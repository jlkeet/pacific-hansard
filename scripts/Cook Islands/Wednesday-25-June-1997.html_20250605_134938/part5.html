<div><span>NO QUORUM 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  You may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you very much Mr Speaker.  I was just saying that I wish to 

congratulate  the  Fiji  National  Rugby  Team  because  they  did  well  against  the  All 

Blacks than the Pumas. 

</span></div><div><span>Now coming back to Paper 50 I want it known, Mr Speaker, that through the efforts of 

the Minister of Justice, the Honourable Tiki Matapo, that is why this Commission of 

Inquiry was put in place.  Of course through the support of the Cabinet, that is why we 

had  this  Commission  appointed  to  look  into  the  Ngateina Makitae case, and in  case 

some of us Honourable Members did not have a look at the Terms of Reference that 

the  Commission  was  ordered  to  undertake,  it  is  spelt  out  very  clearly  there.    There 

were five points of the Terms of Reference and the first one is and I read: 

</span></div><div><span>(a) 

</span></div><div><span>Upon what basis the original charge of attempted murder was reduced 

by the police to a charge of aggravated wounding, and whose  

responsibility it was to decide on the appropriate charge. 

</span></div><div><span>(b)  Whether all the facts available to the Police were disclosed to the Court 

</span></div><div><span>and, if not, why any of those facts were not disclosed. 

</span></div><div><span>(c)  Whether all the facts available to the Police were disclosed to the  

</span></div><div><span>Solicitor-General to enable him to decide whether to appeal against the 

sentence. 

</span></div><div><span>(d)  What changes, if any, in the prosecution procedure and in the  

</span></div><div><span>relationship  between  the  Police  and  the  Crown  Law  Office should be 

made, and how any such changes can be achieved. 

</span></div><div><span>(e) 

</span></div><div><span>Any other matter affecting the administration of the criminal law in the 

Cook Islands which arises out of the investigation and which should be 

brought to the attention of the Government.  

</span></div><div><span>And  as  a  result  of  the  Inquiry  by  the  Commissioner,  and  that  is  Justice  Hillyer,  the 

</span><span>following recommendations were received by Cabinet and now this House through the 

Office of the Crown Law.  And the recommendations are: 

</span></div><div><span>1. 

</span></div><div><span>2. 

</span></div><div><span>The Police will appoint a Police Doctor who will provide a report for 

the Court and therefore achieve uniformity of reporting. 

</span></div><div><span>Victim impact legislation be prepared for enactment as already  

previously  determined  by  the  Minister  of  Justice,  Secretary  of  Justice 

</span><span>and Solicitor-General. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>3101 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>And I think the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate was touched on victim impact in his 

speech, so he should be comforted by this recommendation.  And the third one reads 

as follows: 

</span></div><div><span>3. 

</span></div><div><span>but  

</span></div><div><span>4. 

</span></div><div><span>-  

</span></div><div><span>Crown Law will conduct and appear in the High Court for offences of a 

serious nature as set out in the schedule attached hereto.  In relation to 

less serious charges but which still carry a significant term of  

imprisonment  such  as  burglary  the  Police  will  continue  to  prosecute 

refer any file of difficulty or complexity to Crown Law. 

</span></div><div><span>That for any future complaints an internal inquiry will be held on a tria 

parte  basis  between  the  Heads  of  the  Police,  Justice  Department  and 

Crown Law Office.  If it is established that there is a complaint to  

answer it will then be referred to the Minister of Justice who will take 

the appropriate action. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  satisfied  that the Terms of Reference set  forth  are good ones, 

and  that  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  composed  of  Justice  Hillyer  performed  his  job 

well,  and  these  recommendations  I  feel  are  adequate  to  ensure  that  there  is  no 

repetition of what happened during the Makitae case.   

</span></div><div><span>Maybe what some people wanted to see happen, was a retrial and a reconsideration of 

the sentence and so forth.  But I was a bit worried when I heard the Deputy Leader of 

the  Opposition  say  that  the  law  is  inadequate.    The  Crown  Law  Office  were 

inadequate  in  their  performance,  the  Police  were  inadequate  in  the  performance  of 

their  responsibilities  in  this  case.    I  feel,  Mr  Speaker,  that  for  any  Member  of 

Parliament  in  this  House  to  level  out  some  very  serious  allegations  like  these,  we 

should  check  our  facts  first  and  we  should  make  sure  that  when  we  attack  a 

Government  institution  in  this  House,  that  we  have  the  facts  to  back up the attacks.  

The  Honourable  Member  for  Ngatangiia  reminded  this  House,  and  as  far  as  I  am 

concerned I do not need reminding because I cannot forget that tragedy at Ngatangiia 

CICC Church where those two ladies were killed almost  instantly.  Mr Speaker, the 

law  was  in  place,  the same law that was in  place then is  still in  place now and it is 

because the people involved did not take advantage of the law like Mr Scott did in this 

case, that was the problem.  I am sure that if the Honourable Member for Ngatangiia 

had done something to  advise those people involved, particularly the families of the 

victims, to take the course of the law then something would have been done.  I do not 

know  who  he  was  expecting  to  take  the  action.    Because  in  this  particular  case,  Mr 

Scott, the victim of the attack, was the one who instigated the complaint and hence the 

setting  up  of  the  Commission  of  Inquiry.    So  perhaps  there  is  a  need  here  for  our 

people  to  know  what  their  rights  are  and  their  entitlements  are,  under  the  law.  

However, this matter has been dealt with and I am sure that we have learnt from this 

sad experience. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3102 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Mrs Mau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>  Greetings to you, Mr Speaker, and to all staff members, also 

to all Honourable Members on both sides of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the Makitae Order.  What I want to raise from this Report, 

Mr Speaker, is not to point the finger at a Government Department but to look at this 

Report  as  it  is  written.    John  Scott  is  not  the  only  person  to  have gone through this 

kind of problem.  Mr Scott has the advantage of being able to afford a lawyer, hence 

he has resorted to this process.  Mr Scott is quite pleased with the outcome, the result 

being a Commission of Inquiry,  but for most of our people who experience matters of 

this nature they are not  so lucky as they cannot afford the expense of going through 

the same process.   

</span></div><div><span>Why did John Scott have to seek help on his own?  When I look at this report I see 

what  John  Scott  has  written  here  and  those  who  are  supportive  of  his  case,  on  the 

</span><span>defendant’s side I see that the counsel for Makitae is weak.  In the report Makitae says 

</span><span>that he did not purposely go there to kill the man but to defend himself.  What does 

Makitae think and the people supporting Makitae with regards to the wound in John 

</span><span>Scott’s  neck?    Only  a  fraction  of  an  inch  more  to  the  cut  in  Mr Scott’s neck would 

</span><span>have seen him dead.  What are we going to do about this?  Are we going to wait until 

somebody dies then we look into the matter?  What if this particular instant happened 

</span><span>to one of us in this House?  Makitae’s counsel informed the police that Makitae said 

</span><span>he did not go there  to kill the man and he was defending himself with the attack.   

</span></div><div><span>I acknowledge what John Scott has done to further this matter and he has to pay for 

the  price  of  the  Inquiry.    Let  us  look  at  the  petty  thievery  that  is  happening  in  our 

country today.  I encourage our police to look into all matters carefully and do not take 

lightly  any  small  offences.    People  whose  houses  have  been  burgled  are  lucky  that 

they were not cut like in the case of Mr Scott.  Mr Speaker, it is unfortunate that he 

had to pay for the price to get this case to this point, to bring to our awareness the kind 

of things that is happening to our people of which should not take lightly in the future.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Thomas Hewett. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. HEWETT:</span><span>  Greetings to you, Mr Speaker.  Greetings also to the Clerk and  to 

</span><span>our Mamas looking after the kitchen, to those looking after the Parliament grounds, to 

the  interpreters,  and  also  to  all  other  staff  members.    Kia  Orana.    Greetings  to  the 

Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers and to the Members on the 

Government  side,  to  the  Members  on  the  Opposition.    Greetings  in  the name of the 

Lord.  Finally, Greetings to our people  listening in to our debate this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I seek your indulgence to express a message to my own electorate of 

Vaipae/Vaipeka/Tautu.    I  would  like  on  behalf  of  my  wife  and  my  electorate  of 

</span><span>Vaipae/Vaipeka/Tautu to extend to the family of Melani John Varu who passed away 

</span><span>a few days ago.  To her husband John Varu and their family- may God truly comfort 

you all.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>3103 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  the  servants  of  God  in  my  Constituency.    And  also  to  the  people  of 

Araura  Enua,  Kia  Orana.    Special  Greetings  to  the  team  from  Tautu  who  will  be 

travelling to New Zealand to raise funds to renovate their hall, to be lead by Charlie 

Brothers and who will depart on Friday.  May God guide you all throughout your trip 

overseas, taking you all out there and bringing you all back home safely. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will not prolong my thoughts on this Report.  I give my support to the 

Minister  who  has  brought  and  presented  this  Report  in  the  House  concerning  the 

findings made by the Commission of Inquiry into the matter containing the case of Mr 

John Scott.  I think, Mr Speaker, this will be precedent for future cases.  And I think 

this  will  also  caution  any  hasty  decisions  made  as  to  what  is  going  to  be  done  by 

parties  involved,  before  presenting  cases  to  the  High  Court.    I  think  we  should  take 

this on board, Mr Speaker, and look at this case very closely.  To bring in new laws 

that  will  prevent  this  from  happening  here  on  Rarotonga  and  through  out  the  Cook 

Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know of similar cases that happened on the island of Aitutaki, and the 

</span><span>way those cases were treated according to the phrase of “it’s who you know, not what 

you know”.  Mr Speaker, there were hearings on that </span><span>island, but I know for a fact that 

</span><span>in one such case the victim passed away.  In the end, we didn’t hear of a conclusion or 

</span><span>the outcome.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to give my support to this Report and this Paper, Mr Speaker.  We do not 

know who the next victim will be, but let us hope that whoever it is will not have a 

case badly dealt with like the case that we are talking about before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  would  like  to  call  on  the 

Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff.  Kia Orana 

also to the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, Members in 

the Government, and to Members in the Opposition whose your Leader is not here yet 

or he has not returned- Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana also to our people listening in 

to  our  discussion  this  afternoon.    I  would  like  to  send  some  Greetings  to  my  home 

island of Aitutaki.  Kia Orana to all the people living on the island of Aitutaki.  And 

also  to  my  Constituency  Amuri/Ureia-  Kia  Orana.    I  would  like  to  congratulate  the 

</span><span>combined  Amuri/Ureia  rugby  team  who  were  successful  in  their  shield  match 

</span><span>yesterday between themselves and Avarua.  The people told me, Mr Speaker, when I 

come back to Rarotonga to give their regards to the people here in Rarotonga, I have 

and  I believe that all the people in the Cook Islands have heard their Greetings.  Next 

week  there  is  another match they will be playing against another team  that wants  to 

compete against them and I believe they will do well. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to give my support to the Report and also to raise a few comments 

on  what  is  written  in  the  Report.    This  Report  is  on  a  problem.    This  problem  was 

</span><span>investigated and that is what we are discussing this afternoon.  When the Honourable 

</span><span>Member  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  spoke  on  the  issue  he  mentioned  about  insufficient 

transport.  I looked to see if anything on transport was written in this particular Paper 

and  I  never  found  anything.    I  read  the  Report  right  through  and  I  am  sure  there  is 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3104 

</span></div><div><span>nothing else on transport at the back of this Report that made the Honourable Member 

Dr  Pupuke  Robati  mention  insufficient  transport  that  our  Police  have.    What  I 

understand  is  the  dissatisfaction with  the penalty given to  this particular case that is 

why  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  was  called.      Mr  Speaker,  if  there  is  a  problem 

between  two  people  the  defendant  will  have  to  find  ways  to  be  successful  and  the 

complainant must do the same but the decision is with the Police.  

</span></div><div><span>Nobody else was present and no one else witnessed this incident except for Ngateina 

and  Mr  Scott.  Everything  that  happened  to  Mr  Scott,  he  revealed  in  the  Report  and 

Ngateina was also telling the Police what his side of the story was.  And because Mr 

Scott was not happy with the Police decision, he called for a Commission of Inquiry 

into  the  matter.    Mr  Speaker,  it  is  true  according  to  the  doctors  report  within  the 

Report  that  we  are  discussing,  that  it  was  a  big  cut  on  Mr  Scott.    The  case  was 

investigated  by  the  Police  and  a  hearing  of  the  court  and  they  arrived  at  a  decision.  

Also  in  this  report, it says that Mr. Scott did  not  reveal  everything that happened to 

him to the police.  Furthermore, Ngateina also says that he did not deliberately cut Mr 

Scott.    This  was  investigated  and  an  understanding of the police was reached.  This 

aspect  was  also    investigated  as  well  as  the  decision  that  the  judge  made as regards 

this  part  of  the  case.    Mr  Scott  was  not  satisfied  and  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  was 

called to look into the case.   

</span></div><div><span>I do not feel that there is any weakness in the system.   I feel that the weakness is with 

the  administration.    A  piece  of  legislation  cannot  administer  itself..    Those 

administering  that  legislation  will  have  to  do  it  properly.    In  any  court  case,  Mr 

Speaker, both parties will never be happy with the decision that the court is going to 

finally  make.    Sometimes  the  defendant  or the complainant will be dissatisfied with 

any  decision  that  the  High  Court makes.  Mr Speaker, Members are saying, that we 

should  do  something  about  this  so  we  can  prevent  it  happening  again  in  the  future.  

My response is, problems will never cease to happen in our country, they will always 

happen.  What we have to do is to try and prevent them.  

</span></div><div><span>The other complaint that Mr Scott raised, was that Ngateina was not convicted to the 

fullest extent of the law.  I think this is fair Mr Speaker.  I feel that what the court did 

was right because the court has to listen to both sides of the story, from Mr Scott and 

from  Ngateina,  then  it  has  to  make  a  ruling  so  that  it  is  fair.   Mr Speaker, what  we 

have before us is only a report on what happened, from when the case happened, when 

it was taken to court, when it was investigated and finally as regards the decision by 

the court. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Report did not give any recommendation, it did not say, the Police 

should have done this, the judge should have done that.  What it says, is what actually 

happened.  Accept it or not, it is up to us.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  watched  the  Police  Crime  Line  program  on  television  and  also 

listened  to  it  on  the  radio.   What  the Police are asking for, is  that if you witness an 

</span><span>offense, report it to the Police.  Mr Speaker, some people are complaining that some 

</span><span>offenses are not being reported to the Police.  The onus is on the witness to report to 

the Police what he or she saw as regards the offence that was committed, do not rely 

on anyone else.  Mr Speaker, I am not against the Police or the Crown Law Office or 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>3105 

</span></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>the Justice, the Court or anyone.  What I am saying is, this is a decision made by the 

court  and  I  will  stick  by  that.    Mr  Speaker,  let  us  not  criticise  anyone  here  because 

only  superman  can  see  a  crime  being  committed.    Let  us  not  criticise the Police for 

having insufficient transport to deal with the offenses that happen.  Mr Speaker, I will 

give you an example.  I sleep with my wife and my son.  My son wakes up and finds 

the house on fire.  He wakes me up and I ask him why is the house on fire?  This boy 

will explain what he knows caused the fire.  If someone asks me, I will give them an 

answer  of  what  I  think  caused  the  fire,  but  the  cause  and  the  truth  still  remains 

unknown.   

Mr Speaker, I am standing in support of the Report before us and I thank the Minister 

for bringing it in.  I have a lot confidence in those who perform their duties as far as 

this case is concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands Tiki Matapo to close the debate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker,  I  will  be  very  brief.    I  just  want  to 

answer  a  couple  of  queries  on  points  raised  by  the  Honourable  Members  and  at  the 

same time, thank them for the contribution that they have put forward on both papers. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to return back to when I made a submission to Cabinet for 

the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry into this matter, the thought of setting 

up  an  ordinary  committee  did  crop  up  during  the  discussion.    Mr  Speaker,  I  am 

pleased to say that there was overwhelming support that a Commission of Inquiry be 

established  to  look  into  this  matter  before  the  House.    With  the  facts  available, 

Cabinet  saw  the  seriousness  of  the  matter  and  therefore,  supported  the  need  for  a 

Commission of Inquiry to be set up.  Even the cost is also a factor.  Mr Speaker, in 

regards  to  having  established  the  personnel  on  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  and  the 

facts to be considered were that he had to travel to the Cook islands, all the costs of 

the  air  travel,  plus  accommodation  and  transport  would  have  to  be  covered  by 

Government.    With  all  those  factors  in  mind  the  Commission  was  set  up  and 

undertook this Inquiry and reported to this House and this is the result of that Inquiry. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am very pleased that the report is tabled in Parliament.  When I listened 

to the speakers,  I feel that most of the speakers have confused our listeners today.  I 

am glad to say, Mr Speaker, that the Report is here.  It is available to anyone, to any 

</span><span>member  of  the  public  that  wishes  to  know  the  findings  of  the  Commission  and  the 

</span><span>recommendations made on this report.  It is available at Parliament for any member of 

</span><span>the public who wishes to get a copy of this Report.  I don’t really think that it is the 

</span><span>intention of this paper to  reveal  or to  let our people hear what actually transpired to 

</span><span>one’s own imagination.  Rather,  one can say that there is a report here, the result of 

</span><span>the Commission of Inquiry, the investigation, and it is here for anyone to read and to 

understand. 

</span></div><div><span>In regard to the costs, Mr Speaker, no, I just want to correct the Honourable Member, 

</span><span>Ngamau Munokoa.  The cost has been covered by the Justice Department.  It may well 

</span><span>have been a cost incurred by John Scott doing his own inquiries but the actual cost of 

the Commission has been covered by the Justice Department. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>25 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3106 

</span></div><div><span>Those are just the comments I wish to make, Mr Speaker, and again I would like to 

thank the speakers for having contributed to this Report.  Thank you.
