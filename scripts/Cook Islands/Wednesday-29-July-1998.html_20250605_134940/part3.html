<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clauses 1 - 8 Stand Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Greetings  to  you  this  afternoon.  

Greetings to the staff of Parliament, Honourable Members on both sides of the House 

and to members of the general public who are listening to our debate this afternoon.  

Greetings  to  the  people  from  the  Outer  Islands,  the  Northern  Group,  Atiu,  Mauke, 

Mitiaro, some of whom will be coming through the rain on a plane. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to complete my speech regarding Clauses 1 through 8.  I rise also 

to respond to the thoughts expressed by the Member for Rakahanga, the Honourable 

Dr Pupuke Robati, that only the lawyers will benefit from this Act.  I caught up with 

that thought as I tried to explain yesterday because it is customary for our people from 

the  Outer  Islands  to  send  several  boxes  to  relatives  here  in  Rarotonga  and  also  for 

some of them to send products to sell in the shops here.  The question raised is, who 

</span><span>among  them  in  the  Outer  Islands  is  able  to  draw  up  a  contract?    You  know,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, that was a very valid point raised yesterday.  Suddenly, Mr Chairman, I had 

a  thought  -  why  did  we  establish  the  Council?    Is  it  possible  for  the  Council  to 

negotiate with the carriers, on behalf of individuals in the Outer Islands, so they can 

come to a standard form of agreement recognised by all parties so that the people do 

not have to run around making their own contracts?  Instead, the Council formulates a 

standard  declaration  form,  or  whatever  it  may  be.    I  am  saying  through  you,  the 

Council is the only body recognised by law that is capable of contracting somebody, a 

lawyer  or  an  accountant,  to  draft  a  standard  form  of  Bill-of-lading  or  agreement 

</span><span>between  the  parties  concerned.    Doing  it  that  way,  Mr  Chairman,  we  will  find  in 

</span><span>Clause  8  there  is  14  different  types  of  contractual  agreements.    I  am  saying through 

you,  the  provisions  are  there  for  the  Council  on  each  island  to  draft  their  own 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>2 

</span></div><div><span>agreement  between  the  carrier  and  the  consignee  relevant  to  the  needs  of  each 

particular island. 

</span></div><div><span>Next comes the Growers Association.  I see the Growers Association as strong enough 

to  do  likewise.    So,  as  a  fisherman  I  see  them  strong  enough  to  formulate  a  similar 

arrangement.    The  important  factor  is  that  the  law  or  legislation  is  now  before  the 

</span><span>House  for  the  Honourable  Members’  consideration.    Taking  into  account  past 

</span><span>experiences  of  the  transportation  of  goods  between  islands,  or  from  international  to 

here, between the road carriers, air carriers and sea carriers.  I will leave it there for 

now, Mr Chairman.  Perhaps later on I will have the opportunity to carry on but in the 

meantime, I stand to put my full support behind the provisions of Clauses 1 through 8.  

It  is  important  for  us  Members  to  go  back  and  take  the  Bill  to  our  various 

communities and work with them to find what is really involved in the Bill so far as 

transportation of goods by road, air and sea between the various parties is concerned.  

Thank you, Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    I  now  call  upon  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, to all Honourable Members in the House - Greetings 

to  you  all  this  rainy  afternoon,  to  our people who are listening in to  this debate this 

afternoon, and Greetings also to our people from the Outer Islands who have travelled 

here to join with us in the Constitution Celebrations. 

</span></div><div><span>On the subject of shipping and the transportation of goods from one island to another -

these are the two most important things in the lives of the people who live outside of 

Rarotonga.  Yesterday, this Bill was presented before the House in the belief that the 

debate  will  be  completed  very  soon.    Upon  close  examination  of  this  Bill  and  after 

having  had  discussions  with  friends,  such  as  boat  owner,  Tapi  Taio,  and  the  people 

from  Rakahanga,  who  are  affected  by  this  Bill,  I  can  see  that  there  will  be  major 

problems which will need to be ironed out before this Bill becomes law.   

</span></div><div><span>Regarding the unloading of ships in the Outer Islands, this provides employment for 

many of the young men there.  The money they earn is a great help to the people of the 

Outer Islands.  I am thinking, if we pass this Bill into law, the ship-owner may want 

his  own  cargo-handlers  to  unload  the  cargo  to  ensure  that  whatever  cargo  is  lost  or 

</span><span>damaged during unloading, is covered by insurance.  We have seen ships arrive in the 

</span><span>Outer Islands.  The young men ashore come to unload the cargo.  When the boat that 

is unloading cargo overturns, many flour and sugar bags will fall into the sea.  Who 

will pay for the loss - the ship-owner or the workers unloading the cargo? Because, it 

is no longer on the ship  - it is now on the boats or lighters of the workers, who will 

pay  for  this  loss?  If  the  workers  or  owners  of  the  cargo-unloading  boats  are  to  take 

</span><span>responsibility for the loss, I don’t think they will want to work anymore, nor provide 

</span><span>their boats for the work.  Covering losses  will be a huge burden for them.  This has 

happened, I have seen it.  Some time ago, there was this boat that was going ashore, to 

</span><span>the wharf.  The young men working on this boat saw that the cargo was liquor so they 

</span><span>deliberately overturned the boat.  This was a loss.  That night, they returned, dived to 

recover the liquor and took it away to consume it.  Next morning, they were unable to 

work because they were drunk.  So, who is going to pay for the loss? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>3 

</span></div><div><span>These are some of the problems that the Outer Islands will face that I can see.  I would 

therefore ask the Minister responsible if we can wait until we have time to take this 

Bill  to  the  people  in  order  for  us  to  get  their  views,  because  they  will  be  the  ones 

unloading the boat and transferring the cargo from the main vessel to the shore.  These 

are the people who w</span><span>ill be affected most by this Bill.  They don’t understand what we 

</span><span>are discussing.  For myself, I am reluctant to support this Bill without knowing which 

Clauses will benefit my people, and which will not. 

</span></div><div><span>Also, the owner of the only ship in operation these days, Tapi Taio, does not know of 

the existence of this  Clause or the Bill.   I asked him if he knew about it, he said he 

</span><span>didn’t.    I  think  it  would  be  a  good  thing  if  he  looked  at  this  Bill,  to  see  what  parts 

</span><span>benefit  him  and  which  parts  concern  him  and  the  people  in  the  Outer  Islands,  who 

unload  cargo.    This  is  the  problem  I  have  with  the  Bill.    It  is  moving  too  quickly.  

These people should be given a chance, say two weeks or so, to look at this Bill and to 

</span><span>give us their views.  I am sure the Minister won’t mind.</span></div><div><span>Also, I want to discuss with the Council of Rakahanga, the suggestion put forward by 

the Minister of Agriculture, that the Island Councils, as representatives of the people,  

take  charge  of  contractual  arrangements.    This  is  a  good  suggestion.    This  is  why  I 

would  like  to  ask  the Minister to  give us  more time to  examine this Bill  so that the 

</span><span>people will gain a better understanding of the Bill, to give us their views.  I don’t fully 

understand the Bill myself because it is being rushed through.  I haven’t had enough 

</span><span>time to read the Bill properly, which is why I am asking that we be given more time.   

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  is  not  happy  about  what  I  am  saying.    I  am  only  asking,  if  he  doesn’t 

</span><span>agree then I have no choice.  I am  hoping that the ship-owner, the Councils and the 

cargo- handlers will come together.  These are my views.  This is my request.  If the 

Minister  disagrees,  well...    it  is  up  to  Government  to  decide.    However,  it  is  to  the 

Minister  that  I  am  directing  my  request,  but  I  can  see  that  he  is  having  difficulty 

accepting it.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    Good  afternoon,  Mr  Chairman  and  staff  of  this  Honourable 

</span><span>House, Honourable Members on both sides of the House - Kia Orana.  Kia Orana to 

</span><span>our people listening in this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Special greetings to the Honourable Minister responsible for this Bill, the Honourable 

Tupou Faireka, to the staff of the Ministry of Tourism and Transport, to the Secretary 

and everyone else who is responsible for providing us with this Bill, Kia Orana to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  ask  Leave,  through  you,  to  send  condolences  to  the 

</span><span>families  of  the  people  who  have  had  bereavements  in  the  last  couple  of  days.  

</span><span>Especially  to  Mr  Kavea  Ngau,  whose  wife  passed  away  on  Sunday  afternoon.  

Through you, Mr Chairman, I send condolences from my wife and I, our family and 

the people of our village to this gentleman, their children and families, here, Aitutaki 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><span>and  in  New  Zealand  and  Australia,  for  what  has  happened  to  them on Sunday.  We 

</span><span>pray that the Lord’s blessing will be upon them, especially with him as he is now in 

</span><span>hospital, during their time of grief.  May God comfort and bless you all.   

Secondly, Mr Chairman, I send Greetings to our sports people, especially those from 

the  Outer  Islands  who  are  on  Rarotonga  for  the  Constitution  Celebrations  and  the 

Tarekareka sports.  A special Kia Orana to the Youth Organisations in the village of 

Titikaveka for the good job that they did on the Monday, which was a public holiday, 

when they cleaned the village from Tikioki to Vaimaanga.  I thank the Leaders of the 

Youth in the village for the co-operation that they showed on the day.  They started to 

clean  our  village  by  collecting  plastic,  bottles  and  all  sorts  of  rubbish.    They  also 

mowed the sides of the roads.  This shows that there is co-operation between the youth 

of our village.  I like the spirit behind this move which showed us on Monday that we 

do  not  have  to  rely  on  Government  to  keep  our  villages  clean  but  that  we  can  co-

operate as a people to beautify our village.  I give special thanks for the help by those 

people who offered their transport.  To the parents who helped the youth on that day, 

thank  you  very  much.    This  was  done  last  year  and  repeated  again  this  year.    As 

mentioned  earlier,  I  believe  the  spirit  in  this  is  that  the  people  of  the  village  co-

operated and did not rely on anyone else to do the cleaning in our village. 

</span></div><div><span>I will now come back to the Bill before the House, Mr Chairman.  I give my support to 

Clauses 1 to 8 in this Bill.  I was glad to hear the views of previous speakers especially 

from  those  Members  of  the  Outer  islands  who  had  pointed  out  to  us  the  conditions 

that  their  people  face  when  sending  or  receiving  goods  back  and  forth  from  their 

islands to Rarotonga.  An important aspect that I picked up from the explanation given 

by the Honourable Minister with  regard to  this  Bill,  was the fact that it has been 48 

years since anything has been worked on along the lines of a Bill or Act such as this 

Bill - </span><span>The Carriage of Goods Bill.  We know that it hasn’t been very long since Air 

Rarotonga  first  started  taking  goods  from  Rarotonga  to  the  Outer  Islands.    I  don’t 

</span><span>think that </span><span>the majority of our peoples’ problems lie with the airline in respect to the 

</span><span>carriage of goods.  I think the majority of their problems is with regard to the carriage 

of goods through shipping.  I have sent things to my friends and family in the Outer 

Islands.  It may not have been very many times but after inquiring, I was told to give 

my things to the sailors which would mean that my things got to their destination in a 

better  condition.    This  has  been  the  way  that  things  were  done  in  the  past.    People 

would give their things to the crew of the ship to take over to the Outer Islands.  Or, if 

you have friends or relatives going over, then it is  best that your things are given to 

them to ensure that it arrives safely.   

</span></div><div><span>One  year  I  attended  the  opening  of  the  CICC  Youth  Convention  in  Aitutaki.    A 

gentleman who had brought the youth contingent from the island of Pukapuka to this 

convention on Aitutaki met up with me and we talked about the issue of carriage of 

goods.    This  pastor  had  told  me  that  it  was  unfor</span><span>tunate  that  his  whole  contingent’s 

</span><span>luggage  and  clothing smelt  like diesel  because of the conditions  on the ship,  and he 

was sure I could smell it on him.   

</span></div><div><span>Another incident occurred, Mr Chairman, when I visited the island of Mauke.  I have a 

</span><span>relative there who had imported concrete blocks from here to be taken to Mauke with 

the intention of building a House.  As the blocks were being loaded off the boat onto 

the  dinghies  and  proceeded  to  shore,  a  couple  of  those  dinghies  capsized  and  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><span>majority of the blocks sunk  to  the bottom of the sea.  He was desperate to build his 

house so he paid people to dive for those blocks at a cost of a $1 per block retrieved.  

He  had  paid  for  the  freight  from  here  and  at  the  same  time  paid  for  the  retrieval  of 

those blocks at the bottom of the sea to be carted to the site where he was to build his 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I am sure we need not go back 48 years to be able to account for the 

many experiences, or should I say grievances, that our people have gone through when 

sending  cargo  and  personal  things  to  their  home  islands.    Does  that  mean,  Mr 

Chairman, that we need to wait another 48 years before we can put in place a system 

that  enables  us  to  cater  for  the  problems  encountered  by  our  people  when 

transportation  of  their  personal  things  or  cargo,  or  whatever,  is  to  go  to  their  home 

islands?  I have heard other Members say in this House that they have known of cases 

where  people  have  complained  time  and  time  again  and  nothing  was  forthcoming.  

There was no response in terms of assistance for their loss or damages.  There is no 

doubt,  Mr  Chairman,  the  Bill  is  long  overdue.    I  am  sure  a  majority  of  Honourable 

Members of this  House support it and see the intention and purpose in bringing this 

Bill before the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I am sure it was never intended, for the record, to mention the shipping people.  For 

instance,  the  name  Tapi  Taio  was  mentioned.    There  has  to  be  an  understanding 

between  both  the  carrier  and  the  people,  the  consignees,  and  also  the  people  on  the 

other  end  who  are  receiving  the  cargo.    We  have  in  place  a  Bill  of  Lading  which 

proves still, to be not workable.  Mr Chairman, I think there is a common consensus 

</span><span>among our people that, sometimes we tend to show a ‘no care’ attitude to this kind of 

</span><span>thing.  I would have to say that this has to come about because of various experiences 

</span><span>we  have  gone  through  where  nothing  has  been  done  to  assist  the peoples’ needs, so 

they feel well, “she’s right, some day it will all work out”.  Mr Chairman, I see a lot of 

</span><span>merit in this Bill.  It may appear in this House to be wordy but I think, Mr Chairman, 

with the intention and merits being put in place, I think it is very important.  I stood to 

give my support to the Bill.  As I said before, it is long overdue in addressing some of 

the problems our people have encountered for a long time.  Hopefully this will create 

a better situation compared to what we have had to experience before. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR. T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, to your staff, 

to Honourable Members and to our people listening in.  It certainly is a rainy day but 

we are blessed with that.  We need the water. 

</span></div><div><span>I  seem  to  follow  the  trend  of  thought  given by Government  Members, especially by 

the Minister in charge.  I think to a certain extent there is a lot of dreaming also in this 

whole affair.  Sometimes we draw up rules and we think it is going to fix everything 

for life.  I will accept this as an attempt to try to improve the situation.  I am not going 

</span><span>to admit this is a solution to all the problems in the past because contracting of cargo 

</span><span>carried by carriers from one point to another is covering the insurance of that process.  

In the past up to now, there has always been the availability of that insurance process.  

We  want  to  send  a  tonne  of  cargo  to  the  Outer  Islands,  and  you  are  allowed  under 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>6 

</span></div><div><span>current rules to insure your cargo and you will be covered by insurance on whatever 

carrier takes it.  Under these Clauses there are options given.  You can send it at your 

own risk without having any insurance cover - right here in these Clauses.  The carrier 

can even refuse to take your cargo if you refuse to pay and he is not obliged to take 

any care of your cargo if you are not insured or no contract is made.  So what is the 

</span><span>gain?  I don’t see any gain in this particular area </span><span>- at your own risk.  It is like what we 

are doing now.  When you move into the coverage, like insurance, you move into the 

contracting area.  How is the plan going to be; like if I lose a box of mangoes that I 

</span><span>have  contracted?    I  would  like  a  simple  procedure  with  that.    I  don’t  want  to  go 

</span><span>through court filing a case against the carrier that, I have lost a box of mangoes that I 

have contracted.  Because I am sure it is going to cost me to take it to court to claim 

</span><span>for one box of mangoes.  We may even have to go through a lawyer.  I don’t know 

</span><span>what the process is.  We may have to go through lawyers.  What is the explanation of 

this?  How do we go about making a contract; where is the explanation if we get into 

difficulty?  Do we have to pay for a lawyer to advise us or to do the case for us?  Our 

people in the Outer Islands do not have the capability to get into this.  Even us here in 

Rarotonga have to depend on legal minds to help us.  Mr Chairman, what I am getting 

at  is,  it  seems  for 40 years we have been needing a change.  But  a change to  what?  

You tell me?  One thing I am sure of right now is that you are going to have to pay for 

freight  </span><span>plus  the  cost  to  make  the  contract.    Don’t  expect  to  send  your  cargo  for  the 

</span><span>same freight without extra costs for cover damage or loss.  I want a simple explanation 

</span><span>for these things.  Could the Minister or Government tell me: 1) it isn’t going to cost 

</span><span>them  more  through  this  system,  and,  2)  it  is  going  to  be  simple  to  have  a  contract 

made up.  It has been suggested that the Island Council do this.  I do not know which 

is  the  right  one  for  us,  Government  is  not  telling  us  what  the  procedure  will  be  for 

these  contracts.    Currently  we  have  a  system  whereby  you  obtain  a  Bill  of  Lading 

which identifies the cargo, the owner, the carrier.  And, if there is insurance it will all 

be on that Bill of Lading.  All I have heard so far is, you do not need a Bill of Lading 

anymore, all you need is  your invoice.  I hope it is  an invoice that will be useful or 

sufficient  when it comes to  claiming your cargo through the court.  One thing is for 

certain, Mr Chairman, if you want to negotiate a contract on a carrier, for instance a 

boat where your cargo is taken from the wholesaler by transport to the wharf, that has 

to be covered by a contract.  Then from the wharf onto the ship, that has to be covered 

by  a  contract.    And  then,  cargo  carried  on  the  ship  to  the  Outer  Islands  has  to  be 

covered  by  a  contract.    When  it  arrives  at  the  Outer  Islands,  there  is  a  contract 

covering  carriage  from  the  carrier  to  the  shore  and  to  the  licensed  company.    Well 

already,  Mr  Chairman,  this  is  a  long  process  of  coverage  by  this  contract.    Now 

Government  is  saying,  the  Minister  is  saying  and  the  Members  of  Government  are 

saying it is simple.  If it is simple, let our people know how simple it is.  Because, Mr 

Chairman,  our  people  out  there  need  to  know  exactly  where  the  contract  starts  and 

</span><span>where  the  contract  ends.    I  am  raising  this,  Mr  Chairman,  because  don’t  expect  our 

</span><span>people to understand exactly what you think.  Tell them what you want to tell them.  I 

want  it  simple  and  I  want  to  hear  it  as  being  simple.    I  want  to  do  it  in  a  simple 

manner.    How  </span><span>can  the  Island  Councillors  make  a  contract  for  somebody’s  box  of 

</span><span>mangoes?    Tell  me  how  can  that  be  done?    In  my  view,  Mr  Chairman,  this  kind  of 

</span><span>explanation  is  just  like  giving  suggestions.    I  would  like  to  hear  something  more 

</span><span>defined, more simple and easy for our people to know how to negotiate for a contract.  

Where are they going to negotiate for a contract?  Who will they need to assist them in 

making  a  contract?    If  it  is  just  a  simple  invoice  -  well?    I  am  not  here  to  listen  to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>7 

</span></div><div><span>anything like, it’s been</span><span> 40 years.  The system has been working except in a situation 

where a boat is burned or a situation where a boat has sunk.  The process of insurance 

has always been available.  If you wanted to secure your cargo going out to the Outer 

Islands or anywhere you could insure it.  It is the same thing that is going to happen.  

</span><span>If you want your cargo to be secured, you pay for that contract.  It’s nothing new.  It’s 

just  a  change  of  name,  Mr  Chairman,  and  if  somebody  doesn’t  want  to  pay  for  that 

</span><span>contract,  he  is  e</span><span>ntitled  to  do  that  because  under  this  Clause  here,  it  talks  about  “at 

owner’s risk”.  If you want to do it with a contract you can do it and it has always been 

the case anyway.  There’s no difference.  You can insure it now or don’t.  Suffer the 

consequences  if  you  don’t.    What  I  want  to  hear  from  them  is,  how  simple  is  this 

</span><span>contract going to be done without our people getting confused and so forth? 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t mind supporting a Bill, Mr Chairman, but I don’t want to see a Bill brought in 

</span><span>here for political ca</span><span>mpaign purposes.  It’s as if nothing good has been done in the past 

40 years till today.  I don’t want to support any politicking in this pre</span><span>-election year.  If 

there is a change for the good, do so and I will support it. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  thoughts,  Mr  Chairman.    I  know  the  intention  here  in  this  Bill  is 

supposed  to  be  a  good  one,  but  as  long  as  we get  some good explanation and some 

simple methods of supplying these contracts, I will support it.  Because at this time, 

Mr  Chairman,  I  am  watching  these  Bills  coming  in,  I  am  watching  the  actions  of 

</span><span>Government.  It’s a pre</span><span>-election year.  I want to see things done genuinely and not for 

political reasons.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Greetings to you and Greetings to all staff 

members  of  this  House  and  to  all  Honourable  Members,  Cabinet  Ministers, 

Honourable  Members  on  the  Government  side,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  and 

Members on his side and also to our radio audience this afternoon.  Kia Orana to you 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I send a special message to  those who have grieved the loss of loved 

ones in the last few days.  Firstly, with regard to the accident that occurred on Sunday 

evening,  Mr  Chairman,  which  caused  the  loss  of  a  wife  of  a  dear  man.    They  were 

</span><span>happily going on their bike, and now the wife is lost and the husband is suffering in 

</span><span>hospital.  Mr Chairman, my grief is heightened when a life has been destroyed through 

drunkenness.    Therefore,  to  the  husband  who  is  now  in  hospital  -  Greetings  to  you 

Kavea and also to your children as you stay in your sick bed.  Mr Chairman, I believe 

that all expenses incurred due to the accident should be the responsibility of the person 

who  has  brought  about  this  accident.    The  Police  Department  had  issued  many 

warnings like - </span><span>if you drink, don’t drive and if you drive don’t drink.  The Police have 

</span><span>done their part to let people know but the situation is not improving at all.  It is getting 

worse  and  out  of  hand.    So,  I  say  that  the  Police  and  Medical  Services  should 

</span><span>formulate  an  Act  that  whenever  there  is  an  accident,  whoever  brought  about  the 

</span><span>accident should be responsible for all expenses involved.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>8 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to acknowledge the support given by the village of Titikaveka, who have 

taken care of the grave and the funeral service.  Thank you all.  Those who are holding 

positions of responsibility in Titikaveka, the young people and those who do not hold 

any positions of responsibility, I say to you all, thank you very much indeed. 

Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  to  give  my  support  to  Clauses  1  to  8  in  the  Bill  with  the 

understanding  that  every  Act  brought  into  this  House  will  be  to  the  satisfaction  of 

some  and  the  dissatisfaction  of  others.    Whatever  law  debated  in  any  country,  the 

</span><span>people who are law abiding will be entertained by it and the others who don’t abide 

</span><span>will not be.  The purpose of this law that is being brought into the House is to protect 

our people.  This law that we are looking at now, Mr Chairman, is between the owner, 

the consignor and also the consignee. 

</span></div><div><span>I don’t think, Mr Chairman, that a box of mangoes will be much of a worry and that 

</span><span>you  have  need  to  take  such  a  matter  to  the  police.    Mr  Chairman,  I  think  this  deals 

with bigger cargo.  I had once experienced the loss of cargo shipped from Rarotonga 

to Aitutaki.  I had placed an order with a company in Rarotonga and waited in Aitutaki 

for  its  arrival.    Because  of  the  delay  I had to  get  on the plane, fly to  Rarotonga and 

inquire as to the reasons the cargo did not get to Aitutaki.  I saw the supplier and he 

told  me  that  they  had  moved  the  cargo  to  the  boat.    But  at  the wharf my cargo was 

nowhere to be found.  I inquired as to its whereabouts and told the people there of the 

company that I had dealt with who had sent my cargo over to the boat.  They replied 

that they had no idea if such cargo existed.  Therefore, my cargo which was supposed 

to go to Aitutaki had just disappeared.   

</span></div><div><span>So the Bill before the House now will help me with any cargo that I will send in the 

future.    The  Bill  will  be  helpful  in  protecting  my  goods  should  I  send  anything  to 

Aitutaki.  The Bill states that in any event that my goods, which I send to my island, is 

not received, the owner of the boat will be liable.  Mr Chairman, after reading the Bill 

today I am wondering how and when the liability upon the ship owner ends.   

</span></div><div><span>In Aitutaki the cargo is unloaded off boats and onto the barge and then shipped to the 

wharf.    Maybe  my  cargo  had  disappeared  between  the  boat  and  </span><span>the  wharf.    I  don’t 

</span><span>know.    When  is  the  boat  owner  cleared  from  this  responsibility  because  the  cargo 

leaves  Rarotonga for Aitutaki being transported on the boat to the barge and then to 

the wharf.  When is he cleared from that liability?   

</span></div><div><span>Looking  at  the  Bill  before  the  House, I can pick out  any politics involved.  It  is  the 

Honourable  Members  who  create  political  issues  to  do  with  this  Bill  in  our 

</span><span>discussions.  I had to read the Bill today as I wasn’t here yesterday.  While reading it I 

</span><span>could understand w</span><span>hat the Bill is all about and it doesn’t contain political issues in my 

</span><span>view.   

</span></div><div><span>Under one of the sections it states that, if a person loses cargo the ship owner is liable 

to  pay the worth  of the goods lost.  Mr Chairman, it is my understanding that cargo 

which gets lost on any shipment are the small ones.  If I ordered 10 drums of diesel, 10 

</span><span>drums of petrol and one bag of sugar, the bag of sugar is the cargo that is likely to get 

</span><span>lost.  I don’t think the problem is here.  The problem is in the agreement th</span><span>at will have 

to  be  signed  and  understood  that,  whatever  is  stated  in  the  contract  is  for  the 

protection  and  right  of  a  person  in  respect  of  the  goods.    If  someone  loses  a box of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>9 

</span></div><div><span>mangoes and takes the case to court, pays a lawyer and the court costs, I think he is 

</span><span>better off buying a new box of mangoes.  I can’t see any difficulty with this Bill.  The 

</span><span>law that is being established here deals with a contract between the consignee and the 

</span><span>ship owner.  There isn’t any confusion at all.  The reason for the agree</span><span>ment, signed by 

the two parties, is so that at the moment goods are put on the boat and should by any 

chance the goods go missing, the agreement binds the boat owner to be liable for the 

loss.  Our people have had many problems with losing their cargo on boats.  That is 

one reason this Bill had been introduced in the House.  What we see here is that the 

ship owner is given direction to know that if he fails in his transportation of goods for 

the consignee, he will be made responsible to pay out the loss.   

</span></div><div><span>I  wouldn’t  go  to  the  owner  but  deal  with  the  administrators  of  the  vessel,  raising 

</span><span>matters with them.  If those people in that office say that they do not know about my 

problem  then,  who  can  I  go  to?    I  see  now  that  there  was  never  any  proper 

arrangement between the ship owner and the consignee of whether goods were to be 

</span><span>sent  to  Mangaia  or  Aitutaki.    There  is  no  politics  involved  in  this  so  we  shouldn’t 

</span><span>bring in anything here that will cause us to prolong the debate over this matter.  Let us 

not bring in anything to confuse our people but to let them know that all this is in their 

best interests.  I feel I should end here, Mr Chairman.  These are my views on the Bill 

before the House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

I will now put the Question.  The Question is</span><span>:</span></div><div><span>That Clauses 1 to 8 Stand Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Part 2 : Liability of Carriers.  Part 2 contains Clauses 9 to 15.  The Question is</span><span>:</span></div><div><span>That Part 2 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to  all  the 

Honourable Members today.   

</span></div><div><span>I stand to  express my views with what I think I could interpret as to this Part of the 

Bill.    From  Clause  9,  I  think  this  will cover some of the questions already raised in 

</span><span>this  House.    For  example  under  this  Clause  9,  the  words  “contracting  carrier”  and 

“actual carrier” are mentioned and I would interpret this as, an example, a wholesaler 

</span><span>and  a  retailer;  businesses  in  town.    Take  CITC  as  an  example  where  CITC  is  a 

wholesaler as well as a retailer.  In the same light as the carrier I would say that Taio 

Shipping can be a contracting carrier and also an actual carrier.  So he can be both of 

these.  At the same time if anybody else wants to handle the carrying of cargo he can 

contract.  In so far as contracting is concerned, Taio Shipping can be the contracting 

carrier and also the actual carrier.  We will see under the provisions of this Bill that 

there  will  be  contractors,  contracting  for  other  carriers.    In  Clause  9(2)  and  (3)  it 

explains  that  the  liability  of  those  contracting  carriers  continues  until  the  goods  are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>10 

</span></div><div><span>delivered  or  tendered  to  the  consignee;  furthermore  in  the  manner  expressed  or 

implied  in  the  contract.    Therefore,  Mr  Chairman,  that  liability  continues  after  that 

contract  is  drawn,  paid  and  whatever  is  implied  in  that  contract,  continues  and  the 

carrier is liable until he has delivered the goods to the consignee.  There could be one 

or two carriers in that process.   

</span></div><div><span>Under the same Clause 4 it talks about, in the case of a carrier of goods by sea from 

Rarotonga to the Outer Islands and vice versa, it expresses that any goods delivered by 

sea from Rarotonga to the Outer Islands or from the Outer Islands to Rarotonga, the 

goods are capable of being tendered to the consignee only after they have been safely 

landed  ashore.    The  same  goes  with  cargo  landed  on  both  actual  carriers  or  the 

contracting carrier, delivered from the Outer Islands to Rarotonga, this Bill says that 

goods are capable of being delivered by the consignee only after having been landed 

safely ashore.  I think as we go through the whole Bill we will see that the benefit also 

goes to the carrier including the consignee in a sense that all cargo loaded on sea from 

the Outer Islands to Rarotonga, that carrier gets total payment.  There will be no cargo 

just put on, all cargo will be reported.  That is the benefit to the carrier.  Likewise the 

benefit  will  also  go  to  the  consignee  to  the  extent  that  his  cargo  is  safe  until  it  is 

landed ashore.  As is in Part I of the Bill, the consignees have four options altogether 

as to which category he wishes to send his cargo to Rarotonga.   

</span></div><div><span>The same Clause talks about when an international carrier’s responsibility stops.  Also 

</span><span>with carriers in Rarotonga, where our responsibility stops in so far as any international 

carrier is concerned.  Therefore the Bill only covers carriers in the Cook Islands rather 

than  carriers  internationally,  as  the  Act  describes  how  far  a  local  ca</span><span>rrier’s 

</span><span>responsibility extends and also the international carrier.  I think in the meantime even 

the manner in which the cargo is transmitted to the Outer Islands and vice versa, ships 

do not have to ensure the cargo they carry is insured by businesses.  The rest of this 

part of the Bill talks about the liability of an actual carrier.  It is really talking about 

liabilities.   

</span></div><div><span>That is my view that I wish to express in the meantime on this part of the Bill.  Thank 

you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR.T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    At  this  moment  I  am  a  bit 

disappointed  I  am  not  getting  the  feedback  I  expected.    Thanks  to  the  Member  for 

Mitiaro, the Honourable Tangata Vavia, who is making every attempt to clarify what 

the Bill is talking about.  I quite agree with his views because the Clauses are talking 

about contracting carriers and actual carriers and therefore it would appear to me, Mr 

Chairman, that a wholesaler like CITC can be labelled as a contracting carrier.  And 

therefore,  as  such,  the  cost  for  the  freight  can  be  charged  onto  the  cargo  for  a 

consignee in the Outer Islands plus a contracting fee.  Whereas when we talk about an 

</span><span>actual  carrier  and  these  are  to  me  the  people  who  actually  transport from  point one, 

</span><span>say,  from  the  wholesaler  to  the  wharf.    The  ship  owner  becomes  the  actual  carrier 

from the wharf, from the port, to the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>11 

</span></div><div><span>This Act of course, Mr Chairman, is to come into force on the 1st day of July 1998.  

Now what I want to know is, is the system available in place to start these things as 

soon as the Act is assented to, or what is going to happen?  Is there any development 

into setting up whatever needs to be set up?  Because in my view, Mr Chairman, there 

are  these  wholesalers  who  can  act  as  contracting  carriers.    You  have  these  actual 

carriers who actually pick up the cargo and take from point to point.  In other words, it 

will  be  available;  the  contracting  at  the  wholesaler.    It  will  be  available  also  at  the 

</span><span>actual carrier’s depot.  The way I see it, Mr Chairman, somebody could take this up as 

</span><span>a business, as a contracting office, establish a contracting office and have agencies on 

each island.  The Island Councils, like has been mentioned, could be the agent on one 

</span><span>of  these  islands  or,  the  Grower’s  Association  could  be  agents  on one of the islands.  

But I cannot see the Grower’s Association or the Island Councils or a group of people 

</span><span>or a person starting up a contractual business on each island and when the cargo is lost 

</span><span>in  Rarotonga,  how  can  he  pay  for  these  losses  or  damages?    You’ve  got  to  start  up 

</span><span>with some kind of capital in order to be able to pay losses should the loss happen once 

</span><span>the  cargo  is  shipped.    If  you  haven’t  got  that  income  from  the  contracting  for cargo 

</span><span>carried, then you will be tempted to increase your charges.  And what happens if you 

want to do that?  You will find that the freight plus the contracts will be higher than 

you would expect in an ordinary situation like we are in now.   

</span></div><div><span>So the aim for this as I see it is to protect the cargo of the owner and as such, you have 

to pay extra in order that you recover your loss should there be any loss in transit. 

</span></div><div><span>When  we  talk  about  shipping  cargo  from  the  Outer  Islands,  say,  a  container  of  taro 

from  Atiu  to  Rarotonga  and  from  Rarotonga  to  New  Zealand.    That  container  is 

covered should a contract be arranged.  That is covered from Atiu to Rarotonga, but 

according to this Act it does not cover from here to New Zealand.  I would think you 

go  under  a  new  contract  from  here  to  New  Zealand,  under  a  different  arrangement.  

We have had experiences of loss of containers of taro going from here to New Zealand 

because the refrigeration was not properly managed.  I am not sure whether that was 

covered by the arrangement but it seems to me we have difficulties in this area.  Under 

that situation, I think it is the insurance policy that covers those situations.  It will be 

worth our while looking into that matter because if we want to encourage the export of 

taro  from  Atiu  and  Mangaia  to  New  Zealand  via  Rarotonga  then  we  have  to 

accommodate that in presenting a Bill such as this.  I would like the Minister to give 

us  some  explanation  on  the  connection  of  this  arrangement  to  the  international 

shipping  carrier  from  here  to  New  Zealand  for  instance.    I  think  that  is  a  very 

important aspect of this part of development, in this carriage of cargo from the Outer 

Islands such as taro and then off to New Zealand on the international line. 

</span></div><div><span>I do appreciate the comments by the Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia, with regard 

to  the questions  I raised earlier and that is  with  regard to  contracting carriers and to 

what  he explained, about  the terminology, what they are supposed to do and what it 

means.  I can appreciate the comments made by other speakers that the whole idea of 

</span><span>this  Bill  is  to  protect  the  loss  and  the  damage  of  cargo  for  the  owners.    But  don’t 

</span><span>forget that if you need that protection and compensation, you need to pay first.  You 

</span><span>don’t just get it for</span><span> nothing.  Like as was mentioned, if you send a box of mangoes and 

</span><span>you don’t think you should have a contract to cover it should it go missing, well it is 

up to you.  Because, if you don’t and then you send it at your own risk and there is no 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>12 

</span></div><div><span>obligation on the carrier to safeguard it from going missing, to safeguard its damage or 

it being eaten by other people.  They have no obligation.  You are sending it at your 

own risk and you are not paying any contract to cover the loss or the damage.  Yes.  

So  I  want  to  say  this,  Mr  Chairman  -  </span><span>don’t  expect  recovery  of  your  cargo  without 

</span><span>paying for the insurance or for the contract of that carriage of your cargo. 

</span></div><div><span>So those are my thoughts on this part of the Bill on carriage of goods, Mr Chairman 

and  maybe  I  will  be  able  to  make  further  comments  should  there  be  any  further 

explanation.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister for Agriculture, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you again, Mr Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the second part of the Bill that we are discussing and that 

</span><span>is from Clause 9 to Clause 15.  Clause 9 deals with “liability of contracting carrier”.  

Clause 10 deals  with  “liability of actual carrier”.  So what is the difference between 

</span><span>these  two  parts?    My  understanding,  Mr  Chairman,  is  that  Clause  9;  Liability  of 

contracting  carriers,  we  in  the  Outer  Islands  or  on  the  island  of  Mauke,  we  send  an 

order to CITC and they take our cargo to the wharf to be shipped over to Mauke.  But 

because CITC know that they cannot carry this cargo to the wharf, they put in place a 

contract with Malcolm Sword who then takes the cargo to the wharf for CITC, under a 

contract.    So  if  the  cargo  goes  missing  between  CITC  and  the  wharf,  Malcolm  is 

liable.  (2). the cargo is on the wharf.  The carrier there gives a Bill of Lading for the 

cargo  received.    This  means  that  the cargo is  on the ship  as indicated by the Bill  of 

Lading.    The  main  thing  here,  Mr  Chairman,  is  at  least  we  have  guidelines  to  work 

within.    At  least  our  people  have  something  to  refer  to  when  sending  cargo.    The 

exportation from the Outer Islands to Rarotonga is all right.  The arrangement is made 

that taro will be paid at $3.00 per kilo, but when it gets here only $1.00 is received or 

there is no money at all.  Yes.  We managed to negotiate on our own behalf through 

our growers association, through the Island Council and through our agent, as far as 

the maire is  concerned, with  both  the airline and the shipping line.  The problem is, 

the people at this end think they are a lot smarter and can act as agents.  Yeah.  The 

agent  here  forgets  that  freight  and  fumigation  has  to  be paid  and that applies to  any 

other  expenses  incurred.    Mr  Chairman,  I  have  had  dealings  in  the  past  with  these 

</span><span>kinds of people.  I once saw the manager of Air New Zealand to be advised on their 

</span><span>freight  costs  from  here  to  there,  until  they  get  paid  for  that  produce  from  New 

Zealand.  At least with this Bill that the Minister has brought into the House, there is 

something  written  down  where  parties  can  negotiate  the  best  deal  possible  for 

everyone.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to channel my thoughts to the cargo that is transported by ships from here 

</span><span>to the Outer Islands.  Where does the ship carrier’s responsibility end?  You see, Mr 

</span><span>Chairman, we still have some commodities under price control on that price order out 

</span><span>to  the Outer Islands, such a thing as boating and reefing charges, are included.  The 

</span><span>question is, from that boat somebody is paid to transport the cargo from the ship to the 

shore, and from the shore to the cargo shed - boating and reefing costs.  You see, Mr 

Chairman, that provision is already there.  But what is important now is the Bill before 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>13 

</span></div><div><span>the House, a provision has been made to an agreement specifically the responsibility 

and the liability and what type of liability, or limited liability to the carrier in between 

people to carry this cargo.  You see, Mr Chairman, sure someone has to pay for it.  It 

has been done ever since we started in Timbuktu.  Yes.  What it is today though, is it 

is down in legislation, in written form where parties concerned can negotiate to avoid 

the losses.  Mr Chairman, when it comes to  the final  analysis out there in the Outer 

Islands,  it  is  the  consumer  who  will  end  up  paying  for  it.    The  shop  owner  will  be 

</span><span>stupid  if  he  doesn’t  bring  this  extra  cost  and  add  it  upon  the  commodity  he  has 

received.  Any person who doesn’t do so will end up being bankrupt.  This hasn’t only 

</span><span>happened  lately.    That  has  been our way of life in  the Outer Islands for a  long time 

now.  It  will continue to  be so especially since our economy is  based on the market 

model economy.  We have said that if we make $10 or a dollar today on a carton of 

</span><span>mangoes,  that  is  a  dollar  of  new  money  that  we  did  not  have  yesterday.    We  didn’t 

</span><span>have it yesterday but we have it today.  The same goes with our pawpaws.  Is that the 

best  we  can  get  for  these  fruits?    Is  it  possible  to  contract  a  carrier  to  carry  that 

produce, the reject fruit that we sell for 45¢ here, somewhere else so that our growers 

can  earn  a  bit  more?    This  section  of  the  Bill  is  providing  the  base  for  parties  to 

consult and negotiate. 

</span></div><div><span>Down to Clause 11; “Rights of contracting party where contracting carrier insolvent or 

cannot  be  found”.    There  was  a  man  who  had  started  out  as  a  carrier,  lost  all  his 

money  and  then  disappeared.    In  Clause  12;  “Special  rules  relating  to  liability  of 

carrier in respect of baggage”.  This is related to personal effects, Mr Chairman.</span></div><div><span>Clauses  13,  and  14  states;  “Carrier  not  liable  in  certain  circumstances.”    Except  of 

course for Clause 15; “Limitation for amount of carrier’s liability”.</span></div><div><span>This is the important thing, that the three parties get together and talk about how best 

they can deal with the matter.  If the person who owns the supplies is not prepared to 

sell his supplies then he can go away and not sell them.   

</span></div><div><span>In  the  Outer  Islands  we  have  the  capability  to  contract  somebody,  a  solicitor  or 

whoever,  to  draft  a  standard  form  of  agreement  so  that  individual  exporters  can  be 

taken care of.   

</span></div><div><span>I therefore stand up to support this part of the Bill, Clauses 9 to 15 of the legislation 

before the House.  Thank you Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you and to your staff.  

Kia Orana to Honourable Members of the House and to our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  before  I  give  my  opinions  on  this  section  of  the  Bill,  I  would  like  to 

</span><span>welcome and say Kia Orana to one of our sons who has returned to the Cook Islands, 

</span><span>of whom I had the opportunity half an hour ago to sit with and talk and discuss what 

he could do to contribute to the Health service of our people.  Welcome to Dr Teariki 

Maoate who is a highly qualified consultant specialist in Christchurch, New Zealand.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>14 

</span></div><div><span>He is here visiting his family.  I think for the record of all our people, I think Teariki is 

the  second  Cook  Islander  to  achieve  one  of  the  highest  qualifications  in  health  i.e. 

Fellow  of  Royal  Colleges  of  Surgeons.    Apart  from  one  of  our  own  sons  George 

Ngaei,  both  are members of the Australasian Royal College of Surgeons.  I am very 

happy he is the audacious to take the time and come here to discuss things with me, as 

well  as  make  a  visit  to  the  hospital  and  have  a  chat  with  our  doctors  and  nurses  up 

there.  I look forward to the time when he can come back and work for our people as a 

consultant  on  short  term  attachment.    And  wherever  we  can  we  will  give  that  our 

support. 

</span></div><div><span>Coming back to this Clause of the Bill, Mr Chairman, I would just like to give some 

brief  explanations  to  the  questions  that  have  been  asked  by  some  Members  of  the 

House.    The  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga  raised  some  very  interesting,  very 

factual points that I have supported and agree with what he brought as concerns of the 

people of the Northern Group.  I agree with him as to the problems in the past where 

goods are transported between the ship and the land.  There has been a lot of loss of 

goods and nobody claims liability for that.  Under this new Bill the responsibility of 

shipping  the  goods  from  here  to  the wharf on Rarotonga and to  the Outer Islands is 

with the carrier.  As we have gone past the very important Clause of the Act, Clause 8, 

that is the Clause that makes the Bill work.  Where, through Clause 4, the option given 

to the shipper; the shipper can enter into a contract with the carrier to ship his goods at 

his  won  risk.    Number  two;  they  can  enter  into  a  contract,  shipping  the  goods  at 

limited carriers risk, the maximum  is  $1,500.  Third option is  that the goods can be 

entered into a contract with the shipper and the carrier to the value of the goods.  And 

lastly, a contract can be entered into in terms where both parties can decide what they 

would like to contract on. 

</span></div><div><span>This  is  what  this  Bill  is  making  available  to  our  people both  in  the Northern Group 

and in the Southern Group.  You see under the old Act which is the New Zealand Sea 

Carriage  of  Goods  Act  1940,  that Act  was more biased towards the shipper.  It  was 

more beneficial to the carrier than to the shipper.  One of the deciding concepts in the 

old  Act  is  negligence.    You  see  negligence  is  a  very  hard  word  to  prove.    Lawyers 

have  been  saying  that  it  is  going  to  cost  money  and  then  it  is  for  the  shipper  to  do 

reasonable  things  to  make  that  word  not  applicable  or  liable  for  them.    That  for  48 

years  has  been  the  concept  that  rendered  our  shippers  not  liable  for  damages  or 

liabilities that have been incurred on our people.   

</span></div><div><span>There  is  also  the  other  avenue  and  that  is  insurance  as  mentioned  by  another 

Honourable  Member.    You  see,  insurance  contracting  means  you  go  and  tell  the 

shipper that this bag of flour is worth $20 and they work out how much you are going 

</span><span>to pay for insurance.  So you pay your insurance and that’s it.  If you lose the goods, if 

</span><span>the shipper damages the goods you can claim insurance on that.  But under the present 

Bill, it is giving options, it is giving ways of helping the shipper enter into a contract 

between  the  shipper  and  the  carrier,  those  are  the  four  avenues  that  I  have  just 

mentioned earlier.  You see, the insurance question here is performed by the carrier or 

</span><span>the ship owner.  All you are doing is entering into a contract, an agreement with the 

</span><span>carrier that you have 50 bags of flour, 20 bags of rice and you have to choose whether 

you ship these at your risk.  That means if there is damage you are going to pay for it 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>15 

</span></div><div><span>or  you  are  going  to  contract  at  the  value  of  what  you  are  sending.    These  are  the 

options given for you to apply. 

</span></div><div><span>And  going  back  to  the  issue  of  transporting  of  goods  from  the  boat  to  the  land,  a 

contract  under  this  Bill  is  that  when  the  goods  are  handed  over  to  the  owner  of  the 

boat,  that  is,  on  the  wharf,  it  becomes  his  liability,  it  becomes  his  property  until  he 

disposes of it on the land.  Maybe this will be a problem for some islands where, as we 

know, there are lighterage companies that take the cargo from the boats on to the land.  

We have discussed this particular area with lawyers and this is the reason that we have 

put  in  place a Clause such as this that tells  us that the onus is  on the carrier to take 

those goods from one port to another port.  Therefore it will be in the interests of that 

carrier  to  make  sure  that  he  cargo  gets  from  the  carrier  on  to  the  land  as  soon  as 

possible.  Therefore an agreement must be put in place between the carrier which is 

the ship owner and also the lighterage companies on each island.  So as I said earlier, 

it will be up to the carrier to put in place some sort of arrangements that will ensure 

the quick disposal of the cargo or the goods from the ship on to the land. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  then  are  my  views  with  regard  to  the  questions  that  have  been  posed  and  I 

believe that we will all agree with the principle behind this Bill.  The spirit behind this 

Bill  to  help  our  people  alleviate  problems  from  over  the  years  where  they  have  lost 

things unable to recover any of them. 

</span></div><div><span>If we can remember recently the burning of the Avatapu.  The people that lost goods 

on that ship up to today have not been paid anything in insurance.  I was talking to a 

lawyer, Mr Mike Mitchell, and he said to me that maybe some people will be lucky, 

but up until now nobody has been paid. 

</span></div><div><span>This is why I rose, Mr Chairman, to help some of my colleagues understand this better 

and also for our people to understand it better.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  The Question is</span><span>:</span></div><div><span>That Clauses 9 to 15 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  am  every  grateful  for  the 

</span><span>Minister’s explanation to queries raised.  This is how it should be.  I am glad it is not 

</span><span>the  Honourable  Minister  around  the  back there, the Honourable Member Ngereteina 

Puna,  otherwise  he  would  just  ignore  me.    I  would  like  to  withdraw  my  comments 

</span><span>from earlier on.  I didn’t realise that while the Minister was not in his seat he was out 

</span><span>there talking to some people and I am grateful for the kind words that he has given to 

my son.  Some, no doubt, will ask - when is he going to come back?  He is here now.  

And while he is here on holiday, I have encouraged him to do as much as he can. 

</span></div><div><span>And  for  the  explanations  to  the  queries,  I  am  quite  satisfied.    I  am  happy  with  the 

</span><span>answers and I see this as an encouragement to people who are exporting and sending 

cargo either by boat or by air, to and back from the Outer Islands.  I have had a lot of 

experience  with  the  loss  of  cargo  and  actually  in  the  management  and offloading of 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>16 

</span></div><div><span>cargo while I was the administrator of the lighterage company in Aitutaki during my 

years as Resident Medical Officer there.  All the difficulties that we had experienced 

with the losses nobody cared about and sometimes, even losses through similar things 

like  what  the  Honourable  Dr  Robati  has  said.    Workers  sometimes  actually  cause 

damage to cargo, even dropping boxes of corned beef in the passage as they go into 

</span><span>the wharf and they come back later and dive and pick it up for their own use.  That’s 

</span><span>nothing new and it happens more than often. 

</span></div><div><span>But these I am referring to many, many years ago, Mr Chairman.  I suppose nowadays 

</span><span>it  doesn’t  happen  any  more  but  the  damages  as  a  result,  like  a  boat  catching  fire  or 

</span><span>even  a  boat  that  sinks,  as  the  Minister  explained  none  of  these  have  been 

compensated.    There  is  no  doubt  this  arrangement  is  slightly  different  from  what  it 

used to be, that as the Minister was explaining that cargo when it gets on to the wharf 

here it goes straight to whatever island and not until it lands on the wharf on the other 

end, the responsibility of the carrier ends there. 

</span></div><div><span>It  will  be  interesting  now  to  see how this will work now, to  see how this will work 

with  the  pressure  that  the  carrier  no  doubt  will  be  putting  on  whoever  is  going  to 

undertake the contracting of the unloading of the cargo from the ship onto the wharf 

on each island.  I doubt whether the ship owners have the right to establish their own 

lighterage company on each island because I believe the Island Councillors have the 

right to establish, you know the giving of licenses for anyone operating on each island 

as far as lighterage is concerned.  But, if it means that the lightering of cargo is more 

efficient under the establishment by a carrier, by shipowners - why not?  Because all 

the  lighterage  that  is  carried out  by the Government,  by the Ministry of Transport, I 

suppose on each of the Outer Islands none those operations have been a viable venture 

up  to  now.    And  therefore,  by  this  new  Act  the  responsibilities  of  lightering  can  be 

given  to  the  private  sector  and  maybe  by  that  way  it  will  become  a  more  viable 

operation  and  at  the  same  time  more  efficient.    I  remember  some  years  back  when 

Aitutaki  was  privately  owned  as  far  as  the  lighterage  is  concerned,  and  then 

Government  decided  to  take  it  over  thinking  that  they  could  do  it  better.    But 

unfortunately, like all the time, Government is never a profit making organisation and 

that is exactly the same as it is now.  So I believe that the move is in the right direction 

and I give my support to this Bill so far, Mr Chairman.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 9 to 15 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Liability of Employees.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 16 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Warranty by Contracting Parties.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>17 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 17 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I am not too sure I understand 

what is in this Clause, Mr Chairman.  But I believe, Mr Chairman, that it is to do with 

making </span><span>sure that the contracting parties understand what they’re worth.  Particularly to 

</span><span>the  types  of  cargo,  the  conditions  of  transport  and  the  protection  to  the  cargo.    So 

perhaps  the  Minister  could  clarify  a  little  bit  more  as  to  exactly  what  this  warranty 

means  in  this  Clause.  Because as I see it refers to a kind of agreement between the 

carrier and a contractor, or a contracting carrier.  Or perhaps it relates to the conditions 

of the clear to the cargo, how the cargo should be carried from point one to point two 

and so forth.  And what sort of agreement or terms can be agreed upon by all parties 

concerned.  Scanning this does not give me a specific indication but more of a general 

meaning, Mr Chairman.  Perhaps I will ask the Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna, 

</span><span>to explain.  Yes, I’ll give him his two minutes.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Minister, 

Tupou Faireka.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>I just want to briefly respond that this section is established to 

oblige the shipper to warn the carrier what sort of goods are being taken.  If the goods 

are declared dangerous then the shipper must be made to know that there is some risk, 

some danger in that ship so if an accident should happen, he has already been told.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 17 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Action Against Carriers.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 18, 19 and 20 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Rights of Carriers.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 21 to 27 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  sorry  Honourable  Member.    Time  is  up.    I  will  now  call  upon  the  Honourable 

Minister for a progress report to Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That progress be reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>18
