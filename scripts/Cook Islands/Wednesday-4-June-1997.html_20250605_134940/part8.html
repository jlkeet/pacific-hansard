<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The Honourable Minister, Pa Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Again, Mr Chairman, I suggest we go through the clauses in 

Parts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    May  I  seek  the  leave  of  the  House  for  the  Clauses  to  be  dealt 

with in Parts.  I can see that the Honourable Members have agreed.  The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Dealt in Parts 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 1:  Short Title.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Part I-  Interpretation.  And that involves Clause 2,3,4 and 5.  

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Part I Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3002 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.  Mr  Chairman,  it  is  perhaps 

opportune  that  when  we  are  looking  at  these  parts  certain  matters  relevant  to  the 

services of people employed by Government paid forward these tax monies, ought to 

be  queried.    I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity,  Mr  Chairman,  to  raise  with  the 

Minister responsible for this Bill and the Minister of MOID, (Outer Islands Affairs) as 

to why they have suspended the Government Representative of Atiu.  I would like to 

object very strongly to this great humiliation that has been brought on this young man, 

who everybody agrees in Atiu has been doing his utmost best for the island of Atiu. 

Now he faces an uncertain future and has been suspended without any indication as to 

what he has done wrong, and why he has been suspended.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also  on this occasion  like to  reiterate that the island of Atiu was the first to 

invent the idea of having a chief executive and an assistant chief executive to run the 

financial affairs of the Island Council.  It is from the Atiu example that MOID decided 

to  spread  such  an  example  right  around  to  the  other  Outer  Islands.    It  is  from  that 

</span><span>example.   

</span></div><div><span>And  the  Honourable  Minister  of  Education  has  the  audacity,  the  cheek  and  the 

outrageous arrogance, to suggest that I had interfered with my Island Council when I 

am  lawfully  an  ex  officio  member,  together  with  my  partner  in  Parliament  the 

</span><span>Honourable  Upoko  Simpson  and  the  Ui  Ariki.    We  are  ex  officio’s  of  the  Island 

</span><span>Council,  and  it  is  through  the  Democratic  process  of  due  diligence  and  due 

discussions that our decision was arrived at, not a decision by myself alone.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Honourable Member we are dealing with Clause 2 - 5. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Yes, so am I.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  And the statement made by the Honourable Minister was during 

the time of the principle and the merit of the Bill.  So please come back to the Clauses. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you.  I am obliged, Mr Chairman.  You see the Minister 

of  Education  is  a  very  grumpy  operator.    He  has  left  bits  and  pieces  all  over  the 

Interpretation  Clause  and  everywhere.    That  is  why  I  am  tidying  up  his  comments 

from  the last speech.  I just need to mention that perhaps my friend, the Minister of 

Education,  can  follow  my  example  and  to  spend  more  time  with  his  Island  Council 

and do some work in Araura Enua, rather than staying here hiding in Rarotonga, and 

allowing the Education system to fall apart while he is sitting idly by reading comics.  

So  I  come  back  to  these  Clauses  with  a  message  to  my  friend  the  Minister  of 

Education that if he is inspired by the present situation, if he is inspired by the present 

situation and by his Prime Minister for doing absolutely nothing about the economy at 

the present, then no wonder our education system is in an outrageous mess.  He seems 

to be inspired by absolutely nothing.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>3003 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>So we come to these Interpretation Clauses, Mr Chairman, which quite clearly defines 

all the critical areas of the Bill.  I do not think that there is a need for me to discuss 

any of these in particular.   

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps it is sufficient for me to mention at this point, Mr Chairman, that my island, 

the  island  of  Atiu,  is  one of the highest  tax payers in  the entire country.  I have got 

tables given to me about the total amount of taxation paid by each island, and I can tell 

you, Mr Chairman, the best island of the lot, they have exceeded what was expected 

from them, is Atiu.  Mr Chairman, the worst island that owes 50% of what they should 

be  paying  is  Aitutaki.    I  have  a  list  in  writing  and  it  was  given  to  me  the  Select 

Committee and these are facts and I would like to suggest to the Minister of Education 

to go back to Aitutaki and make sure he collects all the taxes that his island owes the 

Government.   

</span></div><div><span>So  it  is  important,  for  example,  to  observe  for  the  1996  year  the  people  of  Atiu 

overpaid  their  taxes  by  $4,497.    In  the  case  of  Aitutaki  out  of  $510,000  that  they 

should  have  paid,  they  only  paid  $268,000.    I  got  the  full  table  here  for  the  Outer 

Islands and I am very proud of my island, they have paid more than they should and 

</span><span>they are right up to date.  Unfortunately, Government does not always seem to favour 

</span><span>Enua  Manu  all  the  time.    So  on  that  happy  note,  I  do  not  have  any  comments,  Mr 

Chairman, I am quite sure that we will make a very good progress for this Bill as the 

afternoon goes by.  Thank you.

</span></div><div><span>First Schedule. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>3006 

</span></div><div><span>That First Schedule Stands Part of the Bill</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  P.  POKINO:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman,  I  have  some 

amendments to make in Part C of the First Schedule.  If the Members will please turn 

to Part C of Schedule One, the amendments are as follows.   

</span></div><div><span>At the top of the line after Part C could Members please after numbers 4 and 5 remove 

the letter in bracket B.  Members cross out B in brackets. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly, Mr Chairman, as we proceed towards the middle of Part C you will note A) 

</span><span>is “$24,000 and”.  Would Members please delete the word “and”.  </span></div><div><span>In Section 1 of Part C, you will notice Section 1A and 1B.  Would you please add a 

</span><span>section C and in Section B insert the following sentence: 

</span></div><div><span>“Income from commercial and residential, if any, for the income year and” </span></div><div><span>In 1C, move the phrase “majority income” from B to C.</span><span>

Now section one reads as follows: 

</span><span>“For</span><span>  the  purpose  of  Part  C  for  each  person  who  earns  income  from  more  than  one 

source the primary source of income shall be the total of  

</span></div><div><span>A) Investment income if any or the income near. 

B) income from commercial residential rentals if any or 

the income near.  

C)  majority income. 

</span></div><div><span>In Section 2 second line, the line includes the words in the bracket, between the words 

</span><span>“excluding and investment” please insert the words “rental income”.</span><span>

So that Section 2 now reads: 

</span></div><div><span>“Majority  income  is  determined  b</span><span>y  reference  to  a  persons  total  non  -  investment 

</span><span>income  (being  income  from  all  sources  excluding  rental  income  and  investment 

</span><span>income) and is either carry on”.</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  there  was  an  omission  regarding  income  from  commercial  and 

residential  rentals which  must be included as  part of Part C of the First  Schedule to 

make the income complete 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.
