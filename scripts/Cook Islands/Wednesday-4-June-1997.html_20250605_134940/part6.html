<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Income Tax Bill Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>The Associate Minister of Finance Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, 

</span></div><div><span>I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Income Tax Bill be read a Second time</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  Even  though  this  Bill  is  thicker  than  the  previous  one,  most  of  the 

matters incorporated in it are just a continuation or are taken from the old Income Tax 

Act.  There are a few additions that have been included merely to improve and update 

the old Act.  I feel that the most noteworthy inclusion, Mr Speaker, is the provision for 

$6,000  exemption  from  your  pay  before  your  income  is  assessed  for  Income  Tax.  

Secondly, the other important area is the ceiling, the tiers, this is the  level of payment 

you  are  required  to  pay  tax  on.    For  example,  Mr  Speaker,  from  memory  from  0  to 

$10,000 you are required to pay 20% tax.  From $10,001 to $20,000 I think the figure 

is 25%, and from $20,0001 to above that is 30%. 

</span></div><div><span>Beside those major improvements there are other minor ones which I do not need to 

go  through.    But  I  want  to  reiterate  that  for  this  Bill  to  be  effective  it  must  be 

considered  in  combination  with  the  VAT.    Once  again  may  I  repeat,  I  feel  that  we 

have  thrashed  the  debate  on  the  Principles  and  the  Merits  of  the  tax  package.  

Therefore, I do not anticipate any prolonged debate on the Principles and Merits of the 

Income Tax Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister, and a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. T. Faireka 

</span></div><div><span>And the question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2994 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Good  afternoon  to  you,  good 

afternoon to Honourable Members of this House on the Government side and on the 

Opposition side and good afternoon to our people listening. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my support to this Income Tax Bill and to highlight some of 

the very important issues raised in this Bill.  But before I do that, Mr Speaker, as we 

are talking about tax, I just want to read this quote that I feel is relevant to the issue of 

taxation.  It comes from Benjamin Franklin.  This is what he said in the 18th Century 

</span><span>“In this world nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.”  </span></div><div><span>However,  Mr  Speaker,  looking  on  the  brighter  side  of  taxation,  this is  the only way 

that  a  country  like  ours  can  survive.    A  country  that  has  no  resources  that  we  can 

manipulate  to  extract  revenue  for  the  development  of  our  country.    We  have  no 

alternative  but  to  initiate  a  taxation  system  in  order  for  Government  to  generate 

revenue to pay its public bills. 

</span></div><div><span>Just a few minutes ago, Mr Speaker, we passed the taxation that is initiated for mainly 

business  people.    Now  we  are  talking  of  a  Bill  that  will  impose  upon  our  people, 

</span><span>Income  Tax.    However,  as  I  said  the  other  day,  the  two  bills  have  to  be  taken  in 

</span><span>consideration  -  its  importance  has  got  to  compromise  each  other.    Under  this  new 

Income  Tax  Bill,  we  will  be  seeing  exemptions  that  have  been  highlighted by some 

speakers of up to the amount of $6,000 ie) for the first $6,000 that you earn you will 

not be paying any taxes on that amount.   Thereafter, a tier system of taxing will be 

placed  on  any  income  that  you  collect  or  accumulate  after  the  $6,000  that  you 

originally earn. 

</span></div><div><span>However, there are other areas that people have been querying, as to when the tax will 

apply and how the tax would apply.  One area Mr Speaker,  is that of insurance.  We 

are aware, Mr Speaker, from our session in camera with the experts that the insurance 

will be exempted.  That included, will have a total exemption figure of up to $5,000.  

The other money that is common to our people is that derived from superannuation.  

When  you  are  contributing  to  super  this  will  be  taxable.    That  means  if  you  are 

contributing to super you will be paying tax.  But the beauty about that, is that when 

you  retire  and  are  entitled  to  your  superannuation,  during  that  time  you  collect  your 

superannuation you are not paying any tax at all. 

</span></div><div><span>I want  to  highlight  those areas, Mr Speaker, because these two issues, the insurance 

</span><span>and superannuation are issues that our people are very much interested to know, as to 

whether they are taxed or not. 

</span></div><div><span>Also under this new Bill, Mr Speaker, are the same exemptions given to spouses and 

children, similar to the old Act.  That means at the end of the year, from the money 

that is spent, you can claim some benefit on a child or your wife or husband that does 

not work or earn money at all. 

</span></div><div><span>There is also the issue of donations, Mr Speaker, that are exempted from business as 

</span><span>well  as  individuals.    You  can  donate  money  up  to  the  amount  of  $5,000  to  any 

organisation, namely to sport, the church, and also to village committees.  At the end 

of the financial year, you can claim that $5,000 back from the Tax Department.  This 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>2995 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>has  been  increased  from  $2,000  which  was  the  figure  under  the  old  Act  to  $5,000 

under  this  new  Act.    I  would  like  to  highlight  this  aspect  to  our  people because not 

only  companies  are  entitled  to  this  claim  but  individual  people  who  pay  taxes  and 

claim  tax  can  also  claim  this  figure  of  $5,000  that  they  have  donated  or  given  to 

charitable organisations. 

</span></div><div><span>In looking at this new taxation system, Mr Speaker, I think it is obvious to see what 

this  Bill  is  trying  to  create  especially  at  this  time  where  our  people  are  down  in  the 

economic crisis situation.  This Bill is trying to compromise the VAT Bill, which has 

</span><span>been passed, and this Income Tax Bill is trying to give more money into the people’s 

</span><span>hands to spend in order for the economy to move ahead.  But I would like to warn the 

people Mr Speaker, that although this Act will become effective or passed soon and 

become  law,  the  benefit  that  we  are  talking  about  now  will  not  be  seen  or  realised 

until about twelve months time.  Again, I reiterate the point.  Let us put the Act into 

</span><span>operation and let’s see how it will give the benefit to the people.</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Incidentally,  Benjamin  Franklin  is 

</span><span>also  well known for saying that “visitors are like fish, after they stay with you for a 

few  days  they  start  to  smell”.    Of  course  those  that  are  not  learned  about  these 

</span><span>important quotations should shut up. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Speaker, I shall leave the elaborations and other persuasions about this Bill 

to the Government Members because it is their Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>What I would like to do now, is to make some comments overall on it’s impact on our 

</span><span>economy.  Mr Speaker, we represent the tax payers of this country.  It is the tax payers 

that voted us into this House.  This important role of Parliamentarians is often lost on 

the less conscientious Members of the House, especially some Cabinet Ministers.  The 

fundamental rule is, that only Parliament can levy taxes no one else.  Indeed the very 

creation of Parliament from the beginning was a rebellion against the King.  The King 

of England use to  impose taxes without asking the people, without a meeting of the 

</span><span>people.  He use to impose taxation over and over again.  It was only through a Civil 

</span><span>War in England, whereby the Parliament went to war with the King, fought and were 

victorious.   That allowed the creation of Parliament to come into being. The doctrine 

of    Magna  Carta  came  into  force  requiring  the  King  not  to  impose  any  tax  except 

</span><span>through Parliament.  Hence, the doctrine of “no taxation without representation”.  It is 

</span><span>only the representatives of the people sitting in Parliament that can impose taxes.   

</span></div><div><span>Today,  Mr  Speaker,  our  country  is  shrouded  with  the  mists  of  depression,  a  mist  of 

doubt, over the affairs of the nation.  Never in our history has leadership been so badly 

needed.    We  are  simply  not  getting  it.    There  is  no  leadership  in  the  country  today.  

That is why each morning you wake up, you see nothing but gloom, the feelings of the 

people  are  down,  the  business  community  is  distressed.    What  is  required  in  this 

country today is good sharp leadership.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2996 

</span></div><div><span>When people pay taxes, they want to see their money go to good use.  I am amazed, 

Mr Speaker, at the level of awareness that the average citizen of this country has, they 

are  so  mindful  of  their  tax  contribution.    Through  talking  to  them,  through  mixing 

with  them.      I  just  could  not  believe  that  the  stage  of  maturity  has  been  reached 

whereby  they  are  conscious  of  what  they contribute, of what  they pay in  the way of 

taxes and they are very conscious how that tax money is being spent.  These people 

come to me and I say to them, do not complain to me I can only do so much.  Go and 

tackle  these  Ministers,  go  and  tackle  the  Prime  Minister,  go  and  see  Lloyd  Powell, 

they  are  in  control,  they  are  the  big  spenders,  they  are  the  ones  spending  your  tax 

money, they are the ones that you ought to protest to, not to me.  I can only do very 

</span><span>little from the side.  Mr Speaker, I am sad to recount that all the Minister’s have left 

</span><span>the Chamber except for one.  All of them have decided to abandon Parliament because 

I am on  the Floor.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Can you please come back on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Take for arguments sake if you read the paper this morning, the 

expenditure  which  was  spent  on  consultants,  on  consultants  to  decide  what  repairs, 

what renovations are needed for the Rarotongan Hotel, $700,000 for people to tell us 

what is needed.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Point of Order.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of Order 

Honourable Minister for Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>   193  - Relevancy.  Mr Speaker, we are talking about Income Tax 

not  the  expenditure  on  the  renovation  of  the  Rarotongan  Hotel.   I would like to  ask 

you to bring this Honourable Member back to discuss the Principals and Merits of the 

Income  Tax  Bill  before  the  House.    The  Honourable  Member  may  speak  on  the 

expenditure on the Rarotongan when we come to the 1997/98 estimates.  Thank you 

Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    The  Honourable  Member 

Norman George.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you for your ruling Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Just a reminder to the Honourable Member that we are now dealing 

with the Income Tax Bill and try and speak on the Paper. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    I  am!  But  I  am!  Mr  Speaker,  I  am  what  I  am!  I  am  talking 

about tax money.  Mr Speaker, with all respect ... 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Maybe you do not understand our Maori parable.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  I do not want it, I want to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Well do not use it in the House.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>2997 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  I can use what I want to use in the House as long as it is my 

right. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  If you want to use it in the House, we do not want to hear it. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  It is my right to use whatever I want to use. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Please sit down! 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  As long as I follow Standing Orders. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>But you can’t tell me what to</span><span> say and what not to say with all 

respect. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Would you please apologise before I make the next statement. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>You can’t dictate to me what I am.  I am elected to be here.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Interfering. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>It’s my right </span><span>to speak Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    If  you  do  not  apologise  to  the  Speaker  you  will  not  be  given  the 

chance to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>I would like to know Sir ... I’ll apologise, but tell me what it is 

</span><span>for please? 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Answering back to the Speaker is what I am telling you Honourable 

Member.   

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>Even if the Speaker is wrong.  With all respect.  You can’t tell 

</span><span>me what to say and what not to say.  With all respect.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Please  sit  down!    Honourable  Member,  please  when  the  Speaker 

speaks, do not answer back. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, if that is your finding, I retract from that with all 

respect.  But at the same time I would like to reinstate my right to speak in this House 

unimpeded, unrestricted because that is my role as a Member of this House.   

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, I observe what you have said.  I will take particular note of 

that,  not  to  answer  directly  back.    But  please,  I  would  also  like  to  seek  your 

understanding  that  now  and  every  time  a  ruling  is  made  there  ought  to  be  grounds 

based  on  Standing  Orders.    I  believe  in  Standing  Orders  and  I  follow  the  rules,  I 

follow  the  law.    But  when  somebody  says  something  that  is  not  founded  on  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2998 

</span></div><div><span>Standing Order in accordance to the law, then I question it.  Mr Speaker, I submit as 

part  of  my  comments  on  this  Bill,  that  the  tax  money  that  Government  spends  is 

derived from the collection of taxes and not from raffles.  Not from found money, but 

from taxes that are imposed on the people of this country.  I say without fear that the 

majority of the taxpayers of the country agree the expenditure by this Government of 

$700,000  on  overseas  consultants  on  the  Rarotongan  Hotel  is  a  bad  mistake  on  the 

part  of  this  Government.    When  we  make  a  law  to  collect  tax  from  our  people  we 

should follow that responsibly with accountability to spend the money wisely.  What 

we  are  saying  in  Opposition  is  spending  the  $700,000  from  the  taxpayers  is  an 

absolute wasted extravagant exercise, and totally unjustified expenditure. 

</span></div><div><span>Just a simple exercise in comparison and evaluation- do we need to spend $700,000 of 

</span><span>these people’s hard earned tax dollars, when we can do it for $25,000?  Surely anyone 

</span><span>with common intelligence can tell you the difference. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  The Honourable Minister of Education and Cultural Development, 

Ngereteina Puna.  What is your Point of Order? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Standing  Order  193  Relevancy.    We  are  speaking  about  the 

principles and merits of the Income Tax Bill.  This is the second Point of Order I have 

raised concerning the Honourable Norman George speaking on the renovation of the 

Rarotongan  Hotel.    If  I  remember  correctly,  Mr  Speaker,  you  upheld  that  Point  of 

Order and now the Honourable Member is going back to that point and it is irrelevant.  

We are not talking about expenditure.  We are talking about Income Tax.  I am asking 

you,  Mr  Speaker,  please  refrain  the  Honourable  Member  from  talking  about 

expenditure when we are talking about Income Tax. 

</span></div><div><span>Anyway the Honourable Member has got his facts all wrong and if he wants to know 

more about it he should ask a question in the House then he will get the correct facts. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Member  Norman  George  to 

please  direct  your  thoughts  on  the  Income  Tax  Bill.    What  has  been  written  in  this 

booklet, has been written.  Please do not beat around the bush.  Come back to the tree 

that is in the House at present, the Income Tax Bill of which we are still debating.  So 

will the Honourable Member please come back to the paper on the Floor. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Perhaps you would be so kind as to 

make a firm ruling that we cannot talk about the expenditure of Income Tax.  We have 

a  Bill  before  the  House  about  Income Tax, the imposition of Income Tax.  Are you 

going to rule that we now cannot talk about how that money is to be spent?  If it is the 

wish of the Speaker to rule that we cannot talk about how Income Tax funds are to be 

expended, then please say so.  While there is no ruling to that effect the majority of 

people of this country will find that what I am saying is relevant, because we are on 

the principles and merits.  What you take with one hand and what is handed out with 

the other hand is  a matter of interest,  is  debatable and belongs to  the public.  And I 

represent the public.  I just cannot believe how dense the Minister of Education is.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>2999 

</span></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:  </span><span>Do you have to say something like that? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>   At this  point perhaps I shall leave the subject  with  a humble 

request from the Opposition.  I would like to ask a Minister of Government to please 

explain to the House either while we are on this Bill, or later on, to break down how 

the  $700,000  of  tax  payers  money  was  spent  at  the  Rarotongan  Hotel.    Give  full 

details of how it was spent, because that $700,000 is Income Tax money belonging to 

the people of this country.  It is not raffle or Housie funds.  It is not aid money.  It is 

Income Tax money belonging to the people of this country.   

</span></div><div><span>Of  course  if  we  had  reformed  our  Standing  Orders  to  allow  daily  questions  to  be 

raised, then we would not need to raise questions such as these when Bills are being 

discussed.    There  is  no  other  opportunity,  hence  the  pressure  from  us  to  you,  Mr 

Speaker, to move on with a reform of the Standing Orders to allow these questions to 

be raised. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, there are many hard working people in this country.  People who work in 

all kinds of weather.  They want to pay their taxes, but when they do pay it they want 

to know how the money is spent.  And when they see it mis-spent, when they see this 

Government throwing their money around they get angry and concerned.  The people 

expect  encouragement.    The  taxpayers  of  this  country  expect  great  encouragement 

from their Government, not a regular smack in the face each time they raise questions.   

</span></div><div><span>The  people  of  this  country  would  rather  see  their  money  spent  on  sensible  things.  

Already  this  country  is  facing  a  bill  of  $5  million  for  the  up  coming  South  Pacific 

Forum meeting.  When you add this to the $3 million for the Rarotongan Hotel, plus 

all  other  incidental  expenses,  we  are  now  staring  at  $5  million  to  host  the  South 

Pacific Forum  from our Income Tax money.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Education and Tauranga Vananga, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  I rise to support the principles and merits 

of  the  Bill  before  the  House.    I  know  that  the  speaker  before  me,  the  Honourable 

Norman George, also supports the principles and merits of the Bill before the House. 

But  instead of speaking to  the fine principles of this package which he helped bring 

before  this  House,  he  chose  to  attack  Government  on  a  subject  which  is  quite 

irrelevant  to  the  Bill  before  us,  and  that  is  the  subject  of  expenditure.    I  suspected 

yesterday the Honourable Norman George was going to do exactly what he is doing 

today, and that is get up and attack Government on matters which have nothing to do 

with the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member  spoke  about  gloom  hanging  over  the  country.    No  one  is 

denying that we have an economic crisis that we are going through.  The Honourable 

Member  said  that  there  is  a  lack  of  strong,  sharp  leadership  in  the  country  today, 

</span><span>meaning  in  Government.    What  the  Honourable  Member  meant  to  say  was  that  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Norman George, should be the Prime Minister of this country.  

That  is  what  he  was  trying  to  say.    The  fact  of  the  matter  is  he  is  not  the  Prime 

Minister  of  this  country.    He  is  not  in  Government.    He  was in  Government  for ten 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>4 June 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3000 

</span></div><div><span>years  from  1985,  I  believe,  to  1989.    Sorry,  that  is  five  years.    Yes.    So  he  had  his 

chance  to  lead  this  country  into  prosperity.    What  did  we  find  when  we  became 

Government  in  1989?    We  found  run-down  schools,  run-down  Government  offices, 

the roads were full of potholes, the power supply was unreliable and so on.  Now that 

is their legacy that they left the Cook Islands Party Government to inherit in 1989.   

</span></div><div><span>And  just  lately,  I  have  heard  that  he  had  forced  the  Atiu  Island  Council  in  making 

appointments  to  the  position  of  CEO  and  Deputy  CEO  in  Atiu  when  he  had  no 

business  to  do that.  I think he should step down as Member of Parliament for Atiu 

because he has grossly mislead his Island Council and his people. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  coming  to  the  principles  and  merits  of  the  Bill,  one  of  the  principles  of  the 

Income Tax Bill is to leave more money in the pockets of our people.  Hence, we have 

heard the Minister responsible for the Bill, the Honourable Pa Pokino, tell us the three 

levels of tax rates - 20 cents, 25 cents and 30 cents.  When this package was taken to 

our people, they were very happy with this principle.  Because they could see that the 

rates that will become effective as from the 1st July this year is going to be easier on 

the taxpayers than the ones currently in force.   

</span></div><div><span>The  other  principle  in  the  Bill  is  secondary  employment.    The  rates  that  I  have  just 

reminded  you  of  is  for  primary  income,  or  primary  employment.    Government  has 

taken the strong leadership in making this decision that for revenue, for income from 

secondary sources, we would impose 15 cents in the dollar right across the board.  The 

purpose of this across the board flat rate of 15 cents in the dollar is so that our people 

can be encouraged to earn more money for the family and for themselves.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  have  not  heard  of  any  complaints  from  the  communities,  from  our 

people, that this is not a fair imposition on them.  I have not heard any complaints and 

I  suspect  that  the  Honourable  Member,  Norman  George,  who  is  a  Member  of  the 

Select  Committee  appointed  by  this  House  to  take  the  matter  out  to  our  people,  

knows this.  It seems he did not want to mention it because it would be a pat on the 

back for this Government. 

</span></div><div><span>So,  Mr  Speaker,  all  that  this  House  can  do  is  to  put  in  place  the  infrastructure  of 

taxation and we feel that this is the best that we can come up with at this time.  Also, 

it would be the incentive that our people need for an economic recovery. 

</span></div><div><span>And  just  one  more  point I wish to  touch on before I resume my seat,  because I feel 

that  this  Bill  together  with  the  VAT  Bill  has  had  such  extensive  exposure  and 

consultation  with  the business  community, with  the communities in  the villages, the 

Outer Islands, and even among ourselves the Members of Parliament, that we all are 

in support of this Bill.  However, my question is on of money that the parents of our 

children contribute in support of their schools.  Under the provisions of this Bill that 

will  be  recognised,  there  are  provisions  here  where  you  will  benefit  under  your 

Income  Tax  concessions.    Under  this  Bill  charitable  purposes  are  defined  as  those 

which relate to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education and religion, or any 

other activity beneficial to the community.  So I would like our people, especially our 

parents to hear that and I want to thank you for your help with the schools.  Now we 

are recognising your support to helping to recoup your expenditure or your donations 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>3001

</span></div><div><span>to  your  schools.    But  of  course  the  decision  of  Government  to  put  in  this  Bill,  the 

provision  where every taxpayer will receive $6,000 tax free, is a very bold decision.  

This  has  never been taken in  this way before.  So, Mr Speaker, if that is not strong, 

decisive leadership in Government, then I do not know what the Honourable Member 

Norman George, has got in mind.  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any other speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>CLERK-ASSISTANT:</span><span>    A  Bill  Intituled  an  Act  to  consolidate  the  law  relating  to 

Income Tax.
