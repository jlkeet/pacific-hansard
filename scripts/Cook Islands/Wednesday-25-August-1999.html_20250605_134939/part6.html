<div><span>SITTING IS RESUMED 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Please be seated Honourable Members. This Sitting is now resumed 

and  I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member  for  Matavera  to  continue  with  his  Maiden 

Speech and you have 17 more minutes. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAE  PARE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  I  would  like  to  extend  my 

greetings to the Ui Mataiapo and Ui Rangatira and to the people of Rangiatea. To the 

youth organisations of Matavera and the various religious organisations in Matavera.  

I wish to extend my Kia Orana to the Executive of the Democratic Alliance Party of 

Matavera  for  it  was  you  who  enabled  me  to  be  in  this  Parliament.  I  would  like  to 

extend my thanks to our Papaa friends in the village of Matavera for your support.  I 

would also  like to  extend my  greetings to  the political  parties in  Matavera and their 

</span><span>supporters.  To  the  New  Alliance  Party,  the  Cook  Islands  Party  and  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance  Party.    Greetings  also  to  the  unsuccessful  candidates  who  contested  in  the 

June General Election with me. Kia Orana also to my wife and children at home.  To 

the  staff  of  the  Health  Department,  the  Secretary  of  the  Hospital  Dr  Tamarua,  Kia 

Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI</span><span>:  Mr Speaker, </span><span>there’s too much interjections from the Members.</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAE  PARE:</span><span>…and  to  the  Public  Health  Division,  to  all  Health 

</span><span>Department  staff members, from  the Doctors to  the nurses, the kitchen hands to  the 

groundsmen, Kia Orana. Special greetings to my former colleagues in the Laboratory.  

I feel sorry for my former co-worker who ran in the Elections in Tupapa because she 

has not started working yet.  If you are listening to the Radio this afternoon, I would 

like  her  to  come  back  and  work.  Likewise  a  Matavera  staff  member  who  is  also 

waiting to be reinstated.  Mr Speaker I have seen an advertisement in the newspaper 

</span><span>regarding her post at the hospital. Personally, I don’t think there is anyone else in the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands  who  is  qualified  to  take  up  that  position.  I  would  like  to  advise  the 

Deputy Prime Minister that she is a very good worker, except she was enticed to run 

in the last election and so she had to leave.  But I do not know Mr Speaker, whether it 

was the Honourable Tupou Faireka or the Honourable Norman George who did that. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to give a special Kia Orana to my people in Mangaia.  To 

the people of all political parties in Oneroa, Kia Orana. To Numangatini Ariki and all 

the people of Mangaia, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>When  I  looked  at  the  Budget  allocation  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  I  see  that  it  is 

almost  $1/2  million  just  over  the  Budget  of  last  year.    I  do  not  understand  why  the 

</span><span>Ministry of Health didn’t receive a bigger increase over this year’s app</span><span>ropriation. Our 

</span><span>Budget of last year was not very large. This is a very small increase.  When we look at 

</span><span>the allocation for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Speaker, I cannot help 

making this statement.  I cannot help but feel sorry for our people. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>32 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Order please. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. VAEVAE PARE:</span><span> Speaker thank you for that.  I would like to thank you Mr 

Speaker for this opportunity to speak and encourage all Members to be honest in our 

dealings for the sake of our people.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  very  much  Honourable  Member  for  your  excellent 

Maiden Speech. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  The Honourable Member for Mauke. 

</span></div><div><span>MR M. TAIA:</span><span>  Greetings to you Mr Speaker, and to your wife, greetings in the love 

of our Lord.  To open my Maiden Speech in this House I would like to quote a verse 

from  the Bible.   It  says;  Love  and Truth  they meet,  Peace and Honesty,  they kiss.  I 

believe Mr Speaker that this verse is quite appropriate for our meeting this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  give  thanks  to  the  Almighty  God  for  giving  me  this 

opportunity to represent my people in this House.  Allow me, Mr Speaker, to extend 

</span><span>my greetings to the Honourable Members in this House.  To our people listening in to 

</span><span>this  broadcast,  to  my  people  in  my  constituency  of  Akatokamanava,  Kia  Orana. 

Greetings to you Mr Clerk and to all your staff members and all those ladies serving 

us  in  the  kitchen.    Greetings  also  to  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Deputy 

Prime  Minister  the  Honourable  Norman  George  and  also  to  our  Papa  Sir  Geoffrey 

Henry, to all Cabinet Ministers in the House and to all Honourable Members on the 

Government side, greetings to you all in the Love of God.   

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  our  Leader,  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate and to the Deputy Leader, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>And to us on the Opposition side, Kia Orana.  I trust and believe that what we do in 

this  House  will  be  for  the  benefit  of  our  people.  No  matter  whether  you  are  on  the 

Government side or on the corrective side, it is my hope that what we are doing will 

be for the benefit of our people.  May the Lord truly guide us in our deliberation as we 

go on. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend my </span><span>aroa</span><span> to the people of the Cook Islands who are residing on 

the island of Tumutevarovaro.  To the Ui Ariki on this island, to the Ui Mataiapo and 

to  our  people  and  children,  to  the  Tama-Ua  of  the  Ui  Ariki  of  this  country,  who 

graced  our people with  the Love of our Lord under the auspices of the church, Kia 

Orana.  May God truly bless you all at this time. Those who are here to visit us, to the 

people from Akatokamanava who are residing on Tumutevarovaro, may God give you 

strength to pursue your goals. 

</span></div><div><span> To  the  Outer  Islands,  the  various  authorities  on  these  islands,  the  churches,  the 

Government, Kia Orana.  I believe we should also extend to them greetings because I 

think they are listening in to our broadcast and trying to find out what we are debating 

</span><span>in the House. 

</span></div><div><span>Now  I  would  like  to  extend  my  greetings  to  my  island  Akatokamanava.    To  the  Ui 

Ariki, the Ui Kavana, the Ui Mataiapo and the people of the three tribes on the island 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>33 

</span></div><div><span>of  Akatokamanava,  Kia  Orana.  Greetings  also  to  the  religious  sector  of  our 

community  in  Akatokamanava.  The  many  religious  leaders,  your  congregations  </span><span>–</span><span>

Greetings.    To  the  Government  workers,  to  the  Government  Representative  and  the 

public  servants  on  the  island  of  Akatokamanava,  Kia  Orana.  To  the  Mayor  of  the 

island, to the Deputy Mayor and to the Island Councillors, Kia Orana. I hope that you 

are  discharging  your  responsibilities  properly.    I  extend  a  very  special  greetings  to 

those people who have voted for me into this House.  To the Campaign Manager, to 

the Secretary-Treasurer and the supporters who are listening in to this broadcast this 

afternoon.  Because of your efforts in carrying out your responsibilities, I am in this 

House today. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  also  at  this  time  to  give  my  greetings  to  a  person  who  has  served  the 

people  of  Akatokamanava  in  Parliament  for  some  time,  Mr  Vaine  Tairea.    I  will 

continue  to  carry  out  the  work  that  you  have  left  from  here.    My  objective  is  clear. 

That  is  to  improve  the welfare of our people  and advance the projects  on the island 

that will help them.  I stand to represent the interests of our people. I intend to hold on 

to this position and to do my best to serve our island. I am going to serve you to the 

best of my abilities. I know that we will fail to accomplish anything without the help 

</span><span>of our Lord. Let us accept our Lord to help and guide us in whatever we do.  We have 

</span><span>set an objectives in this House for the benefit of our people. We need this House to 

</span><span>provide assistances to them.  Our party’s Aim is –</span><span> People First at all times!  My desire 

in my heart is to do my work in this House with all honesty.  This is a new era and we 

need to refocus our minds. Let us not waste our time here objecting to anything that 

will  be  of  benefit  to  our  people.    However,  if  we  see  that  the  issue  debated  in  this 

House will not benefit the country, and will not serve the interests of our people, there 

is no reason why our support should be expected.  Our people will be drawn to what 

we  are  debating  in  this  House.    So  let  us  deliver  the  goods.  Remember  that  we  are 

</span><span>here to serve them.  If it wasn’t for their support, we wouldn’t be in th</span><span>is Chamber. 

</span></div><div><span>Now I will come back to the Budget before us.  In one of the Koutu Nui Meetings I 

attended, it was recommended that we should be speaking in Maori in Parliament.  So 

I would like to speak in my own dialect in this House. By doing that, we would all be 

able  to  educate  each  other  how  we  speak  in  our  respective  islands.  Understanding 

what  we  are  saying  will  be  a  problem  if  we  resort  all  the  time  to  English.  The 

</span><span>procedures of the House will also be a problem if we don’t understand.  Our people 

</span><span>will  want  to  know  exactly  what  we  are  doing.  I  am  sure  we  all  understand  the 

Maukean dialect. So if I complain in Maukean, you will know. Likewise if someone 

else speaks in their own dialect.  We need to learn our languages. 

</span></div><div><span>In regards to the Budget before us, I would like to look at the Education Budget first.  

I  have  been  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  for  over  40  years  and  in  those  40  years,  I 

served  as  a  Principal  for  22  years.    It  was  through  those  years  that  I  was  able  to 

understand  the  problems  of  the  teachers,  the  students  and  some  of  the  worst  school 

premises.    Maybe  we  came  through  a  very  difficult  time  and  we  were  not  able  to 

address these problems. But I am hoping that during our debate in this House we will 

come  to  understand  the  needs  of  the  schools.  Consider  the  Members  of  Parliament 

</span><span>today.  If we hadn’t gone through the schools to achieve some form of education we 

</span><span>won’t be able to be in Parliament.  And we will not be receiving the salaries that are 

</span><span>paid to us.  Consider the remunerations of the teachers.  I see in this Budget that there 

is going to be a salary increase to all the teachers.  I know this is not enough.  If you 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>34 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>pay  the  teachers  well,  they  will  work  well.    Otherwise  they  will  not  perform  well. 

They are like everybody else. If we </span><span>don’t receive</span><span> a good pay for the work we do, we 

will not be happy to  give in all our efforts.  So it is important for each one of us to 

look  at  this  Appropriation  carefully.    We  are  now  moving  into  a  new  era.    Provide 

good facilities to our children.  L</span><span>et’s improve our educational system.</span></div><div><span>Honourable Members, in order to achieve that goal, we should increase the allocation 

for the Education Department because I know that this is not going to be enough.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  I wish to  speak on the allocations for  the Health Department.   I am  not  a 

doctor but I was appointed to a position on the island of Akatokamanava to look at the 

needs  of  the  Health  Department.  As  a  member  on  this  body,  I  realised  the  need  to 

</span><span>build  a  new  hospital  premises.    I’m  not  trying  to  co</span><span>ndemn  the  former  Minister  of 

</span><span>Health,  but  what  I’m  trying  to  do  is  to  address  the  needs  of  the  island  of 

</span><span>Akatokamanava.  Because the hospital building that we have today has always been a 

target  for  every hurricane that struck the island.   So to  you the Minister  responsible 

for Health Department, please consider our case on the island of Akatokamanava.  We 

need  your  help.  Likewise  the  other  islands  with  dilapidated  hospitals.    There  were 

</span><span>times when we ran out of drugs on our islands and we had to fundraise to raise money 

</span><span>to purchase drugs. There were other amenities necessary for the hospital and we had 

to fork in. 

</span></div><div><span>As this is my maiden speech, I would like Honourable Members to consider my plea. 

These issues are of great concern to me.  Thank your, Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member for Mauke, and congratulations on 

your  maiden  speech.    Can  we  call  for  further  speakers?    There  appears  to  be  none.  

The Honourable Member for Akaoa for your maiden speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>  Kia Orana Mr Speaker, my congratulations to you in your election as 

Speaker.  Kia Orana also to our Prime Minister, Dr Joseph Williams.  I believe that 

the Members in Government have thrown away their contracts but we are still holding 

on to the contracts that we signed.  You all know that we signed the contracts before 

we came before you for the swearing-in.   

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the Deputy Prime Minister the Honourable Norman George and also to 

the  Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  and  to  your  good  wife.    Kia  Orana  to  all  the 

Ministers  in  Cabinet  and  to  all  Members  in  Government.    To  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition  and  to  the  Deputy  Leader,  to  all  the  Honourable  Members  in  the 

Opposition who will become Government in the very near future, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  send  my  greetings  to  my  constituency.    Kia  Orana  to  my  Ariki 

Tinomana Ariki and to your good husband.  Kia Orana to the Ui Mataiapo and the Ui 

Rangatira of Puaikura.  Kia Orana also to all the religious organisations in the village. 

To my chairman of the Democratic Alliance Party in Akaoa, Kia Orana to you and  to 

the hard working committee members in the last General election.  I also would like 

</span><span>to  thank  you  for  having  confidence  in  me  as  your  Member  in  this  Parliament.    Kia 

</span><span>Orana also to the former Member to Papa Utia Matata who  worked very hard in his 

time  as  a  Member  for  our  constituency.    I  am  aware  that  during  the  time  of  the 

petitions you did not want to make any move against me.  Because you agreed to have 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>35 

</span></div><div><span>me  as  your  Member,  we  will  now  work  together.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Mayor  and  the 

Councillors of the village.  I endorse all the good work that you are doing in the vaka 

of  Puaikura.    Kia  Orana  also  to  all  the  business  people  in  Puaikura,  big  and  small. 

Even those who are sewing </span><span>ei </span><span>for sale, Kia Orana also to you. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana also to all government workers in Puaikura.  Kia Orana to all the people in 

Puaikura  and  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga.    To  you  my  friend  Tiaki  Wuatai,  I  would 

like to encourage you even though you were only a Member of Parliament for 2 days, 

I would like to assure you that on the 30</span><span>th</span><span> of September you will have that seat for 5 

years.    Kia  Orana  also  to  my  good  friend  Inatio  Akaruru.    I  know  you  are  on  the 

island,  the  boat  arrived  in  Pukapuka  last  night.  I  would  like  to  offer  my  words  of 

encouragement too.   To </span><span>you Mr Fred Goodwin, the leader of the DAP’s hard working 

</span><span>delegation on the island of Pukapuka, keep up the good work.  Sort yourselves out and 

make sure you comply in full with the Acts to stop us from going back to court again. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to the people of the Outer Islands.  Kia Orana to the people in the Southern 

Group.  I would like to encourage you and ask you to look at the programme that the 

Democratic  Alliance  Party  gave  to  you  during  the  elections.    When  the  Democratic 

</span><span>Alliance Party becomes Government on the 30</span><span>th</span><span> of next month, I would like to assure 

</span><span>you  that  help  will  come  to  you  in  the  Outer  Islands.    We  will  try  and  help  you  to 

improve yourselves. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to congratulate and to thank the Minister of Finance, the Honourable Papamama 

Pokino  for  this  Budget.    This  is  also  one  of  the reasons  why  I  wanted  to  come  into 

</span><span>Parliament.  We’ve had all kinds of problems over the last couple of years. I looked at 

</span><span>the debts we have to pay and I was very disappointed. I want to see if I could bring in 

my ideas to assist us improve the financial situation of this country. 

Again  Thank  to  the  Minister  of  Finance  for  the  Appropriation  Bill  that  he  has 

submitted to us this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  I would like to  speak on the issue of the  Fisheries.    I invite  you  all to  have a 

good  look  at  this  area  because  in  other  countries  this  is  a  very  important  industry.  

More so in developing our economy.  But in our situation we have not spent enough 

time or effort looking into this sector.  We know that we have a very large ocean and 

we  know  there  are  a  lot  of  fishing  vessels  out  there,  but  I  am  not  sure  if  they  have 

licences to fish but they are taking a lot of resources out of our waters.  So I would 

like  to  ask  the  Government  of  the  day  to  look  into  this  industry  and  try  and  do 

something about it.  

</span></div><div><span>Since the day my fishing vessel started fishing we have brought 12 tons of fish onto 

the island and all this fish was sold at the Market here in Rarotonga.  I believe that it 

would be best for this industry to export fish to the canning factory in Samoa. Such a 

venture will be suitable for the Southern Group and the Northern Group.   I would like 

to ask that we spread our resources out rather than concentrating on Tourism.  I would 

like us to look at fisheries because we know that the  fish are plentiful today.  There 

are plans for the development of this industry in Western Samoa and I am aware that 

</span><span>this is now a very important industry to have since they have lost out on the export of 

</span><span>taro. I also know that our people will be able to fish because they do not need to be 

taught to fish.  They have been fishing since time immemorial. So I would like to ask 

the  Government  of  today  to  look  into  this  so  that  we  can  start  this  venture  now.    I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>36 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>know of the existence of some people in other countries who would like to help us in 

this particular area of fisheries. To those people thinking of leaving the country today, 

I  would  like  to  ask  you  to  be  patient.    On  the  30</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  next  month  the 

Democratic Alliance Party will be the Government. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker can you ask the Honourable Members not to interrupt? 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Please  be  aware  that  this  is  the  Honourable  member’s  Maiden 

</span><span>Speech. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. TAIO:</span><span>  Before I conclude, I would like to reiterate my request to Government 

to look at the benefits of this industry to our country in the future 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you very much the Honourable Member for Akaoa.  May I 

call for the next speaker?  There appears to be none, I will now put the Question. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member for Rakahanga. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    I  was  waiting  for  some  response  from  the  Government  side,  but 

</span><span>none has come.  Kia Orana to you Mr Speaker.  I would like to congratulate you on 

becoming Speaker.  The Honourable Members on both sides of the House, Kia Orana 

The Prime Minister of today Kia Orana to  you.  I would like to congratulate you on 

your wisdom in gaining the office that you have today.  The Deputy Prime Minister, 

the former Prime Minister, Ministers and the Members of the Coalition Government 

Kia  Orana.    Kia  Orana  also  to  all  the  Members  on  our  side,  our  Leader  and  all  the 

Members, Kia Orana in the name of our Lord.  I would also like to send my greetings 

to  the  former  Speaker  of  the  House  and  also  to  the  Members  who  were  not  lucky 

enough  to  return  to  this  House.    I  greet  you  all.    I</span><span>’d  like  to  give  my  words  of 

encouragement to the “Young Guns” or “New Guns”. I was happy to hear what they 

</span><span>have said today but would like to say, </span><span>do not sit too close to the “Old Guns”!</span></div><div><span>Through you Mr Speaker I would like to send my greetings to my Island of birth, to 

my  constituency  of  Rakahanga.    To  all  the  people  on  the  island  of  Rakahanga  and 

those on the island of Rarotonga, and everywhere else outside of Rarotonga.  I send 

my greetings to you all. My thanks to my people in Rakahanga for bringing me back 

into this House.  I would like to thank my committee, my campaign manager and all 

my supporters.  I would also like to give my thanks to the Democratic Alliance Party, 

to  the  Executive,  to  our  Leader,  to  everyone  who  helped  me  in  my  pursuit  for  this 

office in the last Election.  I would like to give my thanks to some of the Cook Islands 

Party supporters on the island of Rakahanga who I believed and agreed to vote for me.  

That is why I had such a large majority and I believe in future elections they will vote 

for me.   

</span></div><div><span>I noticed that today a lot of people are not too happy and all I would like to say is to 

be patient.  What they would like to happen will eventuate, maybe on the 30</span><span>th</span><span> of next 

month, as we have been informed earlier.  Maybe we will see them look happier then. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker in Schedule 1 if we look towards the bottom of this table we see a great 

deal of money for Ministerial Support. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>37 

</span></div><div><span>We are all aware that in the past the Ministerial Support never went past the sum of 

$70,000 but today we see one Ministry, with their allocation is over $200,000 and this 

is so scary.  This is a waste of money.  If we look further down this table we see a sum 

of $120,000 for Ministerial Support.  There was never a time that I recall where more 

than $70,000 was appropriated to Ministers.  During the elections we told people that 

we would be their servants.  Is this what we pay servants?  This is one of the reasons 

why our people were so angry with us in this Parliament because we are looking after 

ourselves and forgetting all about them. 

</span></div><div><span>We all say that we would like to support the reform process.  We are also aware of the 

report  given  to  us  by  the  Commission  of  Political  Review  and  one  of  their 

recommendations was to do away with Ministerial Support altogether.  So what do we 

see in this Budget?  We see an increase, not once, not twice, not doubled but three or 

four times over the original amount.  This is the kind of  greed that we can see with 

this Coalition Government.  We can see in this Table that there is only one item that 

has remained at $70,000 but this has actually increased from a sum of maybe $53,000 

</span><span>to  $70,000  now  and  why  shouldn’t  this  money  be  used  for  the  hospitals  or  our 

</span><span>education system.  This is one of the ways that this Government is trying to waste the 

money of this country in schemes such as this. We can recall when the Prime Minister 

on  his  program  over  the  air  said  that  the  Members  of  Parliament  are  receiving 

inadequate  salaries.  What  we  have  found  out  was  that  on  the  Talkback  Radio  there 

were people who made recommendations to Cabinet that this should be cut.  So what 

we  should  be  doing  is  to  look  after  the  affairs  of  our  people,  not  Cabinet  Ministers 

looking after their own affairs rather than the interests of the people. 

</span></div><div><span>You  can  recall,  Mr  Speaker,  at  one  time  we  were  talking  about  the  Superannuation 

Scheme  and  you  were  Chairman  of  that  Committee.  The  recommendation  to  that 

Committee  has  not  been  looked  into  or  considered  since.    This  is  one  of  the  worst 

places where the taxp</span><span>ayer’s m</span><span>oney is being used, and that is to pay the pensions of the 

Members  of  Parliament.  If  only  we  had  considered  that  Report  that  you  were 

supposed to present, Mr Speaker, when you were Chairman at the time, I am sure the 

Budget will be much much lower.  Because I think, Mr Speaker, that is why they have 

in</span><span>creased  the  Minister’s  Support,</span><span>  because  they  are  not  aware  of  that  Report.    That 

Report was prepared four years ago.    

</span></div><div><span>Had  that  report  been  implemented  then  there  would  be  no  excessive  appropriation, 

and  there  would  be  enough  money  to  pay  for  the  Council  Members  of  the  Outer 

</span><span>Islands.  But I don’t know whether the Rarotonga Island Councillors have been paid. 

These  people  are  hard  workers,  really  working  for  their  positions  but  I  don’t  know 

</span><span>whether </span><span>they have received their payments yet. Mr Speaker, I don’t know whether the 

</span><span>wages  have  been  paid  but  there  are  other  areas  in  the  Outer  Islands  that  need  to  be 

supported financially by Government.  The projects are not being dealt with because 

of  lack  of  finance  but  the  money  that  should  have  been  used  for  those  purposes  is 

diverted to increase Ministerial Support. 

</span></div><div><span>In  the  last  few  days  there  was  an  article  in  the  paper  where  this  Government  has 

ordered  the  Police  Department  to  try  and  find  out  how  they  can  get  something  out 

from the people opposing the Democratic Alliance Party candidate.  The day before 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>38 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>yesterday, maybe it was another day, a flight was chartered by Government to go to 

</span><span>the  island  of  Pukapuka.    I  don’t  kno</span><span>w  why?    Maybe  some  of  the  money  in  these 

allocations  will  be  used  for  that  purpose.    Maybe  the  Government  has  paid  for  the 

</span><span>flight for the Cook Islands Party to go there, but I’m not sure.</span></div><div><span>During  the  Island  Council  election  on  the  island  of  Pukapuka,  there  was  a  flight 

chartered to go out there because the Member that has been elected into the position 

of Island Councillor was not a Cook Islands Party Member.  Maybe that is why they 

sent that plane over there now. 

</span></div><div><span>May I issue a word of caution to the Minister responsible not t allow any  misuse of 

public  money  but  to  make  sure  that  he  takes  full  control  and  management  of  the 

public  purse.    This  is  the  reason  why  we  have  gone  into  this  financial  crisis  in  our 

</span><span>country, we waste the people’s money.</span></div><div><span>I  acknowledge  the  views  raised  by  the  Honourable  Member  from  Aitutaki.    This  is 

one thing I acknowledge about the new Members.  They have a purpose in here, and 

that is to ensure that the interests of the people  is number one. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  now  call  on  the  Honourable 

Member for Nikao-Panama. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS  N.  MUNOKOA:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Clerk  and  also  to  all 

staff members in Parliament.  Greetings to you all today.  Greetings to the Honourable 

Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to our Papa, the Honourable Sir Geoffrey 

Henry and to Cabinet Ministers.  To all Members on the Government side </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings 

to you all.  Greetings to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Deputy Leader of the 

Opposition,  to  all  Honourable  Members  on  the  Opposition  Bench  and  to  the 

Honourable Member, Maria Heather, my friend, Greetings to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  may  I  extend  to  my  electorate  a  word  of  Greetings.    Greetings  to  the 

Pastor in  the village and to  the Assistant  Pastor and  your wives.  The Pu Tapere, to 

our  senior  citizens  in  the  village  of  Nikao  and  to  our  young  couples,  and  to  our 

children,  and  to  our  little  ones  </span><span>–</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  all.  The  European  and  the  locals, 

Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like at this time to give my support to the Budget and to the views aired by 

the various speakers before me.  I believe and I also know, Mr Speaker, that some of 

the Ministries are waiting on us to debate and pass this Budget and I am really waiting 

for the time when we have to go through the Bill.  That is when I will decide to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to say thank you to the Private sector as well as the consumers who 

have contributed a lot to the revenue that we have earned.  Because we must all accept 

the fact that every time we buy a tin of food from the shelves you are paying tax. So 

this should be our prime purpose.  That is to  ensure that we hold the interest of our 

people as first priority.  We must encourage them to stay in our country because they 

</span><span>are  the  major  contributors  as  consumers  to  our  revenue.    There’s  no  use  in  havi</span><span>ng 

</span><span>businesses around on each of the islands and we don’t have the people to buy.   There 

</span><span>are some lucky people around the place where they can export their products from the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>39 

</span></div><div><span>Cook Islands.  But for those who are unfortunate, they have to sell their products here 

on the island.  

</span></div><div><span>There are many ways to support our country.  A lot depends on the youth of the Cook 

Islands. I would try and discourage you people from living our country.  Please, stay 

in our country in order that we may have people there to get the support that we need 

to rebuild this country.    

</span></div><div><span>Before I sit down, I would like at this time to give my thanks to my Chairman who 

really  worked  hard  in  my  constituency  at  the  time  of  the  Election,  and  to  all  the 

Committee.  Thank you to the people for the confident that you have put in me. Now I 

am able to carry out the work of our village for the next 5 years.  To me, I work for 

everybody in my constituency.  I accepted the responsibility to serve my people to the 

best of my ability.   So I would like to say to the Government, please let us try and 

work  together.      There  are  only  12  of  you  on  your  side  and  12  of  us  on  our  side. 

Regardless  of  colour  we  should  all  be  working  together  for  the  benefit  our  people.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    I  now  call  on  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member for Titikaveka. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  R.  WIGMORE:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker. 

Greetings  to  the  Clerk  of  the  House  and  your  staff.    Greetings  also  to  the  Prime 

Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  and  to  the  Members  of 

Government.  To  the  Ministers,  Kia  Orana.    Greetings  also  to  the  Leader  of  the 

Democratic Alliance Party and to all  the Members on our side.   

</span></div><div><span>Through you Mr Speaker, if I may at this time speak to my people in my constituency, 

Titikaveka.    Greetings  to  all  title  holders  in  the  village  of  Titikaveka.    To  all  the 

various  church  organisations  and  to  all  the  people,  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    To  the 

traditional  leaders  in  the  village  of  Temurimotia,      to  all  the  people,  dignitaries  or 

otherwise, Greetings to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  extend  my  Aroa  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Democratic 

Alliance  Party  in  Titikaveka,  to  the  Secretary  and  to  all  Office  Bearers  and  the 

Committee Members of the Democratic Alliance Party, Kia Orana.  To the people of 

Titikaveka, Greetings.  Whatever political party you are affiliated to, I would like to 

extend  to  you  all  as  one  people  of  Titikaveka  a  big  Kia  Orana.  Thank  you  for  the 

confidence that you have in me to represent your interests in this Honourable House, 

to be your representative for the next 5 years.   

</span></div><div><span>At  this  time  Mr  Speaker  may  I  convey  words  of  condolences  to  a  family  who  have 

had  problems  this  morning.    To  Mama  Moe  Tukurangi  who  lost  everything  in  her 

house that was gutted by fire, I would just like to encourage you all.   There will be a 

radiothon  tonight  at  9.00  p.m.  An  appeal  to  support  this  family  who  have  lost 

everything - gutted by fire.  Through you Mr Speaker, the village people of Titikaveka 

</span><span>are prepared to give their support to this family.  So my challenge to you is that we go 

</span><span>for a $ to a $.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>40 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>At  this  time,  I  wish  to  comment  on  the  Budget  submitted  to  this  House  by  the 

Minister  in  Charge  and  for  his  presentation  this  afternoon.    When  we  look  at  our 

Budget for last year we have a surplus.  So I would like to challenge us in this House 

to  try  and  manage  our  finance  in  order  for  us  to  have  a  surplus  of  over  $5  million.  

There are some areas in our budget allocation that I am not very supportive and there 

are  some  which  I  am  supporting.      We  have  heard  the  Honourable  Member  Teina 

Bishop  who  spoke  earlier  from  Aitutaki.  I  really  appreciated  his  views  and  I  am 

behind all that he has said. 

</span></div><div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  heard  the  views  of  people  from  the  private  sectors  who 

have  contributed  much  to  our  revenue.    I  also  would  like  to  show  my  appreciation 

because  when  I  look  around  the  people  in  this  House,  we  have  people  who  are 

business  minded.      We  must  try  and  understand  Mr  Speaker  that  in  running  any 

project, we must run  it  like a business.  So I will speak mainly on a subject that I am 

very familiar with and that is Agriculture.   

</span></div><div><span>Although  there  is  an  increase  in  the  Budget  allocation  for  the  Department  of 

Agriculture, in my observation this increase is not enough.  Because I am certain that 

</span><span>you  will  agree  with  me  Honorable  Members  that  this  is  one  department  not  many 

</span><span>people can say - has not had many problems in the last 10 years.  This Department has 

been  likened  to  a  sick  patient.  This  is  why  I  said  earlier  that  the  allocation  for 

Agriculture is not sufficient.  I believe that this is one of the sectors, Mr Speaker, that 

we can use to turn our economy around, that is Agriculture. Agriculture on Rarotonga 

and  the  Outer  Islands.    Maybe  the  Members  will  ask,  what  are  these  areas  that  we 

need to develop?  Because we all know Honourable Members that there are a lot of 

divisions in this Ministry on the island of Rarotonga as well as in the Outer Islands.  I 

think  I  can  recall  correctly,  Mr  Speaker,  that  we  used  to  enjoy  the  profits  from  our 

produce marketed overseas. Not long ago, the export quantity slummed to its lowest 

ever experienced.  Maybe Honourable Members we would say that our people are just 

lazy.    On  one  hand  maybe  this  could  be  correct  because  in  some  cases  we  are  not 

working hard.  Overall however, we work extremely well.  The problem is that when 

we  work,  we  all  work  so  hard  that  when  it  comes  to  a  time,  we  all  sit  back  and  do 

nothing.    I  am  inclined  to  believe  that  because  of  the  New  Zealand  legislation 

covering  exports  to  New  Zealand  we  were  not  able  to  utilise  our  potential  to  the 

maximum.  

</span></div><div><span>I want the Members to know that I was a driving force behind the investigations into 

why we were not able to export many  fruits to  New Zealand.  I believe we can all 

remember the day that we were able to send our pawpaws to New Zealand.  We used 

to  treat  them  with  chemicals.  For  7  years  now  our  pawpaws  are  being  heat  treated. 

What  should  have  happened  was  for  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  to  look  into  the 

possibility of exporting fruits like mangoes to New Zealand years ago. This however 

did  not  happen  and  it  was  not  until  March  of  last  year  that  we  resumed  Mangoes 

exports back to the New Zealand market.  

</span></div><div><span> In other areas, we have eggplants and capsicum that need to be exported. However, 

</span><span>we  need  to  open  up  the  market  first.  We  need  to  negotiate  with  the  New  Zealand 

</span><span>market.    I  was  surprised,  Mr  Speaker  when  I  heard  the  Minister  of  Agriculture 

mentioning on television that we can send our capsicum to  New Zealand.   I am  not 

certain  whether an agreement is  in place between the Governments  of New Zealand 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>41 

</span></div><div><span>and the Cook Islands.  The Ministry of Agriculture needs to put in place the necessary 

arrangements  to  allow  us  to  market.    A  lot  of  the  crops  we  could  have  marketed  to 

New Zealand for their winter is now rather too late because New Zealand is ending its 

winter season now. Although we are moving to the end of the winter market in New 

Zealand for this year we should work towards the winter market of next year.   

</span></div><div><span>The reason I have brought this up Mr Speaker is that I would like to warn our people 

that the local market has dwindled quite significantly.  It would be a waste of time to 

target our people because a lot of consumers have left our shores.  Pawpaw used to be 

an  excellent  export  commodity  to  help  us  out  of  the  financial  constraints  we  came 

through.  But over the past couple of years we have seen a decline in the supply and 

also in the demand for this fruit.   I would like to ask the Department of Agriculture to 

look at this area.  We have a Nita Association but I believe the Ministry of Agriculture 

can  assist  them  in  dealing  with  the  formalities.  Together  with  the  Department  of 

Agriculture,  the  planters  must  work  together  to  bring  this  crop  back  to  its  former 

status.  We are all aware that today the quota for pawpaw has been opened up and the 

nita  growers  can  now  export  all  their  produce.        There  are  other  areas  that 

Government  can  help  with  this  fruit.  I  am  not  asking  that  Government  give  a  lot  of 

</span><span>money to help but to see how best we could analyse and arrest the problems relating 

</span><span>to the formalities.  I think we all understand that any new money we can bring into the 

country will add to the revival of our economy.  Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Are there any further speakers?  The Member for Vaipae-Tautu. 

</span></div><div><span>MR K. IOANE: </span><span>Thank you for this opportunity Mr Speaker.  I am very pleased Mr 

Speaker that you are in this Office and I trust that you will be a very good Speaker.  I 

would like to thank you Mr Speaker because we are finishing at 5 p.m. this afternoon 

you will give me a very long period to speak.  To the Clerk of this House and to all 

your staff members, Kia Orana to you all.  To the Prime Minister, to your Deputy and 

to our former Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>To all the Ministers of Cabinet and to all Members in Government today </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana 

to  you  all.    To  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  to  the  Deputy  Leader  and  to  all  of  us 

Members in Opposition </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord.  Kia Orana to all the 

people of the Cook Islands listening in to our deliberations this afternoon.  From the 

titled people right down to all our children.  To the people on the island of Araura, to 

the title holders and to our children </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  four  Ariki  on  the  island,  to  the  Mayor  of  the  island  and  to  all  Island 

Councillors - Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord.  To my constituency of Nga-Vaitau, 

that  is  Vaipae,  Vaipeka  and  Tautu  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana  to  you  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    I 

believe  that  we  should  not  politicise  the  developments  in  or  constituency  anymore 

because although we had a lot of political infighting during the elections, I think it is 

time  to  put  those  behind  us.  Let  us  reunite  ourselves  and  work  together  as  a 

community.    To  my  two  colleagues  who  contested  this  seat  with  me,  Tiraa  and 

Tuakura Tuakura </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you two in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>To  my  Committee  in  my  constituency.    The  Patron,  the  Chairman  and  to  all 

Committee  Members  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana  to  you  all  in  the  name  of  Our  Lord.    Thank  you 

very much for all your support. Thank you for your confidence, for your belief that I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 22</a></div><div><span>42 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>would be the best representative for our constituency.  I would also like to thank all 

those people who voted for me, for your confidence in me.  For believing in me to be 

your voice,  your Member </span><span>of Parliament in this House.  If there are people I haven’t 

</span><span>congratulated personally I would like to thank you and congratulate you at this time. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Executive  members  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  on  the  island  of 

Rarotonga;  the Chairman the Committee Members and also the lawyers who worked 

very hard during the period after the elections.  Thank you very much.  Maybe if you 

</span><span>hadn’t done your job well, I might not have been in Parliament tod</span><span>ay. 

</span></div><div><span>I will come back now Mr Speaker to the Budget.  I have looked through our Budget 

and  I think we have  a  good Budget.     However,  I am  hoping that the Ministers and 

Government will implement our Budget properly.   

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  special  concern  and  that  is  the  Hospital  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki.    I  know 

there  have  been  a  lot  of  problems  with  pharmaceuticals,  drugs  and  other  related 

problems  on  the  island  in  the  past.    I  would  like  to  invite  the  Minister  of  Health  to 

review the situations in the Outer Islands and avoid any more recurrence of the past. 

</span><span>Remember the people in the Outer Islands, as you serve the people here in Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>We  heard  the  Honourable  Member,  Robert  Wigmore  express  his  concern  about  our 

people moving out of the country. I think this is an area that we the Members of this 

House must analyse carefully.  Initiatives must be put in place to alleviate the outward 

migration of our people.  By providing incentives for our people to remain here in the 

Cook Islands it will benefit our businesses, the labour force, the tax revenue and the 

overall situation here in the country. 

</span></div><div><span>These are my thoughts for the time being, Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much for this 

opportunity to register my views. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you for your maiden speech Honourable Member.  Are there 

any further speakers?  The Honourable Member for Manihiki. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  Kia Orana to you this afternoon, Mr Speaker.  To all the staff 

of  Parliament,  to  the  Clerk,  to  the  Typists  and  also  to  the  Interpreters  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana.  

Kia Orana  also  to  the Honourable Members of this House.  Kia  Orana to the Prime 

Minister,  to  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  to  the  Cabinet  Ministers  and  also  to  all 

Honourable Members of this House.  A special Kia Orana to us, the Members on the 

Opposition  bench.    We  look  so  good  on  this  side.    We  look  so  good,  Mr  Speaker, 

because we are all in a straight line and the way that we govern will be in a straight 

line.  To our  Leader, to  all the Members of our  caucus  and to  your loved ones,  Kia 

Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Through  you  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  greetings  to  the  Manihikian 

people on Rarotonga, on the island of Manihiki, on the island of Penrhyn and also on 

the island of Rakahanga.  Kia Orana to you all in the name of Our Lord. I am aware 

</span><span>that you are not able  to receive our debate over the  radio clearly.  So I waited until 

</span><span>this time of the day before taking the floor because I know that around about this time 

you  have  a  better  reception.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Mayor  on  the  island,  to  the  Island 

Councillors, to the Government Representative, to all Government workers, to all the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 23</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>43 

</span></div><div><span>people on the island, to the elderly people, to all the children </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to you all in 

the name of Our Lord. Kia Orana also to my friend on the island of Te Ulu-o-te-Watu, 

to  my  colleague  Tiki  Wuatai.    Kia  Orana  also  to  the  President  of  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party and the delegation that you have lead to the island of Pukapuka </span><span>–</span><span> Kia 

Orana to you all.  A very special Kia Orana to all the people of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to offer you my personal congratulations for being elected as 

the Honourable Speaker of this House.  We all know your political background, your 

history and I trust that you will uphold the seat of Speaker of the House with integrity 

and without being bias. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  I have to interrupt you Honourable Member.  It is time to adjourn 

for today.  Before we adjourn I would like to thank all the new Members for all the 

good  speeches  that  you  have  made.    And  secondly,  tomorrow  after  our  Parliament 

Sitting we will have our AGM for the CPA.   

</span></div><div><span>It is time to adjourn and I would like to ask an Honourable Member to close us with a 

prayer please.
