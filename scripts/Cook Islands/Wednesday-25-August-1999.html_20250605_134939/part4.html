<div><span>ORDERS OF THE DAY 

</span></div><div><span>Appropriation Bill and I call upon the Minister of Finance for the Second Reading of 

the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Greetings to you Mr Speaker and to all 

your staff members. 

</span></div><div><span>First of all I would like to congratulate  you Mr Speaker for attaining the seat of the 

Speaker of Parliament.  Greetings to all Honourable Members in the House and also 

to our people who are listening to our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the 1999/2000 Appropriation Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Appropriation Bill  marks a  milestone for the restructuring program 

</span><span>that this Government has implemented over the past three years. 

</span></div><div><span>I am delighted, Mr Speaker, to be able to announce a surplus of approximately $2.5 

million  from  operations  for  the  1998/99  year.    Not  only  this,  Mr  Speaker,  but  I  am 

also  able to  announce that  during the 1999/2000 period, the  Government will spend 

over $3.2 million on infrastructure and assets funded from our own resources. 

</span></div><div><span>An  impossible  dream  only  three  years  ago  and  showing  the  first  benefits  from  the 

hard decisions we were forced to take in 1996. 

</span></div><div><span>The improvement in the economy over this short period is a credit to all those both in 

the  public  and  private  sector  who  have  worked  to  make  the  reform  a  reality.    I  am 

proud to  be part of this  Government  that  had the courage and perseverance to  drive 

through  the  necessary  reforms  even  though  many  of  the  actions  taken  were 

unpalatable to us. 

</span></div><div><span>Our achievements have not been without cost.  It was heartbreaking for us to have to 

take the necessary steps to restore our economy to a sound basis in the knowledge that 

it would lead to the suffering of many of our people.  It is unfortunate that our success 

in restoring the economy to a sounder basis has not immediately been reflected in an 

improvement in the daily lives of our people.  However, what is certain is that if we 

had not taken the difficult steps that we did, then life for most people today would be 

far worse than it is and we would be facing a grim future. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, Government is sensitive to the position of our people.  It realises that the 

success  of  the  reforms  has  been  at  a  significant  cost  to  our  people.    This  budget, 

therefore, does not  use the improvement in  our  position solely for the repayment  of 

</span><span>debt although this must remain an important part of our planning for the foreseeable 

</span><span>future.    This  budget  provides  tangible  evidence  that  the  economy  has  improved  and 

that the benefits are shared by all.  There are in this budget significant increases for 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>24 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>social equity expenditures in line with our “five</span><span>point plan for economic growth” that 

</span><span>set out our goals for recovery in 1996. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Budget,  Mr  Speaker,  is  based  on  Crown  Revenues  from  all  sources  except 

overseas  aid  of  $48.6  million  compared  to  the  budget  of  $43  million  and  the  actual 

revenue  of  $44.8  million  for  1998/99.    The  main  increases  being  import  levies, 

company and income tax. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Appropriation  Bill  has  an  increase  of  $10.8  million  in  expenditure  to  $56.8 

million.  Of this increase $4 million is for expenditure relating to Asian Development 

Bank  loans  for  Education  and  Solid  Waste  Management  projects  that  in  previous 

years were treated inappropriately as Aid.  $1 million  is  for capital  expenditure that 

Ministries previously used depreciation to fund.  This is the first budget to separately 

show capital expenditure in the Appropriation Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>While  there  are  many  variances  the  real  increase  in  expenditure  is  $7.4  million  of 

which  $3.2  million  is  for  major  infrastructural  assets  and  $4.2  million  for  increased 

Ministry  expenses.    This  increase  is  partly  offset  by  the  use  of  $1.7  million  of  the 

</span><span>1998/99 surplus for the major capital expenditure. 

</span></div><div><span>There  are ongoing increases in  expenditure for  Education, Health, Welfare, Cultural 

Development and Environmental Protection.  In addition, there is a major increase in 

expenditure  for  infrastructure,  assets  so  essential  if  Tourism  is  to  remain  our  major 

sources of revenue. 

</span></div><div><span>Tourism is essential for the ongoing growth of our economy and in recognition of this, 

the vote for Tourism has been increased  by $500,000 </span><span>–</span><span> a 25% increase on the amount 

allocated in 1998/99.  While we would like to increase the expenditure on Tourism by 

an even greater amount we believe that this increase will have a significant influence 

and will build on the increased tourism numbers achieved during the last ten months. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  planned  to  be  a  review  of  Education  and  Health  during  the  coming  year.  

However, we are not waiting until these reviews have been completed.  In recognition 

of the importance of these two areas increases of 16% and 13% respective have been 

provided for in the budget. 

</span></div><div><span>The government is very appreciative of the Asian Development Bank for the loan that 

provided additional resources for Education.  This budget provides funds to maintain 

the level of learning resources that the loan was able to provide.  I am also pleased to 

announce that phase two of the new teachers salary scale will be implemented during 

1999/2000 as promised. 

</span></div><div><span>More  trainee  nurses  and  specialist  personnel  are  provided  for  in  the  Health  budget.  

More  importantly  in  the  area  of  pharmaceutical  supplies,  laboratory  stores  and 

consumables  Government  has  provided  a  significant  increase  so  that  the  problems 

encountered  in  1998/99,  particularly  in  the  outer  islands,  will  not  be  repeated  in 

</span><span>1999/2000. 

</span></div><div><span>Expenditure  on  the  Environment  in  1998/99  increased  to  $443,000  and  has  been 

further increased to $516,000 in this budget.  Priority has been placed on the revision 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>25 

</span></div><div><span>and design of a national environmental framework, strengthening the Environmental 

Impact  Assessment  strategies;  Education  and  Awareness,  and  most  importantly  a 

more efficient and effective management of our environment. 

</span></div><div><span>For many years maintenance of Government Buildings has tended to be ignored.  In 

this budget the first steps have been taken to implement an ongoing maintenance and 

basic  maintenance  of  Government  buildings.    In  future  years  a  system  where 

Ministries will be required to pay market rents for the premises they occupy will be 

developed so that the buildings can be properly maintained and so that Ministries will 

better appreciate the value of the assets they use. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Government  recognises  that  the  Airport  Authority  requires  additional  funds  to 

maintain the assets  and  safety measures so  necessary for the  airport.    In this budget 

the proportion of the Departure Tax paid to the Airport Authority has been increased 

from  $200,000  to  $300,000.    Further  increases  will  be  made  as  the  economy 

improves.    A  first  class  airport  and  services  are  essential  for  the  maintenance  and 

growth of Tourism. 

</span></div><div><span>At the present time the utility companies provide services for the country such as fire 

</span><span>services  and  street  lighting.    These  are  reflected  in  a  lower  return  from  the  utility 

companies  and  the  provision  of  inadequate  reserves  for  the  replacement  of  assets 

when they come to  the  end of their useful life.   Provision  for the payment  of social 

costs  is  shown  on  the  Statement  of  Fiscal  Responsibility  but  no  funds  have  been 

allocated in this budget.  Work is still being carried out to determine the appropriate 

cost  for  these  services  with  the  intention  of  making  provision  for  them  in  future 

budgets so that Government assets can be properly maintained. 

</span></div><div><span>This  budget,  Mr  Speaker,  with  its  emphasis  on  social  equity  expenditure  and 

infrastructural  assets demonstrates the  success  of the reforms and provides evidence 

that the difficult decisions this Government had the courage to make are leading to a 

better economy and an improved standard of living for our people.  We acknowledge 

with appreciation the very real contribution that the public and private sector and all 

of our people have made to achieve this success. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Government,  Mr  Speaker,  has  not  lost  sight  of  the  need  to  reduce  debt.    It  is 

committed  to  meeting  all  our  debt  commitments  particularly  our  commitments 

resulting  from  the  Manila  debt  restructuring.    This  budget  provides  for  all  our  debt 

requirements  during  1999/2000  to  be  met  and  in  addition  for  the  repayment  of  the 

mortgages  on  the  New  Zealand  properties.    We  will  not  lose  sight  of  the  need  to 

reduce our heaving debt burden and as the economy continues to grow and resources 

become available further provision will be made for additional debt repayment. 

</span></div><div><span>This  Government  remains  committed  to  continuing  the  reform  process  and  the  tight 

financial  management  of  the  past  three  years  but  just  as  resolutely  we  remain 

committed  to  investing  in  the  Security,  Health  and  Education  of  our  people  as 

resources permit. 

</span></div><div><span>Reform is a continuing process.  We must continually adapt our policies and systems 

in  an  evolutionary  way  to  changing  circumstances  and  to  reduce  the  need  for  crisis 

management.  In other words action should be taken before a crisis happens and not 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>26 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>afterwards.  We will continue to  promote better government  with  effective controls, 

transparency, and accountability. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, this Government remains committed to these ideals.  It is committed to 

good leadership.  It is committed to the principles of good Government.  Mr Speaker, 

I have much pleasure in moving: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Appropriation Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>And in conclusion, I wish Inatio Akaruru all the best in the forthcoming By-Election 

and to let him know  his seat in this House is still here. Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Mr Minister of Finance. I now call for a Seconder.   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Mii Parima Member for Tamarua. 

</span></div><div><span>The Motion is:  

</span></div><div><span>That the 1999-2000 Appropriate Bill be now Read a Second time. 

</span></div><div><span> And before I call for speakers to the Motion, I wish to remind Honourable Members 

of Standing Orders 298 (2), last sentence; </span><span>“…Debate thereon shall be confined to the 

financial  and  economic  state  of  the  Cook  Islands  and  the  Government’s  financial 

policy.”  Just a gentle reminder Honourable Members.</span></div><div><span>There appears to be none.  The Leader of the Opposition, the Honourable Dr Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.  Mr  Speaker,  one  of  these 

microphones is sick and needs some medi</span><span>cation.  Now I can’t really say</span><span> whether the 

Minister of Finance is going to buy a new one although he seems to be boasting about 

this package.  However, Mr Speaker, I would like to give you my congratulations. I 

thought you said you were going to retire, but congratulations to you for attaining this 

very high office.   

</span></div><div><span>To all the Honourable Members and to our people listening in, Kia Orana.  Because I 

was not able, Mr Speaker, to send my greetings to my Electorate the last time we met 

I would like now Mr Speaker through you to do so.  I would like to send my greetings 

to  the  Ui  Ariki,  Pa-ma-Kainuku,  to  all  their  people  and  also  the  religious 

organisations, to the Pastors and to all the Deacons and Ekalesia in my Electorate, Kia 

Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  greet  the  Youth  Organisations  in  my  constituency,  the  sports  and 

</span><span>women’s  organisations  and  all  of  the  people  in  my  cons</span><span>tituency.  Especially  to  my 

Committee. Thank you for believing in me. Thank you for bringing me back into this 

House.  To  my  very  hard  working  President,  Fred  Goodwin,  who  has  gone  to  the 

</span><span>Island of Pukapuka and  your  hardworking team  with you, Kia Orana. I would like to 

</span><span>encourage  you  in  the  task  you  have  set  yourselves.  To  Mr  Tiaki  Wuatai  the 

Democratic Alliance Party  champion and  your Committee and all the people on the 

Island of Pukapuka I send you my greeting.   To the people on the Island of Nassau, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>27 

</span></div><div><span>Kia  Orana.  I  ask  you  not  to  worry  about  these  people  who  are  trying  to  use  scare 

tactics  to  get  you  to  join  them.    I  have  also  read  your  actions  in  the  newspaper. 

Unfortunately, these people have forced you to take that position. 

</span></div><div><span>To my friend Mr Inatio Akaruru, I think it is time for you to retire.  I believe if you 

are not successful in this race, I think you will believe it is time to retire.  To all the 

supporters  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  on  the  island  of  Rarotonga,  the  Outer 

Islands and overseas, I extend to you my special Kia Orana.  I thank you for the high 

standards  you  maintained  thus  far  in  our  Party.    I  think,  had  we  been  a  little  more 

serious in  the last election there would have been  a landslide victory to  us.  But we 

were  not  serious  enough.  Nevertheless  we  have  achieved  a  large  part  of  our 

objectives.   

</span></div><div><span>At this juncture, I would like to send greetings to the supporters of the Cook Islands 

Party and the New Alliance Party.  I invite everyone to work together.  Let us live in   

peace  and  harmony.    The  Elections  are  over.      And  I  believe  we  should  leave  our 

politics  aside. At the same time, Mr Speaker,  I  want  it known that my  plan was   to 

wait    for  everything  related  to    the  Elections  to  be    settled  and    then  asses    our 

</span><span>potential  partners  who  would  go  into  coalition  with  us.    But  my  colleague  Hon. 

</span><span>Norman George and Sir Geoffrey Henry were too quick and confirmed their alliance 

before the Petitions were dealt with by the Court.  So I would like to ask at this point 

in time whether this partnership is working or not?   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  worried  Mr  Speaker.  We  have  this  Appropriation  that  the  Minister  of  Finance 

has presented to  us but  we know that over the last  couple of weeks the  Honourable 

Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have been on the Political Frontline. I am 

worried that maybe what the Honourable Minister of Finance is trying to do might not 

work after all. 

</span></div><div><span>I am also worried to hear the people moaning about all these embassies that are going 

to  be  set  up  in  countries  all  over  the  world.    A  lot  of  money  will  be  involved,  Mr 

Speaker.  We need money to set up embassies in these countries.  So I would like to 

ask  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  to  withdraw  that  policy  because  the  only  thing 

these embassies will be doing is to campaign fo</span><span>r him and we don’t want that drain on 

</span><span>the public coffer. 

</span></div><div><span>I  am  quite  certain  that  the  Honourable  Member  for  Aitutaki,  the  Honourable  Paora 

Teiti will not be happy with all this money that will be spent.  Such expenses could be 

directed to improve our hospitals or the health and education.  Even the infrastructure 

of our country needs addressing 

</span></div><div><span>I  know  that  people  are  complaining  about  the  Prime  Minister,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Joseph Williams and the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Norman George who is 

the Leader of the NAP.  I know they are concerned about the way they are leading our 

country  and  the  people  are  afraid  that  they  might  cause  more  damage  to  this  nation 

than  good.  Particularly  in  view  of  this  good  Budget  by  the  Minister  of  Finance,  the 

</span><span>Honourable Papamama Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  register  my  support  for  the  Reform  Process.  I  am  concerned,  Mr 

Speaker, that if this Coalition Government is going to continue in the direction we are 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>28 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>heading, the message from the Minister of Finance will be meaningless.  The surplus 

of  two  and  a  half  million  dollars  may  disappear  before  we  reach  the  end  of  this 

financial year.  However, I would just like to remind the Minister of Finance that in 

the last Supplementary Budget I know that there was supposed to be a deficit of about 

$500,000.  The deficit was supposed to be half a million dollars but as it turned out 

this Budget is two and a half million dollars surplus. Which means, Mr Speaker, they 

did not do their home work properly. The hard work by the private sector in fact paid 

off.  Over the last couple of years we all worked hard in order to realise a savings of 

two and a half million dollars.  Yet, they predicted a half a million dollars deficit. 

</span></div><div><span>I  agree,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the  investment  we  placed  into  Tourism  has  achieved  its 

goals.    We  believe  in  Tourism  Mr  Speaker.    In  our  policy  we  have  emphasised  the 

point that if you invest in tourism you will get twenty times more for every dollar. I 

see from the comments made by the Minister of Finance indicated a continued effort 

to  invest in  Tourism and  I  am  very pleased with  that intention, Mr Speaker. That  is 

exactly what  our policy  talks about.    I support the Minister Mr Speaker.  Tourism is 

the main revenue earner for this country. 

</span></div><div><span>But  I must say  Mr Speaker, that  I  am  not  satisfied with  some of the Appropriations 

</span><span>that  this  Coalition  Government  is  making.    For  example  there  is  an  increase  in  the 

Office  Support  for  </span><span>each  Minister.    I  note  that  each  Minister’s  Ministerial  Support 

</span><span>averaged  something  like  $130,000.    Above  all  that,  you  will  find  that  the  Deputy 

Prime Minister has almost got quarter of a million dollars for his office alone.  Now I 

know where we can best use that money. The Health, Education and Infrastructure are 

the more important areas where that money should be spent. 

</span></div><div><span>I have run out of time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Yes, your time is up.  Are there 

any  further  speakers?    I  call  on  the  Honourable  Member,  for  Arutanga,  Reureu  and 

Nikaupara for your maiden speech in Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. BISHOP:</span><span> Kia Orana, Mr Speaker and congratulations to you for attaining the 

position of Speaker for this  House.   First  of all, Mr Speaker, before  I speak on the 

Appropriation Bill before the House, allow me to extend a few words of greetings to 

our people.   

</span></div><div><span>First, to the Clerk and all the staff members of Parliament. Greetings to you all in the 

love of God.  To the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, to the Honourable 

Sir Geoffrey Henry and to all Honourable Members in the Coalition </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings. To 

the  Opposition  members,  Kia  Orana.  Greetings  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 

Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate, to all your colleagues, Greetings to you all in the love 

of God.  Greetings also to us the new Members, we are newly elected into this House. 

Kia Orana to you all.   

</span></div><div><span>To our friend, Inatio Akaruru on his way to Pukapuka.  For sure if you work hard you 

</span><span>will  come  back  and  take  up  your  seat.    To  our  people  who  are  listening  in  to  our 

</span><span>debate this afternoon, both in the North and the Southern Groups </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you 

all.  To the four Ariki on the island of Aitutaki, Vaka Mataiapo and to the people of 

Aitutaki and to our children </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all.  To all the religious organisations 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August 1999 

</span></div><div><span>29 

</span></div><div><span>on  the  island  of  Aitutaki,  to  the  Mayor  and  Deputy  Mayor  and  to  all  Island 

Councillors  on  the  island  of  Aitutaki  </span><span>–</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  all.    To  the  Government 

Representative and Chief Executive Officer and Government workers.  I hope you are 

all  playing  your  parts  for  the  benefit  of  all  our  people.    To  the  people  in  my  own 

electorate  of  Arutanga,  Reureu  and  Nikaupara,  to  supporters  of  the  NAP,  DAP  and  

the CIP  </span><span>–</span><span> Greetings to you all.  I believe you have taken off your political coats and 

have  donned  your  working  clothes  to  pull  rimu  or  sea  grapes  as  well  as  the  other 

activities  we  need  to  do  to  assist  the  economic  situations  on  the  island.  We  must 

continue  our  efforts  in  planting  </span><span>maniota</span><span>.    I  believe  </span><span>that  you’re  ready  to  send  those 

</span><span>crabs from Aitutaki. Feed the tupa properly before you send them over to Rarotonga. 

To  all  those  people  in  the  business  sector  in  Aitutaki,  Kia  Orana.    Now,  we  are 

debating  the  Appropriation  Bill.    We  are  talking  about  the  money  you  raised  as 

revenue for the country. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, if I may come back to the Budget.  Firstly I would like to support the 

statement made by the Minister of Finance with regard to the situation of the Budget. 

I believe this is the result of the reform that we have done over the last three  years.  

Today we see an increase in our Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>I also wish to register my support for the continuation of the reform. I like this Budget 

Mr Speaker because it sounds responsible. The Minister and the Financial Secretary 

has  taken  the  responsibility  of  stating  if  </span><span>I  may  quote  in  their  statement:    “That  the 

</span><span>overall  responsibility  and  inte</span><span>rgrity  of  the  Budget  is  theirs”</span><span>  In  other  words,  if 

something goes wrong with this Budget we have a target to shoot.  And I also feel that 

it  is  responsible  because  the  Budget  complies  with  the  Section  24  of  the  FEM  Act, 

especially in regards to the statement which says that the expenditure is less than the 

expected revenue of the budget.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker we must also appreciate the contribution to the budget that has been given 

by the Heads of Ministries and assisted by their Ministers.  I hear  the Leader of the 

</span><span>Opposition saying that he is worried about the Reform.  I’d like to assure the Leader 

</span><span>of the Opposition that as part of the Coalition Government, that I and this Government 

is  committed  to  the  Reform  process.  After  all,  we  are  the  initiators  of  this  Reform 

programme.  I also hear from him saying that the surplus is due to the contributions of 

the  Business  Sector.    Mr  Speaker,  my  understanding  of  a  business  is  that,  when 

</span><span>there’s a surplus it is because of the wise spending of that person o</span><span>r that business.  In 

this case, I believe it is the wise spending of the Government that gave us the surplus 

</span><span>of $2.5 million.  He’s also concern about the Embassy Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, let 

</span><span>me  remind  all  Honourable  Members  that  there  is  no  allocation  in  this  budget  for 

Embassies as far as I am concerned.  I believe, in accordance to the Prime Minister, 

that if there is any embassies to be established, it will happen with no cost to us.   

</span></div><div><span>May I Mr Speaker refer us to the First Schedule of the budget, page 11 where a table 

of the gross domestic product shows what I just said.  That table clearly states the fact 

that the change in our financial status is due to the Reform.  The hard decisions that 

we made since the meeting in  the National  Auditorium  - where the people from  the 

</span><span>Opposition,  business  community,  the  church  leaders,  where  all  involved  in  that 

</span><span>meeting  established  a  path  way  to  economic  recovery.    Mr  Speaker,  I’m  sure  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member from Titikaveka will join me in saying that it was at that meeting 

that  the  difference  was  started.    I  hope  this  country  will  never  have  such  a  meeting

</span></div><div><span>again  for  the  rest  of  our  lives.    Mr  Speaker,  it  was  actually  at  that  meeting  where  I 

made up my mind to join politics.   

</span></div><div><span>So if there’s anybody in this House who thinks that he’s going to stab  the Reform, 

I’m sorry I’ve got news for you.  Let me go back and congratulate the contribution by 

the  business  sector  in  our  country  because  it  is  their  money  once  again  that  we’re 

</span><span>talking about.   Sorry  Mr Speaker, let me clarify. They  are the major contributors to 

this budget.   Including some people in this House today.  I can see them.  So let me 

say, thank you very much to your contributions to our budget. 

</span></div><div><span>So Mr Speaker, we see that this budget that we are talking about belongs to our people 

and we the Government actually do not create money.  So let us look after the money 

</span><span>and the sweat that our people have given into our hands.  And let’s ask the business 

</span><span>community to keep paying their taxes.  One of the main things that I</span><span>’m happy with in 

</span><span>this budget is that, I believe, this has contributed to the gross domestic product of our 

country. The fact that the previous Government brought into this House 3 major Acts, 

including the Public Service Act, the FEM Act and the PERCA Acts also contributed 

vastly to this recovery.  Mr Speaker I believe that these safety valves of the economy 

</span><span>should be maintained.  

</span></div><div><span>This Coalition Government Mr Speaker, has made an agreement - despite the Leader 

of  the  Opposition  getting  worried.    We  have  stated  in  Section  (g)  of  our  agreement 

that both parties must act in the best interest of the nation and their parties at all times.  

</span><span>So don’t be worried Opposition Members. I believe that all of us that have signed this 

</span><span>agreement will work in the best interest of this nation.  So if there are any Members 

on the other side who feel that you can live with this agreement and you can live with 

</span><span>the Public Service Act and you can live with the Reform there’s already a vacancy on 

this side.  I’m sure we</span><span> can find another seat for Inatio Akaruru when he comes back. 

</span></div><div><span>So Mr Speaker before  I  sit down may  I lodge a  plea to  all Honourable  Members of 

this House. Our old politicians, our young ones - when we come into this House we 

leave  our  personal  interests  at  home  and  bring  the  interests  of  our  nation  into  this 

House.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member for Are Nikau. Congratulations on 

your  excellent  maiden  speech.  I  now  call  on  our  next  speaker  and  we  have  the 

Honourable Member for Matavera. You have the Floor Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  VAEVAE  PARE:  </span><span>Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker  and  congratulation  to  your 

position as Speaker in the House.  Greetings also to the Clerk and to the Interpreter 

and also to every staff members in this House.  Greetings also to the Prime Minister to 

the  Honourable  Dr  Joseph  Williams.  Even  though  you  have  been  on  this  side, 

nevertheless  greetings  to  you.  To  the  Honourable  Sir  Geoffrey  Henry  and  the 

Honourable Members on the government side, greetings to you all.  To the Leader of 

the  Opposition,  Deputy  Leader  and  to  our  two  mothers  in  the  Opposition  side, 

greetings.  Greetings also to us the new Members.  I think it was good of Joe Williams 

</span><span>to teach us politics in 3 days.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, allow me to give my greetings to my constituency.
