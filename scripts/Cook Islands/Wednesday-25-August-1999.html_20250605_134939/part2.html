<div><span>PRAYER 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER took the Chair at 1.00 p.m. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    May  we  all  be  seated.    Kia  Orana.  Greetings  to  all  Honourable 

Members this afternoon and I would like to welcome you all.  Before I call upon the 

Leader  of  the  House,  I  would  like  to  say,  whatever  I  do  in  here  I  will  try  to  do  as 

honestly as I can.  I am hoping that we have an enjoyable time here at our meetings.   

</span></div><div><span>Now I will call upon the Leader of the House, the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE: </span><span>Thank you Mr Speaker.  To you Mr Speaker and the Clerk of 

the House and to all your staff members, Kia Orana.  To the Prime Minister Dr Joseph 

Williams  and  all  Members  of  Cabinet  and  Members  of  the  Coalition  Caucus,    Kia 

Orana.  To the Leader of the Opposition Dr Maoate, his Deputy and Caucus Members,  

</span><span>Kia Orana.  Mr Speaker,  I  also,  lastly, extend a  warm  greeting to  the people of this 

</span><span>country.  Kia Orana in the name of our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in order for us to proceed with our Order of the Day, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 21 be suspended  in order that the day for the Ceremonial 

Opening of Parliament be postponed until such future date. 

</span></div><div><span>The reason Mr Speaker  is  that there is one vacancy in the House.  It would be futile 

to have a Ceremonial Opening if there is a vacancy.  It is the intention of Government 

that when the By-Election is completed and when there are 25 members in the House 

we will consider a date for the Ceremonial Opening.  I am quite sure that with a clear 

explanation  like  that  there  will  be  no  need  for  further  comment.  Thank  you  Mr 

Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank    you  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    I  call  for  a 

Seconder to the Motion?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by the Honourable Member for Tamarua, Mii Parima. 

</span></div><div><span>Are  there  any  further  speakers?    The  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable  Dr 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Speaker.    Mr  Speaker  Kia  Orana  on  this 

special  day.    To  the  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Sir 

Geoffrey,  and  Members  of  Government,  Kia  Orana.    To  my  colleagues  in  the 

Opposition, Deputy Leader and Members in the Opposition, to all our people listening 

in,  and  a special one to our friend the Financial Secretary.  Kia Orana to all of you.  

</span><span>And of course, to your staff members, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I  will  not  be  long.  I  stand  to  my  register  the  general  view  of  the  Opposition  on  the 

Motion  before  us.    Mr  Speaker,  I  would  have  thought  that  some  proper  planning 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>22 

</span></div><div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> August1999 

</span></div><div><span>would have taken place.  Now we are sitting in the afternoon instead of the morning.  

I  also  expected  some  proper  organisations  to  have  a  Ceremonial  Opening  of 

Parliament only to find now that there is no Ceremonial Opening. I think this is a very 

poor organisation.  It is not a good reflection on the performance of this Government.  

Let  us  have  a  good  start  Mr  Speaker,  instead  of  this  meddling  kind  of  planning.    I 

know  the  preparation  of  the  Ceremonial  will  now  depend  on  the  Pukapuka  By-

Election.   

</span></div><div><span>Incidentally, Mr Speaker, I heard from the leader of our delegation in Pukapuka that 

we  need  not    worry.    I  do  not  blame  my  friend,  the  Honourable  Inatio  Akaruru  for 

chartering a plane to go up there the other day.  Because of the ci</span><span>rcumstances we’re in 

</span><span>right now, the Ceremonial Opening of Parliament should accordingly be postponed. It 

is definitely more practical and more logical to  have the By-Election first on 29</span><span>th</span><span> of 

</span><span>this month…</span></div><div><span>MRS. N. MUNOKOA:</span><span>…No!  29</span><span>th</span><span> of next month. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Oh. I would have thought this month is a better choice.  So 

</span><span>we will be waiting for result of that then?    

</span></div><div><span>I know Mr Speaker that the vacant seat is on the Government side. I am not sure why 

your staff decided to put the vacant seat on that side because it is in the wrong place.  

Thank you Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  Opposition.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  There appears to be none.  So I will put the question. The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Standing Order 21 be suspended in order that the Ceremonial  

Opening of Parliament be postponed to some future date? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>We now move to the Presentation of Papers.
