<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 1 - Short Title. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 1 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 2 - Interpretation. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  There are aspects of what amounts 

to  persons,  individuals,  firms,  companies  that  is  worthy  of  comment.  Some  of  the 

answers  that  we  have  heard  from  the  Minister  of  Broadcasting  are  rather 

disappointing. Especially when you consider the actions by him and his Government 

in  handing  over  hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  of  publicly  owned  television  and 

broadcasting assets to political friends of theirs at no cost. And when you consider the 

fact that you are handing in assets that belong to the people of this country to a group 

of people who have no capital,  who have no finance. Do you call that a responsible 

Act? When you also look at the situation where the broadcasting system especially the 

</span><span>television  side  of  it  has  failed  time  and  time  again,  they  have  become  a  National 

</span><span>embarrassment.  Now  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  has  explained  that  they  have  been 

using  these  state  owned  assets,  they  have  not  actually  been  allowed  to  own  them.  

</span><span>Now  that’s  the  clarification  that  I  appreciate  but  at  the  same  time  it  is  like  giving 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>2750 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>children  expensive  toys,  especially  when  they  have  limited  facilities  to  use  these 

expensive  toys.    I  would  say  that  due  to  the  many  failures  of  CITV  to  perform,  the 

Minister  of  Broadcasting  has  ample  grounds  to  sever  the  contract,  to  sever  the 

agreement. It is a very basic ground in a contract that where a party fails to perform, 

that  goes  to  the  root  of  the  contract  and  therefore  fails the contract.  It  is  the lack of 

performance that can give the other party grounds to cut the contract or to revoke it.  

Now,  we  have  seen  the  present  group  and  there  is  no  question  about  their  courage, 

there  is  no  question  about  their  trying,  they  have  tried  their  very  best.    But  what 

concerns me is that there are many many occasions where they have failed to show the 

programmes  which they have advertised previously. On occasion they have failed to 

go on air.  They have failed many times to deliver.  

</span></div><div><span> I am basing my observation Mr Chairman, on a reasonably drafted sensible common 

sense  contract.    I  have  not  viewed  the  Ministers  contract,  I  do  not  know  how  he 

drafted  it.  Obviously  he  made  it  so  tough  for  himself  to  act  that  it  was  a  one  sided 

contract  favouring  these  people.  To  me  there  is  no  absence  of  grounds  except  there 

might be an absence of Will on the Ministers part to protect the interests of the people 

of this country.  There are clear examples of occasions where they were not up to it, 

</span><span>there has been allegations of showing pirated tapes. These all amount to acts which if 

</span><span>there was a properly written contracts between the parties the Minister would have no 

difficult, absolutely no difficulty doing something about it. 

</span></div><div><span> Mr Chairman, what we are complaining about from the Opposition side is that with 

the  exception  of  George  Pitt.  The  rest  of  that  group  that  operates  that  broadcasting 

service are Cook Islands Party in fact some of them are on the Executive of the Cook 

Islands Party. It is done with a political manifestation.  It is no good denying it to us 

</span><span>we are all sensible people, it is no good beating around the bush let’s face it.  That is 

</span><span>probably  why  they  are  kept  in  there,  they  have  actually  become  a  hindrance  to  a 

properly  structured  organisation.  A  private  sector  made  up  of  locals  with  the  right 

capital and with the right finance to do a better job.  We see Mr Chairman, that there 

are interested parties and obviously interested parties with money and with equipment 

that want to take over. But this group has now decided that because of their superior 

positions  in  being  granted  the  license  to  operate  broadcasting  by  their  benevolent 

</span><span>Minister of broadcasting and Government, they hold themselves out to be the one’s to 

</span><span>decide who comes into a joined venture with them when really these people should be 

allowed  a  clear  entrance  into  broadcasting  without  these  other  people  getting  in  the 

</span><span>way.  Those are my observations at the moment Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to you Mr Chairman and to your staff.  Kia Orana to all Honourable 

Members on both sides of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>This particular clause views persons as individuals, companies and so forth.  I would 

</span><span>like to make a few comments.  I would like to respond to the Minister’s comments on  

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2751 

</span></div><div><span>my remarks regarding those on the board and the staff members before privatisation 

took place. 

</span></div><div><span>I make no apology to anyone.   I have mentioned to some board members and some of 

the staff that, according to my reliable source, have  abused the broadcasting services 

of this country while it was in their hands. 

</span></div><div><span>While that broadcasting service was in their hands this service ran into a lot of losses 

and government  had no option but just to cut it off and wipe that loss.  These debts 

and  losses  were  caused,  in  my  view,  due  to  the    mismanagement  and  abuse  of  this 

service.  I am  interested to  hear the Leader of the Opposition  saying that there were  

C.I.P. supporters in the administration of this services which led to a huge loss by the 

broadcasting service.  I do not know Mr Chairman but that is what he said.  I can only 

go  by  the  performances  of  Government    where  they  preferred  to  have  their  own 

supporters  on the boards.  Those are my comments Mr Chairman.  I have given my 

full support to the Amendment and I see this as an opportunity for newcomers;  those 

who have taken over the broadcasting and television service as a private business.  I 

give all the support I can in order for them to carry on and to do better.  If we have 

</span><span>anymore  to  talk  about,  I  suggest  we  talk  about  supporting  them  by  encouraging 

</span><span>sponsorship  for  this  venture.  It  is  the  people  of  the  country  that  will  make  this 

broadcasting and television service. We support them by way of utilising the facilities,  

by  paying  for  it  rather  than    kaiou.    There  are  services  that  a  lot  of  our  people  feel 

should be provided by the broadcasting and television services free of charge.  I have 

no problem with that,  provided Government can pay the bill.  But if they cannot pay 

for those kinds of services they should not be forced to take it on as  a burden for the 

company  who  is    taking  over  this  service.    Just    like  any  other  business,    they  are 

supposed to  survive.  Whatever the input is  they have to charge  in order to make a 

profit to keep on going.  But at the same time they have to be reasonable about their 

charges.  I give my support to the Bill,  Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span> I have a very short question to raise to the Minister,  Mr Chairman.  

This  is  in  regard  to  the  money  appropriated  for  this  station.    What  I  want  to  ask  is 

what  has  happened to  the money deducted off the pay of the Rakahanga people?  Is 

</span><span>that going to come back to help build the new station or not?  As the company is being 

</span><span>put  into  the  hands  of  private  enterprises,    is  the  money  going  to  come  back  to  the 

people of Rakahanga?   They will be greatly helped if the money can be identified and 

utilised for the Rakahangan T.V. station.  So this is my small question.  Is it going to 

come back? We in the northern group should be working together to achieve our own 

radio  station.   We understand our own language.  The question is,  what is going to 

happen to the money? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  The Honourable Minister, 

Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>   Mr Chairman,  I rise to reply to the question raised regarding 

the money.  According to law that has been deducted from the workers for the purpose 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>2752 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>of broadcasting.  I feel that is not a difficult question because I know the Honourable 

Members will understand when the money is deducted it goes into the public purse.  I 

want  to  assure  the    Honourable  Members  that  when  the  station  is  started  in 

Rakahanga,  money will be taken out and injected into the new station.  I quite agree 

with  him.    Technicians  are looking into the matter as well for Rakahanga, Manihiki 

and Tongareva to be included in this thing.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 2 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed  

</span></div><div><span>Clause 3 -  Prohibition on the provision of television or radio services.   

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  This clause clearly defines that 

no  one  shall  operate  unless  they  have  a  license.      When  I  spoke  on  the  merit  and 

principles  of  the  Bill  Mr  Chairman  ,  I  gave  a  strong  emphasis  on  taking  over  of 

broadcasting  and  television  services  by  our  own  people.    This  clause  Mr  Chairman 

allows anyone to apply for a license. 

</span></div><div><span>My  plea  is    directed  to  the  Minister.    While  he  has  done  the  job  well  to  give  this 

service to local people, I am asking him to continue with that aim and objective and 

not to allow outsiders to compete with our local people because quite often when that 

</span><span>happens, money talks.  But I don’t mind if the Minister is </span><span>going to look at applications 

for licences from here in the Cook Islands.  To me there has got to be a local element 

in  whoever  applies  for  a  licence.    I  stated  this  because  I  believe  in  competition  and 

competition is a healthy thing for any business like this.  For those who are provided 

</span><span>with  licences  or  operating  in  a  business  with  a  monopoly  behind  them  should  take 

</span><span>note  that  they  should  not  take  advantage  of  their  monopolisation  of  their  fields  of 

businesses.   

</span></div><div><span>I say this, Mr Chairman, because I know there are services provided, there are public 

services  provided  by  certain  companies.    For  example,  the  Aponga  Uira  is  one  of 

those companies that in my view takes advantage of their monopoly.  There are certain 

services  provided  by  the  private  sector  in  a  monopoly  situation  and  so  far  some  of 

them are really doing well and playing the game well without taking advantage of the 

monopoly that they have. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2753 

</span></div><div><span>So  I  rise,  Mr  Chairman,  to  indicate  to  the  Minister  of  my  emphasis  on  local  people 

taking over this sort of services and to ensure that our people are given the first choice 

for any of these opportunities.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the 

Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Mr  Chairman,  when  I  see  a 

retroactive provision in the clause, all four aerials come out of my head and I get very 

suspicious.  The provision here in Clause 3 says,  the principal Act is amended with 

effect from the 30th August 1996,  by repealing Section 4 with the new substitution.  

</span><span>Now there must be a purpose behind this.  Who are they trying to get at?  Don’t forget 

</span><span>when I get suspicious I am usually proven right over and over again in the history of 

this Parliament,  every time I raise a concern like this.  You wait, the truth will come 

out later.  There are two reasons why this is dated back to last August.  There are two 

reasons.    One  is  either  to  protect  an  existing  interest  or  to  make  an existing interest 

illegal. 

</span></div><div><span>Let’s look around this </span><span>particular situation.  It is my understanding, Mr Chairman, that 

a  certain  Mr  Wholer  from  Tahiti  has  installed  some  very  very  expensive  satellite 

dishes with modern transmitting equipment at the television station.  The equipment 

valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars is in place and the question the people of 

</span><span>this  country  want  to  know  is,    what  is  happening  with  Mr  Wholer’s  expensive 

equipment?    What  is  happening  with  Mr  Wholer’s  application  to  operate  a  TV 

</span><span>station?      I  would  like  to  ask  the  Minister  of  Broadcasting,  the  Honourable  Tepure 

</span><span>Tapaitau to tell this House exactly what is happening to Mr Wholer’s application for a 

</span><span>TV licence?  What is happening to his equipment and while he is pondering over that, 

</span><span>could  he  also  confirm  to  this  House  that  it  is  also  one  of  Mr  Wholer’s  dishes  and 

transmitting  equipment  that  has  been  “lent”  to  the  Prime  Minister?    Will  Minister 

</span><span>Tapaitau please tell us,  is this the right thing to do when somebody is applying for a 

licence to operate a TV station,  that he would also lend expensive equipment to the 

Prime Minister of this  country free of charge to  use, to  watch world-wide television 

while he is waiting for his licence or for his application?  Is it proper that the Prime 

Minister should accept equipment free of charge while an application is in place?  Is it 

proper that this should take place?  Is it not a conflict of interest?  These are questions 

</span><span>that have been raised in the community and don’t forget the people of this country are 

</span><span>very  very  intelligent  and  they  are  not  to  be  fooled  by  silly  little  answers?    And 

</span><span>whatever answers given should be addressed to grown-up people who will not accept 

any childish answers. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  when  I  raised the questions about  Mr Wholer’s television application 

</span><span>and  about  his  expensive  equipment  installed  at  the  television  station,    the  Minister 

responsible for the Bill was outside of the chambers.  I want to repeat those questions 

for his benefit so we can get some answers from him.    The question I wish to ask the 

Minister  is,    what  </span><span>is  happening  to  Mr  Wholer’s  application  to  operate  a  television 

</span><span>service or Pay TV service in this country?  What is happening to his application and 

also what is happening to his expensive equipment that has been installed at the CITV 

</span><span>station?  And question No.3 is, was it Mr Wholer’s equipment that the Prime Minister 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>2754 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>is getting free use of?   I add, is it the right thing to do that the Prime Minister should 

get this equipment while Mr Wholer is waiting for his application to be decided? 

</span></div><div><span>With  those  questions  in  mind,    let  me  just  add  to  it,  Mr  Chairman,  that  I  am  not 

critical.  If anything,  I am absolutely mesmerised about the facilities that have been 

installed, its ability to bring into this country a CNN channel, ITV, you name it.  Even 

some  channels  from  Australia.  The technology is  there.  I am  awed by it and I just 

want the Minister to tell us,  is there a hope that the people of this country will benefit 

from this latest modern technology?  I raise the question.  I raised the issue not to bury 

this advanced television facility but to praise it and hope that the Minister can tell us 

something positive and definite about it. 

</span></div><div><span>I shall rest for now Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the 

Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.   Mr Chairman, I rise to give my support to 

this Clause of the Bill.  I feel Mr Chairman that this is one of the issues that we need 

to  look  at    carefully.    Because  we  know  these  two  areas  are  being  privatised.    I 

strongly support the views aired by the Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate,  who 

stretched the point that he want to see local input in the company. 

</span></div><div><span>This  morning  I  met  somebody  who  is  also  a  member  in  a  Manutea  local  company. 

And during our discussions,  he assured me that they will not bring any foreigner into 

this  matter.    I  asked  him  for  the  reason  and    he  said  that  every  time  a  foreigner  is 

brought  into this country they always have the tendency of taking money out of this 

country.  That is why they disapproved of foreigners.  

</span></div><div><span>I strongly support the view that this should be given to our local people.  Because if 

we happen to give this company out to a foreign company that means the money will 

go  out  of  our  country.    The  only  thing  is  if  there  are  things  that  none  of  the  Cook 

Islanders could do then they may have to seek help from else where.  I was watching 

him. I asked him to  name such things  that our people from the Cook Islands cannot 

do.  Well according to him all areas have been covered except of cause for planning.  

That is the reason why I strongly support this Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the Opposition was enquiring after the facilities provided by Wholer.  I 

</span><span>don’t think that is  our business.   If this is  my material,  when I leave what happens?  

Do  I    take  with  me  my  wires,  radios  and  what’s  not?  How  is  the  operation  of  the 

company  supposed  to  continue  working.    So,  I  don’t  think  we  should  moan  about 

</span><span>those matters. If you are interested, then apply for a licence. The  successful applicants 

have to de</span><span>cide what programmes they will air on the TV. It’s not for you or for me to 

</span><span>decide what they have to televise.  If you do not want to watch what they are playing 

over the TV turn your TV off.  Mr Chairman our people are wise.  This is a very true 

statement Mr Chairman because our people know what the benefits are. I understand 

that  this  Honourable  Member  always  uses    politic  in  everything  that  he  says.    The 

</span><span>Cook Islands Party Members don’t politicise every issue,  there is a time for politics, 

</span><span>there is a time where we discuss  matters for the benefit of our people.  Unlike what he 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2755 

</span></div><div><span>said to the people of Atiu,  that is  he will be the next Prime Minister  of this country.  

Who does he think we are?  Our people are very wise, we are very understanding Mr 

Chairman They can look at the person and know what the capability of that person is.  

Now is not a time to play politics,  now is not  the time to campaign Mr Chairman. 

</span><span>Let’s  not  come  here  and  criticise  about  those  who  applied  and  got  the  company, 

</span><span>because whatever they decide is what they are going to put over the air.  The Deputy 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  raised  the  idea  that  he  likes  the  idea  of  localising  this 

</span><span>particular area.  I agree with that because the money will stay with us,  it won’t go out 

</span><span>of the country.  Mr Chairman those are my comments and I will sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Honourable  Minister 

Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr Chairman,  I stand up to answer three questions raised by 

the Leader of the Opposition. </span><span>What is happening to Mr Wholer’s application?  I think 

</span><span>you  can  recall Mr Chairman,  when I was talking on the merit and principles of the 

Bill and also earlier on this afternoon,  I mentioned that there were interested parties 

who made some approaches to the Minister of Broadcasting requesting for licenses or 

</span><span>licenses to operate television and radio services in the country.  Mr Wholer’s and his 

</span><span>representative were one of the group who saw me.  In reply to the inquiries made by 

the Wholer and his group,  I advice Mr Chairman that at present the CIBS which is a 

private company is still operating.  And a valid contract is still in existence between 

CIBS or Government and Cook Islands Broadcasting Services.  And unless there is a 

breach of the contractual relationship between those two parties,  I would be unable to 

rescind that contract.  I said to Mr Wholer and his team at the time, that unless there is 

</span><span>a  breach  of  that  contract  I  cannot  exercise  any  other    party’s  interest  for  licenses  in 

</span><span>radio  television  services  in  the  Cook  Islands.    They  asked  whether  it  would  be 

possible  for  them  to  send  me  the  application  anyway?    I  replied  that  they  would  be 

wasting their time and wasting my time because as far as I can see,  the legal position 

is that CIBS still holds the contract and they have my blessing to continue.  And that 

was  the  end  of  the  discussions  on  the  application.    I  hope  I  have  advanced  that 

question. 

</span></div><div><span>No. 2 Mr Chairman:  what is happening to Mr Wholer’s equipment at CIBS?</span></div><div><span>What is happening to Mr Wholer’</span><span>s equipment at Cook Islands Broadcasting Service?  

</span><span>I  think  if  we  look  at  the  setup  Mr  Chairman,  we  will  find  that  Cook  Islands 

</span><span>Broadcasting  Service  is  a  private  company.    It  has  its  own  legal  entity.    It  is  not 

controlled  by  Government  and  therefore  in  law  they  operate  on  their  own.    I  am 

informed  Mr  Chairman,  that  they  have  entered  into  some  arrangement  with  Mr 

</span><span>Wholer, hence Mr Wholer’s equipment being placed on the site.  I do not know what 

</span><span>was the final details of that arrangement and I do not think it is my business to find out 

what  that  private  company  is  doing  with  their  own  arrangements.  However,  Mr 

Chairman,  I  have  been  told  that  the  group  has  renegotiated  and  there  are  some 

consultations  going  on  in  the  meantime  between  the  parties and a final  arrangement 

will soon be reached.  What those arrangements are Mr Chairman, I do not know. 

</span></div><div><span>In  regard  to  question  number  3  that  asks  who  owns  the  equipment  at  the  Prime 

</span><span>Minister’s  residence?    Quite  frankly  Mr  Chairman,  I  do  not  know  who  owns  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>2756 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>equipment.  I think the Honourable Member should direct that question to the Prime 

Minister himself.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman. I thank the Honourable Minister of 

Broadcasting for his answers although I am not satisfied with any of them. I am very, 

very disappointed in the manner in which Mr Wholer has been brushed aside by the 

Minister.  I know this man has Cook Islands connections. I also know he has Cook 

Islands partners. I do not know whether he is a direct descendant from the Makea 

family here, but I do know that there are Wholers in the Makea Nui family of 

Rarotonga. 

</span></div><div><span>When I get answers like that from the Minister I feel very despondent, I feel very sad 

and very unhappy because what he answered is typical of what the Ministers are doing 

in this country today. Their stubborn and relentless inflexibility is so damaging to our 

economy. That is why we have not turned the economy around by now.  We are still 

on the descent, we are still going down.  It really is quite upsetting.  There is a man 

with the equipment ready to introduce a modern services to the people of our country.  

Once  this  Government  introduced  television  to  the country there is  no turning back.  

</span><span>You  can’t  go  back  to  silent  movies  again.    I  am  afraid  that  the  way  people  like  Mr 

</span><span>Wholer have been discouraged is just a small example of how investors are treated in 

this country.  They just get thrown around by the Ministers who could not care less.  

There  is  an  agreement,  there  is  a  political  agreement  and  the  Minister  found  it 

impossible  to  change  his  mind  despite  the  poor  service  from  the  existing  company.  

Despite its many failings, the Minister of Broadcasting still finds it difficult to revoke 

the  contract.    Mr  Chairman,  time  and  time  again  politics  plays  such  a  great  role, 

politics  plays  the  only  role  this  Government  will  ever  understand.    Politics  in 

television, politics in education, politics in health, politics everywhere. Then we have 

some Members of Parliament, telling us not to come and argue but to come and praise 

the Government, to talk nicely, do not ask questions.  What kind of parliament is that? 

What kind of Country are we going to bee if it is Yes Minister; Yes Prime Minister.  

</span><span>For heaven’s sake wake up.</span></div><div><span>I want to assure the people of this country, that if the Demo Alliance Government was 

</span><span>in today Mr Wholer would get first preference because he has got the equipment, the 

capital, the means and together with a local partner.  He would be given the go ahead.  

Mr Chairman, let me say categorically that the philosophy and the foundation of the   

Demo Alliance Party is that the people of the country come first. First and Foremost 

ahead of the party ahead of anything else. The people come first, first, first. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  you  to  ask  the  Minister  of  Education  to  behave.  He  is 

making rude signs with his tongue and his mouth. Such is the provocation that I am 

tempted to throw a pen at his tongue.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  things  are  quite worrying because this is  not  the first  time. The 

Prime Minister of the country is the worst.  When people want to see him he is simply 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2757 

</span></div><div><span>not there. He will not respond to letters and the people just go away.  They are turning 

away investments, they are discouraging investments.  I would have thought that the 

Minister  of  Broadcasting  would  know  whose  equipment  is  being  used  by  the  Prime 

Minister. I would have thought he would make it his business to know that something 

abnormal  is  taking  place.    I  would  have  thought  he  would  find out  and remove that 

</span><span>equipment from the Prime Minister’s place in case he compromises his position. That 

</span><span>is a matter of concern that the Minister is not aware that an attempt has been made to 

compromise the position of the Prime Minister.  He should put a stop to it and remove 

the equipment. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  these  things  are  quite  worrying.  I  raise  the  questions  in  the  public 

interest  and  as  I  stated  earlier I am  quite disillusioned with  the Government  and the  

Minister of Broadcasting in his handling of the broadcasting service of this country. 

</span></div><div><span>I will reserve my final ten minutes for later. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Minister Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you and to Honourable 

Members of the House.  Kia Orana to the people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to support Clause 3 in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill which 

simply  requires  to  amend  the  old  Act  which  was  to  control  the  then  Cook  Islands 

Broadcasting Corporation and to  be effective as of August  last year. There is  a very 

good  reason  for  that  Mr  Chairman.  When  Government  decided  to  privatise  the 

operations of the Cook Islands Broadcasting Corporation there was a need to amend 

the Act, the Broadcasting Act to enable this to take place.  During that time they were 

offered through the privatisation committee within Government through tendering to 

give out to people to apply for it. 

</span></div><div><span>And  if  I  remember  right,  there  were  about  three  applications  at  the  time.   So it was 

given  to  the  then  Directors  of  CIBS  who  were  Teroa  Mani,  Mere  Raita  and  Emile 

Kairua and I also remember distinctly on their application that was brought in to the 

privatisation  committee  by  Tina  Browne  who  was  representing  them.  I  think  it  is 

</span><span>extremely  rude  for  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic-Alliance  Party  to  call  these  people 

</span><span>Cook Islands Party supporters. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>They are.  It’s not rude.</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  They never were Cook Islands Party supporters. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  They are on the Executive.  I know that. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  No, not Mere Raita.  Definitely she works for you.  Like I stated 

Mr  Chairman,  it  is  rude.    When  those  people  are  not  here  to  defend  themselves  but 

what  is  important,  is  that  they  are  Cook  Islanders.  How  can  the  two  Honourable 

leaders have short memories?  They go around this island promoting this Government 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>2758 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>as  selling  the  jewels  of  this  country  to  foreigners.    They  are  saying  that  this 

Government  is  selling  the  jewels  of  this  country  to  foreigners.  Yet  today  the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition is saying to this Government, to the Minister, to 

cancel the license of these three Cook Islanders, these locals.  I want to let the people 

of this country know all he is interested in is the kick-back to him. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order on the floor.  What is your Point of 

Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Reflections - 171.  What he is saying is that all I care about is 

kick-backs  to  me.    I  find  that  offensive  Mr  Chairman,  and  I  ask  you  to  ask  him  to 

</span><span>withdraw it.  That’s unparliamentary.</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  That is not unparliamentary.  Can I explain that? 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> All along during the debate this afternoon there are many things 

that are taken out of the mouths of the speakers and it comes to this very minor thing 

that can cause something big to one of the Members. I will ask the Minister to leave 

what he has stated. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  V.  TAIREA:</span><span>    Thank  you  because,  Mr  Chairman,  in  any  new  business  -  it 

happened during his time when he was a Minister of the Crown and it is continuing to 

happen today and continuing to happen in any Country. When businesses come even 

through private sectors, it does not have to be Government, they bring samples of their 

products.  They allow you a free sample.  That is what kick-</span><span>backs I’m talking about.</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Under the table! 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  No, not under the table at all.  It is not under the table. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Order please. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Because these companies gave you a sample of their products so 

they  can  test  their  viability  throughout  the  sectors  of  the  community.  But  while  that 

free sample has been given to you Mr Chairman, who is going to benefit out of that.  

That is what I mean when I said kick-backs and you get offered free trips too. Even 

today I have got a document here.  It concerns the nono fruit which a huge company in 

the  United  States  is  marketing  not  as  a  medicine  but  as  a  product,  as  a  food  line  in 

order to bypass the requirement of the USDA medicinal rules. They are doing that.  It 

is a big development here today in the Pacific. So you can sell the pururu, you can sell 

the nono or anything.  A lot of people will get benefits in this community of ours and 

they  should  go  and  visit  these  plants.    So  for  the  Honourable  Member  to  ask  this 

House, how did the Prime Minister acquire that dish out there, of course it was given 

</span><span>by this guy who owned the dish for a sample for the Prime Minister to have a look at 

</span><span>it. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>What’s his name?</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2759 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Because it was given by this Honourable gentleman to the Prime 

Minister  to  have  a  look.  To  assess  what  is  available  throughout  the  world  today  on 

that type of dish.  It may be that this Honourable gentleman thinks that if he gave it to 

the  Prime  Minister,  the  Prime  Minister  will  turn  around  and  cancel  the  license  to 

CIBS.  Unfortunately for the Honourable gentleman, it is Cabinet and the Honourable 

Prime Minister who makes that decision.  There is no point in giving it to us.  They 

would not understand what is being shown. But the fact of the matter Mr Chairman, is 

this  amendment  to  Clause  3  of  the  Act  allows  other  people  to  participate.  You  see, 

instead of monopolizing the industry to one licensee, it is necessary to Amend Clause 

3  of  the  old  CIBC  Act  and  for  the  Minister  of  Broadcasting  today  to  cancel  that 

license given to the CIBS Directors is unethical. It is against the law.  Because I think 

it was a two year contract that was given  - the Minister can correct me - to the CIBS 

since  August  last  year.  Give  our  people  a  chance  to  make  it  work.  They  have  only 

been operating for almost nine months now. They have to struggle.  

</span></div><div><span>And of course I remember earlier on today the Leader of the Opposition saying why 

give  this  to  these  local  people.  They have not  got  any money.  Every person in  the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands  borrows  money  from  the  bank.  If  only  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the 

</span><span>Opposition  agreed  with  me  that  we  should  go  into  business  and  let  Mama  Mau,  Dr 

Maoate, Upoko Simpson, Dr Robati and Robert Woonton run the business.  And here 

he is calling out to me, I speak for myself but he is the one who went out and told the 

public to forgive him for what he has done. 

</span></div><div><span> Now we are talking about the business opportunities given to our people today, I am 

saying Mr Chairman, Give them a chance to make it work they have only been at it for 

nine months. Give them the two years to do it.....  because he was asking for a piece of 

</span><span>land .... I’ve been waiting for that time until now for him </span><span>to send me the bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>  Point of Order Mr Chairman.  Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  There is a Point of Order on the Floor.  What is your Point of 

Order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. GEORGE:</span><span>    Mr Chairman, it is true Minister Tairea owes me four tonnes 

of cement on his house and it has nothing to do with what he is saying and I want . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Carry on Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  You see that is different. Everything I have today I can give you 

a  pile  of  newspapers  from  1983  to  today.    Everything  that  has  been  said  in  those 

newspapers, I have until today. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Please come back to Clause 3 Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>2760 

</span></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  I am on Clause 3.  Relevancy in Clause 3 the business activities.  

We  should  not  be  debating  the  ethics  of  this  Amendment  in  here  because  we  are 

talking about the setting up of a private industry. 

</span></div><div><span>I  did  not  intend  to  take  this  debate  along  this  road.  No!  But  he  was  blaming  us 

Ministers. I did not want to take that road. But it is important Mr Chairman, that the 

debate is confined to this. There are many things that need to be looked at, but at the 

mean time I am putting my full support behind this Amendment. Which has nothing to 

</span><span>do with Raymond Wholer’s equipment or who someone else’s equipment because the 

</span><span>privatisation  of  CIBS  was  carried  out  by  the  privatising  Committee  within 

Government and the private sector was also involved on that Committee. The delay in 

bringing  the  Amendment  arose in  that the Minister responsible was  looking at  ways 

and  means  to  accommodate  the  requirement  of  these  services  to  the  outer  islands. 

When  the  Minister  was  away,  this  was  happening  when  Wholer  was  here,  I  was 

Acting as Minister because I am his Associate and when I am out of the country he is 

also my Associate. Mr Chairman, there is no reason whatsoever why the directors of 

CIBS and Mr Wholer could not come together as a company to operate the service. 

</span></div><div><span>There  is  one  thing  that  the  Minister  has  to  be  very  very  careful  of.  Last  year  an 

</span><span>incident happened in Niue similar to here, where somebody got the exclusive right to 

operate  television  on  Niue.    But  you  know  when  that  guy  opened  that  television 

station on Niue, it cost him $4,000 for the license. When he said he finished it, he was 

not  even  able  to  cover  a  quarter  of  the  island.  Apparently  the  Niue  Government 

realised that they had been taken for a ride. But Mr Chairman, to buy that license back 

from  that  guy  it  cost  them  $92,000  for  a  $4,000  license.    This  is  why  the  Minister 

nee</span><span>ds  to  be  cautious  in  sending  this  Act  in  place.  That  is  why  it  states,  “anybody 

requiring such a license, the license must be operated and let it come under this Act”.</span></div><div><span>For  that  matter,  taking  into  consideration  the  words  from  the  Honourable  Member 

Pupuke Robati. I can not  see any reason why the Island Councils of Rakahanga and 

Manihiki  can  not  get  together  and  operate  a  television  license  for  themselves.  

</span><span>Similarly, I can’t see any reason whatsoever why the Island Council of Nga Pu Toru 

</span><span>could  not  operate  a  license  themselves.    Because  the  lands  of  these  operators  to  be 

given in the outer islands has been given away practically for 10 years. I mean there is 

a  security  on  that  land  now,  there  is  an  access  to  that  land  now.  I  believe  Mr 

Chairman,  this  Amendment  to  Clause  3  is  so  relevant  and  valid  to  the  continuing 

</span><span>operation of television and communications in our country.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    The  Honourable  Member 

Tangata Vavia.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  VAVIA:</span><span>    Thank  you  Mr Chairman. Kia  Orana to  you this afternoon. I seek 

your indulgence Mr Chairman, may you allow me to  extend to the bereaving family 

today for one of their shady tree that has fallen.  In the days I came to know this man 

in  New  Zealand  he  has  done  a  great  deal  for  the  island  of  Nukoroa  and  also  his 

aspirations  and  the  plans  that  he  proposed  in  his  life to  accomplish  for his  children.  

The  encouraging  words  that  he  has  presented  us  are  food  for  thought  for  all  of  us.  

Also calling upon our people of Nukuroa for the family service that we will be having 

</span><span>at Moko’s home in Panama.  Also the message that you the Ui Ariki of Mitiaro have 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>30 April 1997 

</span></div><div><span>2761 

</span></div><div><span>sent I have received and also from the Island Council I will extend them to that family. 

I  have  no  doubt  that  if  we  put  our  trust  in  God  he  will  bring  comfort  to  our  hearts.  

Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my full support to Clause 3 in this Amendment Bill. Because of what I 

have heard. That these members in CIBS are CIP supporters that is the reason that this 

station is in a bad way.  I am not really concerned about it because this is all politics.  I 

am  not  worried  about  that  Mr  Chairman,  if  there  is  anybody  in  there  who  is  a 

Democratic party supporter or CIP supporter, but if they have the money. I repeat that 

if they have the money, I have no doubt at all that the service they provide will be the 

best. Not simply because of their political affiliations. I am certain of that, but if they 

have the money I am sure that they will provide the best service.   

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I will interrupt you Honourable Member.  We have come to the 

end.  The Honourable Minister in Charge of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I move that the Bill be reported to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> The question is:   

</span></div><div><span>The Motion be agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion agreed
