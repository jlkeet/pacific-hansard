<div><span>(TOO MUCH INTERRUPTION) 

</span></div><div><span>The  Minister  is  trying  to  say  that  </span><span>I’m  the  one  who’s  scared.    No,  he’s  the  one  who 

</span><span>does not have the guts to object to anything his leader says.  That is what I am trying 

to say. If we provide the money that we are paying to hire legal advisers to prepare the 

bills,  we  should  be  able  to  pay  another  person  to  work  in  this  office.    Because  the 

money that we are appropriating for this department will go out to hire lawyers.  This 

</span><span>is what we are trying to say but it’s not really a problem to us because we can easily 

</span><span>solve it soon.  However, the </span><span>point over here I’m trying to press Mr Speaker is, I feel 

sorry  for  the  Solicitor  General,  she’s  been  loaded  with  a  lot  of  work  in  this  office.  

</span><span>And how can I prove this?  Many staff has moved out of this Department.  So I just 

want  to  make  the  people  know  </span><span>that  there  are  2  people  in  the  Prime  Minister’s 

</span><span>department paid over $200, 000.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Our next speaker is the Honourable Members Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I did not rise to give my support to this appropriation 

but I rise to say to acknowledge the work of these people involved in this Department.  

I  feel  sorry  for  one  of  the  boys  who  have  been  working  in  this  Department,  that  is 

</span><span>Peter  Graham.  He’s  a  good  boy.    He  was  doing  very  well  and  he  has  been  to  the 

</span><span>Northern Group to see how we could complete the by-laws of the Local Government 

of  the  Northern  Group  islands.    I  hope  that  this  new  boy  whose  working  in  this 

</span><span>Department  right  now  doesn’t  leave  the  job  and  migrate  overseas.  I  appreciate  the 

</span><span>effort  of  those  workers  in  this  department  and  I  ask  them  to  have  patience  because 

after the next  elections  then you have no problems  because somebody else will take 

over.  In addition, they are not the only ones that are being affected. There are others. 

</span></div><div><span>I  support  the views of my leader who said  that if only the $200,00 allocated for the 

</span><span>Prime  Minister’s  Department  was  diverted  into  the  department  of  Crown  Law,  then 

we  would  be  able  to  pay  for  more  lawyers  to  serve  us.    I’m  sure  our  people  in  the 

</span><span>Cook  Islands  are  surprised  to  hear  that  2  people  are  receiving  $200,000.  There  are 

young people who have left  the country to go overseas to earn more.  So this is our 

</span><span>humble  request  to  them,  have  patience.    These  are  my  views.    I  just  can’t  remain 

</span><span>seated  without  getting  up  and  acknowledge  the  work  provided  by  the  Crown  Law 

</span><span>Office.    So  I  would  like  to  say  to  the  Minister  of  Education  that  I’m  not  trying  to 

praise him but I’m trying to praise the people in the Crown Law’s Office.  Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  

</span></div><div><span> The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $264,910 for Crown Law stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Culture: 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $324,337 for Culture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr. Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> I rise to give my support to this appropriation and also to 

</span><span>stress  my  feelings.  I  feel  sorry for this  Department.  I don’t think enough money has 

</span><span>been given to support them.  If only the Minister responsible is not a Minister who is 

not afraid all the time then this Department would have been a better Department.  Do 

you  think  Mr  Chairman  that  this  is  the  kind  of  person  to  lead  this  very  important 

</span><span>Department  in  our country? He can’t even say, “no Mr Prime Minister you can’t do 

this”.    Maybe  if  the</span><span>y  have  appointed  the  Honourable  Member  Paora  Teiti  to  be  the 

Minister responsible, there will be money and he will fight for the Department.  But 

the  only  problem  with  him  is  when  I  ask  him  to  come  and  stand  as  a  Minister  he 

</span><span>doesn’t want  to.   I can see tha</span><span>t problem for this Ministry under the responsibility of 

this Minister. He is scared.   

</span></div><div><span>From the report of PERCA Committee, they have recommended that the Auditorium 

should  be  given  to  private  enterprises.  I  believe  privatisation  is  the  answer  to  the 

National Auditorium because one of our young people very much wanted to utilise the 

auditorium for his private work. If only this opportunity had been given to him.  This 

young man has  shown an excellent  example of how to  assist  our financial situation. 

He  has  accomplished  projects  given  to  him.  Allow  him  to  manage  the  complex  but 

reserve times when Government need to use the National Auditorium.  The problem 

with Government is that did not do anything during the time of the reform. They were 

away travelling and never had the time to look into this matter.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  afraid  that  the  place  might  be  deteriorating  and  rusting  away  without  any 

maintenance.    Government  should  have  given  the  opportunity  to  this  young  man 

Sonny Williams to utilise this centre.  The only way is to tender the centre. This is a 

good  proposal  and  we  should  consider  privatising  it.  We  should  have  listened  to 

</span><span>recommendations of PERCA that the auditorium be privatised because maintenance is 

</span><span>accumulating  and  attracting  a  lot  of  expenditure.  We know we have committed the 

country to a big debt from Nauru just to build a monument to the Prime Minister.  We 

can  see  the  problem  now.  Let  us  ask  ourselves  what  revenue  we  derive  from  the 

Culture  Centre.    This  is  one  thing  Government  is  in  trouble.  I  do  not  believe  in 

begging for debts  to  be cancelled out.  If I borrow, I make sure I can pay the money 

back.  Our country in a very bad state owes a lot of money. The only country who is 

reluctant to reduce our debt owing to them is France and Nauru. Of course, France and 

Nauru cannot reduce the debt we owe them because they are also in trouble.  We are 

</span><span>all aware of the global financial crisis encounted today.  

</span></div><div><span>This is not a small matter, when we talk about the Culture department.  The loan was 

not  reduced.  If we  look  at  the revenue we are receiving from  the Culture Centre, it 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>1666 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>does not equate the amount borrowed. We should have privatised the Culture Centre. 

</span><span>This  Department’s  staff  are  concerned  as  to  when  they  will  be  transitioned  because 

</span><span>there  is  not  enough  money  to  take  pay  them.    Government  today  has  been  boasting 

about  the  work  they  are  doing.  During  our  time,  the  private  sector  looked  after  the 

culture of our country and everything went very well. But look at what is happening 

now.    What  we  see  is  that  we  put  up  this  centre  as  a  monument  to  one  man.  The 

question in the future will be who created the problem in our country? I think it is this 

reason  that  has  brought  it  about.    If  only  the  time  we  built  this  facility  was  when 

everything  was  running  well,  we  would  have  been  all  right.  Now  we  are  really  in  a 

mess.  Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN: </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $324,337 for Culture stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman I would like to ask a question. Will there be enough 

money in this allocation to repair the Culture Centre?   

</span></div><div><span>In the past, we can recall that this Ministry’s budget was $7 million but now there is a 

</span><span>big difference.  I feel sorry for the Minister responsible because when this Department 

</span><span>was under the Prime Minister’s Department, the budget was so high that it reached the 

</span><span>coconut  trees. Now it has come right down.  I recall also that our dance teams went 

overseas to all parts of the world to show that we are a people that uphold our culture.  

We now see the Culture Centre rotting away. Is there enough money to maintain it?  I 

heard that this project was rigged. The contract was given to a certain interest group. 

</span></div><div><span>It is the same principal as that of the Sheraton Hotel.  Now we have the outstanding 

loan but the Hotel belongs to the landowner.  I feel sorry for the Minister responsible 

because  the  Budget  drafted  from  $9  million  to  just  under  half  a  million  dollars.    I 

support  the  views  earlier  that  this  should  be  privatised  but  before it can be given to 

any private enterprise, it should be repaired. At the moment it is leaking and very soon 

the roof will come down. 

</span></div><div><span>My  question  I  wish  to  raise  to  the  Minister  responsible  is,  “Will  there  be  enough 

money to repair the National Auditorium?”  Thank you Mr Chairman.</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  I rise, Mr Chairman, to give my support to this Appropriation 

</span><span>for  the  Department  of  Culture  and  to  also  show  my  appreciation  to  the  staff  of  this 

</span><span>Department which embrace our culture and traditions.  I would like at this time to give 

a  word  of  encouragements  to  the  people  in  the  Culture  Department.  Culture  Centre 

has become a tourist attraction and it is being utilised by our young people in sporting 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>1667 

</span></div><div><span>activities  like  netball,  basketball  and  others.    Our  young  people  are  lucky  nowadays 

because they have a proper place for their indoor sporting activities and there are a lot 

of groups coming from outside utilising the National Auditorium as a place for their 

sport competition. 

</span></div><div><span>This National Auditorium is in good condition.  It is not that when one roof is leaking 

then  we  say  that  the  house  will  come  down.    The  body  of  this  building  and  other 

adjacent buildings are all in good condition.  This building is there to encourage our 

young  people  to  get  into  sports.  The  venue  has  become  a  place  where  our  young 

people have their performances. They have pride in  what  they own.  The amount of 

money  that  has  been  spent  on  this  building  is  worthwhile.  Yet  there  are  instances 

where  money  disappeared.  However,  what  is  important  is  that  the  premises  and  the 

buildings  are  there  and  it  exists.  The  school  children  of  Rarotonga  are  utilising  this 

</span><span>place.    Every  time  they  use  the  premises,  it  is  memorable  to  them.  If  it  wasn’t  for 

Government we wouldn’t have been able to have a place like this.</span></div><div><span>At  the  time  when  the  Democratic  Government  was  in  power,  they  were  all  looking 

after  themselve</span><span>s.    They  can’t  be  bothered  with  our  young  people  and  our  school 

</span><span>children. They were only looking after their own affairs.  I have no problem with the 

</span><span>amount  of  money  spent  on  this  Auditorium.  I  am  very  proud  to  have  this  building 

because we have something that we can utilise. Every time we have our Constitution 

Celebrations,  we have a place to go to. I always take pride in what Government has 

for our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I am not surprised at the narrow mindedness of the Leader of the Opposition and the 

Honourable  Member  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  in  the  way  that  they  are  criticising  this 

National Auditorium.  People will always remember that it was this Government that 

came up with a new building. Our people will not be surprised to see the Opposition 

criticising what Government has done. Government has committed money to build a 

nice  auditorium.  People  can  see  that  something  has  been  done.  But  what  did  the 

Opposition do in the ten years that they were in administration? They have nothing to 

show because they spent money on themselves.  I will not be surprised, Mr Chairman, 

with  what  our  people  will  think.  Our  people  are  not  silly.    They  know  that  the 

Opposition has a poor record of accomplishment.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, we are not the only country in the world that is finding difficulties with 

</span><span>the  economy.  Countries  throughout  the  world  are  experiencing  this  problem.    The 

</span><span>Leader of the Opposition is trying to tell the people that it is this Government’s fault 

that our country is in an economic or financial crisis. It is not Government’s f</span><span>ault. The 

financial crisis is affecting countries throughout the whole world.  This is not the end 

of  it  Mr  Chairman,  because  our  economy  is  starting  to  improve.    The  economy  has 

started to pick up and I would like the Leader of the Opposition to know. This is the 

reason Mr Chairman why the people will re-elect this Government because they know 

that this Government will be able to take this country into a better future. 

</span></div><div><span>This is why I am supporting the allocation for Culture Mr Chairman. Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>1668 

</span></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999 

</span></div><div><span>DR PUPUKE ROBATI: </span><span>Mr Chairman I was going to ask a question to the Minister 

earlier but he was not here. Now he is here, I would like to ask him whether our debt 

to  the  Nauru  Government  has  been  paid.  The  reason  I  am  asking  this  question  Mr 

Chairman is that, when we discussed this issue in the past, the Finance Minister of the 

day  told  us  in  this  House  that  this  loan  was  called  a  zero  coupon  loan.  The country 

will not pay anything on it because this loan will pay itself. Therefore, I would like to 

ask the Minister of Finance of today whether this loan is paid off.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.  The  Honourable  Minister  for 

Tauranga Vananga Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  NGERETEINA  PUNA:  </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  I  rise  to  congratulate  the 

Secretary  of  the  Tauranga  Vananga  Mrs  Carmein  Temata  and  her  staff  for  doing  a 

good  job  in  the  financial  year  we  have  been  through.  I  support  the  amount  we  are 

appropriating  for  the  Ministry  of  Culture.  We  know  that  because  of  the  good 

administration by Carmein Temata and her staff, they were able to give back over and 

above what we have allocated them. I am sure we can remember last year during the 

Maire  Nui  celebrations  that  Government  contributed  very  little  finance  towards  the 

</span><span>Maire  Nui.  What  we  contributed  was  the  employee’s  time.  We  know  that  the 

</span><span>Government  tried  to  give  the  administration  of  the  celebration  into  the  hands  of  the 

people  and  they  were  pleased  with  this  arrangement.  The  people  and  the  business 

community  provided  the  administration  and  the  financial  support  for  the  Maire  Nui 

last year. The only thing Government  was requested to  assist was  $5000.00 to help 

pay broadcasting but other than that, the Maire Nui committee and our private sector 

helped to make it a successful celebration.  

</span></div><div><span>In response to the question raised by the Honourable Member for Rakahanga, I would 

like to ask him to look at page 15 where it explains the debt servicing for the 1998-

1999 budget year. However, I would like to say that our people are glad to have this 

house  for  all  occasions  such  as  Government  functions,  sport  etc.  Concerning  the 

question  about  the  zero  coupon,  I  cannot  answer  that  because  I  am  not  the  Finance 

Minister. All I am in charge to do is, to utilise this building acquired through the loan 

from the Nauru Government. If we look at the allocation for the Ministry of Culture, 

we  will  see  that  there  has  been  an  increase  of  $35,627.00  above  the  original 

appropriation for the Ministry of Culture. I had to beg the Minister of Finance for this 

amount of money so he felt sorry for me and gave it. So it is true when the Leader of 

Opposition said I am a cry baby because sometimes it pays to be a cry baby Minister. 

On page 7, it clearly explains us where we got the $35,627.00 from.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>I will interrupt you Minister. It is time to adjourn. May I call upon 

</span><span>the Honourable Minister to…. The Honourable Minister Ngereteina Puna. </span></div><div><span>HON N. PUNA: </span><span>Mr Chairman, I move:  

</span></div><div><span>That Appropriation be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>The Question is:  

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> March 1999
