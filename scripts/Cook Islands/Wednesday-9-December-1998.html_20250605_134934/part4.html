<div><span>BILL READ A FIRST TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER</span><span>: Can the Honourable Prime Minister please name the date and time 

of the Second Reading of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Forthwith, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> The Bill is ordered to come up for Second Reading forthwith. 

</span></div><div><span>Constitution  Amendment  (No.23)  Bill  Second  Reading.    The  Honourable  Prime 

Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span> Mr Speaker, I wish to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Constitution Amendment (No.23) Bill be now Read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Let  me  begin,  Mr  Speaker,  by  extending  a  special  Greeting  to  you,  to  all  your  staff 

members, Honourable Members in the House and our people who are listening in to 

our debate. 

</span></div><div><span>The Constitution Amendment Bill we have before the House is a result of the review 

undertaken  by  the  recently  established  Commission  of  Inquiry.  On  Page  46  of  their 

Report, it says that although there are 25 Members of Parliament, there are  persons 

</span><span>capable of discharging a Minister’s responsibilities outside the circle of the 25 elected  

</span><span>Members. The Report is not belittling our position in this House. However, they are 

</span><span>saying that we are not the only ones who can carry out these responsibilities in a way, 

</span><span>that  they  are  correct  because  there  are  people  in  our  communities  who  are 

knowledgeable  in  the  work  of  a  Minister  but  are  reluctant  to  engage  in  politics  and 

accordingly be elected.  The Report also says that some of these people may also have 

</span></div><div><a>Page 2</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1455 

</span></div><div><span>the  makings  of  a  Minister,  but  they  may  not  be  successful  at  the  polls.  The  Report 

referred to  the system in  the USA where the President selects  the Cabinet. They are 

not chosen from the Congress or Senate but they are chosen from outside of these two 

bodies.  In  the  majority  of  the  Parliaments,  who  adopted  the  Westminster  system, 

Ministers  are  selected  from  amongst  the  elected  Members.  In  neighbouring  Fiji,  the 

power of the Prime Minister to select two Ministers from outside of Parliament was 

enshrined in its  new Constitution. They are first appointed to the Senate and they are 

then made Ministers. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  our  political  system  felt  that  while  there  are 

disadvantages, the pros outweigh the cons and as such one or two Ministers should be 

appointed by the Prime Minister from outside Parliament. They recommended that a 

total  of  seven  Ministers  form  the  Cabinet,  with  one  of  those  to  be  appointed  from 

outside of Parliament.  And this particular Minister is eligible to speak in Parliament 

but not to vote.  We have discussed this matter at length in our Caucus.  The view of 

the Caucus was that we should leave this matter and decide upon it at some later date, 

either  during  the  elections or thereafter.  I reviewed this matter carefully and shared 

my views with Cabinet. There was an aspect of this recommendation which created a 

</span><span>lot  of  concern  and  that  was,  “one  Member  of  the  seven</span><span>-Member  cabinet  be  elected 

from  out</span><span>side  of  Parliament”.    Mr  Speaker,  this  recommendation  is  negating  the 

</span><span>discretion  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  first  choose  within  Parliament  before  looking 

</span><span>outside it. That is why Cabinet decided to modify this recommendation to read, “That 

</span><span>the  discretion  be  given  to  the  Prime  Minister  to  first  consider  the  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament  before  considering  candidates  from  outside  of  Parliament”.  It  is  our 

</span><span>reckoning  that  this  broadens  the  scope  of  the  Prime  Minister  to  choose  the  right 

person for Minister, it does not restrict him to choose from outside only. This means 

that, if there is no suitable person from within Parliament then he shall look outside.  

</span></div><div><span>The  main  aim  of  this  recommendation  is  to  reduce  the  number  of  Members  of 

Parliament. We have agreed that the number of Cabinet be reduced to seven, that is 

the first thing. Secondly, we have agreed that the Prime Minister has the discretionary 

right  to  look  outside  of  Parliament  for  a  Minister,  if  the  need  arises.  The  Prime 

Minister is not bound by law to confine himself to selecting one Minister from outside 

of  Parliament.  If  he  finds  that  he  is  able  to  meet  all  his  requirements  from  within 

Parliament, then that is okay. Thirdly, as stated in the Bill, we have decided that the 

Act shall come into force after the next Election.  

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, the main aim of this Constitution Amendment before us is 

to  reduce  the  number  of  Members  of  Cabinet  to  seven,  which  complies  with  the 

number  put  forward  by  the  Commission.  Secondly,  it  gives  the  right  to  select  a 

Minister  from  outside  of  Parliament.  Thirdly,  it  means  the  Prime  Minister  is  not 

bound to make his selection of one Minister, to outside candidates only. And fourthly, 

that this Act will come into effect next year.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Prime Minister.  Who will second the Motion? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr Tangata Vavia 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>1456 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now Read a Second Time? 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? The Honourable Member, Dr Norman George, Leader of the 

New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker  and  thank  you  for  the  honour  of  being 

</span><span>addressed as a doctor. In legal circles it’s an insult to be called a doctor.  Thank you 

</span><span>anyway, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>To  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  House,  the  Prime  Minister  and  to  our  people 

listening in - Good afternoon. To all visitors in our country - Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  stand  to  support  this  Constitution  Amendment  before  us.  This 

Amendment vindicates the predictions of some people.  It shows the Political Review 

Commission that their recommendations will be sensibly implemented.  What is being 

done  today  is  a  deliberate,  careful  introduction,  which  marks  the  first,  I  am  sure,  of 

regular  changes  that  we  will  go  through,  over  the  next  ten  years,  in  implementing 

some of the more positive recommendations of that Commission.  

</span></div><div><span>We  have  demonstrated  and  I  am  proud  to  be  part  of  this  House.  We  have 

</span><span>demonstrated to the Commission, and to the radical thinkers, who don’t usually think 

</span><span>carefully  about  what  they  say,  that  we  are  not  going  to  have  a  shotgun  approach  to 

changes.    I  am  so  proud,  Mr  Speaker,  about  the  exclusively  outstanding  leadership 

role of the New Alliance Party in this entire issue. The Political Review Commission 

submitted  their  report  with  a  loaded  double-barrel  gun,  to  say  to  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament,  ‘change  and  change  everything  immediately’.    Mr  Speaker,  the  New 

</span><span>Alliance  Party  calmly  and  deliberately  walked  up  to  them  and  disarmed  them.    We 

</span><span>took  the shotgun off them, put it away and said, ‘calm down and back off’.  And in 

</span><span>doing so, this House supported that move by passing a Motion of No Confidence in 

</span><span>two  of  the  Commission’s  Members.    From  that  point  on,  Mr  Speaker,  the  shotgun 

</span><span>approach  was  neutralised,  effectively  and  precisely.    And  taking  up  that  issue,  from 

that moment on, was critical for everybody and for that we should be grateful - I am 

sure  there  was  some  divine  intervention  along  with  the  New  Alliance  Party, 

</span><span>persuading  Government  to  deliberate  over  this  Report  carefully.  Thank  God  for  the 

</span><span>manner in which they arrived at their sensible intelligent conclusions.  

</span></div><div><span>There is no question about it, Mr Speaker, if we had followed the shotgun approach 

there will be mass confusion, there will be a lot of upsets. There will be disunity, there 

will be a lot of tension in the community because we will go into a General Election 

uncertain  and  confused  and  this  country  will  have  disturbances,  which  we  did  not 

</span><span>want,  and  we  don’t  want.  So,  Government  is  to  be  congratulated  for  the  manner  in 

</span><span>which they approached this recommendation. 

</span></div><div><span>This Amendment </span><span>sets the pattern of what ought to be done. Let’s do it carefully, let’s 

learn  to  walk  before  we  run  and  let’s  follow  some  of  the  more  positive 

recommendations of the Political Review Commission. Let’s follow them in a careful, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1457 

</span></div><div><span>steady  manner  rather  than  in  a  series  of  instant  changes,  which  does  not  benefit 

anyone. 

</span></div><div><span>And  one  of  the  most  important  lessons  to  be  learnt  from  the  whole  exercise,  Mr 

Speaker,  is  the  critical  role  played  by  a  minority  Opposition  Party  called  New 

Alliance.  What a Party! Their ability to persuade Government to follow the direction, 

which New Alliance felt that the majority of the people of this country wanted, was a 

major achievement.  One could describe the success of the New Alliance Party in this 

area as David being able to shake </span><span>hands with Goliath and saying, ‘come on, let’s join 

together  and  sort  this  mess  out’.    In  this  case,  David  did  not  destroy  Goliath.    He 

shook  him  by  the  hand  and  said,  ‘let’s  sort  this  Political  Review thing out  together, 

let’s  not  fight  each  other.    There’s  no  need  to  come  to  that’.  I  am  quite  sure,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker,  that  the  people  of  this  country  in  the  coming  General  Elections  will  not 

forget the ability of the New Alliance Party to perform whenever it was needed in a 

crisis.  We  faced  a  critical  situation.    There  were  populist  people  in  the  community 

who  was  ready  to  shoot  down  anybody  who  stopped  the  shotgun  advance  of  the 

Political Review Commission. However, New Alliance showed fearlessness in taking 

a  firm  stand  and  taking  what  may  come,  and  indeed  was  severely  criticised  by  a 

number of anonymous wimps in our community. Many of these people were bogged 

down  in  their  own  self-importance.    And  those  that  put  their  names  down  in  the 

Letters to the Editor attacking me, at least they were brave enough to put their names 

down, but  it also  demonstrated how dumb  they were. They only picked some of the 

issues,  it  lacked  thoroughness  and  intensity  in  their  comments.  When  they  did  put 

their view points in writing they looked silly.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  as  you  know,  being  an  Honourable  gentleman,  I  do  not  want  to  attack 

people who are not here to answer it. So we stand today, we stand today, to salute the 

Prime Minister and his team in Government for this wonderful Amendment.  Indeed, I 

suppose this is  part of the Prime Ministe</span><span>r’s farewell to this nation by putting in this 

</span><span>Amendment.  What a wonderful gesture, after a rocky ten years, that you would end 

your career as a Prime Minister with this wonderful Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I know some of the Members would like to speak on this Amendment. I 

shall  conclude  here,  by  again  giving  our  support,  the  support  of  the  New  Alliance 

Party to this Amendment and to say to the people of this country, they already know 

that it is in the policy of the New Alliance Party to reduce the Ministers to seven. It is 

in our Constitution that you can go to the Parliamentary Library now and get a copy of 

our brand new Constitution, its already there in Clause 20.  

</span></div><div><span>I also want to state the position of the New Alliance that we are most unlikely to take 

the option of bringing an outsider into the House through this way, because we feel if 

anyone  wants  to  serve  this  country  then  stand  for  an  election,  stand  for  Parliament.  

Bringing in an outsider who is not elected, is not accountable to anyone in this House. 

</span><span>It’s like bringing a cat to reside with a flock of pigeons. And those pigeons will never 

</span><span>be comfortable while that cat is around them. So, I say this as a matter of policy for 

</span><span>New Alliance, that all of our Cabinet will come from elected Members of Parliament.  

</span><span>Our Speaker will also come from elected Members of Parliament, to save the country 

money. And we will not hesitate, I serve notice as part of it, to make changes to our 

political  system.  We  will  not  hesitate  to  appoint  an  Opposition  Member  to  be  a 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>1458 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>Speaker.  So, there could be hope for the odd Cook Islands Party MP’s, whichever few 

</span><span>are left after the next election. There could be hope for you to be appointed Speaker of 

the  House.  But,  as  the two Members from  Aitutaki,  the Honourable Paora Teiti  and 

the Honourable Thomas Hewett, they will not be here with us and so they will not be 

considered.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, before I start a riot with the Members for Aitutaki I had better conclude 

here by again saying that we support this Amendment, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Tom Marsters. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  T.  MARSTERS:</span><span>  Greetings  to  you  Mr  Speaker.  Greetings  to  the  Honourable 

Members of the House and to our people listening this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise, Mr Speaker, not necessarily to support the Bill but to make comments on it.  Mr 

Speaker,  for  a  start,  I  was  surprised  to  receive  my  copy  of  the  Bill  especially 

considering  that  our  Caucus,  as  well  as  the  joint-Caucus,  had  decided  otherwise  on 

this  very  issue.    Whilst,  Mr  Speaker,  I  support  the  reduction  of  the  composition  of 

Cabinet.  I cannot, Mr Speaker, support the second part, which suggests that the Prime 

Minister may appoint a member of Cabinet from outside of Parliament. Therefore, if I 

were to quietly and calmly just let this go by and walk out of the House, I do not think 

I would be doing justice to those who do not support this part of the Bill.  Because I 

know,  Mr  Speaker,  there  are  Members  in  this  House  today  who  may  not  be  able  to 

speak up but they do not support that part of the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, right from the outset there was an expression of no confidence on the part 

of  the  Prime  Minister,  any  Prime  Minister  for  that  matter,  if  he  or  she  decides  to 

appoint  from  outside  of  those  who  were  elected  by  the  people.  The  Honourable 

Norman  George  has  already  indicated  that  the  New  Alliance  Party  will  not  appoint 

any body from outside of those elected to the House. I can understand why he would 

do  that,  because  Mr  Speaker,  those  who  are  not  elected  by  the  people  are  not 

answerable in way that we are. And whilst he or she would have the same privileges 

and  rights  of  any  other  Minister,  they  are  not  answerable,  Mr  Speaker,  in  the  same 

way as the rest of the Cabinet. Those 25 elected Members were given the mandate by 

the people to come and rule on their behalf. They have a mandate to appoint people to 

</span><span>do work for them.  They can appoint, as many consultants as they can like in order for 

</span><span>them to be able to do the work required of them by the people.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, you either have one system or you have another system. If we decided to 

go  the  presidential  way,  the  way  of  the  Americans,  as  mentioned,  then  we  go  the 

whole  hog.  Otherwise,  Mr  Speaker,  as  far  as  I  can  see,  for  thirty-odd  years  we 

managed with the Westminster S</span><span>ystem and I don’t see anything wrong with it. I can’t 

see  Mr  Speaker,  why  we  can’t  reduce  the  Cabinet  even  further,  from  seven  to  five, 

</span><span>that  is  a  consideration.  That  is  why,  I  say,  I  take  a  different  view  in  this  part  of the 

</span><span>Bill. Whilst I support the firs</span><span>t part to reduce the Cabinet numbers, I can’t, Mr Speaker, 

</span><span>support the second part. And especially, Mr Speaker, when there was a consensus in 

Caucus - our Caucus, as well as the joint-Caucus, on this very issue. If it was possible 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1459 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  would  really  like  this  motion  to  go  through  and  to  be  treated  as  a 

conscience thing rather than it being driven through as a matter of course.  

</span></div><div><span>I  sense,  Mr  Speaker,  there  was  pressure  put  on  Government  to  change,  especially 

when we had decided something else last week.  That is all I have to say, Mr Speaker, 

thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER: </span><span>Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Mrs Ngamau Munokoa. 

</span></div><div><span>MRS N. MUNOKOA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you, to your staff, to 

the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. To all Ministers of Cabinet, Members 

on the Government side, the two leaders of the Opposition and Opposition Members, 

Kia Orana to you all this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>As  indicated  by  the Honourable Tom Marsters, he supports the idea of reducing the 

number  of  Members  of  Cabinet.  I  also  support  that  part  and  also  the  fact  that  the 

number should come down from seven to five, or four. Like him, I do not agree with 

the  suggestion  that  one  Minister  should  be  appointed  from  outside  of  Parliament.  I 

believe that the people should elect all of us Members of Parliament. Even though we 

</span><span>don’t know everything, we will work it out if we actually do the job.  There are those 

</span><span>among us today who are highly educated while there are those of us who do not have 

qualifications yet we are Members of Parliament too.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  confident  that  when  we  become  Government,  the  Democratic-Alliance  Party 

Government, our Ministers will appoint the right people to carry out the work required 

of  them.  Over the past  few years we have seen lots of money being spent  on senior 

consultants from outside of the country who were brought here to improve our country 

but  they  did  not  succeed.  I  believe  our  Ministers  will  ensure  that  those  whom  they 

appoint to head the ministries will do their jobs well, if not they shall be replaced. I 

believe it is something for us to think about seriously if we are elected again. We must 

ensure that we look carefully at whom we appoint to senior positions so that we do not 

wind up having to bring in outsiders to tell us how to do the jobs.  

</span></div><div><span>Those  are  my  views  on  the  Bill  before  the  House.    I  would  now  like  to  say  Merry 

</span><span>Christmas and Happy New Year to all Honourable Members in the House and also to 

</span><span>our people listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker, Kia Orana to you this afternoon, Kia 

Orana to Honourable Members on both sides of the House, to your staff of Parliament 

and to our people listening in to the broadcast this afternoon.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>1460 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rose  to  support  the  Motion that the Constitution Amendment (No.23) 

Bill  be now read a Second time and also  to  support the principles and merits of the  

Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>I support this Amendment Bill, Mr Speaker, because this is also part of the Report of 

the  Commission  of  Political  Review.  This  Amendment  Bill  is  following  through,  in 

part, some of the recommendations in the Report. We are unable to follow through on 

all of the recommendations because it is more complicated than that. 

</span></div><div><span>I think, Mr Speaker, we should have a good look at the spirit of the Amendment in so 

far as the Prime Minister is now being given the opportunity to select a Minister from  

outside  the  ranks  of  Parliament  if  the  Prime  Minister  deems  that  necessary.  Maybe 

there  would  be  a  Prime  Minister  in  the  future  who  would  dearly  like  to  have 

somebody  in  Cabinet  but  is  not  a  Member  of  Parliament,  then  this  Amendment  is 

giving the Prime Minister of the day an opportunity to get this person. I am looking at 

the  principle  here,  Mr  Speaker,  where  the  Prime  Minister  is  being  given  the 

opportunity  to  look  outside  of  Parliament.  I  support  the  principle  that  the  Prime 

Minister  first  looks  for  Ministers  from  among  the  Members  of  Parliament.    If  the 

Prime  Minister  thinks  that  there  are  six  Members  of  Parliament  that  could  become 

Ministers  then  that  will  be  the  end  of  it.    We  should  remember  that  this  is  an 

opportunity given to the Prime Minister. It may happen, there maybe a time when the 

Prime  Minister  will  not  be  able  to  find all six people from  within Parliament.  This 

gives the Prime Minister the opportunity to look outside of the parliamentarians. And 

</span><span>I don’t think that this is such a bad idea, Mr Speaker. I am saying, it would be unfair 

</span><span>for us to  confine the Prime Minister to Members of Parliament alone and this is the 

intention  of  the  Political  Review  Commission  -  to  allow  the  Prime  Minister to  look 

outside of Parliament. If we were to  restrict the Prime Minister, in my view, we are 

not being fair to the Prime Minister of the country and the people of the country as a 

whole.  We have to look at this situation because it might happen. There might be a 

time when the Prime Minister looks at his team and finds that he will not be able to 

find six people from amongst the Members of Parliament. We should give the Prime 

Minister the opportunity to look for a Member of Cabinet from outside of Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>We are not trying to belittle the system of the mother-Parliament in Britain, which we 

have used for a long time. Australia and New Zealand have also used this Westminster 

system but their situations are different to ours. They are bigger than we are, they have 

a  larger  number  of  Parliamentarians  from  which  the  Prime  Minister  can  select  his 

Cabinet. He or she has a wider choice from which to choose. Whereas we are smaller 

and  there  may  come  a  time  when  our  Prime  Minister  may  not  be  able  to  fill  his 

Cabinet from Members of Parliament alone. His or her choice is limited.  

</span></div><div><span>The eligible voters in this country number between 8-9,000 people. If we compare that 

to  25  Members  of  Parliament,  I  think  it  would  be  unfair  on  the  Prime  Minister  and 

also unfair on our people if we were to confine the Prime Minister to a choice of 25 

people to pick the number of Cabinet Ministers. Whereas we have a market place of 

</span><span>between  8-9,000  people  outside  that,  the  Prime  Minister  might  be  able  to  appoint  a 

</span><span>Cabinet  Minister  from.    Maybe  the  time  has  come  for  this  to  happen.  This 

Amendment is asking for the right of the Prime Minister to take one, one extra into his 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1461 

</span></div><div><span>Cabinet,  not  only  from  among  the  25  but  from  among  8-9,000  people  who  are  out 

there, who may be capable of taking up the position.  

</span></div><div><span>I  don’t  want  anybody to  misinterpret  what  I am  trying to  say, Mr Speaker. I am  not 

</span><span>saying that he ought to do it because the law requires him to do so, rather, it gives the 

Prime Minister the option to choose from outside should he need to. This will aid him 

in making the right choice for a Member of Cabinet to assist him in the difficult task 

of    carrying  out  his  responsibilities  to  the  nation.  I  am  not  trying  to  denigrate  the 

present system that we have, no! This is an attempt to improve it. We are not trying to 

get rid of the system, nor are we trying to replace it with a completely new one. We 

have seen it in operation for 33 years and we have felt its benefits. If we can improve 

upon it, we will. That is the spirit of what we are trying to do, which is why I support 

</span><span>this Amendment. We don’t want to go further beyond this on this subject. If we were</span><span>to ask the public’s opinion on this matter, I am afraid it would change the whole thing. 

</span><span>This  is  just  the  first  step  but  it  is  better  than  nothing.  Mr  Speaker,  I  think  it  will 

improve the present system.  

</span></div><div><span>We have heard the opinions of some of our  people over the radio, in the newspapers 

</span><span>and T.V. I don’t think we can ignore their views even thought they may be the views 

</span><span>of just a few people. We must also take their views into consideration for any plans 

that  we  may  develop  for  trying  to  improve  our  present  political  system.  This  is  the 

spirit  of  this  Bill  before  us,  Mr  Speaker,  it  is  trying  to  improve  our  present  system. 

That is why I support the principles and merits of this Bill, Mr Speaker, and I hope the 

rest of this House supports it also. Thank you,  Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you, Deputy Prime Minister.  Are there any further speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, to all Honourable Members in the House - Greetings.  

Kia Orana also to our people who are listening in to our debate.  

</span></div><div><span>the  Amendment  was  for 

</span></div><div><span>When I heard yesterday that there was a Constitution Amendment coming before the 

House,  I  was  happy  because  I 

the  13 

thought 

recommendation  put  forward  by  the  Commission  in  their  Report.  If  you  recall,  Mr 

Speaker, when I talked about  the recommendations there were many different views 

</span><span>expressed in  this House. Some of the recommendations were argued against and the 

</span><span>general  view was that these recommendations be returned to the people by way of a 

referendum. Mr Speaker, what I see is this, only one of these 13 recommendations has 

been  accepted  and  even  then,  it  has  been  modified.  It  does  not  come  into  force 

immediately, the new Government will implement it after the next elections.  

Mr Speaker, this is not what concerns our people - it is the number of Members and 

Cabinet and their salaries which is a problem for our people. They want the number of 

Members  reduced  as  well  as  their  salaries.  This  is  what  the  Commission  said  in  its 

Report.  

</span></div><div><span>When I listened to previous speakers, especially the Deputy Prime Minister, it seems 

</span><span>to me that it is the Prime Minister’s decision to bring whoever he wants from outside 

if he doesn’t find them all from within Parliament. Mr Speaker, this is what is wrong 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>1462 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>with us. We always look down upon ourselves, the Maori people. It disturbs me that 

the Prime Minister is able to get people from outside. This is why our country is in the 

mess  it  is  in  -  we  have  too  many  advisers  from  outside  who  are  close  to  the  Prime 

Minister.  The  Prime  Minister  accepted  their  advice,  which  is  why  we  ended  up 

bankrupt. This is why public servants were laid off. I have no problem if it is Temu 

</span><span>Okotai, Honu Ben or Apii Porio but I do have qualms with Papa’a whose advice is to 

</span><span>sack public servants. This is what </span><span>I am afraid of, that the Papa’a will come here and 

</span><span>take over the Government of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I do not have a problem with the first part of the Amendment, which is to reduce the 

number  of  Members  to  seven,  which  corresponds  with  the  recommendation  in  the 

Report.  The  second  part  is  where  I  have  a  problem,  that  is,  a  Member  can  be 

appointed from outside. But if this is what our people want, well, they are our boss in 

</span><span>this House. We have no choice but to accept what they want. I don’t recall this issue 

</span><span>being  discussed  in  our  Caucus  and  Joint-Caucus  meetings  so  it  surprises  me  that  it 

was included in this Amendment. The things that really concern our people, which is 

to  reduce  the  number  of  Members  and  salaries,  have  not  been  included  in  this 

Amendment.  I want you, Mr Speaker and our people to know that I will accept this 

Bill if this is what our people want. I don't think it is up to us to decide. It is up to the 

people to decide whether this Amendment is acceptable or not.  

</span></div><div><span>There  are  some  things,  which  can  be  changed  without  having  to  change  the 

Constitution. It  is  possible for the Prime Minister and Government to make changes 

today such as reducing the number of Ministers from eight, by asking one to stay out 

of Cabinet. It is that simple. Our Constitution says the number of Ministers may be 7 

to 9. It is very simple for the Prime Minister to reduce the number to seven today, in 

accordance with the wishes of the people. They can amend the Constitution at some 

later date. In order to reduce the salaries of the Ministers, there is no need to amend 

the Constitution. We only have to amend the Civil List. All of these things which the 

public is complaining about can easily be changed without changing the Constitution. 

</span><span>This  will be in  keeping with  the public’s w</span><span>ishes. However, there are some changes, 

which will require a referendum. Once that has been done, then the Constitution can 

be changed to accommodate them.  

</span></div><div><span>I  am  disappointed  because  many  of  the  recommendations  which  were  put  forward 

could  be  implemented  quite  readily  today  but  they  were  not.  Instead,  this  one  put 

forward  today  does  not  take  effect  until  the  next  Government,  after  the  General 

</span><span>Election  comes  to  power.  That  is  why  I  don’t  think  it  is  a  good  idea  to  bring  this 

</span><span>Amendment before this House today. It should be left to the next Government to make 

the changes in that case or it should be returned to the public in a referendum.  

</span></div><div><span>We shouldn’t just make the changes because, as mentioned in the Report, that Fiji has 

</span><span>two Ministers from outside of Parliament. Mr Speaker, these people were nearly shot 

</span><span>during Rabuka’s coup because of this. I don’t think we should follow Fiji’s example 

</span><span>because they have a terrible history. Their record of democracy is not a good one in 

</span><span>the  Commonwealth.  We  have  a  better  system  which  I  believe  we  should  stay  with. 

</span><span>Our  only  problem  is  the  Government  of  the  day.  It  is  incapable  of  carrying  out  its 

duties which is why we are in our present difficulties. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1463 

</span></div><div><span>I feel Mr Speaker, this Bill should go back to the people by way of a referendum so 

that we will know what they really want. I believe we should not rush this through. I 

think  this  Bill  should  be  returned  to  the  people  -  not  just  this  one  but  all  of  the 

recommendations - so that we can be certain of what the people want. We will  then 

know who is telling the truth - the Report  or the many Members who have criticised 

this Report in this House. Return it to the people so we will erase all doubts.  

</span></div><div><span>As I said earlier, Mr Speaker, there are some recommendations, which do not require 

amendments  to  the  Constitution.  The  number  of  Ministers  and  their  salaries  are 

examples. These are my thoughts on this Bill, Mr Speaker, thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister for Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Greetings to you, Greetings to the Prime 

Minister,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  colleagues  and  Government  Members. 

Greetings  also  to  the  Leader  of  the  Democratic-Alliance  Party,  Dr  Maoate  and  your 

assistant,  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party  and  all  Members  on  the  Opposition 

side, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>I rise to give my support to the principles and merits of the Constitution Amendment.  

Before I make my speech, Mr Speaker, may I seek your indulgence please, so  that I  

may  advise  the  general  public  that  the  SDA  Band  will  be  marching  the  streets  of 

Rarotonga  tomorrow.  I  would  like  to  call  upon  the  public  to  please  support  these 

people  and  their  fund-raising  effort.  Their  first  march  will  be  in  the  town  area  in 

Avarua between 12 and 1.00 p.m. The second march will be at 4.00 p.m. tomorrow, 

when the sun is starting to set and they will go around the island and return home to 

an umukai. 

</span></div><div><span>We the three Members of Aitutaki, are urging all the Members in this House to go out 

on the road and support this appeal. It does not matter where you will be on this island 

tomorrow, you will hear the band playing. Please excuse our use of air-time for this 

free advertisement but the details of this appeal will appear in a paid advertisement on 

T.V. tomorrow morning, and on the radio this evening and tomorrow morning.  Thank 

you, Mr Speaker, for your indulgence. 

</span></div><div><span>With regard to the Constitution Amendment before the House Mr Speaker, it is one of 

</span><span>the  recommendations  proposed  by  the  Commission  of  Political  Review  which  we 

Members  in  this  House  have  no  difficulty  in  accepting  and  making  it  a  part  of  the 

Constitution. In my observation, we are all generally agreed on the recommendation 

that the number of Cabinet Ministers be reduced. The problem area, as I see it, seems 

</span><span>to  be  the  Government’s  acceptance  that  the  Prime  Minister  may  look  outside  of 

</span><span>Parliament  for  one  Cabinet  Minister.  The  Commission  recommended that the Prime 

Minister  select  a  Member  of  the  Cabinet  from  outside  of  Parliament.  It  made  it 

compulsory for the Prime Minister to select one Cabinet Minister from outside. This 

</span><span>meant he had no option but to select one of the Cabinet from outside. This means five 

</span><span>Ministers  will  come  from  within  Parliament  and  one  from  outside.  That  means  Six 

Ministers altogether, plus the Prime Minister,  to make seven Cabinet Ministers.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>1464 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>The  Government’s  recommendation  says  that  the  Prime  Minister  may  make  the 

appointment from  outside. It  says he ‘may’, it does not say he ‘shall’ or ‘will’. This 

</span><span>means he has the discretion to choose whether he will look outside or not. This is the 

</span><span>difference in  the Government’s and the Commission’s recommendations.</span></div><div><span>We  have  told  you  that  Government  had  a  sub-committee,  which  looked  into  this 

Report by the Commission.   This subcommittee was enthusiastic and very supportive 

</span><span>of the spirit of change behind this Commission’s findings. So when it is claimed that 

</span><span>all  of  Parliament  opposes  any  changes,  such  as  the  recommendation  which  says  to 

take a Cabinet Member from outside, this is untrue. There are those of us who think 

that  this  will  be  a  good  thing,  that  is  if  the  Prime  Minister  wishes  to  exercise  this 

</span><span>option. We don’t want the Constitution to be a straitjacket on our administration. We 

don’t want  to  be restricted in our </span><span>movements within the system. If the Bill becomes 

law  and  it  gets  the  support  of  17  Members,  we  will  not  be  the  only  parliamentary 

democracy in the world with this sort of system in the selection of Cabinet Ministers. 

There are already other Parliaments in  the Pacific Region who practices this system. 

As mentioned earlier by the Honourable Member, Pupuke Robati, Fiji also does this. 

It has two Ministers  from outside of Parliament.  

</span></div><div><span>I  was  unhappy  when  the  Honourable  Member  for  Rakahanga,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati, 

criticised the political system of our friends in Fiji. This Member for Rakahanga has 

been  a  Prime  Minister  himself  yet  he  criticised  their  system  and  says  that  choosing 

Ministers from  outside of Parliament will cause people to come into this Parliament 

and aim guns at us. What kind of warped thinking is this? I feel sorry for him. He was 

a Prime Minister of this country and these are the wicked words that emerge from his 

</span><span>lips.  The  only  reason  he  says  this  is  because  of  Government’s  support  of  the 

</span><span>recommendation  put  forward  by  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  -  he  says  it  will  cause 

</span><span>friction, there will be violence and bloodshed. I can’t understand him. </span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  when  the  recommendation  to  reduce  Cabinet  and  the  right  to  choose  a 

Cabinet Member from outside was </span><span>brought before the seven of us in Cabinet, it didn’t 

</span><span>cause us too  much trouble, even despite the fact  that we are the people who will be 

most affected by changes. I want the people to know that if this recommendation by 

the Commission does not eventuate, t</span><span>hen don’t blame the Government for it because 

</span><span>we have tried to make it happen.  

</span></div><div><span>I am surprised by the Honourable Member, Norman George from Atiu’s comments </span><span>- 

this is a new Norman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>It’s because the Election is getting closer. </span></div><div><span>(Laughter) 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  he  is  like  a  stonefish.  While  in  Aitutaki,  I    went 

fishing in the lagoon and I saw a huge stonefish, which changed its colour when it was 

</span><span>disturbed. This is very much like the Member, Norman George, who is changing his 

</span><span>colour to please people.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Rubbish! 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1465 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span> I want the people to know that this man is a stonefish.  

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span> Changes like a rainbow.  

</span></div><div><span>HON.  N.  PUNA:</span><span>I’ll  repeat  </span><span>-  if  this  does  not  come  into  effect,  it  is  not  our  fault.  

Government has done its part and made this recommendation by the Commission as 

</span><span>an  amendment  to  our  law.  Don’t  blame  us  if  other  Members  in  this  House  have  a 

</span><span>different view. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, just because it is recommended that a Minister may come from outside of 

Parliament, doesn</span><span>’t mean that the Prime Minister is going to choose from outside. The 

</span><span>person  who  becomes  the  Prime  Minister  is  going  to  be  a  strong-minded  individual. 

Someone who is intelligent and will choose whom he thinks is the best person to help 

him  run  the  country.  He  will    not  allow  himself  to  be  restricted  by  the  law  in  the 

</span><span>choice that he makes. The spirit of this Amendment Bill is a good one and I don’t see 

</span><span>what  the  problem  is  if  the  Prime  Minister  chooses  to  exercise  his  right  to  choose  a 

Minister from outside of Parliament.   

</span></div><div><span>Maybe  after  the  next  General  Elections,  this  Parliament  will  be  full  of  teachers,  or 

maybe even doctors. The Opposition has three or four doctors but what will happen if, 

</span><span>by  the  remotest  chance,  they  became  Government?  We  don’t  want  five  do</span><span>ctors  to 

become Ministers. We want a teacher for the Ministry of Education, a lawyer for the 

Ministry of Justice and an economist for Development and Finance. That is what we 

must  do.  We  should  not  create  these  laws  for  our  benefit  today.  We  have  to  create 

these laws for the benefit of our people in the future. This is the way that we should be 

choosing our Members of Cabinet.  

</span></div><div><span>In closing, Mr Speaker, I would like to remind everybody to remember tomorrow, our 

young  people  will  be  going  around  the  island,  so  please  look  out  for  them.    Thank 

you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Can  I  have  the  next  speaker, 

please?  The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker. Kia Orana to you and your staff 

members.  Kia  Orana  to  the  Prime  Minister  and  your  Deputy,  to  all  Ministers  and 

Members  of  Government,  to  the  Leader  of  the  New  Alliance  Party,  the  Honourable 

Norman George, to the New Alliance Party Members and your supporters, and to us, 

Members of the Democratic Alliance Party on this side - Kia Orana.  Kia Orana also 

to our people listening in to us this afternoon.  Kia Orana in the name of Our Lord. 

</span></div><div><span>Through  you,  Mr  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  give  words  of  condolences  to  the  family 

that we spoke of yesterday, that of Poeau Vaea. The funeral was held this morning. 

To the family of Poeau Vaea in Avatiu, Ngatangiia and Muri, we would like to give 

</span><span>you  our  words  of  condolences  to  you  in  this  time  of  bereavement.  I  would  like  to 

</span><span>congratulate  the  daughters  of Poeau Vaea and their mother who brought  their father 

from New Zealand and took him all the way up to the hills where he now rests in a 

most beautiful location. I think it was worth bringing him back to this beautiful place 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>1466 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>and  I  would  like  to  congratulate  them  all.  At  this  stage  in  my  life  I  have  come  to 

appreciate  the  beautiful  view  from  the  hills,  of  the  Ngatangiia  lagoon.  As  a  young 

man,  I  did  not  appreciate  it  but  now  I  do,  especially  after  I  climbed  up  the  hill  and 

looked out. I really saw the beauty of this village of ours. 

</span></div><div><span>I  come  back  now,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  Amendment  of  the  Constitution  before  the 

House.  I would like to thank this Government, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet for 

coming  up  with  this  Amendment.  Our  people  have  been waiting in  anticipation, Mr 

Speaker,  for  some  actions  as  a  result  of  the  Report  of  the  Commission  of  Political 

Review, insofar as any amendments to the Constitution is needed to be done as soon 

as possible. We are running out of time.  

</span></div><div><span>When looking carefully at this Constitution Amendment, Mr Speaker, I see this as a 

mediocre  effort  by  this  government,  or  any  government  for  that  matter,  to  make 

changes before the next Election. This is not a major change. This Amendment change 

the number of Ministers of Cabinet.  Now we have a figure of seven or less.  As far as 

I can see, Mr Speaker, if there really is a need to have seven Ministers then this can be 

done immediately. Secondly, Mr Speaker, I see that this Amendment does not totally 

follow the recommendations of the Commission of Political Review.  

</span></div><div><span>As far as I can see Mr Speaker, the Commission on Political Review would like these 

changes  implemented  before  the  next  General  Election.    The  Amendment  that  we 

have  before  us,  will  not  be  effective  until  after  the  next  Election.  I  also  look  at  the 

issue of the requirement to have a Minister elected from outside of those who will be 

successful    in  the  General  Elections.  The  sort  of  person  the  Prime  Minister  will  be 

looking  for,  outside  of  Parliament,  will  be  someone  who  has  contested a  seat  in  the 

General Elections but was not successful. Alternatively, this person would be a good 

party  man  who  has  supported  the  PM  and  the  Party,  so  this  will  be  his  reward,  a 

Cabinet post. Or this could be an influential person from an influential family. These 

are the things, which could happen if we were to appoint a Minister from outside of 

the elected Members of Parliament. There are other disturbing scenarios, which may 

result from  this Amendment.  On the other hand, it would be possible to appoint  an 

ideal person, for example, as Finance Minister, an accountant who is good at financial 

management. But from my experience of the last 14 years in this Parliament and also 

in various Governments, I think it will be very hard for any Prime Minister to appoint 

somebody  from  outside  if  there  are  a  lot  of  good  people  to  choose  from  within 

</span><span>Parliament.  And I’m quite certain that there will be a lot of problems for the Members 

</span><span>of Government if this eventuates.   

</span></div><div><span>Personally,  I  cannot  support  this Amendment which allows a Cabinet Minister from 

outside  of  Parliament.  I  was  listening  to  the  comment  made  by  the  Honourable 

Minister of Education, the Honourable Ngereteina Puna, when he said that we should 

not make laws to suit ourselves.  I will have to agree with him </span><span>because I don’t believe 

</span><span>that we should make laws to suit ourselves, but we should make these laws to suit our 

people.   

</span></div><div><span>Looking  now,  Mr  Speaker,  at  the  last  part  of  this  Bill,  which  is  the  section  on 

Transition.  This  section  is  telling  us  that  during  and  after  an  Election  they  will  be  

allowed  to  stay  on  as  Government.  This  Amendment  is  being  tailor-made  by  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1467 

</span></div><div><span>Government of the day for themselves. If we read the summary of the Report of the 

Commission  of  Political  Review,  we  will see what  they recommend  in  paragraph 5.  

</span><span>So  I  don’t  want  the  Honourable  Minister,  Ngereteina  Puna  to  brag  that  they  are 

</span><span>following  the  recommendations  of  this  Political  Review  Commission.    Because,  Mr 

Speaker, this Report is telling us that in the period between elections, there should a 

Transition Committee appointed to run the country.  The recommendation is that the 

Speaker of Parliament will be the Chairman of this Authority, and the Prime Minister, 

the Public Service Commissioner and the Commissioner of Police will be members. 

This is what the Commission of Political Review is recommending. It is not what the 

Honourable Member Ngereteina Puna, is telling us. He should not twist things around.   

Clause 4 in the Constitution Amendment Bill does not follow the recommendations of 

the Commission of Political Review. What he says and what is written in this Report 

are two very different things.  

</span></div><div><span>So,  as  I  said,  Mr  Speaker,  this  is  just  a  way  for  this  Government  to  be  seen  to  be 

making some changes  although they are not  the changes that  were recommended by 

the Commission of Political Review.  As I have said time and time again, with regards 

to  the  recommendations  by  the  Commission  of  Political  Review,  in  so  far  as  they 

recommend a reduction of the number of Members of Parliament and reforms for this 

House, these are the things which I believe we should be doing. 

</span></div><div><span>There are some major issues in this Report, as I have said time and time again, which 

our people are expecting us to address, such as the Term of  Parliament. Our people 

are  wondering  what  we  will  do  about  this,  whether  we  will  disregard  the 

</span><span>Commission’s  recommendations,  or  follow  it,  or  make  up  our  own.  I  have  already 

</span><span>indicated the desire of the Democratic Alliance Party, which is a parliamentary term 

of four years. But if it is the will of the people that it be three years, then three years it 

will be. We have no qualms in accepting that. Before I sit down, Mr Speaker, I would 

like  to  say  that  my  own  personal  desire  was  a  parliamentary  term  of  three  years  so 

none of these problems will occur. In three years we will know readily whether we are 

in or out. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Health, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span> Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Firstly,  I would like to say Greetings 

</span><span>to  you  and  all  the  Parliamentary  staff,  and  all  Honourable  Members  in  the  House. 

</span><span>Greetings also to our people listening in. Greetings in the name of Our Lord.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  I  rise  to  give  my  strong  support  to  the  Constitution  Amendment.  Mr 

Speaker, we should thank the Honourable Prime Minister for coming up with this Bill 

at such short notice. It shows the people that we keep our promises to our people in 

fulfilment  of  their  wishes.  And  we  have  done  that,  because  if  we  had  waited  any 

longer, we would not have been able to in the future.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  we  all  met  in  this  House  and  discussed  the  Report  at  length.  We  all 

</span><span>agreed  that  there  are  some  things  in  this  Report  which  we can change and there are 

those  we  cannot.  This  is  one  of  the  recommendations  which  will  affect  the 

Constitution,  which  is  why  we  are  dealing  with  it  now  so  that  we  will  arrive  at  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>1468 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>Third Reading in March. Then there are those changes to laws which we have agreed 

in this House that we can make easily as we go along.  

</span></div><div><span>With  regards  to  the  parliamentary  term,  Mr  Speaker.  It  was  the  Government  of  the 

Opposition,  which  changed  it  and  made  it  difficult  to  make  changes  in  the 

Constitution. They themselves said  that they have created a law, which will make  it 

difficult to change the term of parliament. We cannot just get up and make a change to 

the Constitution to amend the term of Parliament as there is a requirement to have a 

referendum,  which  requires  a  two-thirds  majority  of  Cook  Islanders  to  support  it. 

Government agrees this is one of the things it will do. In the next elections it will ask 

the  people  whether  they  want  a  three-,  four-,  or  a  five-year  term.  The  will  of  the 

people is the one we will implement.  

</span></div><div><span>There  are  those  laws,  which  we  are  able  to  change  now  through  to  March,  because 

they are minor amendments. As expressed earlier by someone, parliamentary salaries 

can be adjusted through amendment of the Civil List. We are working on that and the 

Minister  responsible  for  the  Civil  List  will  make  the  necessary  adjustments.  As  the 

Minister who spoke earlier said,  we are not  worried. We know two of the Ministers 

will  lose  their  posts.  We  strongly  supported  the  recommendation  that  Cabinet 

Ministers should be reduced from nine to seven, but not limited to seven.  

</span></div><div><span>May  I  make  an  announcement  at  this  time?  The  Prime  Minister  is  trying  to  decide 

which  Departments,  after  the  HOMs  submit  their  Reports,  need  to  be  merged,  and 

which need to be on their own. The Prime Minister may decide, based on the Reports, 

how many ministers he needs. If the Prime Minister decides on 5 Ministers, then 4 of 

us will lose our ministerial posts.   

</span></div><div><span>In  Clause  2  of  this  Amendment,  I  am  pleased  to  hear  that  the  Prime  Minister  can 

</span><span>appoint another Minister from outside. As the Papa’a s</span><span>ay, it is optional. It is up to the 

Prime  Minister  to  decide  whether  to  make  an  appointment  from  within  or  from 

outside of Parliament. I think this is a challenge for us parliamentarians to consider. 

Although some Members have said that we are used to the Westminster system and all 

its aspects, that may be so. But if it is possible to modify the system for the better by 

incorporating  aspects  of  other  systems,  then  why  not?  For  me,  one  of  the  most 

important  aspects  of  this  concept  is  the  fact  that  this  Cabinet  Minister,  who  will  be 

appointed  from  outside,  will  be  like  an  adviser  to  Cabinet  on  matters  they  are  not 

knowledgeable  about.  We  have  seen  the  dramatic  effects  of  the  Reform  process, 

which  has resulted in the transparency we see today. The people who conducted this 

Reform were skilled and experienced. Mr Speaker, we should also be aware that there 

are  members  of  our  local  community  who  are  very  talented  and  who  should  be 

included in the running of the country.  

</span></div><div><span>These are my views, Mr Speaker. I rose to give my support and to ask the Members to 

</span><span>give their’s also. Kia Orana.</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister. Are there any other speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Tepure Tapaitau. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Greetings to you, Mr Speaker. To all your staff, to Members 

of  the  House,  the  Prime  Minister,  my  Cabinet  colleagues,  and  Members  of  the 

Opposition, Greetings to you all. Greetings also to our people who are listening in to 

our debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I rise to give my strong support for the Constitution Amendment before 

the House.  Mr Speaker, looking back to 1996, we will recall the Reform of the Public 

Service. We will recall that a lot of Public Servants were laid off because the Budget 

could  no  longer  afford  them.  The  idea  was  to  make  the  Budget  sustainable  and 

affordable.    Later,  Government  developed  the  idea  for  a  Commission  to  look  into  

Political Reform.  Cabinet followed this idea through with an Act of Parliament and 

three people were appointed to  do a review of  the political  system of this country. I 

was happy with what has occurred. Their Report has been Tabled in this House. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, when we look at the Commission’s Report, on Page 46, we will see that 

</span><span>the recommendations they proposed have been incorporated into the Bill which we are 

discussing today. The recommendations in this Report, Mr Speaker, came about as a 

result of the discussions the Commission had with our people. Their wishes were then 

transformed  into  the  Bill  before  us.  It  is  the  voice  of  the  people  asking  that  the 

Constitution be amended to suit their wishes. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I will not talk about the parliamentary term, or how the Democratic Party 

changed it, we have not reached that point yet. I want to talk about the principles of 

the  Bill,  one  of  which  is  that  the  number  of  Cabinet  Ministers  be  reduced  to  seven. 

And  within  that,  one  Cabinet  member  will  come  from  outside  of  the  Members  of 

Parliament.  The  Prime  Minister  will  make  that  appointment.  This  is  what  the  Bill  

before the House is about.  

</span></div><div><span>I am sure people who are listening will agree that their views which they put forward 

to the Commission are being met in this Bill. I am very happy about this and I strongly 

support it. I would like to congratulate the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and all of us in 

here.  I  am  sure  we  will  all  support  this  Bill.    I  am  happy  about  this,  Mr  Speaker, 

because these are the voices of my people and they can see that through this Bill, they 

are being heard. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Are there any further speakers?  I 

</span><span>will now call upon the Honourable Prime Minister for any comment and to close the 

</span><span>debate on the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. SIR G.A. HENRY:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana again to you and to 

all  Honourable  Members  in  this  House  and  Kia  Orana  to  our  people  listening  in.  

Firstly, I would like to thank everybody for the views that they have presented on this 

Bill before the House. We have listened to all the good views, to all the bad views and 

also the childish views.  

</span></div><div><span>I  go  back,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  views  or  the  excuses  presented  by  the  Honourable 

</span><span>Member Dr Terepai Maoate, and the Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati, for not 

supporting  this  Amendment  Bill.    As  I  listened  to  the  views  of  the  Honourable 

Member  Dr  Pu</span><span>puke  Robati,  he  used  the  Papa’a  as an excuse for his  views.  He has 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>1470 

</span></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>tried to alienate the Papa’a who work for us and he also use them as an excuse to go 

</span><span>against  the  last  part  of  this  Bill.  His  anger,  Mr  Speaker,  this  anti-</span><span>Papa’a    attitude  is 

</span><span>beyond  belief.  </span><span>The  Chief  Advisers  of  his  Party  today,  Mr  Speaker,  are  two  Papa’a 

</span><span>from the USA. I will leave it up to you to look at his childish behaviour.  Only they 

</span><span>should  have  Papa’a  advisers  but  nobody  else.  What  childish  behaviour  is  this,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker? And yet you can see that they have grey hair. Then they say we should not 

make  a  decision  now,  that  we  should  take  it  back  to  the  people  and  await  their 

decision. This is a more childish behaviour.  

</span></div><div><span>When  they  made  an  amendment  to  the  Constitution  in  1981  to  extend  the  term  of 

Parliament to five years, they never went back to the people to ask the people for their 

point of view. However, today, Mr Speaker, they are quick to tell us that we should 

take everything back to the people and if the people agree then we should  go ahead. 

</span><span>He  is  saying,  ‘why  are  we  rushing  to  make  a  decision  today,  saying  it  is  as  if  he  is 

afraid to make a decision. He asks, ‘why are we in such a hurry’? The simple answer 

</span><span>to this is the one that was presented to us by the Honourable Minister of Health. 

</span></div><div><span>In  March  next  year,  this  Parliament  will  be  dissolved  and  there  will  be  no  more 

Parliamentary sittings until after the General Election. This means that if there are any 

laws we want to make next year, we will not be able to after the month of March. And 

if  we  need  to  make  any  amendments  to  the  Constitution,  they  have  to  be  done  next 

week  because  if  we  leave  it  to  the  end  of  next  week,  it  will  be  too  late.  I  am  quite 

certain  that  my  colleague  understands  that  there  is  a  period  of  90  days  between  the 

Second  and  Third  Readings  of  any  Constitution  Amendment  and  the  90  days  will 

expire in the month of March.  So we must make these amendments now so that the 

</span><span>people who will be in power next year will be able to enforce these laws.  If we don’t 

</span><span>make these laws now, they will not be able to enforce them. Yes, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>I have been listening to the many different views that have been presented. The views 

from outside say that Cabinet should reduce its numbers. It is easy for you to say that  

because you are </span><span>not in Cabinet. Mr Speaker, it’s a lot tougher to say that if you are in 

Cabinet, say ‘yes, reduce the numbers’. That’s the greater challenge. I want people to 

</span><span>know that the present Cabinet of Ministers has agreed that their numbers be reduced. 

Look  at  this  spirit.    It  is  easy  for  outsiders  to  criticise.  As  far  as  I  can  see  the  only 

problem  with  this  Amendment  appears  to  be  the  fact  that  the  Prime  Minister  of  the 

day will be given the chance to appoint a Cabinet Minister from outside of Parliament 

if he or she wishes. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, a few days ago we heard the Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati, say 

that he examined this Report over and over. I am saying today that I am quite certain 

he has not gone past Page 5.  I think he is still on Page 4 but what can you say? The 

</span><span>man is old. It doesn’t take long and his eyes get blurry so he cannot read properly. He 

</span><span>would like our people to think that these are my recommendations and not those of the 

Commission. No.  

</span></div><div><span>I am certain that he has not examined this Report as well as he says he has. We will 

</span><span>not  discuss  this  any  further  because  this  recommendation  has  been  given  to  this 

House. It is up to the Honourable Members of this Honourable House to effect those 

changes and it cannot be done by anybody else. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> December 1998 

</span></div><div><span>1471 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to look at the Prime Minister of the future.  What would that 

person, who would be the leader of this country, think of the views of Members in this 

House today as he or she  reflects on the past? Will he or she think we planned for the 

long-term?  Or  whether  we  were  shallow?  Or,  were  we  people  who  were  backward 

thinking?   Mr Speaker, it was quite clear from the points of views of the 6-700 odd-

people who were interviewed, that they want the number of Members of Parliament to 

be  reduced.  Maybe  it  will  not  happen in  the very near future, but  I am  quite certain 

that one day the number of Members of Parliament will be reduced. The reason being, 

the Island Councils have begun to work in the Outer Islands and very soon we will see 

the Vaka Councils working on Rarotonga. The people will then see that the Island and 

Vaka  Councillors  will  be  doing  a  lot  of  work  and  that  the  Honourable  Members  of 

</span><span>Parliament will be doing less.  Soon a lot of our people will start asking, ‘what do the 

</span><span>Members of Parliament d</span><span>o?’ It will be then that the number of Members of Parliament 

</span><span>will be reduced, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>It  will  be  then,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the  Prime  Minister  will  have  to  look  at  a  smaller 

number  of  people  from  which  to  select  a  Cabinet.  We  cannot  know  today  what  the  

number of Members of Parliament will be, maybe it will be 15, maybe 14 or even 17 

</span><span>or 19. We don’t know. And if there are party elections at that time, then there will be 

</span><span>an even lesser amount of people from which to select a Cabinet.   

</span></div><div><span>Today, Mr Speaker, we know that there are a lot of young Maori people working in 

the  Public  Service  who  were  educated  overseas.  They  are  doing  very  well  in  the 

Public  Service  but  they  do  not  want  to  stand  for  Parliament. They would be able to 

carry out  the duties of a Minister but   the law is  telling us that we cannot appoint a 

Minister from outside of Parliament, we have to appoint from within Parliament.  This 

is  what  this  Bill  is  now  looking  at  -  at  the  way  the  future  leaders  of  this  country 

chooses his Cabinet Ministers so he can be assured of getting the best people for the 

job. How will that person select a Cabinet of Ministers so that they will be able to lead 

the  nation?  There  will  be  a  smaller  number  of  people  available  from  which  he  can 

pick  his  Cabinet  Ministers.  This  law  does  not  stipulate  that  he  must  go  outside  of 

Parliament and make an appointment from there. This Amendment is giving the Prime 

Minister  the option to choose. Whichever way he or she chooses to go when making 

this  selection, he or she will have to take full responsibility if anything goes wrong. 

</span></div><div><span>I’ll end here, Mr Speaker. I really wanted to speak on some of the points presented by 

</span><span>the Leader of the Opposition, who tried to cloud this issue, but because my time is up, 

I  will  have  to  end  here.  Mr  Speaker,  we  can  see  that  their  mistaken  views  and  

suspicions come from their American advisors. One American advises the Leader of 

the Opposition and the other one advises the Deputy-Leader. Thank you, Mr Speaker, 

Kia Orana and Kia Manuia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Prime Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be Now Read a Second time?
