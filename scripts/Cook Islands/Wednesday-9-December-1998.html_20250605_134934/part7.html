<div><span>COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:  </span><span>On  page  28  of  the  Report,  Mr  Speaker,  we  see  that  there  is  a 

recommendation  for  an  Authority  to  be  set  up  to  be  the  Government  until  a  new 

Government  is  elected.    Maybe  it  would  be  a  good  idea  to  include  this  in  this 

</span><span>Amendment.    Iâ€™ve  brought  this  up  because  we  know  from  past  experience,  after 

</span><span>Parliament  is  dissolved,  caretaker  Governments  tend  to  start  travelling  and 

squandering the funds of the country. That is why I say this.
