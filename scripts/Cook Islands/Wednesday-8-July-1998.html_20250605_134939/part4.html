</span></div><div><span>587 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 6 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  you,  to  all 

Honourable  Members  of  the  House,  Kia  Orana  also  to  our  people.    I  would  like  to 

extend words of Greeting to Mama Ruta Tinomana and Papa Tinomana in Puaikura, 

for  their  50th  wedding  anniversary  today.    I  am  sure  God  will  enrich  you  with  the 

blessings of your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren today in celebrating 

the happy anniversary that you have achieved together as man and wife. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to extend a Kia Orana to all the staff of the Health Department, those who 

are on Rarotonga working for the Health Service, and also those in the outer islands. 

</span></div><div><span>I also extend a Kia Orana to all the staff of the Tourism and Transport Ministry as well 

as Civil Aviation.  Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Before we adjourned yesterday, Mr Chairman, I was telling the House that I stood to 

respond  to  some  questions  raised  by  some  Members  of  the  House.    A  particular 

question was directed to this Clause 6, dealing with reception facilities at the Port of 

Avatiu.    The  question  was,  why  wasn't  Government  providing  such  facilities  at  this 

Port?    In  brief,  Mr  Chairman,  Government  saw  fit  to  work  in  line  with  its  reform 

policies, and Government saw fit that this should be an opportunity that can be taken 

up by private enterprise to set up such facilities.  It should not necessarily be a ship-

owner  or  a  tank-owner  who  should  provide  such  facilities,  but  any  person  with  a 

business  mind  can  erect  such  facilities  at  the Port.  I believe that, gone are the days 

when we depended on Government to provide almost all services for public use. 

</span></div><div><span>In  Sub-Clause  (2)  of  Clause  6,  Mr  Speaker,  it  gives  the  optional  power  to  the 

Secretary  to  give  the  right  to  any  private  person  or  organisation  that  wishes  to 

establish such facilities.  Under the issuing of such approval, the application for such 

facilities  must  comply  with  the  requirements  of  MARBLE  1973  and  1978,  which is 

the international company dealing with regulations and laws of marine pollution in the 

world.  However, as I mentioned yesterday, there is already an incineration plant at the 

</span><span>airport that can be used for burning of pollutants if no such facilities are available at 

</span><span>the harbour.  That is all I wish to explain, Mr Chairman, on this Clause 6. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 6 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 7 : Duty to Report Discharges. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>588 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 7 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 8 : Duty to Report Threatened Discharges. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 8 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 9 : Records. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 9 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 10 : Powers of Inspection. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 10 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I stood up to explain this Clause 

because a question has been asked concerning it.  This Clause talks about the Powers 

of Inspection, in which the Secretary is empowered to appoint a qualified person to be 

an Inspector.  The question that was asked, is there any such person that is qualified to 

be  appointed  into  such  position  locally.    Well,  there  are  two  sorts  of  technical 

</span><span>qualifications that will fit.  The person either be a qualified Captain or a Navigator, or 

</span><span>he could also be a qualified engineer on any marine boat or sea boat.  At present, we 

have a qualified person who is performing the responsibilities of this position and that 

</span><span>is Captain Don Silk.  But like I said, it doesn’t have to be at that level of qualification, 

</span><span>it could  also  be a qualified engineer.  One of our local engineers can also qualify to 

take the responsibilities of this appointment.  As stipulated under this Clause, such an 

Inspector will have wide powers to go on boats and inspect boats in terms of disposal 

facilities  on  the  boats.    He  is  also  empowered  to  look  at  the  safety  measures of any 

boats  and  the  standard  of  facilities  in  the  boats,  whether  they  are  in  line  or  comply 

with  requirements  of  safety  of  any  vessel.    If,  in  his  opinion,  that  the  failure  of  any 

facilities could provide danger to the persons or property, then it is within his right to 

detain that ship. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>589 

</span></div><div><span>That is all I have to explain.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Are there any further 

speakers?   

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 10 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Part III : Dumping and Incineration of Waste. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 11 : Application of this Part. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 11 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 12 : Dumping or Incineration without a Permit. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Since  it  has  been  very  quiet 

with regard to going through the Clauses, I just wondered whether all the Government 

</span><span>Members are asleep.  Oh, they are saying it’s because of </span><span>the rain.   

</span></div><div><span>Clause 12, Mr Chairman, deals with dumping or incinerating without a permit.  It is 

not  just  throwing  the  rubbish  away.    It  is  also  dealing  with  burning  the  rubbish.  

However, under this Clause, there is a mention of Article 4 of the London Dumping 

</span><span>Convention.    Honestly,  Mr  Chairman,  I  don’t  even  know  what  this  Convention  has 

</span><span>passed, what sort of a resolution they have passed, in order for me to understand what 

should  take  place.    What  are  the  conditions  of  this  Permit?  I  would  like  to  ask  the 

Honourable  Member,  Paora  Teiti,  to  explain  that  because  I  understand  he  fully 

</span><span>understands these Clauses.  So, I think it is important that we understand at least what 

</span><span>the conditions are required for a permit to be given.  Because if the ship gets back and 

it  has  a  bucket  of  some  food  waste  that  needs  to  be  destroyed  properly,  and  not  be 

taken to feed to the pigs, I want to know what sort of conditions the Permit has to deal 

with. 

</span></div><div><span>However, Mr Chairman, I am sure this deals with waste oil that may be discharged at 

places in the ocean that will be safe, and perhaps the Convention has those conditions 

that will be part of the conditions for the Permit being given out.  However, if that is 

</span><span>not  properly  done  under  the  Permit  system,  as  required  under  this  Clause,  then  the 

</span><span>owner is liable to a fine of not more than $100,000.  The Permit must make sure that 

the  dumping  and  incineration  of  the  waste  from  these  vessels  or  platforms,  is  done 

according to the Permit. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>590 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>This particular area seems to cover aircraft as well, so it is likely that any dumping of 

waste  from  aircraft  is  also  covered  by  this  Clause.    It  will  be  a  very  interesting 

situation,  I  imagine,  if  an  aircraft  flying  over  our  wide  ocean  where  there  is  no  one 

around, how can we monitor, how can we find out  about  it, how can it be reported, 

and how can we come to the conclusion that such an aircraft has dumped waste in that 

sort of situation? 

I thought I would raise the concern here, Mr Chairman, perhaps there might be some 

simple explanation as to what this London Dumping Convention is, under the Clause, 

as mentioned here.  Thank you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Member.  Our next speaker is the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati.  </span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Good afternoon, Mr Chairman, to you and to all your staff. 

</span></div><div><span>Looking through this Clause I see that our standards will be similar to those of Great 

Britain.  This is a great step forward for us on the international scene.  Although a lot 

of  our  laws  originated  from  there,  our  standards  are low, particularly  the by-laws  of 

each  of  the  islands.    Maybe  this  is  the  reason  that  the  Honourable  Member,  Paora 

Teiti, told us that the water in the Tereora septic tank is okay to drink if it is treated.  

These are new standards being introduced into our country.  I think it is a good idea 

that  Government,  or  the  Honourable  Minister,  finds  a way to  build an incinerator at 

the harbour in Avatiu instead of giving the project, straight away, to the private sector.  

The latter has been the case in many instances these days, with Government struggling 

to  do things without the necessary funding, hence handing things over to the private 

</span><span>sector.  Government shouldn’t wait until someone from the private sector sets up an 

</span><span>incinerator,  coinciding  with 

invites  competition  between 

theirs,  which  only 

Government and that private enterprise.  I am exhorting Government, should someone 

from the private sector set up an incinerator, to step aside and leave this person to do 

the work. 

</span></div><div><span>Today  there  is  no  incinerator  at  the  Avatiu  wharf.    It  could  be  a  good  idea  that 

Government initially set up a small incinerator and then in future give it to the private 

sector to build a bigger one.   

</span></div><div><span>I don’t support the idea that we use the existing incinerator at the airport as it is for the 

</span><span>airport and should be used by them only.  There should be one situated at the wharf 

for the convenience of ships or vessels wanting to use it immediately.  Thank you, Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I only stood up to respond to the 

query by the Leader of the DAP in regards to the definition of the London Dumping 

Convention.    That  protocol  is  mentioned  under  the  next  section.    At  the  moment  I 

</span><span>haven’t been advised on it, I am still waiting for that information to be passed on to 

</span><span>me.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>591 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Minister.  The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 12 Stands Part of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed. 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 13 :  Offence to transport nuclear waste and other radioactive matter. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Robert Woonton. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  R.  WOONTON:</span><span>    Kia  Orana  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  and  to  all  the  Honourable 

Members  of  this  House.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our  people  listening  in  on  this  rainy 

afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I would like to support this Clause which bans the transport and storage 

of  nuclear  waste  in  Cook  Islands  waters  or  territory.   If I recall correctly, it was the 

Treaty  of  Rarotonga  which  was  signed  in  Rarotonga  some  years  ago  to  ban  nuclear 

testing  in  the  Pacific.    Quite  recently  some  of  the  super-powers  have  become 

signatories  to  that  treaty.    However,  I  have  some  reservations  especially  with  the 

Minister not being able to explain to us what the London Dumping Convention is all 

about.   

</span></div><div><span>If  you  recall,  New  Zealand  went  through  a  period  of  chaos  when  they  banned 

American  nuclear-powered    warships  entering  New  Zealand  waters.    Not  only  the 

nuclear  warships  but  the  also  the  nuclear  submarines  which  belonged  to  the  United 

States Navy.  So, my question to the House is, do we have any provisions that in times 

of  war  we  will  have  to  accept  nuclear-armed  ships  and  submarines  to  enter  our 

waters? As far as our defence is concerned, we are part  of the ANZUS organisation, 

the  Australia-New  Zealand-American  defence  pact.    If  we  are  to  stop  any  nuclear 

ships  entering  our  waters  then  we will be seen as  being against our allies.  I merely 

want o pose the question to the House- what provisions do we have in case war breaks 

out.  Do we remain completely nuclear-free or are we going to support our allies who 

have nuclear capabilities? I have no difficulties at all from the banning of dumping or 

storage of nuclear wastes in our country.  That should not be allowed to take place.   

Let's  face  it,  Mr  Chairman,  quite  recently  the  Indian  and  Pakistani  Governments 

</span><span>exploded  nuclear  devices.    The  technology  to  develop  nuclear  weapons  is  freely 

</span><span>available on the Internet nowadays.  While my concern at this time seems far-fetched, 

there is a possibility that nuclear warfare could develop and what is the Cook Islands 

stance when it comes to that time? 

</span></div><div><span>Perhaps  the  Minister  may  clarify  what  Government's  position  is  with  regard  to  the 

passage of nuclear-powered submarines and vessels through our waters?  Thank you, 

Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Dr Terepai Maoate.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>592 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>   Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Now the Bill is dealing with 

the very offensive waste material and that is nuclear waste.  How is this waste going to 

affect our waters?  This Clause talks about prevention.  It ensures that nuclear waste is 

not to be dumped into our waters.  Really, it is not allowed to transport nuclear waste 

and other radioactive material, through our waters.  Because when this happens, one 

or  two  things  could  happen  and  that  is,  there  could  be  an  accident  and  the  waste  is 

spilled into our waters.  Secondly, the vessel could just dump it into our waters.  Any 

of these two things can happen, either by accident or intentionally. 

</span></div><div><span>But what is the consequence of this?  Do our people realise what the consequences to 

this are because this is nothing similar to garbage or sewage, nothing at all similar to 

that.  This has radioactive material which cannot be seen by the human eye but it will 

go through the waters, it will go through the living creatures in the waters which could 

be consumed by human beings.  The effect of this if it becomes spilled or dumped into 

our waters, there is a direct effect of radioactivity into our people, either directly onto 

the skin, through the water they drink.  This could be evaporated from the ocean into 

the air and dropped back into our water supply.  Of course, as I mentioned, it could  

contaminate the fish from the ocean which we eat such as tuna and so forth. 

</span></div><div><span>The diseases we can get from radioactive contamination through these waste materials 

are  mostly  cancer  type  illnesses.    You  get  skin  cancer,  blood  cancer,  bone  cancer, 

organ  cancer  and  many,  many  types  of  cancers  you  can  get  from  radioactivity  and 

radioactive materials.  Those who are in contact with waste materials will immediately 

show the consequences  of that in  a short duration.  But those who get contaminated 

with  waste  material  through  the  food  chain,  the  effects  will  show  some  time 

afterwards.  For those who have seen recordings or video tapes of the surveys of the 

islands  in  the  Pacific,  that  have  had  nuclear  bombs  tested  on  them  by  the  British, 

Americans  and  French,  they  all  have  signs  and  effects  of  nuclear  contamination  to 

human beings in those areas.  It is frightening, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>One of the saddest things about the contamination to human beings, Mr Chairman, is 

that it goes through the genes.  Children will be born with birth defects, loss of limbs, 

cleft-palates,  one  eye  only,  all  sorts  of  congenital  defects  as  a  result  of  this  kind  of 

contamination.   

</span></div><div><span>The point I am trying to drive at, Mr Chairman, is for people to be fully aware of what 

</span><span>the consequences of nuclear wastes are to human beings.  I would like us to give full 

</span><span>support to anything that will stop nuclear waste-dumping, nuclear waste transporting 

and nuclear bomb-testing next to us, because it can reach us.  We should be seen to be 

fully committed, not half-hearted. 

</span></div><div><span>I congratulate the Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka, he was not a Minister at the 

time, and the Honourable Member Mataio Aperau, who both went near the site where  

</span><span>the French nuclear tests were being carried out, as a protest against France’s nuclear 

</span><span>weapons testing in Moruroa.  Well, it did not mean that we did not want to be part of 

that protest.  We offered to go with that protest but we were not given the opportunity 

to  be  on  the  protest  vaka.    I  volunteered  to  go  on  the  canoe  with  the  Honourable 

Mataio  Aperau  but,  Mr  Chairman,  the  sad  thing  about  it  was,  while  these  two 

Honourable Members were out there protesting, the Prime Minister was having a good 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>593 

</span></div><div><span>chat  with  Gaston  Flosse,  President  of  French  Polynesia.    We  expected  the  Prime 

Minister to make a strong statement against French nuclear testing, but he never did.  

Instead, he gave a statement to the likeness of supporting the French Government for 

</span><span>what  they  had  been  doing  to  their  own  benefit,  to  the  extent  of  saying,  “that’s  their 

</span><span>business.  One cannot influence their de</span><span>cision.  We cannot tell them what to do.”</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Point of Order, Mr Chairman.  Irrelevancy in Debate. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  What is your Point of Order Honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Irrelevancy in Debate.  Clause 13 is not talking about nuclear 

tests.    It  is  not  talking  about  French  nuclear  testing.    It  is  talking  about  transporting 

nuclear waste and other radioactive matters.  You will notice, Mr Chairman, I did not 

interfere  earlier  on,  because  I  thought  it  was  just  passing  comments.    But,  when  he 

tried to stay on that point and create an argument, I felt it was time to pull him down.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Deputy Prime Minister.  The Point of Order is quite 

in order Honourable Member, so I will call upon the Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate 

to come back to the Clause of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    I  was  really  trying  to  put  the 

emphasis  on  the  importance  of  the  issue  of  any  material  that  is  nuclear  capable 

because that is the very thing, whether it came from a nuclear bomb explosion or from 

being transported or from being dumped, it is the same, it is very damaging and it is 

very frightening, Mr Chairman.  What I am trying to highlight here, Mr Chairman, is  

that we  must have a sense of responsibility when it comes to these issues.  Because 

when  these  things  happened our people demonstrated along the street  and protested.  

</span><span>Some  people  said  France  won’t  be  able  to  see  us,  England  won’t  be  able  to  see  us, 

America won’t be able to see us protesting.  What’s the point?  Even our Leaders were 

</span><span>telling our people that. 

</span></div><div><span>We are on the Clause of Transportation of Nuclear Waste, Mr Chairman.  But what I 

am talking about is the effect of nuclear contaminated materials, the nuclear capability 

of atomic bombs and the sorts.  These things emit radioactivity  which is damaging to 

human beings.  Believe me, Mr Chairman, the people of this country must know the 

effect of the nuclear waste.  Nuclear waste and radioactive from these materials is very 

dangerous  to  human  life.    The  Chernobyl  nuclear  power  station  explosion in  Russia 

has  demonstrated  the dangerous effect  of radioactivity.  Throughout  the surrounding  

areas, extending to thousands of miles away the impact of the nuclear explosion and 

the radioactive materials from the nuclear power supply was felt.  That is not the only 

example of releases of radioactive materials from accidents.  Any accident is possible, 

whether  it  is  in  the  transportation  of  waste  material  through  our  waters  or  boats 

carrying  nuclear  wastes  to  Japan  or  somewhere  else  as  we  have  experienced  in  the 

past,  any  accident can happen.  And an accident on a transport carrying this nuclear 

</span><span>waste material is a war in itself to our people. 

</span></div><div><span>I am sure most of us have seen our relations suffer from cancer.  When somebody gets 

cancer  and  it  is  beyond  treatment,  they  hardly  survive,  Mr  Chairman.    So  I  am  just 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>594 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>hoping,  Mr  Chairman,  that  our  support  to  this  Bill,  particularly  with  regard  to  the 

disposal, the transportation of nuclear waste, should be wholesome, not just by us but 

inclusive of all the people of the Cook Islands.  We should not be double minded just 

merely because we have no resources.  If we are to go to France begging for loans or 

go  to  the  United  States  for  money  to  assist  us  during  thes</span><span>e  hard  times,  let’s  not  be 

</span><span>diverted and manipulated.  We must be genuine in our understanding, in our aims and 

objectives  in  supporting  this  bill.    I  understand  all  Government  Members  are  in 

support of this Bill.  I would like to see this support at all times.  Whenever there is a 

transportation of waste material through our waters or whenever there is a bomb test 

next to us - in whatever way  nuclear waste material affects us, we must have a united 

support to protest. 

</span></div><div><span>That is all I have to say for now.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  your  staff  and  Honourable 

Members in this House and our people listening in to our debate this afternoon - Kia 

Orana to everyone.  I think it is a day of rejoicing  Mr Chairman, especially with the 

downpour  of  rain.    I  think  we  all  should  thank  God  for  blessing  us  and  for  the 

encouragement in the message by the Pastor this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I stand in support of the Clause 13 of our Bill.  One or two points that 

</span><span>concerned me, Mr Chairman.   In Part I of this Clause it reads, “No nuclear wastes or 

</span><span>other  radioactive  matter  in  whatsoever  form  or  condition  shall  be  transported  by  a 

</span><span>vessel  or  platform  into  Cook  Islands  waters  ...”    I  think  that  is  very  clear,  Mr 

</span><span>Chairman.    The  phrase  speaks  for  itself  that,  no  nuclear  waste  or  radioactive  matter 

whatsoever,  in  whatever  form  they  come  in,  shall  not  be  transported  in  the  Cook 

Islands waters.  What concerns me though, Mr Chairman, is under Sub-Section 2, in 

</span><span>Clause (a), it reads, “any nuclear waste or other radioactive matter,... taken on board 

</span><span>any  vessel  or  aircraft  in  the  Cook  Islands,  or  in  Cook  Islands  Waters;  ...[for  the 

purpos</span><span>e  of  dumping  or  incineration]”.    Mr  Chairman,  I  just  hope  that  we  never  get 

</span><span>into the situation that has been outlined in this Clause.   

</span></div><div><span>I  think  one  can  appreciate,  Mr  Chairman,  the  fact,  as  we  all  know,  of  the  global 

</span><span>concern  for  transport  or  for  the  use  of  nuclear  powers  and  so  forth.    We  are  no 

</span><span>exception  in  the  Cook  Islands.    We  are  now  experienced  with  the  nuclear testing in 

Moruroa, Tahiti and our fear and concern for the consequences of those nuclear tests.  

I think the important part, Mr Chairman, is the fact that we are putting in place a law.  

With the intention of protecting ourselves in the event of the likelihood of these events 

happening in our waters.   

</span></div><div><span>I  am  not  sure  what  we  had  in  place  in  terms  of  laws  before  this  Bill  came  to  this 

House.  But one must admit that it has always been a concern of this country.  And the 

</span><span>nation of our magnitude, of our size, how we rely on bigger countries to support us in 

</span><span>our  fight  for  combatting  all  these  nuclear  tests  close  to  our  home.    I  think  everyone 

appreciates the speech by Dr Maoate in regards to the consequences of the effects of 

nuclear  waste  and  so  forth  to  the  health  of  the  people.    There  have  been  wide 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>595 

</span></div><div><span>publications on the effects of nuclear waste to the life of the people.  Rightly so, we 

should  be  concerned  with  what  the  French  have  done  with  the  nuclear  testing  on 

Moruroa.    The  point  that  I  am  trying  to  raise,  Mr  Chairman,  is  this  Bill  is  trying  to 

establish a law that we did not have before, with the sole intention of protecting our 

country from this kind of event happening within our waters.   

</span></div><div><span>I am surprised that Dr Maoate did not speak on the fine or the penalties.  These have 

been  an  issue  in  other  Clauses  previous  to  this.    But  I  am  sure  he  will  agree  that  a 

million dollars does not compare to what we may suffer in the event of nuclear wastes 

being  spilt  in  our  country.    A  million  dollars  will  not  buy  our  lives.    So  I  see  the 

importance of this Bill, Mr Chairman.  The protecting of our country, of our people, of 

our lives.  In making sure that these boats or vessels or aircraft do not come anywhere 

</span><span>near our waters in case these accidents do happen.  It has happened.  It isn’t for me to 

say  it  wouldn’t  happen  here.    Here  we  are  in  this  House  today  trying  to  establish 

</span><span>something to prevent this type of event, or consequences from happening in the Cook 

Islands.  Mr Chairman, they should never be allowed through our country.  We are too 

small.    We  are  too  fragile.    Christmas  island  and  smaller  countries  who  have  had 

nuclear bombs blasted on their islands, we know the consequences that those people 

are going through today.  If we want to remain a paradise, we need not have all these 

kinds of things to destroy it.   

</span></div><div><span>Tourism  is  one  that  we  would  like  to  promote  and  improve  the  economy  of  this 

country,  then  this  type  of  activity  need  not  be  in  our  waters  or  in  our  country.    I 

happened  to  be  in  Tahiti  at  the  time  when  the  Honourable  Members  Mataio  and 

Tupou  Faireka,  the  Minister,  arrived  in  Tahiti.    I  was  there  at  the  time  of  the  peace 

protest, or peace marches by the people on the streets of Tahiti.  I was there to witness 

the  marching  by  the  people  and  realised  how  they  felt  towards  the  nuclear  testing 

carried out  at  Moruroa.  In fact, I was there to officially welcome our Vaka crew.  I 

felt a little resentment from the officials in Tahiti about my being there to welcome the 

protest Vaka and its crew in Papeete that very morning.  I was honoured to be there to 

welcome our protest Vaka, the Captain and his crew, and to be part of that delegation 

in a peace protest against the nuclear testing conducted by the French.  Mr Chairman, I 

again would like to support this Clause with the hope that we never get to this stage.  

The  main  thing  is  having  put  in  place  something  to  prevent  these  events  from 

happening,  from  taking  place  in  our  own  Cook  Islands  waters,  and  our  own  Cook 

Islands country.  Again, I would like to stress my point that I support this Clause to the 

extent and hope that we will never witness events of this nature where these boats may 

cross our territory or our waters, especially carrying nuclear waste from one country to 

another.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    The  Honourable  Minister, 

Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    Firstly,  I  would like to  share the 

sentiments  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition,  Dr  Woonton  and  Dr  Maoate,  in 

</span><span>expressing  the  side  effects  or  the  bad  effects  of nuclear waste.  However, in  putting 

</span><span>those  sentiments  to  rest,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  assure  them  that  under  this 

provision there is no nuclear waste carried or stored on any boat or vessel which can 

pass  through  the  Cook  Islands.    To  enlighten  the  Members  of  Parliament  and  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>596 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>people  listening  in  to  this  broadcast,  it  has  been  confirmed  so  I’ll  explain  what  the 

</span><span>Article 4 of the London Dumping Convention is.  Article 4 states that: 

</span></div><div><span>“1)  The contracting parties shall prohibit the dumping of any waste or other 

matter with the exception of those listed in Annex 1.”  </span></div><div><span>These are the items of Annex 1: 

</span></div><div><span>“1)  Drudge m</span><span>aterial; 

2)  Sewage sludge; 

3)  Fish waste or material resulting from industrial fish bones; 

4)  Vessels and platforms of any other man-made structure at sea; 

5)  Inert, organic or geological material; 

6)  Organic material of natural origin; 

7)  Bulk</span><span>y items primarily comprising of iron, steal, concrete and similar;”</span></div><div><span>So  unless  any  dumping  is  in  line  with  these  items  I  have  just  mentioned  -  nuclear 

waste and other material of this kind, they are not allowed to be transported or carried 

in  any  aircraft,  any  vessel  in  Cook  Islands  waters.  Sub-Section 3 of Clause 13 also 

mentions  other  non-radioactive  wastes.    So  apart  from  those  mentioned  and  those 

which I have read out, itemised in Article I, definitely nuclear waste is not allowed to 

be transported within our waters.   

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  is  the  fact  that  these  are  the  only  two  Sections  of  the  Bill  that  carry  a 

maximum penalty of up to $1 million in fines.  This sort of fine is targeted at offences 

relating to nuclear wastes.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable    Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I rise to support the views expressed by 

former speakers in regards to  the danger from the effects of  nuclear waste.  When I 

considered  this  matter,  I  felt  that  the  damage  from  oil  spillage  in  the  harbour  of   

$500,000  or  two  years  in  prison  has  very  little  difference  compared  to  the    fine  for 

dumping of nuclear waste which is  $1 million only.  $500,000 is only half that for oil 

spillage.    That  is  not  sufficient  to  deter nuclear vessels carrying nuclear through our 

</span><span>waters.  In our country today in any murder case a person must go to prison for 7 years 

</span><span>and  yet,  we  are  imposing  a  fine  of  two  years  for  the  spillage  of  oil  plus  a  fine.  

Whereas for nuclear waste dumping there is a fine only and no gaol term.  I believe 

that if any owner of a boat  tries to bring nuclear waste through our waters he should 

be arrested and put into prison for the rest of his life.  In this case, the livelihood of 

our  people  cannot  be  purchased  with  money.    The  least  they  can  do  is  to  serve  life 

sentences in prison.  They should stay in there for the rest of their lives.   

</span></div><div><span>I have been waiting for an answer from the Minister in regard to warships armed and 

</span><span>powered  by    nuclear  energy.   Are we going to  allow them to  come here?  I want  to 

</span><span>know?  This is a very hard question to answer.  I think our people would like to hear 

the answer because whether it will be wholeheartedly or just lips service, we need to 

know.  I don't want  the members of this House to be opposed to these activities while 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>597 

</span></div><div><span>the leaders of this country have another agenda.  We are just talking about the negative 

side of nuclear waste.  I would like to ask the Minister whether he has investigated the 

positive  side  of  any nuclear material  because the French are using it, the Americans 

are using it, the British are using it and more recently the Indians and Pakistanis are 

using  it.    So  there  must  be  something  good  about  it.    Maybe  there  are  some  good 

attributes  in  the  use  of  these  materials.    Maybe  that  is  why the fine is  confined to  a 

minimum.  Government should tell us.  I am sure our people would like to know  the 

potentials  in  nuclear.    We  are  just  a  small  nation  and  who  are  we  to  go  up  against 

countries like India, Pakistan, China, that are giving us a helping hand.  So who are we 

to  protest  against  these  super  powers?    However  if  it  is  true  that  the  effects  are 

detrimental to the people of this country then I would like us to support this Bill and to 

protest against the use, storage and the disposal of nuclear, even if we are so  small.  

We should not just protest for the sake of protesting as was the case in the recent past 

but we should protest vigorously like the young person who burnt the French flag.  I 

believe  it  is  Government's  duty  to  find  out  the  facts    on    this  matter.    Our  protest  

should not be like the two Government members who travelled to Moruroa to indicate 

their position and yet when it came to the crunch right here in the Cook Islands, they 

backed off.  I think we should all vigorously protest any transportation or dumping of 

nuclear waste in our country.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you Sir.  Kia Orana also to 

the Honourable Members of the House, the staff of this House and to our people who 

are listening in this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I rise to present my views on Section 13 which I believe is an important 

Clause to the Bill.  But before I go on to the Clause, I would like through you to send 

my condolences to some of the families who have lost loved ones in the recent past.   

</span></div><div><span>First  of all to  Mama Mereana Paulo,  the family and the children, our sympathies go 

out to you in the loss of our loved one.  This lady is a relation of mine and therefore 

this is our tragedy. 

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  to  the  family  and  children  of  Papa  Koro  Mokotupu,  may  the  Lord's 

</span><span>blessings be with us all during these sad times we are going through.  Maybe we all 

</span><span>know  Mama Ana who passed away a long time ago and it is  just recently that Papa 

Koro passed away.  This gentleman was an older brother to Dr Koekoe Mokotupu and 

I  would  like  to  again  send  on  behalf  of  myself,  my  wife  and  my  family  our 

condolences to the two families who are at the moment bereaving. 

</span></div><div><span>I think this is an important Clause in this Bill insofar as it tries to prevent the transport 

of nuclear waste and other radioactive matter through our Cook Islands waters.  There 

are two sides, Mr Chairman, to  nuclear energy.  There is  the good side.  It provides 

</span><span>power  and  energy  for  the  population  of  countries  who  use  nuclear  power,  that  is 

</span><span>nuclear electricity.  That is one of the good things we can derive from nuclear energy.  

I have heard and also read in places that if we were to have a nuclear power station.  

the  cost  of  electricity  would  be  a  lot  cheaper  to  us  than  it  is  costing  us  to  get  our 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>598 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>electricity from diesel generators.  A few years ago I read in a Pacific magazine that 

the King of Tonga wanted to build a nuclear power station for his people for this same 

reasons I have pointed out.  Because it is so much cheaper to pay for electricity that is 

nuclear generated rather than pay for electricity that is diesel generated.  Mr Chairman, 

this is one of the good benefits of nuclear energy and  what the Lord wants us to have 

are  the  good  things  in  life.    But  you  know,  Mr  Chairman,  this  good  thing  that  God 

gave  us  was  redirected  by  the  Devil  into  the  creation  and  the  manufacturing  of  bad 

products such as nuclear bombs and  nuclear weapons 

</span></div><div><span>We  saw  that  the  Honourable  Member  from  Rakahanga  stood  up  and  said  to  the 

Minister that the Minister had not answered his question when he asked if the Minister 

would  allow  nuclear  powered  vessels,  nuclear  powered  war  ships,  nuclear  powered 

submarines to pass through our Cook Islands waters. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, if there is ever a world war in the future, what will happen is that the 

enemies will die but  the winners will also die because of these nuclear weapons.  In 

this instance there will be no winners.  Everybody will die.  The few people that will 

remain will not be around for very long as we have heard explained earlier on where a 

nuclear plant exploded and the results of that are so horrifying Mr Chairman.  This is 

what  happened  to  those  people.    Some  died  and  some  were  going  to  die.    This  is 

horrifying Mr Chairman.  So I just wanted to point out the two sides to nuclear energy, 

the good  and the bad side of nuclear energy. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka for introducing this Bill 

into the House because it is a Bill that is necessary but the times when the Honourable 

Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati  was  in  Government,  when  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate was in  Government,  when the Honourable Member, Norman George was in 

Government, when Papa Tom Davis was in Government - none of them thought that it 

would  be  appropriate  to  introduce  something like this that would protect  our people 

and our country. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  this  Cook  Islands  Party  Government  for  looking  after  the 

interests of the people by way of introducing this Bill for the House to enact.  It is true 

that the fine of $1,000,000 is not going to be able to replace a life but, hey, this is just 

the  beginning.    If  these  people  are  going  to  be  stubborn  enough  to  keep  on  coming 

through  our  waters  we  can  come  around  and  up  the  fines  to  -  $10,000,000, 

$100,000,000.    This  is  just  the  beginning  so  I  would  like  to  thank  this  Honourable 

Minister for  this Bill.  That is the way to go.  The important thing is we have started.  

Maybe some day we would be using nuclear energy in our country.  I am not going to 

give  a  no,  or  an outright  no to  nuclear energy because the word of the Lord tells  us 

that knowledge shall increase. 

</span></div><div><span>So that is why I needed to preach and this is the end of my speech Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>   Thank you Honourable Minister.  Now the question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Our next speaker is the Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>599 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  I rise to 

give my support to the Clause 13, included in the Bill before us.  It states in Clause 13, 

Sub-</span><span>Section (1), “No nuclear wastes or other radioactive matter in whatsoever form </span><span>or 

condition shall be transported by a vessel or platform into Cook Islands waters except 

</span><span>as  specified  under  Article  IV  of  the  London  Dumping  Convention.”    This  also 

</span><span>includes  the  airspace  of  the  Cook  Islands.    In  fact,  it  is  very  interesting  to  note,  Mr 

Chairman,  that  it  will  be  illegal  to  transport  nuclear  waste  on  the  seabed  and  even 

under the subsoil below the Cook Islands waters.  I feel this Clause is a tough one with 

not  allowing  any  nuclear  or  radioactive  waste  materials  to  be  transported  or  shifted 

through our waters and even our airspace.  This Clause is very different from Clauses 

3  and  4.    Those  Clauses  dealt  with  the  discharge  of  wastes  into  our  ocean.    This 

Clause specifies and concentrates that, no nuclear waste or radioactive matter is to be 

transported through our airspace, on our seabed or subsoil below our waters.   

</span></div><div><span>I wish to congratulate the Minister for introducing this Clause into the Bill before the 

</span><span>House  in  order  that  we  Cook  Islanders  are  protected  in  the  future.    I’d  like  to 

</span><span>emphasise the fact that any amount of contamination of nuclear waste, minor or large, 

in our waters will be lethal and will take years to decompose.  We are all aware of the 

end  result  should  something  like  this  occur.    As  the  Minister  of  Education  had  said 

earlier,  one  day  we  will  see  the  benefits  of  what  we  are  influencing  in  this  House 

today.    Right  now,  I  congratulate  the  Minister  for  incorporating  this  most  important 

Section into the Bill.  This Bill however, is rather silent on particular vessels should 

they  come  through  our  waters  in  times  of  war.    But  the  Bill  applies  to  our  time  of 

peace  today.    If  there  is  going  to  be  a  war,  we  will  deal  with  that  matter  at  the 

appropriate time.  In the meantime, I am glad that this Section has been included in the 

Bill.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, Mr Chairman, and to 

the staff and Honourable Members in the House.  Kia Orana to all our people listening 

into our debate this afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>I rose to give my support to the Clause being debated this afternoon.  The Leader of 

</span><span>the Opposition had mentioned that the Government side was very silent, hence I have 

</span><span>been  compelled  to  speak.    The  Clauses  in  the  Bill  before  the  House  are similar, the 

only difference being in the types of wastes dealt with and their effects in our ocean.  

Their are different fines attached to these different wastes as seen in this Bill.  When 

we come across the relevant Clauses which deal with the different wastes, then I might 

have something to add. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>I have to interrupt you Honourable Member.  We do not have a 

quorum in the House.
