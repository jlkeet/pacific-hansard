1998 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:    </span><span>Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    It  is  also  proper  that  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition should come into the chamber now, as he was the one who forced me to 

get  up  and  speak.    Someone  asked  me  the  other  day  as  to  why  the  Leaders  of  the 

Opposition are always talking in </span><span>here.  I replied that it’s because they are very proud.  </span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Come  back  to  the  Clause  before  the  House  please  Honourable 

Member.   

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:  </span><span>Anyway, this is a reason I didn’t want to get up all the time as they 

</span><span>might think I am proud too.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Pupuke Robati, talked on the fines for nuclear waste.  He 

said  that  the  fines  were  too  small  when  considering  the  damage  done  by  the 

radioactive matter.  Previous fines, he had mentioned, were a lot harsher on the ship 

owners  and  t</span><span>hose  who  were  subject  to  liability.    I  don’t  know  if  he  acts  like  this 

</span><span>because he takes pride in what he does or whether he knows more then those people 

who prepared the Bill before this House.  The first couple of Clauses, he mentioned, 

in relation to the fines are too big, and now in these Clauses the fines are supposed to 

be  too  small.    If  he  thinks  the  fines  are  too  big  or  too  small  in  some  areas,  we  can 

always change them as we progress on the Bill throughout the afternoon.   

</span></div><div><span>The main point in our discussion at this point in time concerns damage as shown and 

dealt with in these Clauses.  No matter how we go about our business in this House, 

the fact remains that the situation is getting worse out there.  The Minister rightly said, 

the idea behind the introduction of this Bill is to prevent such occurrences in the first 

place.   

</span></div><div><span>These days, a lot of countries are doing things that will bring them to the attention of 

the  rest  of  the  world.    Big  countries  are  aiming  to  create  fame  for  themselves.    We 

heard these countries are conducting nuclear tests and what they are doing is trying to 

</span><span>get  a  name  for  themselves.    The  people  don’t  stop  to  think  of  the  consequences  of 

</span><span>their  actions  or  the  price  of  fame.    These,  the  fumes  from  engines  on  the  roads  or 

factories are causing sicknesses that are affecting many people.  Why this Bill is in the 

House is to protect our interests in preventing things such as this from happening in 

our country.  This could be why the fish in our waters are poisonous today, from the 

</span><span>nuclear  tests  in  French Polynesia.  Who knows?  We cannot  know beforehand what 

</span><span>effect  it  would  have  on  our  lives  unless  we  experience  it  first  hand.    Presently,  the 

results  of  how  our  people  lived  has  an  effect.    There  is  a  lot  of  damage  because  of 

those incidents.  I agree with the Honourable Dr Robati in saying that we only a small 

country.    We  can  make  the  changes  if  we  pass  this  law.    We  pass  the  law  in  the 

morning  and  we  can  amend  it  in  the  afternoon.    Mr  Chairman,  these  are  my  views.  

The same points ar</span><span>e being agreed on in here.  I’ll probably have something different to 

</span><span>say later on in the debate. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>601 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  FAIREKA:</span><span>    Mr  Chairman,  first  I  would  like  to  say  how  pleased  I  am  to 

hear comments from all Honourable Members who spoke on the Clause.  I am sure the 

explanations  given  by  Members  of  the  Government,  to  the  questions  raised  by  the 

Opposition, are enough to explain the Clause to our people.  There is only one query I 

would like to  respond  to.   In relation to Dr Woonton's query about allowing nuclear 

vessels to travel within our waters during times of war.  I think, if I am the Minister at 

the  time  it  should  happen,  I  will  make  sure  that  the  Clauses  of  this  Bill  will  apply.  

Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 13 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 14 : Offence to store or dump nuclear waste and other radioactive materials. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 14 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    The  Honourable  Minister  is 

calling out, is this your Bill?  I am not sure what his problem is, maybe my comments 

are  scoring  points  which  he  does  not  like.    I  do  not  look  for  those  points,  if  he  is 

concerned about that. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to get onto the Bill and say what our people want to know.  This Clause 

deals with dumping or storing of nuclear wastes or materials.  When I was giving my 

thoughts  on  Clause  13,  I  failed  to  mention  the  fine  of  $1  million  dollars.    I  did  not 

want to mention it at the time.  Now we have come to Clause 14, the penalty here is 

again  $1  million  dollars.    The  Honourable  Minister,  Ngereteina  Puna,  should  have 

listened  to  the  Honourable  Tangata  Vavia  when  he  said  that  there  are  bigger  cases.  

</span><span>What we are dealing with is half a million dollars.  Now we have come to that kind of 

</span><span>case, this is an example of one of the bigger cases that the Honourable Tangata Vavia 

was referring to, or possibly he had even bigger cases in mind.  An oil tanker carrying 

a million gallons of oil may crash onto the reef for whatever reason.  That will be a big 

disaster for the island it may hit.   

</span></div><div><span>I  stand  to  give  my  support  to  the  Clause,  after  the  explanation  by  the  Minister  on 

Article  IV  of  the  London  Dumping  Convention,  to  clarify  the  conditions  in  that 

convention.    According  to  that  explanation  in  Article  IV  of  the  London  Dumping 

</span><span>Convention, it deals with non-radioactive materials.  I am happy with that explanation 

</span><span>because  the  Clause  clearly  covers  that  any  radioactive  material,  any  nuclear  waste, 

cannot be stored or dumped in the Cook Islands, there is no excuse or any reason for 

that to be permitted to be stored or dumped here.  The concern about no conviction, to 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>602 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>be jailed, which was mentioned by The Honourable Dr Robati, I also have concerns 

with that and question why it has not been included.  If the answer is that it is going to 

be difficult to bring on a court case or that there are complications attached to it, how 

else can we do the same and take people to court and fine somebody and say, all right, 

you  clear  your  mess  and  the  costs  for  that  are  yours  to  bear  and  you  clear  the  mess 

until  it  is  done?    So,  I  agree  with  the  Honourable  Dr  Robati  that  part  of  the  Clause 

appears  weak.    Not  only  in  Clause  14  but  also  in  Clause  13,  it  fails  to  imprison  a 

person  or  an  owner  or  whatever  for  the  crime  committed.    That  is  all  I  have  to  say 

about that, Mr Chairman.

</span></div><div><span>Clause 23 : Liability for Pollution Damage. 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 23 Stands Part of the Bill 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Chairman.    This  Clause  deals  with  a 

situation when there is actual contamination of our waters by either an oil container or 

a nuclear powered boat or a boat carrying nuclear waste material, at any time or during 

war  time.    It  is  talking  about  pollution  that  has  actually  taken  place  due  to  some 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>                                                                                                            8 July 

</span></div><div><span>604 

1998 

</span></div><div><span>unknown or unforeseen incident.  It could be a situation during the time of a war and 

therefore nobody can be blamed.  It could be an accident due to some hurricane that 

might strike a boat, or whatever, and the waste end up dumped just outside Rarotonga.  

Decisions  on  this  matter,  in  this  Clause,  says  there  shall  be  no  liability  to  this 

situation.  I have some concern here, Mr Chairman, about the safety of our people.  If 

damage is done in situations like this and there is no liability to whoever has caused 

that damage, who is going to compensate for the damage that this has caused to our 

people?  I see this Clause has no favour toward those who may cause damage to our 

</span><span>country.  There can be a lot of loopholes in this and I don’t honestly feel the safety of 

</span><span>our  people  can  be  maintained  under  this  situation.    This  Clause  mostly  makes 

allowances  for  those  who  carry  these  nuclear  waste  materials,  or  whatever,  in 

situations as I have mentioned.  Perhaps other Clauses, later on, will help my concern 

but while we are on this particular Clause, I am concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>I will leave this with the Minister.  I’d be happy if he could explain a little in relation 

</span><span>to my concern.  Otherwise that is all I have. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Minister for Justice, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Mr Chairman, I just want to get up to raise a point here.  Not as 

a challenge to the Minister responsible for the Bill but a concern that I would like to 

air  with  regard  to  this  Clause.    The  concern  I  have here, Mr Chairman, is  really the 

degree of the proof that is required by the, perhaps so-called, offending party here.  If 

he had created the problem we only have to prove on the balance of probability.  To 

me, the degree is not really high to prove what has happened is not his responsibility.  

When one has to look at the consequences of what will happen if a spill of whatever 

nuclear source should happen, the consequence is bad and the situation can be serious.  

Yet he only has to prove a little bit of doubt and he will get away from that liability.  If 

you  look  at  the  criminal  cases,  the  offender  will  have  to  prove  beyond  reasonable 

doubt and that degree of proof is very high and yet in this one where the consequence 

can  be  disastrous,  the  standard  of  proof  is  quite  low  or should I say as quoted here, 

</span><span>“just on the balance of probability.”  I would be very unhappy if people get away sco</span><span>tt 

free on any weak excuse to avoid having to pay their fines or face the consequences. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Tangata Vavia. 

</span></div><div><span>MR T. VAVIA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I just rose to add on to what the Minister 

has just said in regards to Part V of this Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>If we look at Sub-Clauses (3) and (4), it basically says that no oils or other pollutants 

shall be discharged or be allowed to escape into Cook Islands waters.  From there we 

come to the Sub-Clause of Clause 23, it tells us about Liability for Pollution Damage.  

It reads: 

</span></div><div><span>“(1)</span><span>  Except as provided in Sub-Sections (2) and (3) of this section, the  

owner of a vessel at the time of an incident shall be liable for any  

pollution damage </span><span>caused by the vessel as a result of the incident.”</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>8 July 1998 

</span></div><div><span>605 

</span></div><div><span>As I see it, the liability is there as explained in Sub-Clauses (2), (3) and (4).  It says: 

</span></div><div><span>(2) 

</span></div><div><span>(a) 

</span></div><div><span>No liability for pollution damage shall be attached to the owner if he 

proves on the balance of probabilities that the damage: 

resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or 

a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and  

irresistible character; or 

was wholly caused by an act or omission done with intent to 

</span><span>cause damage by a third party;”</span></div><div><span>(b) 

</span></div><div><span>which means that if somebody else caused the damage or the leak then no liability for 

pollution should apply. 

</span></div><div><span>“(c)</span><span>  was  wholly  caused  by  the  negligence  or  other  wrongful  act  of 

any Government or other authority responsible for the  

maintenance of lights or other navigational aids in the exercise 

</span><span>of that function.”</span></div><div><span>Of course it is  understandable that if the leakage, spillage, of oil is  caused by these, 

say an act of war, a natural disaster, then those people involved in the spillages in our 

ocean  would  not  be  liable  because  they  did  not  intentionally  cause  the  spillage.    So 

</span><span>this Clause allows for what I call ‘a relief valve’ for these kinds of actions, where it is 

</span><span>not the owner who actually caused or intentionally caused the leakage, but it was done 

by  other  acts.    So  why prosecute the owner when it was a hurricane that caused the 

</span><span>damage.  Unless of course he’d dragged his boat out there, full of oil, knowing there 

</span><span>was a hurricane, which hopefully will cause the spillage of oil into the rough seas.   

</span></div><div><span>We  will  find,  Mr  Chairman,  where  there  is  an  offence  created  in  some  Actsthere  is 

always this kind of relief from actions which are not caused by the person that we are 

looking at to prosecute.  Thank you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank you Honourable Member.  It is time to adjourn so I’ll call 

</span><span>upon the Minister to Report progress to Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>Mr Chairman, I wish to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Progress be Reported to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed
