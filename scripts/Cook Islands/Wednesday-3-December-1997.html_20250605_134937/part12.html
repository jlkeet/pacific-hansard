<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That a Select Committee be established comprising of the following Members: 

</span></div><div><span>Hon. Ngereteina Puna 

Hon. Vaine Tairea 

Hon Utia Matata 

Mr Norman George   

Dr Robert Woonton   

</span></div><div><span>: Chairman 

: Member 

: Member 

: Member 

:Member 

</span></div><div><span>to look into the Copyright Bill with the following terms of reference: 

</span></div><div><span>1. 

2. 

3. 

</span></div><div><span>review the contents of the Bill 

receive submissions from members of the public on the Bill 

at the completion of its review of the Bill and having evaluated the 

</span><span>submissions of the public, to Report the Select Committee’s</span><span>

findings and recommendations to Parliament 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, just speaking briefly on the Motion, the thrust  of this establishment, of  

the Select Committee, is to give those members of the general public a second chance 

to make representations to the Select Committee that would affect the Bill before us.  I 

am  particularly  interested  in  hearing  from  the  members  of  the  public  in  the  Outer 

Islands, because I feel that the general public here in Rarotonga have had a fair chance 

in making submissions on this particular Bill earlier this year.  I am looking forward to 

the work of the Select Committee.  However, I have no intention of calling the sub-

committee to its first meeting until early next year.  So thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  May I call for a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr M. Aperau 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>The Leader of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR R. JACK:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That this House do now adjourn until 1.00 p.m. tomorrow, Thursday, 4th 

December 1997 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>189 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Leader  of  the  House.    The  Honourable  Minister, 

Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  I rise to second the Motion.  And if I may speak briefly on it.  This 

House has basically completed its work, its legislative programme for this year and we 

would have risen sine die, except that tomorrow we are coming back to swear in the 

new  Member  of  Ivirua.    That  is  the  most  important  work  left  for  this  House  to  do.  

Never mind the Reports, never mind the Orders.  The Reports that are on the agenda 

because they are already in force and already operating and we see this as a chance of 

saving on the payment of air time.  It is our hope that all Honourable Members will be 

here tomorrow to receive our new Member into the House and to make him welcome 

into  the  House.    In  accordance  with  the  tradition  of  the  House,  the  leaders  of  the 

parties in the House will have the opportunity to speak to our people and to give our 

Christmas  Greetings  before  we  adjourn  over  the  Christmas  period.    Honourable 

Members should know that there will not be the traditional end of the year Christmas 

party, we are forgoing that.  You can have your own party in your own home.  We will 

just finish tomorrow, say Happy New Year and Merry Christmas to each one and you 

go  home.    But  if  Honourable  Members  want  to  have  a  party  here  then  that  is  up  to 

you.  You bring your own food and bring your own drinks.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Dr Joseph Williams. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  rise  in  respect  to  the  request  that  I 

made  when  I  spoke  before  indeed  from  you,  Mr  Speaker,  because  I  wanted  to  ask 

some questions about MOWEPP.  You see the newspaper headline said . . . 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>I’m  sorry  Honourable  Member.    I  cannot  allow  any  discussion  on 

</span><span>anything outside the Motion, unless the Honourable Member is going to speak on the 

Motion then I will allow the Member to speak, but anything outside the Motion I will 

not allow any Member to speak. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  J.  WILLIAMS:</span><span>  Well  speaking  on  the  Motion,  the  Adjournment  Motion  until 

tomorrow,  the  Minister  of  Education  has  stated  that  we  will  not  be  speaking  on 

anything  else  tomorrow  because  we  will  be  adjourning  sine  die.    If  we  are  not 

permitted to speak about MOWEPP perhaps tomorrow Mr Speaker, you could allow 

some time for us to air our views on this MOWEPP transition because it is a national 

disaster.  But for the moment I do respect your ruling. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  I call the Honourable Member Dr 

Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  I would like to say very briefly on 

the Motion which was Seconded by the Honourable Minister Ngereteina Puna.  And 

enlarge on it to say and to make a decision as to what we should be doing tomorrow.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>190 

</span></div><div><span>3 December 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, he is trying to decide for you and he is trying to decide for us Honourable 

</span><span>Members  of  this  House  what  should  we  be  doing  tomorrow.    That’s  none  of  his 

</span><span>business.  He has no right to dictate to us what our programme should be tomorrow.  I 

want to talk particularly on the agenda, Mr Speaker.  The No. 3 on  the Order Paper, 

</span><span>Mr  Speaker,  and  that  is  the  Public  Expenditure  Review  Committee  and  Audit.    I’m 

</span><span>very interested to take that up tomorrow where if we can because it deals with what 

spending has been going on including the situation with the MOWEPP.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  I  am  sorry  Honourable  Member  that  has  nothing  to  do  with  the 

</span><span>Motion on the Floor.  What’s for tomorrow is for tomorrow.  So please come back to 

</span><span>the Motion or I will have to ask you to sit down. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  am  only  responding  to  the 

dictatorship attitude of this Member.  Because I would have liked the next 20 minutes 

that we had before to deal with this today.  And for him to decide that there is no party 

after this sitting Mr Speaker he has no right whatsoever.  And if Members want to get 

together and shake hands and forget about the past the argument that we had him and I 

especially then this is the place to come to that.  And I am prepared to bring a leg of 

pork for him and I to eat. Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Now the Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Can an Honourable Member please close us with a prayer.
