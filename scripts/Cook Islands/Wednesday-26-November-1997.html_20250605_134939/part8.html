<div><span>BILL READ A THIRD TIME 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  And  this  concludes  the  Second  and  Third  Reading  of  the  Value 

Added Tax Amendment Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Bill : Second Reading.  The Honourable Minister, Pa 

Pokino. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. P. POKINO:</span><span>  Thank you Mr speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Income Tax Amendment (No.2) Bill be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>I d</span><span>on’t think it will take us long to debate over this Bill, Mr Speaker, because it is only 

</span><span>a very short Bill.  The reason why this is brought in is, as we know it is an amendment 

to the Income Tax Bill which was enacted on the 1st July.  Yes, there is a change in 

the Income Tax law which came into force on the 1st July.  From the beginning of this 

year  to  the  end  of  June  we  found  that  there  was  a  difference,  to  do  with  the  tax 

imposed upon workers.  From the 1st July going on to the end of December we know 

there is a little difference to do with the tax imposed upon the people.  We know in the 

past that the Income Tax imposed upon the people was consistent right through from 

the beginning of the year to the end of the year, but for this Amendment that we have 

before the House today there is a difference from the beginning of the year to the end 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>137 

</span></div><div><span>of June.  There is also a difference from the 1st July to the end of December.  So the 

purpose of the Amendment is to even out the payment of tax from the beginning of the 

year  to  the  end  of  the  year.    So  really,  Mr  Speaker,  this  Amendment  applies  to  this 

year only.  After the 31st December it will become void.  So that is why I said it is a 

short simple amendment and it should not invite any debate whatsoever.   

</span></div><div><span>The ide</span><span>a is so that some workers don’t get charged excessively by the tax department 

or they don’t receive a refund in excess from the tax department.  It is to even out the 

</span><span>payment of tax.  So really that is the purpose of the Amendment, Mr Speaker.  Thank 

you.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    I  can  see  that  the  Honourable 

Minister  for  Education  is  on  the  Floor  to  Second  the  Motion.    The  Honourable 

Minister for Education, Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. N. Puna</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I stand to Second the Motion.  

Before I speak on the Bill, Mr Speaker, allow me to give message of Greetings.   

</span></div><div><span>Yesterday  I  was  in  Aitutaki  I  was  there  for  the  purpose  of  presenting  them  with  a 

certificate of achievement - that is the Special Education Certificate.  My purpose was 

to encourage them to carry on the good work in order for our children to benefit.  And 

also I would like at this time to congratulate the teachers of Rarotonga to whom I have 

presented them with certificates for passing their exams last week.  So this is a great 

achievement by our people whom we have received support form the NZODA.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  contributions  made  by  Lex  MacDonald  who  is  a 

teacher from Wellington and also to Bill Evaroa who is the principal of the teachers 

training college, and also Nga Strickland and the other teachers.   

</span></div><div><span>I would also like at this time to congratulate Ms Janet Maki for her appointment to the 

position  of  Solicitor  General.    From  the  people  of  Aitutaki  we  would  like  to  say 

congratulations.   

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  at  this  time  to  congratulate  the  girls  who  are  taking  part  in  the  Tiare 

</span><span>Festival for this year.  Also I would like to congratulate the holder of Miss Tiare for 

</span><span>1996,  that  is  -  Miss  Caroline  Bishop  who  will  be  c</span><span>oming  here  to  join  in  this  year’s 

</span><span>festival.  What I would like to say to the organisers of this festival is - the promise that 

you  made  to  my  daughter,  that  she  will  be  going  to  Australia,  I  would  like  to 

emphasise the fact that she must go to Australia as promised and I want that to happen 

before the end of this year.  Thank you to the organisers.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to congratulate those young people who are operating the TV on Aitutaki, 

they  have  their  own  TV  programme  and  I  would  like  to  congratulate  them  for  what 

they are doing. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Point of Order 193, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>138 

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> There is a Point of Order on the Floor, Honourable Minister.  What 

is your Point of Order, Honourable Dr Terepai Maoate? 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:  </span><span>193  -  </span><span>It’s  getting  repetit</span><span>ious  time  and  time  again,  Mr 

Speaker.  We want  to  economise the spending of this country, Mr Speaker, and this 

Member  is  very  fond  of  saying  hello  all  the  time.    And  when  it  comes  to  actually 

</span><span>talking  about  the  meat  of  the  discussion  he  just  says  “that’s  all  I  have  to  say”.    So 

don’t  allow him to  spend more money on the broadcast  because let him tell  us how 

</span><span>much is spent on every minute that we spend in this House talking.  So I am asking 

</span><span>don’t be irrelevant, come back to the point.  Thank you.</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>  The  Point  of  Order  is  quite  relevant.    So  I  would  ask  you 

Honourable Minister to come back to the Bill before the House. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Secondly, I would like to say that Aitutaki has started to harvest the 

trochus.  And this is what they have allocated - eight kilograms to every single person 

on Aitutaki, from the elders to the youngest.  And my last announcement is next week 

I will be bringing some very exciting news about the Ministry of Education into this 

House.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say in this House that this Income Tax package that this Government 

brought into this House to be enacted this year is one of the best that this Government 

has ever brought into this House.  This Amendment before the House is improving on 

the  first  one.    However,  we  did  not  achieve  this  on  our own.  We ask, Mr Speaker, 

Government  officials  working  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic 

Management ask our people from the business sector - what kind of tax package they 

would like to administered or to be enforced here in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am very delighted to support this Amendment Bill before the House for 

the people on the island of Aitutaki, especially Reureu/Arutanga/Nikaupara, and I am 

sure after me the Leader of the Opposition will not speak on it.  When we look at this 

Amendment, Mr Speaker, it is very good.  I think it is a good Amendment.  That is all 

I  have  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  I  understand  that  this  is  debating  the  principles  and  the 

merits, we are not in committee. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker. With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, 

I  would  just  like  to  make  a  very  brief  announcement.    Since  I  caught  site  of  the 

Minister  of  MOWEPP,  it  reminds  me  of  a  meeting  that  is  of  very  important  to  my 

people  in  Ngatitangiia,  particularly  those  from  Avana  to  Turangi  connecting  to 

Matavera.  Mr Speaker, Pa Ariki, the Aronga Mana, elders, young people, Kia Orana 

to  you  all.    I  am  reminding  everyone  of  a  meeting  that  will  be  held  at  the  Turangi 

meeting house at 6pm this evening.  It concerns those who have a piece of land around 

the  Avana  area  up  to  Matavera  on  the  back  road  and  along  the  main  road  -  this 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>139 

</span></div><div><span>meeting is for you.  The purpose of the meeting is because we need to get the views of 

the landowners in the area, as the Ministry of Works will be laying down new pipes 

for water in the Muri area which will go along the back road through to the main road.  

At  this  meeting  you  can  raise  your concerns and express  your support, also  you can 

indicate where you would like your connection to be made.  Mr Speaker, I think these 

are  announcements  you  would  like  Members  of  the  House  to  make  in  the  House 

instead  of  ordinary  greetings.    I think Members  should do that elsewhere and not  in 

the House.   

</span></div><div><span>I don’t really have much to say to the amendment to the Income Tax Act.  I see it as 

</span><span>patching  up  an  anomaly  that  gives  a  burden  to  some  people  who  may  be  employed 

only half of the year instead of a whole year.  All I can see with this amendment, as 

briefly explained by the Minister, is it is a patching up of an anomaly and getting some 

fair deal to the ones concerned with regards to running it that may otherwise impose a 

burden to the people involved.  Therefore it does not give me much concern because 

</span><span>there is mainly one amendment in this Bill.  I don’t argue with the point that the select 

</span><span>committee have been involved in this so far as there is only one main area of concern 

in the Bill.   

</span></div><div><span>However,  I  would  like  to  warn  the  Minister,  Ngereteina  Puna,  I  do  not  want  to  be 

provoked  in  the  future.    He  said  this  Bill  is  a  C.I.P.  Act.    I  was  on  the  committee 

assigned to the Bill and they needed the services of the Opposition as well.  I started 

off today with a good tone and a good indication of working together where necessary, 

but when I get that kind of provocation I am going to reply to it.  Like I said I support 

the comments made by the Honourable Minister, Pa Pokino, that we should not take 

long.  I think I should be the last speaker on this and then we should pass it. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be read a Second time 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to
