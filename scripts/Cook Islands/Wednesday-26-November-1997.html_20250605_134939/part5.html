</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate, Leader of the Opposition. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana to  you and to  your 

staff, Kia Orana to you on this fine day.  Kia Orana to Members of Government, to the 

Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Ministers and to Members of Parliament on 

the Government side, Kia Orana to you all.  And to us here in the Opposition, to the 

Deputy  Leader  of  Opposition,  Dr  Robert  Woonton,  and  now  my  Members  and 

Colleagues  in  the  Opposition,  including  our  friend  the  Honourable  Norman  George, 

Kia Orana to you all.  Thank you for your instruction through the letter that has been 

given  to  us.    It  makes  us  aware  what  the  situation  is.    Thank  you  for  that 

enlightenment.  And to our people listening in,  particularly  those that are affected by 

this particular Clause, mainly the schools.  I think we should be listening to the debate 

of this particular Clause.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>127 

</span></div><div><span>This is something that our people who are running the schools, especially the private 

schools,  to  acknowledge  that  their  wish  has  been  granted  through  this  Amendment.  

This is some of the things  I would like to support, Mr Chairman, in our deliberations 

in  this  Honourable  House,  to  see  what  we  can  do  as  an  Opposition,  to  support  the 

intentions of Government in order to help our people develop our country, to turn the 

economy around and see what we can do to help them.   

</span></div><div><span>So far, I am impressed with the explanations the Minister in Charge, the Honourable 

Papamama Pokino, has made in explaining and responding to the questions raised in 

the past few days of our deliberation over this very important Act.  Very precise, Mr 

Chairman. Right to the point and it is exactly what our people want to hear.  And we 

in  the  Opposition  would  like  to  carry  on  with  that  trend  in  order  to  establish,  or  to 

</span><span>recover the reputation that we’ve had in the past. We don’t want  people  saying it’s a 

</span><span>waste of time listening to this debate.   

</span></div><div><span>And  therefore,  as  I  said,  I  shall  be  very  brief.  This  particular  Clause  deals  with  the 

attempts to the request by the private schools, to give them the assistance of the VAT 

</span><span>liabilities that are imposed under this section, for them to be free of that, in order that 

</span><span>they will be able to afford to bring things in for the benefit of the schools in the private 

sector.  And while I am talking about this particular one, Mr Chairman, on Education, 

I want to wake the Minister up, the Minister in charge of this portfolio.  Because to me 

it is important to be concerned and to be happy and to express to the schools, to the 

parents what this Government is trying to do to help and assist these private schools.  

However, all I can say is when the Minister is asleep on this particular Amendment, 

how  can  you  expect  the  schools  to  respond  properly?.    So,  I  stand  to  support  this 

Amendment, Mr Chairman, without hesitation, with all the thrust that I am giving to 

support the private schools in our country. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN</span><span>:  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Minister, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>.  </span><span>V</span><span>.  </span><span>TAIREA</span><span>:    Kia  Orana,  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  to  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister,  and  Members  of  Cabinet,  and  to  both  sides  of  the  House,  as  well  as  our 

people listening in to our debate this afternoon.  Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>Through you, Mr Chairman, I seek indulgence to offer some words of condolences to 

</span><span>family in Mauke.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  To Teariki Mouauri and Kura in Mauke, 

to their mother Ngavavia and also Vainetutai, whom we call Mami, and to their sister 

Kura,  and  Makiroa,  also  to  the  Kopu  Ariki  Tamuera  Ariki  and  Tararo  Ariki  for  the 

passing away of their son, Taratoa, yesterday in  New Zealand, and also to  the Kopu 

Ariki  Tararo    for  the  passing  away  of  their  daughter  in  New  Zealand.  To  all  the 

families of both Ngati Tamuera  and Ngati Tobia in Mauke and in Rarotonga,  also to 

the  father,  Te,  whose  son  passed  away  in  New  Zealand,  he  will  be  arriving  in 

Rarotonga  today.  He  will  depart  for  New  Zealand  tomorrow,  for  the  funeral  which 

will  be  held  there.  We  do    not  know  if  we  will  hold  a  service  here  until  the  father 

arrives  in  New  Zealand.  The  main  thing  is,  the  father  is  coming  and  we  offer  our 

sincerest condolences to all of you for your tragic bereavement. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>128 

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Now,  to  the  Clause  we  are  looking  at  in  this  Bill.    As  explained  earlier,  I  am  very 

much satisfied because both sides of the House worked together to support each other 

for the benefit of our children.  Also, I wish to acknowledge the Minister concerned 

and also the Opposition side for working side by side on this particular issue.  Thank 

you, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>CHAIRMAN</span><span>:  Thank  you  Honourable  Minister.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>.  </span><span>I</span><span>.  </span><span>AKARURU</span><span>:    Thank  you  Mr  Chairman.  Mr Chairman, I wish to  give my 

support to Clause 3 of the Bill before us, and to make a brief statement upon it.  First 

of  all,  before  I  speak  on  the  Bill,  I  would  like  to  extend  to  you,  Mr  Chairman,  my 

greetings  and  also  to  your  staff,  to  my  Cabinet colleagues, Honourable Members on 

the Government side, Honourable Members on the Opposition side, to the Leader of 

the Opposition, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Special greetings also to my 

friend,  the  Honourable  Norman  George,  and  to  say  to  you  that  you  have  no  more 

friends  on  the  Opposition  benches  so  you  will  have  to  find  your  friends  on  the 

Government side.  

</span></div><div><span>Secondly,  Mr  Chairman,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  letter written to  us by the 

Secretary of the Democratic Alliance Party of the problems they have come through.  I 

am  pleased  to  acknowledge  the  letter.    It  was  through  him  we  were  able  to  be 

enlightened  on  what  is  happening.    I  would  like  to  request  through  you  that  the 

Secretary let us know what was the result of the meeting on Monday.  I heard a lot of 

fireworks went on. 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>. </span><span>DR</span><span>T</span><span>. </span><span>MAOATE</span><span>: Point of Order. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>CHAIRMAN</span><span>: What is your point of order Honourable Member? 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>.  </span><span>DR</span><span>T</span><span>.  </span><span>MAOATE</span><span>:  193  -  I  would  like  to  ask  the  Honourable  Deputy  Prime 

Minister to leave the joys of that meeting to us and continue with Clause 3 of the Bill. 

</span></div><div><span>MR</span><span>CHAIRMAN</span><span>: Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>.  </span><span>I</span><span>.  </span><span>AKARURU</span><span>:  Yes  Mr  Chairman.    I  quite  agree.    I  will  come  back  to  the 

</span><span>Clause.  I just felt I should ask the Secretary of the Democratic Alliance Party to tell 

</span><span>us what happened at the meeting. I know there is a problem between the Leader of the 

Opposition  and  the  Minister  of  Education  because  the  moment  the  Leader  of  the 

Opposition spoke, that is the time when the Minister pretended to s</span><span>leep.  So, I don’t 

</span><span>want  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  copy  the  many  tricks  that  the  Minister  of 

Education is trying.  He is happy, no problem. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to say that the schools, mainly the private schools, are finding it difficult 

to raise funds to bring teaching aids into the schools.  Fund raising is difficult but by 

</span><span>exempting  tax  on  supplies,  the  problem  is  eased  somewhat.    Even  Government 

</span><span>schools are finding it difficult to carry on because it is hard raising money to support 

the  schools.    If  it  is  difficult  for  Government  schools  to  operate,  it  must  be  more 

difficult  for  private  schools.    This  is  why  Government  acceded  to  the  needs  of  the 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>129 

</span></div><div><span>private schools, by introducing exemptions in order to lighten the burden on them.  I 

would  like  to  say  to  the  private  school  committees  that  are  struggling  to  maintain 

standards,  that  Government  recognises  the  problem  and  that  is  why  they  have  taken 

the  initiative  and  exempted  all  private  school  supplies.    This  is  what  the  school 

committees  need  to  do  now.    Go  to  Customs,  which  is  the  implementing  arm  of 

Government,  and  ask  them  to  exempt  all  supplies  you  have  ordered  from  overseas 

because  this  is  what  Government  wants  you  to  do.  At  least,  this  exemption    is 

</span><span>Government’s  small  contribution  to  easing  some  of  the  bu</span><span>rden  of  costs of materials 

already  faced by  schools when ordering  from overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>Well this is the reason why I rose, Mr Chairman, for me to make that request to the 

Secretary  of  the  Democratic-Alliance,  to  let  us  know  what  has  happened  at  that 

meeting.    Maybe,  probably,  tomorrow  we  will  receive  the  reply.    Thank  you  Mr 

Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Mr Deputy Prime Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 3 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 4: Exempt Importations 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  I didn’t stand up to respond to 

the Deputy Prime Minister’s comments on the letter.  I would like to ask him not to 

</span><span>mention that letter again.  Not even any other letter that may come later. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  Clause  4  brings  in  a  concern  particularly  to  islands  that  have  been 

receiving project aids from donor countries.  This is one of the sensible things that this 

Government  has  come  to  realise  because  even  though  these  things  have  been  under 

</span><span>the consideration of the Select  Committee it has not  become at  that time part of the 

</span><span>Act.   Although there are some areas that have been exempted, I think this particular 

Clause has now extended its coverage to such projects as donor aided projects.  The 

first thing, Mr Chairman, is, this is given as a goodwill or a gift, either to a country or 

to an island in a country like ours.  Secondly, it is not the intention to make money out 

of providing this aid and therefore it stands to reason that this should not be taxed at 

all. 

</span></div><div><span>On  top  of  that  it  is  indicating  also  that  it  is  to  assist  certain  organisations  like  the 

University of the South Pacific.  And I appreciate this amendment, Mr Chairman.  On 

top  of  that  this  Clause 4 includes the exemption  for the importation of persons who 

have  died  where  costs  are  incurred,  including  headstones.    I  feel  it  is  our  role,  Mr 

Chairman, as Members of this House to tell our people what this is all about and that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>130 

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>is exactly what I am trying to do.  So that our people are fully aware when they bring 

home the body of their loved ones from overseas to the Cook Islands they know that 

costs that are incurred, with tax imposed, they know now that these can be exempted.  

And together with that it is also saying that headstones should not be taxed as well.  It 

stands to reason, Mr Chairman, because when you are in sorrow of losing your loved 

ones then you should not be sad after that by looking at how much cost you are going 

to  have  to  pay  for  this  sad  event.    But  in  spite  of  these  attempts,  Mr  Chairman,  to 

assist our people in reducing cost to them we still find some practices that our people 

carry out which are very costly when somebody dies.  Costs have been incurred and 

therefore becomes a sorry event for those who are mourning because they have to pay 

large  amounts  of  bills  for  certain  activities  carried  out  as  a  result  of  the  lost  one.  

Therefore, I stand to support the Clause, I have no objection at all.  If anything, I am 

happy  to  see  that  this  Amendment  has  been  inserted  in  order  to  assist  the  areas 

concerned. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

</span><span>Honourable Member, Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you and your staff.  Kia Orana 

also  to  the  Prime  Minister,  who  is  not  here,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Ministers, 

Government  Members, the Leader of the Opposition and your Opposition Members, 

Kia  Orana.    I  can  see  there  is  one  vacant  seat  in  the  Opposition  Party.    No  one  is 

sitting on it.  I know it is  the Honourable Norman George so I would like to send a 

special  greetings  to  you  my  friend.   Because when you were here in  this Parliament 

you  called me  a baby.  This baby has been warning you to be careful with what you 

say but you never listened. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> You are on Clause 4 Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  P.  TEITI:</span><span>  I  am  only  sending  a  greeting  Mr  Chairman.    Kia  Orana  also  to  our 

people  listening  in  to  our  discussion  this  afternoon  on  this  Amendment  Bill.    I  also 

stand to give my support to Clause 4.  Yesterday when I was speaking on the principle 

and the merits, I also touched on the issue in Clause 4.  I did not speak on any other 

Clause, including Clause 5.  What we are doing is changing the law that we already 

enacted  but  when  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  got  up  to  speak  he  accused  me  of 

supporting the burden that the shipping line and also the airlines are imposing on our 

</span><span>people.  I know I didn’t want to interrupt the Honourable Member in his speaking </span><span>time 

because I knew I had my own rights in this House and I wanted to take this time to 

clarify my position.  Before I speak, Mr Chairman, I think before I say anything and I 

also understand what I say.  The amendment before the House, Mr Chairman, tells us 

that before this VAT was brought into force, they were exempted and when this VAT 

was in force these things were being charged VAT on it so because of the queries of 

our  people  and  because  of  what  our  people  have  been talking about,  Government  is 

</span><span>thinking of bringing back what we used to have in the past. 

</span></div><div><span>In this Clause, Mr Chairman, this was already in our laws before but then when VAT 

came into force all these goods were charged VAT and then because of the noises that 

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>131 

</span></div><div><span>our  people  made  to  Government,  Government  thought  that  they  would  exempt  the 

importation  tax on these things.  We are not trying to change the law, Mr Chairman.  

What  we  are  doing  is  putting  it  back  to  what  it  was  before  VAT  was  applied.    Mr 

Chairman, the problem today with the airlines and the shipping is their business.  We 

cannot  do  anything  about  something  that  is  their  problem.    Mr  Chairman,  what  the 

Leader  of  the  Opposition  did  yesterday  was  he  told  our  people  that  I  supported  the 

amendment that we are bringing in this House now.  I did not say that, Mr Chairman,  

but I did say something like that when the principal Act was brought in this House for 

enactment.   Mr Chairman, our people are clever.  What I am doing now is trying to 

justify  my  actions,  I  am  trying  to  clarify  my  position  on  this,  that  I  did  not  say 

anything  that  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  alleged  that  I  had  said.    I  only  got  up  to 

clear myself on this matter, Mr Chairman.  Thank you Honourable Member. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:</span><span>  I  would  like  to  call  upon  the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. DR T. MAOATE:</span><span>Mr Chairman, I didn’t stand to reply to the comments from 

</span><span>the Honourable Member.  I have gotten up because I was interested when listening to 

the  comments  from  the  Honourable  Member,  Paora  Teiti,  concerning  his  comments 

on t</span><span>he reasons he said the Amendment was brought into this House.  I’m glad because 

</span><span>I think the people who asked for the exemptions are CIP supporters.  I want to ask this 

Government please do not do that.   

</span></div><div><span>I can recall, Mr Chairman, at a retreat that was held quite recently at the Rarotongan 

Hotel  Mr  Robert  Wigmore  got  up  and  asked  Government  to  exempt  VAT  on  the 

importation  of  water  tanks  from  overseas  because  we  are  experiencing  low  water 

pressure these days.  Mr Robert Wigmore was asking for the exemption of water tanks 

because  he  imports  them  from  overseas,  and  the  people  are  asking  for  this  same 

exemption.    That  was  the  request  that  he  put  forward  to  Government.    This  was  an 

urgent need for the people.   

</span></div><div><span>So  I  think,  Mr  Chairman,  if  this  Government  is  only  going  to  listen  to  their  Cook 

Islands Party supporters then these ideas, or these good views, from other people will 

not be heard fairly.  I want to ask the Honourable Member to not just listen to a Cook 

Islands Party supporter but to listen to good views such as this one that this person has 

put forward to Government.   

</span></div><div><span>When I look at this particular Clause, Mr Chairman, I see that there are some things 

that were  brought to the attention of the Select Committee that VAT be exempted on 

those commodities or those goods but the committee did not accept that.  This is what 

I  am  looking  at,  Mr  Chairman,  because  Government  is  responsible  for  bringing  in 

these Amendments without calling the Select Committee together again.  Looking at 

the  Amendment  before  the  House,  there  are  several  Amendments  here  so  I  am  just 

wondering whether it would have been better for Government if they were to call that 

Select  Committee  together  again  to  look  at  what  we  are  Amending  in  this 

Amendment.  Because when I compare this Amendment to the other urgent needs that 

I have highlighted, I think this is very important that we look at it again.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>132 

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, there were other issues that were brought to the attention of the Select 

Committee  for  example:  things  that  will  help  boost  the  economy.    For  example:- 

Agricultural products or agricultural equipment.  We have also looked at fishing, Mr 

Chairman, but we have not granted anything to do with that.  There are other things 

that we could discuss.  

</span></div><div><span>The point that I am trying to make here, is that it looks easy for Government to bring 

in these amendments into this House without referring back to the Select Committee 

that was first established to look into the issue on VAT.  If we are to imagine that by 

next year there are more CIPs coming in to Government and who may say - look we 

need  these  things  to  be  exempted  from  VAT,  we  want  another  change  to  this  one 

</span><span>Amendment.  By the end of the term,  we will find just about everything that’s been 

</span><span>rejected by the Select Committee, are now accepted by this Government through this 

</span><span>system, which I now don’t like.  I ask the Minister to be cautious about these kinds of 

</span><span>amendments.   

</span></div><div><span>When we started the Act we were serious about it, both sides worked on it very hard.  

</span><span>Now it seems  it’s easy for Govern</span><span>ment to come up with amendments and sooner or 

</span><span>later, the whole thing will be back to square one.  I suggest, Mr Chairman, before I sit 

</span><span>down,  that  Government  reconsider  the  approach  to  these  amendments,  particularly 

with this specific amendment in this VAT, so that the review is taken seriously again 

as it was when we started.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any other speakers?  

The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Clause 4 stands part of the Bill? 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Clause 5 - Zero-rated supplies.  The Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:</span><span> To you Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of this House and our 

people listening in, Kia Orana.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Chairman,  I  just  want  to  touch  on  some  of  the  things  that  I  was  talking  about 

</span><span>yesterday to do with the principles and merits on the freight charges of cargo, and also 

</span><span>air fares.   

</span></div><div><span>We all know, Mr Chairman, that our people in the Outer Islands will be burdened if 

this exemption is removed from the transportation of passengers and goods.  Maybe, 

Mr  Chairman,  it  is  right  for  me  to  tell  this  House  that  this  is  the  first  time  in  our 

country that shipping to the Outer Islands has been very good and quite regular, and 

not only that the conditions on the ship have improved as well.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to thank the shipping owner Tapi Taio for providing a very good service.   

</span></div><div><span>What I am concerned about, Mr Chairman, is in this Amendment, if we are going to 

bring VAT. back, I am afraid Tapi Taio will take his ship somewhere else and leave us 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>133 

</span></div><div><span>with  no  shipping  service  in  the  Cook  Islands  because  of  what  the  Deputy  Prime 

Minister said yesterday when we debated the principle and merits.  I was so concerned 

I rang the shipping owner and asked him why he did not drop his freight rate and his 

fares down.  He explained the last time the freight was increased was in 1992.  What 

we do not know is the fuel costs have already been on the increase now to about 60%.   

</span></div><div><span>In  the  past  the  fuel  for  shipping  operations  internally  in  the  Cook  Islands  was 

subsidised by the Government  and Government spent about $200,000 per annum on 

those costs.  I asked the owner whether he would increase the freight charges when the 

VAT exemption is removed.  He replied that he would have no alternative but to put 

the  charge  back  onto  our  people.    So  I  feel  sympathy  for  the  people  in  the  Outer 

Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>I would like to ask the Minister to look at this situation carefully again, Mr Chairman, 

because of the fares of the passengers who do not complain when they experience the 

benefits of the good conditions on the ship, and also the amount of cargo that is being 

transported to and from the Outer Islands which we have not seen before in the past.  I 

want to ask the Minister to review this because we know the Northern Group has been 

</span><span>struck by a cyclone.  If we are going to impose VAT. on goods and materials for their 

</span><span>buildings then it is going to be an added burden on our people.   

</span></div><div><span>Those are my comments, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Leader of the Opposition, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>  Mr  Chairman,  I  rise  because  I  do  not  have  enough 

understanding of this part of the Clause.   

</span></div><div><span>Before going on there has been some comments about a Monopoly in the explanation 

given by the Minister in charge.  In most cases monopolies are, in general, not a good 

</span><span>idea.    The  Monopoly  dominates  on  creating  it’s  own  prices  and  in  many  cases  the 

</span><span>prices  are  laid  down  to  suit  the  business.    If  there is  no control over it then there is 

nothing  the  customer  can  do  about  it.    By  control,  I  mean,  if  there  is  no  means  of 

controlling the pricing of services then the consumer certainly is going to have to bear 

the burden for those prices.   

</span></div><div><span>The Minister has pointed out certain monopolies being carried out in the country.  Of 

course he also outlined the benefits that can be created by the situation where you only 

need one operator to undertake that particular part of a business sector.   

</span></div><div><span>But  there  are  other  examples  of  a  situation  where  a  Monopoly  is  no  good.    For 

example,  the  heat  treatment  plant  for  the  growers,  exporters  of  fruit  and  vegetables.  

When you have a situation like that, the growers moan that they are not getting much 

out of it.  The system keeps you away from doing your own thing.  The only way you 

can control this thing, I think the Minister mentioned, and that is to have price control 

on  the  service  or  whatever  charges  carried  out  by  that  particular  Monopoly.    But  it 

puts  the local  airline and shipping line into a situation whereby they have no option 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>134 

                                                                                                       26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>but to convey whatever increase their is in prices - to the consumer, and that is, to the 

people in the Outer Islands.   

</span></div><div><span>I have been advised by the assistant Financial Secretary with regard to this particular 

Amendment of the Bill and realise what has been said by the Minister is true.  But the 

point  here  is  -  </span><span>is  this  Amendment  going  to  ease  the  burden  on  the  Outer  Islands’ 

</span><span>people at all?  It is all very well for Government to realise they are losing money and 

through  this  particular  Clause  that  allows  for  local  shipping  and  the  airline  to  get 

refunds from the VAT. that has been imposed on fuel, to be refunded to the companies 

running these services.  The way I see it Government is trying to place us in a position 

where it is  easy for Government to implement this particular Amendment.  Whether 

that  is  going  to  be  of  any  help  to  the  Outer  Islands  people,  I  am  not  so  sure,  Mr 

Chairman.   

</span></div><div><span>As  a  member  of  the  Select  Committee  established  at  the  time  this  was  being 

deliberated, it was our strong intention to keep costs of goods and services through the 

local airline and shipping line to be as minimal as possible for our people in the Outer 

Islands, who are always taking the extra burden of this cost.   

</span></div><div><span>Again, Mr Chairman, before I sit down may I express my deep concern that this has 

not been brought back to the notice... or rather reactivate the Select Committee to look 

at these amendments seriously before it is brought to the House for Amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Thank you Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Member.  Are there any further speakers?  

The Honourable Member Paora Teiti. 

</span></div><div><span>MR P. TEITI:</span><span> Thank you Mr Chairman.  I rise to air my views on Clause 5.  Let us 

realise  we  are  going  ahead  and  not  backwards.    We  are  concerned  about  the  Outer 

Islands who will suffer the consequences.  We cannot help things where the Ngamaru 

brings things from New Zealand to Rarotonga and then it is passed onto the smaller 

boats  who  go  to  the  Outer  Islands,  and  this  is  where  the  difficulty  is.    The  Outer 

Islands will suffer the consequences because of what is happening.  Before the freights 

on  both  shipping  and  the  airlines  was  reasonable.    But  as  we  go  through  time,  they 

have to increase their prices in order to meet the requirement in services.   

</span></div><div><span>I can remember when I bought a Honda in Aitutaki.  It only cost me $200 and today 

</span><span>that same bike costs $3,000.  We cannot go to the salespeople and say “you cannot do 

this”, because the owner has to keep up with the times and costs.  I feel that we should 

</span><span>not  be  talking  about  this  because  these  people  are  only  doing  what  is  best  for  their 

interests.  We cannot do anything for them.  We cannot ask them to reduce the freight 

</span><span>to Aitutaki because if they don’t do anything about it, what can they earn?  What can 

</span><span>they receive in  terms  of profit?  Concerning the local airlines and shipping services, 

</span><span>they  shouldn’t  have  to  do  anything  to  follow  what  we  are  saying  here  because  they 

</span><span>should only do what is best for them and their businesses. 

</span></div><div><span>In the Cook Islands a long time ago we used to utilise thatched roofs for our houses.  

Today, nobody wants to stay in a kikau house.  Everybody wants to stay under an iron 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>135 

</span></div><div><span>roof.    Why?    Because  of  the  way  of  living.    We  have  to  proceed  as  time  goes  on.  

Before there was only two taxes on the island  - income tax and turnover tax, but as 

time goes by Government thought it best to introduce another, but as they introduced 

this  one,  we  can  see  now  the  difficulty  that we are going through because today we 

just have to do what is required of us because here in Rarotonga things are cheap.  I 

went to the shop and bought something and I found it to be cheap.  Because before the 

VAT  was  introduced  I  had  very  little  money  to  spend  in  the  shops  but  after  the 

introduction  of  the  Value  Added  Tax,  I  found  I  had  a  few  more  dollars  for  me  to 

spend.  So here we are today, what are we trying to say?  The two business services 

have  to  continue  to  carry  out  their  duties  in  order  to  lift  their  service  up,  not  to  go 

backwards.  Mr Chairman, life today is going ahead.  We are not going downwards.  

</span><span>We don’t want to go back to kikau houses because people will laugh at us.  So we just 

have  to  do  what  the  shipping  and  airline  services  in  place  have  to  do.    If  you  don’t 

want  to  send  your  cargo  then  that’s  your  problem  because  when  my  wife  and  I  go 

</span><span>sho</span><span>pping she will say “that’s a lot of money”.  I say if it’s a lot of money let’s get out.  

</span><span>So  we  cannot  help  it  one  way  or  the  other,  but  what  we  need  to  do  is  see  what 

Government is trying to do and Government is trying to find a way to help our people 

to improve the standard of living.  So, Mr Chairman, this is all I have to say regarding 

</span><span>these two, the airline and shipping line who have to carry out their services.
