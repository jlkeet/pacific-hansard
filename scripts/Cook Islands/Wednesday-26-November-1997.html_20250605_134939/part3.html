<div><span>ORDERS</span><span>OF</span><span>THE</span><span>DAY</span></div><div><span>Value Added Tax Amendment Bill.  Interrupted debate on the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>I  now  call  upon  the  Honourable  Minister  and  Assistant  Minister  of  Finance, 

</span><span>Papamama Pokino, to reply and close the debate on the Second Reading. 

</span></div><div><span>HON</span><span>.  </span><span>P</span><span>. </span><span>POKINO</span><span>:   Thank you Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to  you, Kia Orana also  to 

your  staff  and to  Honourable Members  of the House.  Kia Orana also  to  our people 

listening in to our discussion.  I will not be too long, Mr Speaker.  I just want to reply 

to some of the questions that were raised yesterday. 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  the  question  by  the  Honourable  Member  from  Manihiki  on  the  building 

materials that will be imported to rebuild some buildings on the island of Manihiki.   I 

have been advised, Mr Speaker, that all those commodities, as a result of any disaster, 

are VAT exempted.  That will be located in Clause 5 (d) of the principal Act. 

</span></div><div><span>The second question was raised by Mama Mau.  I want to advise her yes, she can get a 

refund for the VAT they paid on their construction materials.  As I said yesterday, Mr 

Speaker,  that  all  these  amendments  that  we  are  now  debating  have  already  been 

discussed  by  the  Select  Committee  but  unfortunately  were  not  included  in  the 

principal  Act.    However,  Mr  Speaker,  the  spirit  of  the  discussion  carried  out  by  the 

Select Committee were being carried out by officials responsible for implementing the 

</span><span>Act.  That is why it is possible to make all these refunds at this stage even though the 

</span><span>Bill  has  not  been put through the House yet because the matters were discussed and 

approved by the Select Committee, which I explained were inadvertently omitted from 

the Act.  Therefore, the purpose of the Amendment is to incorporate those omissions 

in  the  principal  Act.    I  think  the  only  matter  of  controversy  in  this  Amendment  is 

removal of the zero-rating in passenger and air freight to the Outer Islands.  I believe 

the Deputy Prime Minister, in his speech yesterday, made the appropriate explanation 

why that was done.  But I would like to go over that explanation again to make it clear 

to everybody why the zero-rating on passenger and air freight to the Outer Islands has 

</span><span>been removed.  The idea of zero-rating those items in the first place were so that the 

</span><span>shippers  and  the  fliers  will  be  able  to  reduce  fares  and  freight  to  the  Outer  Islands.  

That  was  the  principle  behind  zero-rating  those  items.    The  idea  was  that  the  two 

concerns  were  allowed  to  claim  VAT  over  those  commodities,  the  understanding 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>26 November 1997 

</span></div><div><span>125 

</span></div><div><span>being that they will then be able to reduce their charges on freight and passenger fares.  

Unfortunately, that was not the case even though they could claim a refund on VAT, 

the fares and the freight did not fall.  In fact, Mr Speaker, the shipping freight to the 

Outer Islands now is at its maximum allowable under the law.  By zero-rating it, we 

expected that cargo freight would drop but unfortunately it remained where it was.  At 

the same time, the firms were claiming a refund on VAT on those air freight and fares. 

</span></div><div><span>In other words, Mr Speaker, the benefit of zero-rating those items were being enjoyed 

by the general public of the Outer Islands.  It was felt that the only way control can be 

made  over  excessive  charges  is  by  price  control.    Unfortunately,  the  zero-rating  of 

those items did not provide instruction to the concerned firms to reduce their charges.  

It  was  left  to  the  owners  of  the  businesses,  left  to  their  discretion  to  reduce  the 

charges, to take into consideration the reclamation of VAT they were entitled to. 

</span></div><div><span>I think I have already mentioned in this House, some time in the past, that there is a 

move  now  to  bring  into  the  House  legislation  controlling  the  unfair  practices  and 

overcharging within the business sector.  Based on the New Zealand system it is called 

a Commerce Commission, or something like that.  It judges or keeps an eye on unfair 

</span><span>practices, something like a Fair Trade Commission.  I feel, Mr Speaker, that it is the 

</span><span>place  to  include  this  zero-rating  to    control  businesses,  to  bring  it  in  under  the 

umbrella of fair trade legislation.  That legislation is now in the Office of the Crown 

Law and hope</span><span>fully will be ready quickly to be enacted in this Parliament.  Let’s face 

</span><span>it,  Mr  Speaker,  there  are  a  lot  of  businesses  that  will  not  survive  with  competition, 

although we are for open trade and open competition but there are certain businesses 

that cannot survive under that scenario.  Let us just give an example.  One example is 

international  shipping.    I  know  there  is  a  lot  of  people  wanting  to  compete.    Sure, 

those ones with plenty of money, they can drop their charges down as little as possible 

in order to get the other out of business.  If there are several shipping lines available, 

the ones with most money will try and get their charges down so that the others will be 

driven out of business.  The danger is once the other line is out of business then the 

one who has dropped his charges can then raise his charges up.  And if his claim for 

</span><span>increased charges is not agreed to, he can just say all right we’ll take our ships away.  

</span><span>And  where does that leave us, Mr Speaker?  It leaves us with no shipping line.  I use 

this as an example of disadvantage of certain monopolies. This needs to be looked at 

</span><span>urgently because this has actually happened to a shipping line, they couldn’t operate 

</span><span>with  the reduced charges.  They just want to force something else that reduced their 

</span><span>charges, they couldn’t survive on that scenario so they asked for an increase and when 

</span><span>it wasn’t agreed to they shifted, they moved.  </span></div><div><span>The other scenario, Mr Speaker, is the case of our local airlines, nobody else wishes to 

compete  with  it.    But  w</span><span>e  need  that  local  airline  over  here.    That  means  it’s  a 

</span><span>Monopoly.    But  unfortunately  nobody  else  wants  to  compete  with  it.    At  least  one 

</span><span>company  tried  to  compete,  Mr  Speaker,  but  I  don’t  know  what  happened  to  that 

</span><span>company.    So  that  is  the  proposal,  Mr  Speaker,    in  order  to  cover  all  these 

possibilities.  I  am  not  saying  it  could  happen  but  they  are  possibilities.  In  order  to 

cover those, we need to introduce what I call a Fair Trading Act, or a Commerce Act, 

or something like that. And that is being drafted right now. And I believe, Mr Speaker, 

that is the place to incorporate the zero-rating of the outer islands air fares or sea fares

</span></div><div><span>and cargo.  That’s all I have to say about those queries that were raised yesterday,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span> Thank you Honourable Minister.  The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Bill be now read a Second time?
