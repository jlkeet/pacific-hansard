opening would be done in an ordinary way.  But the second message reminded me of 

</span><span>this  very  wise  saying  and  it  goes  like  this  “Yea,  winter  has  passed,  the  rain  has 

</span><span>stopped,  the  land  is  covered  with  the  blossoms  of  flowers,  and  the  music  from  the 

</span><span>singing doves reached our ears.”</span></div><div><span>Can an Honourable Member please close us with a prayer?
