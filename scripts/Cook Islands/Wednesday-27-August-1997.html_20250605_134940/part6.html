<div><span>HONOURABLE MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>The Prime Minister and Lady Henry, Cabinet Members and their wives, the Speaker 

and Members of Parliament and their wives, Kia Orana to you all. 

</span></div><div><span>The  President  of  the  House  of  Ariki,  members  of  the  House  of  Ariki,  the  Ui  Ariki 

throughout  the  land,  the President of the Koutu Nui and members of the Koutu Nui 

and the Aronga Mana throughout the land, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>The President of the Religious Advisory Council, members of the Religious Advisory 

Committee, Leaders and members of all the churches in the country, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Members of the judiciary and the diplomatic corps, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>A special Kia Orana to all those whom the Queen has kindly honoured. 

</span></div><div><span>As the representative of Her Gracious Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, I welcome you to 

the forty-second Ceremonial Opening of the Parliament of the Cook Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>We are here to open the 42nd Session of the Parliament of the Cook Islands.  Future  

historians will  remember the 41st Parliament as one of our greatest, for never in the 

previous 31 years since independence had there been such a challenge and, yet, they 

met  it  with  landmark  legislation  and  with  the  never-to-be  forgotten  First  Reform 

Budget. 

</span></div><div><span>With the support of many segments of the community, the 41st Parliament right-sized 

my  Government,  reformed  our  ways  of  financial  management,  restructured  how  the 

Public Service is employed, and made service the first goal of every Ministry.  Even 

then, they did  not  rest  but,  with  the PERCA Act, installed a watchdog committee to 

</span><span>assure that what they had formed, no one could put asunder. 

</span></div><div><span>All that was achieved in just 140 stormy days.  Then, in the waning months of 1996, 

when  the  shock,  challenge  and  excitement  of  rescue  and  reform  had  subsided,  there 

followed  the  week  to  week  task  of  holding  course,  repairing  the  vessel  and  simply 

making headway against so many forces. 

</span></div><div><span>Those  were  the  early  days  of  privatisation  when  liquor  was  deregulated,  the  Akitua 

was  sold  and  other  assets  including  CITV,  Cook  Islands  Telecom  shares,  and  three 

Government-owned  resorts  were  advertised  for  sale,  absolute  proof  that  my 

Government intended thereafter to govern, not compete. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>27 August 1997 

</span></div><div><span>3 

</span></div><div><span>Then came the National Retreat of January 1997, not a crisis-driven gathering, but one 

that chose to look ahead in a wholly constructive manner.  Over four days the reform 

progress was reviewed.  Each Ministry and most public concerns were aired, debated 

and decided. 

</span></div><div><span>From these, there emerged explicit financial principles which were brought together in 

a second historic document, the Budget Policy Statement: </span><span>Te Akataka Anga Moni Ate 

Kavamani  O  te  Kuki  Airani  Mataiti  1997/98</span><span>.    In  it,  my  Government  stated  its 

intentions with respect to the collection and expenditure of public funds: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Comply with spending levels reflecting a far more focused role; 

</span><span></span><span>Comply with publicly disclosed taxation and expenditure policies; 

</span><span></span><span>Maintain  a  balanced  budget  with  a  contingency  element  for  unforeseen 

</span></div><div><span>events; 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Impose debt management disciplines; and 

</span><span></span><span>Allocate funds via output-based criteria determined by national policy. 

</span></div><div><span>Not  long  after  the  National  Retreat,  my  Government  invited  representatives  of  the 

leading  institutions,  non-Government  agencies  and  productive  sectors  to  represent 

their  constituents  in  a  National  Development  Council.    The  group  came  together 

</span><span>willingly.  Under the Chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister, NDC’s first major 

task  at  Cabinet’s  request  was  to  comment  on  the  Second  Reform  Budget  which 

</span><span>Cabinet then finalised and which the 41st Parliament recently passed. 

</span></div><div><span>My  Government  believes  that  the  Second  Reform  Budget  is,  if  anything,  more 

important  than  the  first.    That  is  because  the  first  was  accomplished  under  duress 

whereas the second evolved within an organised process managed by a cross section 

of the community, diverse groups all committed to continuing the reform and getting 

on to new recovery and growth.  It was simply business as usual, the second of its kind 

and, presumably, the second of dozens more yet follow. 

</span></div><div><span>It was at the January retreat when my Government offered a vision towards which we 

will travel throughout the first decade of reform.  Vision 2005 is simple but inclusive.  

</span><span>As  a  nation,  it  states,  “we  are  capable  of  achieving  by  the  year  2005  a  standard  of 

</span><span>living  equal  to  if  not  better  than  any in  the region,  and in  harmony with  our culture 

</span><span>and environment.”</span></div><div><span>My  Government  believes  that  Vision  2005  has  taken  hold.    As  a  result  of  our 

combined pursuit of Vision 2005, my Government will: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Be self-reliant and not dependent on external aid; 

</span><span></span><span>Encourage and enjoy private sector growth; 

</span><span></span><span>Maintain that growth in harmony with the culture and environment that we 

</span></div><div><span>cherish; 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Develop  a  substantial  reserve  fund  with  its  surplus  invested  in  health, 

</span></div><div><span>education, culture, sports and the preservation of our ecosystem; and 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Operate  with  simple,  transparent  development  policies  but  continuing  to 

</span></div><div><span>raise national standards and ideals. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>4 

</span></div><div><span>27 August 1997 

</span></div><div><span>The  Budget  Policy  Statement  named  three  cornerstones  necessary  to  successfully 

achieving these: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>A  resonant  and  vibrant  culture,  not  isolated  from  the  international 

</span></div><div><span>community; 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Sustainable use of our natural resources; and  

</span><span></span><span>Maintaining  a  practical  approach  to  economic  growth  while  setting 

</span></div><div><span>benchmark standards within the region. 

</span></div><div><span>My  Government  believes  that  the  principles,  guidelines  and  cornerstones  which 

emerged  from  the  reform  process  are  beginning  to  yield  the  hoped  for  progress.    A 

recent report by an Asian Development Bank economist stated: 

</span></div><div><span>“The projections  for the next  three years up to  2000 assume a resumpti</span><span>on of 

the longer term growth trend with about 3% real growth in 1998 and 6% real 

growth in the two succeeding years.  These trends are underpinned by stronger 

tourist  expenditures  and  a  resumption  of  investment  activity  --  mainly  on 

tourist related facilities. 

</span></div><div><span>At  about  NZ$8,000  per  capita,  the  Cook  Islands  has  the  highest  GDP  in  the 

Pacific,  but  this  is  not  evenly  spread.    Average  incomes  on  Rarotonga  are 

much  higher  than  average  incomes  in  the  Outer  Islands.    A  more  equitable 

distribution of income among </span><span>islands remains one of the Government’s major 

goals.”</span></div><div><span>In  that  last  sentence, the economist  put  his  finger squarely on what  my Government 

believes  is  the  major  task  that  we  as  a  nation  must  address.    It  is  the  equitable 

development of all the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>While  it  is  conceivable  that  a  right-sized  central  Government  and  a  rejuvenated  and 

growing  private  sector  on  Rarotonga  can  take  us  far  towards  Vision  2005,  my 

Government  believes  that  it  is  inconceivable  that  financial  independence  is  wholly 

obtainable without greater private sector growth in the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>Nor will such growth occur without bold action.  Towards this end, my Government 

</span><span>has initiated a policy of devolution of much of central Government’s decision</span><span>-making 

authority to the local Governments of the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>With only nine more years remaining to 2005, my Government decided to put its faith 

in  the other half of its citizens as well.  It believes there can be no better persons to 

manage  day  to  day  affairs  on  Pukapuka,  Manihiki,  or  Mauke  than  the  Pukapukans, 

Manihikians or Maukeans. 

</span></div><div><span>Nor  is  devolution  confined  to  the  Outer  Islands,  for  my  Government  views  the 

principle of decentralisation equally applicable to Rarotonga.  This year, it will return 

many of its powers to the hands of three Vaka Councils, which together represent the 

</span><span>traditional  centers of this island’s local Government.</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>27 August 1997 

</span></div><div><span>5 

</span></div><div><span>With  regard  to  the  coming  year,  there  remain  many  challenges.    My  Government 

believes  this  is  no  time  to  relax  or  to  bask  in  our  successes.    This  is  true  of  the 

community, of the Ministries, of the National Development Council and Cabinet and, 

most certainly, of you the 42nd Parliament. 

</span></div><div><span>The major legislative tasks for this session will include: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Amendments to bring other Acts into line with the new Ministry if Finance 

and Economic Development Act, with the Public Service Commission Act, 

with the Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit Act. 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Empowering legislation that will formalise the process of devolution. 

</span><span></span><span>Legislation  which  expands  the  offshore  industry  and  improves  the 

</span></div><div><span>regulatory environment which governs it 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Commercial legislation which will provide for consumer protection and fair 

</span></div><div><span>competition; and 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Provision for the reform of tariffs and price controls. 

</span></div><div><span>Beyond the matter of legislation, much remains.  My Government will give its highest 

priorities to: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Restructuring its debt; 

</span><span></span><span>Facilitating  growth  in  tourism,  marine  resources,  agriculture  -  most 

</span></div><div><span>especially in the Outer Islands; and 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Rationalising its aid policy. 

</span></div><div><span>NZODA,  AUSAID  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  are  by  far  the  largest  donor 

agencies in support of our highest priority needs.  Of the $10.0 million projected for 

aid  in  1997/98,  these  three  have  committed  to  not  less  than  $9.0  million  of  it.    The 

remainder  is  to  be  provided  by  the  World  Health  Organisation,  United  Nations 

agencies,  the  Forum  Secretariat,  Forum  Fisheries  Agency,  France,  Germany,  and 

Canada - in that order. 

</span></div><div><span>With  regard  to  NZODA  and  AUSAID,  my  Government  has  proposed  that  their 

assistance  never  again  be  used  for  budgetary  support  and,  further,  that  all  aid  be 

focused  on  a  few  chosen  and  planned  areas.    Its  reasoning  for  this  is  that, if we are 

</span><span>committed  to  Vision  2005,  the  Cook  Islands  will  achieve  a  standard  of  living  that 

</span><span>makes aid of any kind largely complementary. 

</span></div><div><span>My  Government  has  made  clear  that,  while  not  wanting  budgetary  aid,  it  welcomes 

project aid, but only for those projects that will encourage sustainability after 2005.  In 

particular, these are: 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Human resource building, especially in health and education; 

</span><span></span><span>Infrastructure  improvements,  especially  in  waste  management,  coastal 

</span></div><div><span>protection and water systems; and 

</span></div><div><span></span><span>Outer  Islands  development,  especially  by  means  of  project  funding  in 

</span></div><div><span>response to bids from the Outer Islanders themselves. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>6 

</span></div><div><span>27 August 1997 

</span></div><div><span>My Government hopes that Rarotonga’s </span><span>private sector will seek ways to expand their 

interests into the Outer Islands, both through direct developments and in joint venture 

with the Outer Islands.  My Government notes that one entrepreneur has boldly paved 

the way with much improved inter-island shipping and urges that others in their own 

way follow his example. 

</span></div><div><span>My  Government  believes  that  Outer  Islands  development  is  less  a  challenge  than  a 

major opportunity.  A localised fishing fleet based in Penrhyn could harvest and sell 

3,000  tonnes  of  fish  per  year  on  a  sustainable  basis,  therein  offering  a  $30  million 

dollar  industry.    With  the  extension  of  black  pearl  farming  beyond  Manihiki  and 

Penrhyn to, for example, Pukapuka and Suwarrow, another $30 million addition to the 

</span><span>nation’s GDP is foreseeab</span><span>le. 

</span></div><div><span>The Southern Group has similar opportunities, but with quite different resources.  My 

Government  intends  to  make  every  effort  to  facilitate  an  increase  in  visitor 

accommodations  and  activities  here,  first  with  significant  new  construction  on 

Aitutaki  and,  then,  over  several  years  to  each  of  the  other  islands  in  the  Southern 

Group.  These steps will lead inevitably to more commercial farming, both to service 

</span><span>the spreading visitor industry and, then, through more export of agricultural products 

</span><span>to Rarotonga and overseas. 

</span></div><div><span>Going beyond the Outer Islands to the nation as a whole, my Government wishes to 

facilitate foreign investment.  The creation of a Development investment Board is one 

step it has taken in this direction.  Changes to offshore legislation is another. 

</span></div><div><span>I  hope  that  the  Heads  of  Ministries  will  forgive  me  for  leaving  out  the  traditional 

litany of all the fine work that they have done and will do.  My Government and the 

community  are  aware  of  the  much-improved  services  you  are  providing  with 

diminished funding and we are grateful for these. 

</span></div><div><span>As for the year 2005, I myself will be over 90 years young.  The good Lord willing, I 

look  forward  to  seeing  our  national  vision  become  a  fact  and  will,  along  with  Lady 

Short,  enjoy  fruits  of  achieving  that  vision  for  many  years  thereafter.    Having  lived 

eight  decades,  I  can  assure  you  that  each  one,  taken  alone,  seems  a  short  period  of 

time.  Thus, nine years from now seems no time at all. 

</span></div><div><span>I hereby declare this 42nd Session of the Cook Islands Parliament open.
