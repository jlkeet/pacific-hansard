<div><span>COMMITTEE OF SUPPLY 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Interrupted debate on the Question: 

</span></div><div><span>That the sum of $9,058,566 for Ministry of Outer Island Development 

stands part of the Schedule? 

</span></div><div><span>The last Member who spoke was the Honourable Member for Rakahanga.  You have 

two more minutes on your first speech.  You have the floor Sir. 

</span></div><div><span>DR P. ROBATI:  </span><span>Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to all Honourable Members.  

Good afternoon to you all.  One thing I did not like about this vote item is that there is 

no indication of how much is allocated for Rakahanga.  I have met with the Secretary 

of Outer Island Affairs and he has told me, I will have that report but at the moment, I 

have not.  I do not think the difficulty is with him, I think it is with MFEM.  How can 

I know if the Rakahanga allocation has not been transferred to Pukapuka to help buy a 

sawmill in Pukapuka?  How can I tell if the money was not used to charter a plane for 

Inatio Akaruru to go to Pukapuka?  There is no breakdown for budget allocation for 

this  island,  so  I  am  suspicious  while  this  campaign  is  going  on.    The  thing  I  would 

like to look at is this, all the Outer Islands asked for a sawmill and the only one that 

received it in a hurry was Pukapuka.  Maybe it is because of the by-election going on.  

These are crooked things happening. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:  </span><span>Do you wish to take your second speech?  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any further speakers?  Can I have order in the House please?   

</span></div><div><span>The Minister of Outer Island Development. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Kia Orana to you, to the Clerk of 

</span><span>the House, and to the staff directly under your control and management.  Kia Orana to 

</span><span>the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, my  colleagues in  Cabinet and of course 

Members of the Government Caucus. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>251 

</span></div><div><span>I think, Mr Chairman, I would be amiss if I don’t extend that same spirit of Kia Orana 

</span><span>to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  your  Deputy  Leader  and  of  course  all  Honourable 

Members  on  the  Opposition  side.    To  the  Honourable  Tom  Marsters  and  Tangata 

Vavia </span><span>–</span><span> Kia Orana to both of you. 

</span></div><div><span>Kia Orana to our members of the public listening in to this debate this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>At this point in time, Mr Chairman, I would like to extend a special Kia Orana to all 

the people of the Outer Islands. The Ui Ariki, the Ui Rangatira, the Ui Mataiapo, the 

Aronga  Mana  and  all  of  you  in  the  Outer  Islands  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana.    To  the  Mayors, 

Members  of  the  Island  Council,  Members  of  the  Churches  and  the  people  in  the 

private  sectors  in  the  Outer  Islands  </span><span>–</span><span>  Kia  Orana  to  you  all.    To  the  Government 

Representatives, public servants and Members of Parliament from the Outer Islands </span><span>–</span><span>

Kia Orana again. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, I make special mention and extend a special Kia Orana to the people in 

the  Outer  Islands.  The  Vote  Item  that  we  have  before  this  House  deals  with  the 

</span><span>disposition  of  $9,058,560  which  is  the  biggest  amount  from  FEM  than  the  other 

</span><span>Ministries as set  out  in the Appropriation Bill  before the House.   It  may  be large in 

number as opposed to those amounts allocated to other Ministries but, is it sufficient 

to  efficiently  and  effectively  service  the  needs  of  our  Outer  Islands.    Now  that 

question,  Mr  Chairman,  will  be  addressed  in  my  effort  to  find  them  a  solution  to 

satisfy the needs of the Outer Islands. 

</span></div><div><span>You  know,  Mr  Chairman,  yesterday  in  this  House,  the  Honourable  Member  for  the 

island  of  Rakahanga,  Papa  Pupuke  Robati  asked  a  couple  of  questions.    You  know, 

one of the questions he raised was why is it that the island of Manihiki is without a 

doctor?  Or why is it that the island of Rakahanga is without a doctor?  You know, Mr 

Chairman,  if  I  am  compelled  to  answer  those  two  questions,  I  will  try  to  find  an 

answer that would see the easy way out. One of those answers that I would give to get 

the  easy  way  out  is  to  tell  him,  that  because  of  the  population  ratio.  The  island  of 

Rakahanga does not need a doctor.  Or is it because the other answer that I would give 

</span><span>is  that  because  there  is  no  doctor’s  residence  on  the  island.    Therefore  Rakahanga 

</span><span>cannot have a doctor.  Or a third possible answer would be, Mr Chairman, because the 

mosquitoes are abundant in Rakahanga.  Therefore no doctor would like to go there. 

</span></div><div><span>Now an issue would then come, Mr Chairman, whether I, as Minister responsible for 

Outer Islands Development, is giving a truthful answer or whether I, Mr Chairman as 

a  Member  of  Parliament  in  this  House  would  be  misleading  the  House.    I  think  the 

answer would be that although a doctor is not readily available at this point in time, 

we  would  need  to  reassess,  re-evaluate  and  review  all  those  needs  pertaining  to  the 

welfare of our people in the Outer Islands.  I do hope, Mr Chairman, that at the end of 

my presentation, Members of Parliament from the Outer Islands will agree for us to sit 

down,  put  our  thinking  caps  on  for  in-depth  consultation.    Having  done  those 

consultations,  Mr  Chairman,  we  would  all  reach  common  grounds  whereby  some 

</span><span>policies and guidelines would be developed and to point us in the right direction. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Chairman, the questions that were raised by the Honourable Member, Dr Robati 

are real issues.  Issues that are very important to the welfare of our people in the Outer 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>252 

</span></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>Islands.    Issues  that  we  need  to  really  sit  down  and  address  them  as  quickly  as 

possible.    Similarly,  we  are  having  a  number  of  problems  which  have  not  yet  been 

brought to the House from other islands. 

</span></div><div><span>MR CHAIRMAN:</span><span> Please carry on Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  You know, with the indulgence of the Chair, I would like to 

read two letters which I have forwarded to the Outer Islands last Friday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> September 

1999.  Now the first letter that I will read out, Mr Chairman is addressed to the Mayor 

of Aitutaki.  I shall now read the letter, Mr Chairman. 

</span></div><div><span>“Mr Tai Hermann, Mayor, Aitutaki.</span></div><div><span>Subject:  Honourable Teina Bishop, Assistant Minister of Outer Islands Development 

</span></div><div><span>I wish to formally advise you that the Honourable Teina Bishop have been confirmed 

by Cabinet to be the Assistant Minister of Outer Islands Development.  In his capacity 

as  such  he  has  full  authority  to  act  on  my  behalf  to  resolve  issues  that  would  have 

</span><span>otherwise require my attention. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, Mr Chairman, with the interjection coming from the Opposition side . . . 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>That’s news to us, Assistant Minister posts.</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  TAPAITAU:</span><span>    I  would  like  to  advise  the  House  that  this  Assistant 

</span><span>Minister’s role is</span><span> to assist the Minister of Outer Islands Development. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>It’s not in the spirit of political reform.</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  Without any remuneration whatsoever. 

</span></div><div><span>DR R. WOONTON:</span><span>  $30,000 Ministerial Support. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. TAPAITAU:</span><span>  All he gets is his Parliamentary salary.  Like other Members 

on the Opposition side.  I will continue, Mr Chairman, with the letter. 

</span></div><div><span>“I  seek  your  co</span><span>-operation  in  advising  your  Council  of  this  and  ask  that  any  matters 

you wish to raise can be directed through the Assistant Minister.  Furthermore, I have 

requested the Assistant Minister to discuss with the Council, as well as the Ministry of 

Outer  Islands  Development  staff  members  to  find  ways  to  address  and  resolve 

complaints which my Office has received regarding the Council</span><span>’s management of the 

Ministry’s equipment and plant.</span></div><div><span>I  trust  that  the  Council  along  with  the  Assistant  Minister  will  find  an  amicable 

solution to the problem that will be beneficial to Government and the community as a 

</span><span>whole.”</span></div><div><span>The  second  letter,  Mr  Chairman,  is  forwarded  to  the  Secretary  of  Outer  Islands 

Development,  all  the  Mayors  and  Executive  Officers  in  the  Outer  Islands.    This 

Memorandum is, to advise that the process of Devolution in all the Outer Islands will 

</span></div><div><a>Page 5</a></div><div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> September 1999 

</span></div><div><span>253 

</span></div><div><span>come  to  a  halt  forthwith.  With  Cabinet  approval,  I  have  appointed  a  Task  Force 

comprising  of  the  following  people:  Mr  Tai  Herman,  Mayor  of  Aitutaki;  Mr  Roger 

Malcolm, Mayor of Atiu; Taukea Raui, Chief Executive Officer for Mauke; Orthaniel 

Tangianau, Chief Executive Officer of Mangaia and Anna Katoa representative from 

the  Island  of  Manihiki.    They  are  supported  by  Mrs  Vaine  Wichman  who  acts  as 

Coordinator  of  the  Task  Force  and  Professor  Ron  Crocombe  who  is  the  Technical 

Adviser to the Task Force and who will also be responsible for the final compilation 

of the Report from the Task Force. 

</span></div><div><span>The Task Force, Mr Chairman, is commissioned to evaluate and review the needs of 

the Outer Islands.  A period of up to six weeks has been anticipated for the completion 

of this task and that a draft report is to be submitted to the Mayoral Forum scheduled 

to  take place on 18</span><span>th</span><span> October 1999 in  Tongareva.  When the Report is  tabled at  the 

next  Mayoral  Forum  in  Tongareva,  the  Mayors  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to 

discuss the contents of the Report in full. No doubt we will all reach an agreement to 

finalise the paper which will eventually provide some policies and guidelines for the 

Devolution Process to proceed further.  At that meeting, I am requesting input from 

Government  Representatives  and  Members  of  Parliament  from  the  Outer  Islands.  

</span><span>Until  these  steps  are  carried  out,  all  Government  assets  and  machinery  will  remain 

</span><span>under the management and control of the Ministry of Outer Islands Development.   

</span></div><div><span>Now, as you can see, Mr Chairman and Honourable Members of the House, from the 

two  letters,  which  I  have  just  read  out,  there  are  problems  to  be  addressed.    Today, 

there are four or five Chief Executive Officers who are assigned for the Outer Islands.  

I am sure some of you will have seen them around in Rarotonga for quite some time 

now.  The question is if they have been assigned, or taken into the Ministry as Chief 

Executive Officers for those Outer Islands, why are they here in Rarotonga?
