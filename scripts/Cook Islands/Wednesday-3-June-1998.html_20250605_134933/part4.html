<div><span>PAPERS FOR CONSIDERATION</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Parliament  Paper  No.  4  -  Te  Aponga  Uira  o  Tumu-te-varovaro 

Electricity Authority Annual Report for the period July 1994 to June 1995. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. I. AKARURU:</span><span>  Mr Speaker, to all Honourable Members, Greetings to you all 

this afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I am pleased to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament Paper No. 4 - Te Aponga Uira o Tumu-te-varovaro Electricity 

Authority Annual Report for the period July 1994 to June 1995, be received by 

this House 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I presented this Report to this House on 28th August last year.  I am sure 

this has been ample time for all Honourable Members to become aware of the good 

work  performed  by  the  Board  of  the  Aponga  Uira  o  Tumu-te-varovaro  and  its 

employees,  and  we  have  experienced  fewer  interruptions  in  our  power  supply  on 

Rarotonga.  In this Report, Mr Speaker, we can see that the number of employees and 

Board  Members  are  listed,  as  is  the  amount  of  the  power  units  consumed,  as  is 

revenue  earned  and  expended  through  the  activities  of  the  Aponga  Uira  o  Tumu-te-

varovaro.  We  will  also  see  in  this  report,  that  there  was  training    of  some  of  the 

employees  of the Authority, who went to the University of the South Pacific in Fiji.  

They have come back and are utilising the skills gained from their study. 

</span></div><div><span>The employees of Te Aponga Uira, during the period covered by this Report, worked 

well to repair the machinery and generators in the Outer Islands.  There was sufficient 

staff, tools and funding to carry out repairs, they had one of the best workshops.  We 

should be proud, Mr Speaker, of the good results achieved by Te Aponga Uira.  This 

is  confirmed  by  the  figures  in  this  Report.    Compare the units consumed per month 

with the amount of revenue earned, and the uninterrupted power supply, and the profit 

made,  it  is  obvious  they  are  achieving  the  goal  they  have  set  for  themselves.    This 

shows  a  high  level  of  performance  and  achievement  by  Te  Aponga,  there  are  fewer 

power cuts now than we had in the past.  Good work indeed.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 3</a></div><div><span>472 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>This  shows,  Mr  Speaker,  and  all  Honourable Members, that these people who work 

here  are  hard-working,  resourceful  and  energetic.    Sometimes,  Mr  Speaker,  when 

there is a problem after-hours, Te Aponga Uira workers may be called out, but they do 

it without complaint.  Also, we have to appreciate the ability of these employees, Mr 

Speaker,  to  operate  and  service  these  large,  complicated  and  expensive  machines.  

These  machines  have  expensive  components  yet  they  have  managed  to  keep  within 

their budget to afford necessary repairs or replacement parts.  They know, Mr Speaker, 

that if they do not do their jobs properly, or if they waste their funds, they will not get 

assistance  from  Government.    The  Manager  of  the  Board  is  well  aware  that  if  they 

encounter a major problem, which requires funding, they will not get assistance from 

Government,  they  must  find  the  funds  themselves,  for  repairs,  or  the  purchase  of  a 

new generator.  

</span></div><div><span>I would like, Mr Speaker, to congratulate the Minister responsible for Te Aponga Uira 

at  the  time,  the  Honourable  Member,  Tom  Marsters,  the  Board,  and  the  General 

Manager,  Mike  Wilson,  for  their  excellent  efforts.    And  to  everybody  else  at  the 

Authority, the meter readers, those who delivered the bills, and processed payments, I 

would like to thank them all for their combined efforts, they have all worked very well  

indeed.    Apart  from  some  minor  problems  during  the  period,  overall  they  have 

produced  some  excellent  work.    We  have  enjoyed  the  result  of  this  excellent  work, 

through the continued supply of electricity in our homes and workplaces.  There are 

fewer complaints from consumers because of their excellent work and the availability 

of electricity.  

</span></div><div><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker, I wonâ€™t say anymore because it is all in here, what has been 

</span><span>achieved and what is planned for the future, it is all in this Report.  May I thank you, 

Mr Speaker, all Honourable Members and our people listening in.  I now move again, 

Mr Speaker: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Te Aponga Uira o Tumu-te-varovaro Annual Report for the period of 

July 1994-June 1995, be received 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Can  I  have  a 

Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Are there any speakers? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr T. Hewett 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No. 4 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Paper received 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 6 - The Public Expenditure Review Committee and Audit (Remuneration of 

Other Committee Members) Order 1997, Serial No. 1997/16. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 4</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>473 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  7  -  The  Electoral  (Appointment  of  Chief  Electoral  Officer)  Order  1997, 

Serial No. 1997/17. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister of Justice and Lands, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  T.  MATAPO:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  before  I  move  that  the  Paper  be  received,  I  ask 

Leave of the House for Paper No. 7 and Paper No. 8 to be dealt with at the same time.  

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>May I ask the Leave of the House if the two Papers, No. 7 and No. 

8  can  be  dealt  with  at  the  same  time.    Thank  you,  Honourable  Members.    The  

Honourable Minister, Tiki Matapo. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. MATAPO:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Parliament Paper No. 7 and 8 relating to Electoral Appointments of Chief 

Electoral Officer and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer, be received 

</span></div><div><span>Firstly,  Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  also  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the 

House.    Greetings  also  to  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the  Honourable  Dr  Terepai 

Maoate, and also the Honourable Member, Norman George, the Prime Minister, and 

Deputy Prime Minister and to our people listening in today. 

</span></div><div><span>Before I go further, Mr Speaker, I would like to take the time to congratulate you for 

the award that was awarded to you on Queen's Birthday and the great honour that has 

been bestowed upon you by this award.  And also not forgetting Iaveta Short, who has 

received an award also. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, the Paper before the House this afternoon is to do with the Appointment 

of  Chief  Electoral  Officer,  that  is  Mr  Stephen  Wearing.    In  fact,  prior  to  this 

appointment we had Mr Tere Mataio who was the Chief Electoral Officer.  He did a 

great job during his time as a Chief Electoral Officer in the Cook Islands.  In fact, Mr 

Wearing had worked under the leadership of Mr Mataio, as an Assistant to the Chief 

Electoral  Officer.    Mr  Wearing  has  quite  a  wide  experience  in  the  responsibility 

carried out by the Electoral Office.  He has proven to be very capable during the last 

by-elections, in Mangaia, Ivirua, and in Nikao. 

</span></div><div><span>Likewise, in Paper No. 8, we have the appointment of Deputy Chief Electoral Officer,  

</span><span>also  a  capable  person,  in  the  likes  of  Mrs  Ngatuaine  Maoate.    She  has  also  worked 

very  closely  with  Mr  Wearing  during  the  last  two  by-elections.    No  doubt  she  has 

gained a lot of experience in the control and running of the by-elections of Ivirua and 

Nikao.  Despite the fact, Mr Speaker, that they are holding these positions, they have 

attended  overseas  training  courses,  workshops,  which  have  no  doubt  furthered  their 

own experience in the running of elections in the Cook Islands.  I wish to commend 

their ability, their capability in  being able to carry out the duties to which they have 

been  appointed,  and  to  wish  them  to  continue  their  good  performance  in  their 

</span><span>respective positions as Chief Electoral Officer and Deputy Chief Electoral Officer in 

</span><span>the Cook Islands.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister.  Can I have a Seconder, please?

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr T. Hewett</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Papers No. 7 and No. 8, be received 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Norman George. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  N.  GEORGE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Good  afternoon  to  you  and  to  all 

Honourable Members of this House and also to all our people listening in, Greetings.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, may I seek your indulgence to send a short, private message to the Island 

of Atiu.  Kia Orana to all the people of Enua Manu this afternoon, I am sending the 

best wishes of the Honourable Member, Upoko Simpson, and myself, to you all.  To 

all of the Ui Ariki, Ui Mataiapo, the Ui Rangatira and to all the people on the island of 

Atiu, Greetings.  

</span></div><div><span>We would like to  give encouragement to  the people on the island of Atiu who have 

had  some  big  projects  being  undertaken  over  the  past  few  days.  To  the  mamas 

</span><span>preparing  food and the papas working on the construction of the Pastorâ€™s house, we 

give  you  our  strongest  encouragement,  so  the  work  goes  well  and  the  Pastorâ€™s 

</span><span>residence is completed.  

</span></div><div><span>We also offer some words of condolences to those of us who have had bereavements 

over the past few days, this is the first opportunity I have had to stand in this House to 

speak  to  you.    I  send  my  condolences  to  the  Tiki  Teamoke  family,  the  Ngamaru 

family, the family of Mama Ana who passed away in Tahiti.  And this past week the 

tragic  news  arrived  of  the  passing  away  of  our  daughter,  my  sister,  Kini  Vainepoto, 

who passed away in Melbourne.  We send our sincerest condolences to the Ngamaru 

family and the Vainepoto family.  May God bless you all.  I would also like to send 

my condolences to the Uri family in Arorangi, for their bereavement, the loss of a son 

through an activity that occurred last weekend.  

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I also extend our congratulations to you upon receiving a special Queenâ€™s 

</span><span>Birthday award a couple  of days ago, and also to Iaveta Short.  On our behalf, on our 

</span><span>side of the House, we congratulate you and Mr Short. 

</span></div><div><span>Last but not least, and most important of all to me, I extend a very special Greeting to 

all the candidates, executives and supporters of the New Alliance Party throughout the 

whole  country.    Kia Orana to  all the supporters of the New Alliance Party, to  all of 

you which number in your thousands and thousands, Kia Orana. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, in looking at these two Papers before the House, Papers No. 7 and No. 8,  

although they relate to  the same thing, the Minister has made a unusual request that 

we  bite  two  apples  at  one  go.    But  it  is  common  sense  that  the  Paper  No.  7  which 

deals with the Chief Electoral Officer, and the Paper No. 8 dealing with his Deputy, it 

is  common  sense  that  both  subjects  be  discussed  together.    Mr  Speaker,  these  are 

excellent  appointments.  Mr Stephen Wearing is an outstanding young Cook Islander, 

</span></div><div><a>Page 6</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>475 

</span></div><div><span>he deserves his office and I congratulate him on this appointment and also his Deputy,  

Ngatuaine  Luka  Maoate.    She's  an  excellent  choice.    These  two  people  have 

tremendous respect and integrity between the two of them and I congratulate these two 

appointments.  I hope under their leadership, they will give the three political parties 

an opportunity to meet with them before the General Elections, to lay the guidelines.  I 

recall one appalling incident in the 1994 General Elections, when the enrollment was 

closed in New Zealand, the candidate for the Cook Islands Party, the Honourable Dr 

Joe Williams somehow managed to persuade the Chief Electoral Officer to extend the 

enrollment date.  That decision to extend enrollments by an extra week benefited only 

one  person  and  that  was  Dr  Joe  Williams  himself,  who  was  standing  for  the  Cook 

Islands  Party,  and  for  the  Government  of  the  day.    The  other  two  parties,  the 

Democratic Party and the Alliance Party, followed the rules to the letter, knowing that 

in all the years of General Elections, no Electoral Officer had ever extended the dates 

for  enrollment.    By  following  the  rules,  they  missed  out  on  this  advantage,  and  we 

reckon that this is what was responsible for allowing Dr Joe Williams the advantage, 

he gained more supporters on the roll and was successful at the General Elections. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would hope that Mr Stephen Wearing and his  Deputy, Ngatuaine Maoate, will not 

allow this kind  of nonsense to  happen again.   Certainly, if I was not under so much 

pressure  at  the  time,  it  would  have  been  the  subject  of  a  court  action.    So,  I  would 

hope  that  with  these  two  young  people  running  the  show,  and  as  they  have  already  

demonstrated, I look forward to a very clean General Election, the one we are facing 

in front of us.  I know that it will be done properly, ethically and in accordance with 

the law.   

</span></div><div><span>There is  one thing that has been bugging me, Mr Speaker, and this is reflected after 

each  Local  Government  Election.    Recently,  we  had  the  Outer  Islands  local 

Government  election  where  the  Mayors  and  Island  Councillors  were  elected.    I 

understand  that  the  Ministry  </span><span>of Outer Island Affairs conducted these elections.  Iâ€™ve 

</span><span>always  maintained  that  all  elections,  whether  they  are  national  or  local  Government 

elections, should be conducted by the Electoral Office.  There is an element of Mickey 

Mouse in these elections.  In the past, it used to be the Department of Internal Affairs 

that  ran  it,  then  it  changed  to  the  Prime  Minister's  Department.    The  last  time,  I 

understand, the Ministry of Outer Island Affairs conducted them.  Three departments 

in  the  last  ten  years.    Mr  Speaker,  this  is  unsatisfactory.    When  you  look  at  the 

situation in  Pukapuka, where there is a complaint about the conduct of the elections 

there  and  the  country  has  had  to  fork  out,  I  believe,  about  $14,000  to  send  an 

investigation team out there to look into it.  This is because it is a specialised job and 

it  should  be  given  to  the  office  whose  full-time  specialised function it is  to  conduct 

elections.    It  should  be  done  by  the  Electoral  Office.  I would like to  ask the acting 

Minister of MOID to explain to us why it is necessary to spend $14,000 to investigate 

this  complaint  from  Pukapuka?    I  am  also  advised that a lot of beer and lambchops 

were used by the truckload in Aitutaki during the recent local Government elections.  

Can you believe it, Mr Speaker, a beer and chops local Government election? 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I'd better stop here before all the heavy evidence comes out, but I do ask 

</span><span>that  the  Government  consider  transferring  the  responsibility  for  Local  Government 

Elections to the Electoral Office.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 7</a></div><div><span>476 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Can  I  have  the  next  speaker, 

please? 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia  Orana  to  you  and  to 

Honourable Members, as well as our people who are listening in. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, through you I would like to send some Greetings.  Firstly, I would like to 

send special Greetings to the Ariki of Mangaia, the Kavana, the Aronga Mana and all 

the people on the Island of Mangaia.  To the pastors of all the different denominations 

on  the  island,  especially  to  the  C.I.C.C.  Kia  Orana  to  you,  I  believe  we  enjoyed 

ourselves  during  the  celebrations  on  Pentecost  Sunday.    To  the  staff  of  the  Health 

Department under the direction of MOID, and especially to all the staff who assisted 

me while I was there, to help the people of Mangaia, Kia Orana and thank you to you 

all.    To  the  very  strong  supporters  of  the  Democratic  Alliance  Party  in  the  three 

constituencies of Mangaia, Kia Orana to you all.  Kia Orana also to the Members of 

Parliament  of  Mangaia,  the  Honourable  Jim  Marurai,  the Honourable Mariri  Parima 

and the Honourable Minister Papamama Pokino.  You did not look at me as a political 

threat but as a person, there to help our people of the island of Mangaia.  If Parliament 

does not have much to do during the next couple of weeks, Mr Speaker, then I will be 

able to return quickly to work in Mangaia over the next couple of weeks.  I feel sorry 

for  our  people  on  Mangaia  because  they  do  not  have  a  doctor  on  the  island.    Their 

doctor has gone on holiday and no replacement has  been found as yet.  So, I gave my 

time, because they asked me, to help the people of Mangaia.  I would like to thank the 

people  of  Mangaia,  Mr  Speaker,  because  they  are  very  grateful  to  me  for  helping 

them.   

</span></div><div><span>Also, I would like to send my condolences to the grieving families who have lost their 

loved ones over these past few weeks.  A lot of our people are passing away.  This is 

one of the reasons I decided to help our people, Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Also,  I  would  like  to  send  special  Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  for  the  award 

bestowed  upon  you,  which  you  deserve  very  much.    And  to  a  relation  of  mine,  Mr 

Iaveta Short, who also had an award bestowed upon him, you both deserve the awards 

bestowed upon you by the Queen.  I wish to apologise to you both for being unable to 

</span><span>attend your special day as I was in Mangaia helping our people. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to give my strongest support to these two people who have 

been selected to carry these high offices.  That is, to Mr Wearing and to Ms Maoate.  I 

believe they are both capable and have the benefit of their experience to carry out the 

duties of these offices.  I would like to ask them to move quickly to formally appoint 

the Mayors and Island Councillors, who were recently elected in the local Government 

elections  in  the  Outer  Islands.    I  would  also  ask  that  the  Prime  Minister  and  the 

Deputy  Prime  Minister, Inatio Akaruru, do not  interfere with  the elections that have 

</span><span>been  held.    They  have  been  carried  out.    I  also  understand,  Mr  Speaker,  that  the 

</span><span>Deputy Prime Minister was worried because of the drastic changes in the results of the 

elections of the Mayor and the Island Councillors on the island of Pukapuka.  He was 

so  worried,  he  thinks  something  untoward  took  place in  the elections.  It  is  sad, Mr 

</span></div><div><a>Page 8</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>477 

</span></div><div><span>Speaker, because when I talked about the shortage of food on the island of Pukapuka, 

no plane was chartered to take milk for the babies on that island.  Although there were 

</span><span>numerous  â€˜phone  calls  made  to  me  personally,</span><span>  to  tell  me  they  were  short  of  food,  I 

still  did  not  see  any  relief  supplies  being sent  to  the island.  I am  pretty certain,  Mr 

Speaker,  that  if  the  Government  of  today  was  a  Democratic-Alliance  Government, 

then I am  certain  that if these sorts of calls came to  us, we would cry first and then 

send relief supplies.  We all know, Honourable Members, that there is a song about 

the  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Pupuke  Robati,  where  he  sends  planes,  and  food  falls 

from these planes, and this is the sort of thing our Government would do.  This song is 

still  being  sung  today,  Mr  Speaker,  and  as  you  listen  to  the  lyrics  of  the  song,  it  is 

talking  about  the  Minister  Pupuke  Robati  and  all  this  food  falling  from  planes.  

Therefore, I would like to  ask these two people who have been appointed, to please 

hurry up and appoint those people in Outer Islands Local Government because I hear 

</span><span>that there are bad things going on in the Mayorâ€™s Office on the island of Pukapuka.  I 

</span><span>also know that the Mayor Elect on the island of Mangaia wants to be appointed to get 

on  with  the  work  because  this  man  is  a  worker,  so  I  would  like  again  to  encourage 

these two people who have been appointed, to hurry up and appoint all these Mayors 

in the Outer Islands so they can get on with their work, and not waste any time on this 

investigation on the island of Pukapuka. 

</span></div><div><span>I would like to strongly urge the appointment of these two capable people but I hope 

that  they  will  not  be  intimidated  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    This  is  what  I  am 

afraid  of.    He  might  want  to  send  some  other  investigative  team  to  the  island  of 

Pukapuka  but  I  would  like  to  ask  him  to  leave  it  alone  and  to  ask  the  Minister  of 

Justice  to  please  get  these  people  appointed.    I  know  these  people  who  held  their 

elections  on  their  respective  islands  had  no  political  element  in  these  elections,  so  

please, I would like to ask us to leave them alone. 

</span></div><div><span>Therefore, I would like to congratulate these people appointed to the office of Chief 

Electoral Officer and Deputy Electoral Officer.  Thank you, Mr Speaker. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Inatio Akaruru. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  I.  AKARURU:</span><span>    Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  also  Greetings  to  all 

Honourable  Members  and  to  the  general  public  who  are  listening  to  our  debate  this 

</span><span>afternoon. 

</span></div><div><span>I  rise  to  give  my  support,  Mr  Speaker,  to  the  appointment  of  the  Chief  Electoral 

Officer and his  Deputy.  I would also  like to  congratulate the Honourable Leader of 

the Opposition for his campaign trip to Mangaia, that was very clever.  He thinks the 

</span><span>people donâ€™t know the reason for his trip to Mangaia.  Donâ€™t hide behind the position 

</span><span>of a doctor.  Do not hide behind the position of a doctor.  Tell the truth, the real reason 

</span><span>for his visit was to campaign for the Opposition.  Itâ€™s a wonder Government is being 

</span><span>blamed for this but people of Mangaia, you are people of intelligence, you are bright 

</span><span>enough to know that if you meet the Leader of the Opposition in his sheepâ€™s clothing 

</span><span>you  will  know  he  is  not  a sheep but  a wolf.   </span><span>Donâ€™t  be fooled by it.  Thereâ€™s a wolf 

</span><span>underneath.    This  is  encouragement  for  the  people  of  Mangaia.    If  someone  comes 

over in soft, woolly sheepskin, beware- it is a wolf underneath who wants to eat you.   

</span></div><div><a>Page 9</a></div><div><span>478 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  like  to  enlighten  the  Honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  about  MOIDâ€™s 

</span><span>investigation of local Government Elections on Pukapuka- that has nothing to do with 

me.    I  think  the  situation  was  properly  explained  by  the    Secretary  of  MOID  in  the 

newspaper yet the Leader of the Opposition still tries  to put the blame on me.  I am 

not  responsible  for  running  the  elections,  there  are  people  who  are  specifically 

appointed by law for this purpose.  The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting that if 

the people notice something wrong with the elections, that they do not speak out.  He 

</span><span>doesnâ€™t want them to exercise their right to speak up.  Elections are not a new thing, if 

</span><span>they see something is  not  right  before the election, or during it, they have a right to 

point  that  out.    We  are  not  allowed  to  interfere,  or  bribe  people  as  to  whom  they 

should vote for. 

</span></div><div><span>After the elections, the former Mayor rang me and told me that he accepts the will of 

the people.  It must be respected.  I would like to remind the Honourable Leader of the 

Opposition to stop childish politics, you are playing childish games.  You are flinging 

mud  at  people  so  that  when  they  walk  by  there  are  mud  stains  on  them    The 

Honourable Member also went on to say that I should charter a plane to take milk to 

</span><span>Pukapuka, so  I told him, why donâ€™t you put</span><span> your money where your mouth is?  We 

</span><span>didnâ€™t  receive  any  complaints  or  requests.    Government  didnâ€™t  receive  any  requests 

</span><span>from the Mayor or the Island Council.  Why should I commit Government to any costs 

when Government  has not  been asked for help?  If, however, people have put some 

</span><span>requests to  the Leader of the Opposition,  why doesnâ€™t he charter a plane, fill it with 

</span><span>milk  and  send  it  to  help  these people?  Do not  blame me or the Government,  as no 

such request came to us.  Do not accuse the Government of inaction for not chartering 

a plane or boat, why keep asking why the boat has not gone to the Northern Group in 

March,  April  or  May?    It  is  the  result  of  the  politics  of  ship-owners.    This  is  not 

</span><span>Governmentâ€™s doing, yet Government and the Member for Pukapuka is being blamed 

</span><span>for not sending the boat to Pukapuka.  We have heard it in the news, Mr Speaker, yet 

the  ship-</span><span>owners  arenâ€™t  being  questioned  as  to  why  the  boat  isnâ€™t  going?    Not  one 

</span><span>question  to  the  ship-owners.  The Member for Pukapuka does not  own a boat.  The 

ship-owners  have  a  licence  on  the  basis  that  they  service  all  the  islands,  this  is  a 

requirement of their licence.  Yes, I have been watching that very closely, Mr Speaker.  

We  are  moving  towards  the  time  of  Elections  and  I  would  like  to  remind  the  ship's 

owner  to  not  use  his  boat  for  political  purposes  as  his  license is  issued on the basis 

that he services our people fairly.  He should run his business honestly and fairly so 

his business will prosper.  Our wish is that he is successful as the work he does could 

help the lives of the people of our nation.   

</span></div><div><span>I will end here with  a reminder to  the Leader of the Opposition  - stop your childish 

politicking over something important to our country or our people will be considering 

whether  you  are  suitable  to  stand  again  as  a  Member,  let  alone  as  the  Leader.    You 

may be losing your position as Leader in the next DAP meeting and I think Dr Robert 

Woonton  is  suitable  for  the  post.    That  is  all  I  have  to  say,  Mr  Speaker.    I  strongly 

support the two Papers before the House, Papers No. 7 and 8, the appointments of the 

</span><span>Chief and Deputy Electoral Officers. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Deputy  Prime  Minister.    Are  there  any  further 

speakers?  The question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 10</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>479 

</span></div><div><span>That Papers No. 7 and 8 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Papers received</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  9  -  The  Importation  of  Motor  Vehicles  (South  Pacific  Forum) 

Commencement Order 1997, Serial No. 1997/19 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  11  -  The  Shipping  (Te  Kou  Maru)  Amendment  Rules  1997,  Serial  No. 

1997/20 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. T. FAIREKA:  </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I seek Leave to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That both Papers, No. 11 and 12, be received together 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    May  I  ask  for  Leave  of  the 

House that the two Papers be joined together.  Those in favour say aye.  Against?  The 

ayes have it.  The Honourable Minister, Tupou Faireka. 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed</span></div><div><span>HON T. FAIREKA:   </span><span>Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Just before I briefly speak on these 

two Papers I would like to give Greetings to my people.  And before I do so, let me 

move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Papers No. 11 and 12 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Greetings  to  you,  Mr  Speaker,  and  to  all  Honourable  Members  in  the  House  this 

afternoon.  Greetings also to our people listening in to the debate on Rarotonga and to 

all  those  in  the  Outer  Islands.    And  a  special  Greeting  to  my  own  people  in  my 

electorate of Tupapa-Maraerenga.  Greetings also to the Aronga Mana, to the leaders 

of  the  church,  to  members  of  Government,  to  the  elderly  people,  and  to  all  the 

children, Greetings to you all.  Greetings to the young people of the village who have 

won three trophies during this rugby season. 

</span></div><div><span>I  would  also  like  to  give you all the best  wishes of Papa Dan and Mama Poko who 

asked, before I returned, that I relay their love to all the people of the Cook Islands, as 

well as the people of Tupapa-Maraerenga.  Greetings to you all on their behalf.  Mama 

Poko  is  well  at  the  moment  and  the  results  of  her  latest  medical  checkup  will  be 

available to her by the end of this week and the seriousness of her illness will then be 

known.  I also extend to you all, the best regards of Dr Joseph Williams, who along 

with myself, attended the WHO conference in Geneva.   

</span></div><div><span>Back to the two Papers before the House, Mr Speaker.  I rise to raise a point on Paper 

</span><span>No. 11 regarding the storage of hazardous cargo on Te Kou Maru, such as benzene, 

kerosene and LPG gas, when it is in operation.  LPG is highly flammable and could 

set  off  the  others.    The  recommendation  is  that  these  fuels  should  not  be  stored  in 

</span></div><div><a>Page 11</a></div><div><span>480 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>confined spaces because heat will build up and cause an explosion.  This is the main 

aim of this amendment. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.  12  is  about  the  transportation  of  these  fuels  on  the  Maunga  Roa.    If  the 

fuels,  mentioned  earlier,  are  carried  aboard  the  boat,  whether  it  is  above  or  below 

deck, then the passengers are not to be carried on deck.  We all know that these fuels 

are highly flammable, a leakage or naked flame could set off an explosion which will 

endanger the lives of the passengers aboard the ship and result in tragic consequences 

for us all.  These are my simple explanations of the two amendments regarding these 

two ships, Mr Speaker, which have been put before us by Papers No. 11 and No.12.  I 

am asking the support of the House. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Can I have a Seconder, please? 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr U. Matata. 

</span></div><div><span>That the Papers be received 

</span></div><div><span>Papers Received 

</span></div><div><span>Paper  No.13.  -  The  Penrhyn  Pearl  and  Pearl  Shells  (Amendment)  By-Laws  1997, 

Serial No. 1997/22. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No.14.  The Honourable Minister of Agriculture, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  Kia Orana to you this afternoon.  If I 

may be allowed, before I move a Motion regarding Paper No.14, to make an apology 

to Members of the House that after the disposal of all the Papers before us, I intend to 

adjourn  Parliament  until  July  the  1st.    I  apologise  to  all  Members  of  the  House and 

thank Members of Parliament for making themselves available to come to the Sitting 

today.    The  reason  being,  we  are  trying  to  get  Bills  ready  for  this  Session  of 

Parliament and we could not manage to do so by today's date.  Therefore, I am seeking 

the Leave of the House, it will also give the opportunity for Members of Parliament, 

in particular Members from the Outer Islands, as well as Members from Rarotonga, to 

</span><span>make allowances for travel back to their respective islands this weekend. 

</span></div><div><span>So with those few words, Mr Speaker, I would like to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No.14 be deferred at this time 

</span></div><div><span>The  reason  for  this  is  the  Report  itself  is  not  quite  ready  yet  to  be  debated  in  the 

House.  I would like to see all Members of the House have all Reports dealt with at a 

later date.  Likewise, while I am on my feet, Mr Speaker, I would also like to move: 

</span></div><div><span>That Paper No.19 also be deferred 

</span></div><div><a>Page 12</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>481 

</span></div><div><span>For the same reason, to allow everybody in the House to get the Reports properly on 

these two Papers - No.14, the PERCA Report on the Sale of the Rarotongan Hotel, as 

well as Paper No.19, the PERCA Report and Audit on the Office of the Ombudsman.  

I am  seeking the support of the House by deferring it until a later date and I  moved 

accordingly, Mr Speaker.  Thank you very much. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>Can I have a Seconder please? 

</span></div><div><span>Seconded Mr N. George 

</span></div><div><span>The Question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That Consideration of Parliament Papers No. 14 and 19 be postponed to a date 

no sooner than the 1st of July 1998. 

</span></div><div><span>The  Honourable  Member,  Dr  Terepai  Maoate,  Leader  of  the  Democratic  Alliance 

Party. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    Kia Orana to  you.  I rise with 

some brief thoughts on the Motion regarding these two Papers. 

</span></div><div><span>I  had  a  brief  discussion  with  the  Minister  in  charge  of  Parliament,  the  Honourable 

Vaine  Tairea,  with  regard  this  move.    I  quite  agree  with  the  idea  because  I  see  an 

opportunity for us to be briefed a little bit more with the details of the Reports, for us 

to be able to come up with some very constructive comments on the two Papers. 

</span></div><div><span>I  look  forward  to  the  Minister  being  able  to  present  the  areas  that  are  cloudy  to  us 

especially the answers to what the Report is referring to because the PERCA Report 

touched  on  some  very  sensitive  areas and it is  probably going to  be difficult  for the 

Minister  alone  to  give  details  on  these  areas.    I  look  forward  to  the  debate on these 

two Papers as I see they are very important Papers to be debated.  I support the move 

and  suggest  that Parliament could  now be shortened at  this stage in  order to  respect 

the Democratic Alliance Party Conference starting tonight. 

</span></div><div><span>I am extending, to you, Mr Speaker, and all Honourable Members, an invitation to the 

</span><span>opening.    There  will  be  plenty  of  food  at  6.30pm.    You  can  go  home  after  that  and 

leave the issues of importance of the country to the members and delegates.  Through 

you, Mr Speaker, I would like to welcome all those delegates from the Outer Islands.  

Every  island  is  represented,  every  Constituency  is  represented, through you some of 

them are already arrived last week and some of them are arriving this afternoon.  So 

we are very excited by the whole activity.  On behalf of the executive I would like to 

welcome them all to the conference starting tonight.  To those who have been invited 

to  be with  us  I hope you will enjoy the opening and the kaikai at  6.30pm.   You are 

</span><span>most welcome and we look forward to that. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 13</a></div><div><span>482 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>In conclusion, Mr Speaker, I certainly abide by and support the request of the Minister 

to  see this opportunity for us in  the hope to  be able to  understand some of the hazy 

areas we are seeing in this Report. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  conclude,  Mr  Speaker,  I  see  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Tupapa 

congratulating  the  League  players  in  his  village.    Certainly,  but,  these  are  the  lower 

grades,  Mr  Speaker.    You  want  to  talk  about  the  Premier  grade  of  the  Ngatangiia-

Matavera  rugby  team  which  has  taken  the  flag.    They,  throughout  the  whole  of  this 

year's  rugby  season,  were  able  to  maintain  their  high  standard  of  performance  and 

achieve their goal.  Congratulations goes out to all Clubs who were able to keep their 

high  standards  of  performance  and  in  particular  the  Titikaveka  team  who  has  really 

come  up  to  be  second  strongest.    I  understand  that  the  executive  of  the  Ngatangiia-

Matavera  Rugby  League  Club  is  announcing  a  wind  up  dinner  at  the  Ngatangiia 

Clubhouse on Saturday and we all look forward to that occasion. 

</span></div><div><span>I  support  the  Motion,  Mr  Speaker,  and  I  look  forward  to  the  time  of  the  debate  on 

these particular two Papers.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Pupuke Robati. 

</span></div><div><span>DR  P.  ROBATI:</span><span>    Mr  Speaker,  Kia  Orana  to  you  this  afternoon  and  to  all  the 

Honourable Members of this House.  I will not talk for long.  I just rose to support this 

Motion  and  that  is  with  regard  to  Paper  No.14  -  The  Interim  Report  of  the  Public 

Expenditure Review Committee 1997 (A Review of the Sale of the Rarotongan Resort 

Hotel)  and  also  Paper  No.19  -  The  Report  of  the  Office  of  the  Public  Expenditure 

Review Committee and Audit of the Review of the Ombudsman. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  a  request  for  the  Minister.    I  would  like  to  request  that  when  we  debate  this 

Paper  that  the  Ombudsman  for  Vanuatu  could  be  asked  to  be  present.    Maybe  the 

Ombudsman would be able to shed some light on some areas of this Report.  We in 

the Pacific are aware of the Ombudsman of Vanuatu who has featured quite regularly 

in  the  media  over  the  last  couple  of  years.    We  would've  read  in  the  newspapers 

recently  that  the  Parliament  of  Vanuatu  has  accepted  a  Parliamentary  Code  and  I 

believe  this  was  greatly  influenced  by  their  Ombudsman.    That  is  with  regard  to  a 

Leadership Code for Parliament.  Therefore I would like to ask the Minister again if it 

</span><span>would  be  possible  to  contact  and  ask  the  Ombudsman  of  Vanuatu  to  be  present 

</span><span>because that particular Ombudsman might be able to give us an insight into how we 

might  be  able  to  do  better  things  for  our  country  with  regard  to  this  review  of  our 

Ombudsman.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:</span><span>  Thank you Honourable Member.  The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed
