</span></div><div><a>Page 14</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>483 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 15 - The Report of the Cook Islands Government Half-Year Economic and 

Fiscal Update F97/98, December 1997. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 18 - Gaming (Fee) Regulations 1998, Serial No. 1998/01. 

</span></div><div><span>Paper No. 20 - The Ministry of Education Annual Report for 1st July 1996-30th June 

1997. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minister for Education. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:</span><span>  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Ministry of Education Annual Report for the period 1 July 1996 - 30 

June 1997 be received 

</span></div><div><span>Before I speak on this Report, I would like to send my Greetings to my electorate in 

</span><span>Aitutaki.  I heard that you had an enjoyable Queen’s Birthday on Monday with all the 

</span><span>sporting events  that were staged on that particular day  - the fishing competition, the 

vaka  racing  competition  and  also  the  games  competition  that  was  held  at  Araura 

College by the village of Reureu. 

</span></div><div><span>Now, I would like to send out congratulations to all the successful Mayors and Island 

Councillors at the recent Outer Islands Local Government Elections.  In particular, the 

Island Council Elections on Aitutaki, to the successful candidate for the Mayor of the 

Island, Tai Herman, congratulations to you.  And the three successful Councillors for 

Arutanga, Mr William Hewett, for Reureu Mr Tunui Mati and for Nikaupara, I believe 

the candidate declared the winner on election night,  Mr Putangi  Mose, has now lost 

the  seat  to  Mr  John  Tearetoa  on  a  recount.    I believe that you have all accepted the 

results of these elections as an indication of the wish of the majority of the island and 

also  the  majority  of  the  people  of  each  village.    I  also  believe  that  the  Ministry  of 

Outer  Islands  Development  is  waiting  upon  the  resolving  of  the  Pukapuka  petition 

before declaring the final results for the Outer Islands Local Government Elections. 

</span></div><div><span>The  upcoming  three  years  will  be  a  very  important  period  in  the  history  of  our 

individual  islands  and  also  the  country  as  a  whole.    The  policy  of  Government 

declares that the Central Government considers the Local Governments of each Outer 

</span><span>Island  to  be  in  a  position  to  take  on  more  responsibilities  hence  determining  the 

</span><span>destiny  of  their  individual  islands.    I  am  very  confident  that  you  who  have  been 

elected to  the positions of Mayors and Councillors will rise to  the challenge.  I also 

would like to send out my Greetings to all the Central Government Representatives of 

each  Outer  Island.    You  have  a  very  important  task  to  perform  in  representing  the 

Central Government of each island.  Together with the Chief Executive Officers in the 

Outer  Islands,  my  prayer  is  that  you  will  all  paddle  together  in  making  progress  for 

your islands. 

</span></div><div><span>To you, Mr Speaker, Sir, congratulations on the award that was accorded to you on the 

Queen's  birthday.   And, to  the Honourable Iaveta Short and Ruta Short I extend my 

congratulations from my wife and family for your award of the most excellent Order 

of  the  British  Empire,  OBE.    With  other  Members  who  have  spoken  before  me,  I 

</span></div><div><a>Page 15</a></div><div><span>484 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>would like to extend to those families who are mourning the loss of their loved ones 

since we last met in this House, may the Spirit of God be close and comfort you all.  

Your loss is also our loss.   

</span></div><div><span>This  report  before  the  House,  Mr  Speaker,  is  just  as  important  as  the  Bills  that  are 

brought in here.  This is an opportunity for all the Members of this House to comment 

on the progress or non-progress of every Ministry of Government and every activity of 

Government  that  is  brought  into  this  House.    I  trust  that  every  Honourable  Member 

has  done  the  Ministry  of  Education  justice,  by  studying  diligently  the  activities  that 

have been undertaken by this Ministry for the period of 1st July 1996 to 30th June last 

year.  This is the period before the transferring of education in the Outer Islands on the 

1st July 1997 to this year, to the 30th June 1998, over to the Ministry of Outer Islands 

Development, MOID.   

</span></div><div><span>First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Secretary  of  Education,  Mr  Eric  Ponia.    The 

Deputy Secretary of Education, Mr Lionel Brown and your senior management team, 

the staff of the Ministry of Education and all the teachers, all the school committees, 

the  parents  and  pupils  of  the  schools  in  the  Cook  Islands.    I  am  very  proud  of  your 

achievements  for  the  period  being  reported  upon.    The  only  shortcoming  in  our 

operation  within  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  that  we  do  not  tell  the  world  or  the 

country enough of what we are doing in our schools, in our colleges, pre-schools and 

in  the Ministry itself.  During this  year, there was concentrated efforts on reviewing 

and  improving  the  curriculum  in  our  Primary  and  Secondary  schools.    And  in  our 

Secondary  schools,  there  has  been  active  participation  by  our  friends  from  the  New 

Zealand  Qualifications  Authority  and  consultants  who  were  sent  to  us  to  help  our 

principals,  staff  and  committees  to  prepare  themselves  for  the  NZQA  examinations.  

This Government made the decision three or four years ago that we were going to go 

with the NZQA examinations all the way.  In the 1950's, Mr Speaker, you're a former 

teacher so you'd know what happened during those years, our schools here, at Tereora 

College,  for  the  first  time  sat  the  New  Zealand  School  Certificate  Examinations.    I 

believe that the first NZSC graduate was Mr Tony Utanga.  As we were able to build 

up the Secondary level of education here in the Cook Islands we brought in the Sixth 

Form Certificate.  But then, for some unknown reason, the Government of the day, I 

forgot  the  year,  brought  in  a  system  of  examination  which  was  known  as  the  USP 

Foundation examinations.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Mr Speaker, I move: 

</span></div><div><span>That we grant the Minister of Education extra time to speak on this Report</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Can I have a Seconder please?   

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Hon. Dr T. Maoate 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:    </span><span>I  just  want  to  remind  the  Honourable  Member,  Mr 

</span><span>Speaker, let this be a lesson to him not to shorten my own speaking time. 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><a>Page 16</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>485 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>You may continue Honourable Minister. 

</span></div><div><span>HON N. PUNA:   </span><span>Mr Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues, particularly the 

Members of the Opposition for granting me this extension.  I appreciate it very much.  

Particularly the Leader of the Opposition, thank you for the courtesy extended to me.  

As I was saying, it was four years ago that Government made the decision to bring the 

seventh  form  examination  entirely  over  to  the  NZQA  examination,  that  being  the 

Bursary examinations.  That is why I said that Government decided to go with NZQA 

all the way.  Because it is the logical step to take.  And I want to say the record set by 

our  students  in  form  seven  at  Tereora  College,  we  can  all  be  proud  of  their  record.  

They have really performed magnificently.  For the last two years we have turned our 

attention  to  the  majority  of  our  children  who  were  leaving  our  colleges  without  any 

formal qualifications in technical areas.  And during this year under review that was 

the final spurt by the principals, and here I acknowledge the work done by the former 

principal  of  Mangaia  College,  the  Honourable  Jim  Marurai,  and  all  those  principals 

out there for your hard work, it has paid off.  At the beginning of this year we have 

had five of our colleges accredited, offering this credit system to our children.   

</span></div><div><span>I  cannot  sit  down  without  mentioning  the  magnificent  effort  of  our  Outer  Islands 

schools in  the National  Grade Six Examination.  And I talk about the Mitiaro grade 

six level  which provided the student who topped the national examination for 1997.  

And equal with Mitiaro Primary School was Avarua School and I want to congratulate 

the Avarua School for remaining at the top for the last three years.  For three of the 

last  four  years,  Avarua  School  has  provided  the  top  student  for  the  country.  

Congratulations  to  you  Avarua  School.    And  on  the  sports  field  I  would  like  to 

congratulate those schools who did well and I am referring to Avatea School who has 

been unbeaten in Athletics for so long.  So, Mr Speaker, our job as teachers is to look 

at  every  individual  pupil  and  determine  what  talents  that  pupil  has,  whether  it  be 

academic, singing, sports, and then to build on those talents of our children.  That is 

the way we are running the Ministry of Education's program in our schools. 

</span></div><div><span>Mr  Speaker,  there  are  so  many  other  people  that  I  should  mention  in  my short time 

</span><span>speaking to this Report by the Ministry of Education.  Let me mention one particular 

</span><span>program which is called </span><span>Te Ara Anga -</span><span> the awakening.  This is an excellent program 

by  the  Ministry  of  Education.    This  is  looked  upon  with  interest  by  other  countries 

who  are  wanting  to  know  more.    It  is  an  excellent  program  for  the  promotion  of 

language  development,  in  our  language,  English  or  whatever  language  you  wish  to 

learn.   

</span></div><div><span>Do not be deceived by the acronym of the Ministry of Education "M O E".  Do not be 

deceived by it, Mr Speaker.  This Ministry, if you read the Report properly, will tell 

you we are fully awake. 

</span></div><div><span>Before  I  sit  down  let  me  send  best  wishes  to  the  conference  by  the  Democratic 

Alliance Party today and over the next two days.  Enjoy yourselves.  Thank you. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 17</a></div><div><span>486 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister  of  Education.    I  now  call  for  a 

second speaker?  Our next speaker is the Honourable Norman George, Leader of the 

New Alliance Party. 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:</span><span>  I like it Mr Speaker.   

</span></div><div><span>Mr Speaker, I stand to comment on this M O E Paper before us.  Actually the most 

remarkable thing about the Report is it was submitted by the Honourable Ngereteina 

Puna, O.B.E., Minister of Education.  It reminded me that the Minister is an O.B.E. 

award receiver.  Mr Speaker, I feel strongly about education that quite sadly unlike the 

Minister I do not wish to glorify this Report.  There are so many things wrong with the 

education  system  today.    So,  I  wish  to  say  that  while  the  Report  tells  us  what  is 

happening,  I  think  there  are  a  lot  of  problems  at  the  top,  a  lot  of  problems  in  the 

classroom.  I do not think it is a very happy situation out there. 

</span></div><div><span>One  of  the  biggest  challenges  that  I  regret  never having raised with  this Minister of 

Education, seeing as he held the reigns of Education for such a long time, by itself a 

disastrous  thing  to  have  happened  -  that  one  man  can  be  Minister  of  Education  for 

nearly  a  whole  decade.    One  thing  I  never  raised  with  him  is  the  challenge  to  give 

opportunities  for  Members  of  Parliament,  be  they  Members  of  the  Opposition  or 

backbenchers  on  the  Government  side,  an  opportunity  to  visit  the  schools.    Mr 

Speaker,  the  moment  you  mention  an  interest  to  visit  a  school,  the  first  thing  that 

comes out of a teacher's mouth is politics.  Politics!  I really do not know what is so 

dreadful  about  politics.    Mr  Speaker,  I  totally  disagree  with  that.    There  are  some 

Members  of  Parliament  who  are  genuinely  interested  in  gauging  the  standard  of 

education that our children are getting, and I am one of them.  I have made the hints 

and  suggestions  to  friends  and  to  teachers,  I  have  a  lot  of  friends  who  are  teachers.  

There  is  a  huge  wall  blocking  Members  of  Parliament  from  visiting  the  schools.  

Perhaps the Minister has given strict orders that any principal who invites Opposition 

M.Ps will be fired.  I don't  know.  Perhaps  he can clarify this point later.  It is very 

wrong  to  suggest  we  are  going  to  the  schools  for  politics.    What  politics  can  you 

extract from a school when you are just interested in seeing what is being taught to the 

kids.   When you are interested in  hearing the content of what  goes on there.  When 

you  are  interested  in  actually  speaking  to  the  senior  students  to  find  out  what  their 

thinking  is  like  and  to  answer  questions  from  them.    A  Member  of  Parliament  is 

</span><span>interested in what is going on there.  The fact that we are politicians is used to wipe us 

</span><span>out  from  access  to  schools.    I  do  not  know  how  many  Members  of  Parliament  will 

take up the challenge.  I will certainly be very happy to visit the schools.  Mr Minister, 

if you care to hear that maybe there would be opportunities for open days where you 

can arrange for politicians to visit schools, to speak to the senior and junior students.  

And perhaps to have the opportunity to see a live session.  To actually listen to a class 

being taught.  Just a sample of the 40 minutes or however long their periods are, just 

to sit in there and just to see the content and the quality of what our pupils are getting.  

I  would  appreciate  that.    Of  course,  Mr  Speaker,  we  do  not  want  to  go  there  and 

</span><span>interfere  in  the  peak  of  their  studies  for  their  exams,  we  don't  want  to  go  near  the 

</span><span>place.  There are other opportunities at  the beginning of a term  or when their major 

exams are completed to give them an outside break, to allow visitors like politicians to 

go along and perhaps to debate with sixth formers or seventh formers to give them an 

</span></div><div><a>Page 18</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>487 

</span></div><div><span>insight  into  what  goes  on  in  our  world  and  what  they  can  look  forward  to.    And 

sometimes it gives us the opportunity to learn what is going on in their minds.   

</span></div><div><span>You know, Mr Speaker, the Report that I have about the quality of some of our local 

teachers - I mean we all love each other, locals, but some of the criticisms that I have 

heard  about  teachers  who  have  been  teaching  for  at  least  thirty  years and can't  even 

spell  simple  words  correctly.    Now  if  that  is  an  example  of  the  people  who  are 

</span><span>teaching our children then I have some misgivings.  And I get this reported to me.  I’d 

</span><span>better not say it too loud in case my kids </span><span>get punished.  But they say, “Oh Dad, they 

can’t even spell this word.  I can spell it, I told the teacher how to spell it.”  But there 

we are.  And of course there’s also references to their ability to speak English in the 

</span><span>classroom  and  they  always  make  a  few  mock  remarks  about  the  mispronunciations 

here and there, but again this is a reflection of what is perhaps is truly happening in 

</span><span>the classroom.  We don’t want to condemn it.  From my point of view I would like to 

</span><span>see improvements.  I would like perhaps an increase in refresher courses for teachers 

and that type of thing. 

</span></div><div><span>I  have  also  had  opinions  expressed  to  me  about  the  so-called  Grade  6  Exams.   

</span><span>They’re saying it’s an absolute waste of time.  The person that gave me this advice is a 

</span><span>senior staff member of the Ministry of Education, MOE, and I paid particular interest 

in what he had to say.  He said that those Grade 6 Exams have no overall academic 

</span><span>benefit to the kids.  It’s no true a measure of their intelligence.  In fact it is only being 

</span><span>done because it is the Minister's pet project - the Grade Six Exams.  May I suggest to 

the Minister of Education that he creates another hobby for himself instead of relying 

on the Grade 6 Exams to give himself his annual fun and joy.  I think if he would care 

</span><span>to  do  a  polling  of  his  teachers  the  majority  would  tell  him,  "Minister,  you’ve  been 

kidding yourself.  We don’t support this. You should forget it from now on."  </span></div><div><span>And most of all, Mr Speaker, another devastating news to me is that the Outer Islands 

teachers still have not received their full pay yet.  Of course the biggest nuisance about 

the whole system  now is  that if you raise a question, for example, the Outer Islands 

teachers to the Minister of Education, the answer is it is not our responsibility now it 

is  under  MOID.    MOID  handles  all  of  it.    I  can  tell  you  MOID  is  the  equivalent  of 

</span><span>Cyclone  Martin  as  far  as  damage  to  the  Outer  Islands  is  concerned.    It’s  absolutely 

</span><span>confusing  everything.    Everything  is  all  jumbled  up.    Nothing  has  happened  since 

MOID took over all these activities. 

</span></div><div><span>May  I  suggest  to  the  Minister  of  Education  to  take  back  Education  from  MOID.  

Maybe we will see some improvements because nothing has happened for 12 months.  

</span><span>The teachers haven’t received their pay.  This  is  a final  challenge to the Minister of 

</span><span>Education.  Please take back the Outer Islands responsibility to you and try and make 

a  final  impression  before  you  retire  from  the  House.    So  Minister  of  Education,  the 

challenge is there. 

</span></div><div><span>I support the Paper in general, although I don’</span><span>t glorify it to the same extent that you 

</span><span>have  done  Minister.    Education  is  uppermost  in  all  of  our  minds.    We  support  it  in 

total.  Thank you, Mr Speaker.  I support this Paper before us. 

</span></div><div><a>Page 19</a></div><div><span>488 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:</span><span>    Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    Our  next  speaker  is  the 

Honourable Member, Dr Terepai Maoate. 

</span></div><div><span>HON.  DR  T.  MAOATE:</span><span>    Thank  you,  Mr  Speaker.    I  would  like  to  give  special 

words of Greetings and encouragement to those in charge of the Ministry of Education 

throughout  the  country.    To  the  Principals,  the  teachers,  the  parents  and  the 

committees and our school children, I give them special Greetings now. 

</span></div><div><span>I quite approve of the Report, Mr Speaker, because the Report is talking about all the 

things  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  should  do  and  all  the  achievements  that  they 

have  maintained.    What  I  am  trying  to  say,  Mr  Speaker,  is  while  the  Minister  was 

speaking  on  the  Report  he  started  off  by  saying  that  it  is  a  pity  that  a  lot  about  the 

Ministry of Education is not being told.  That is reflected in this Report, Mr Speaker.  

Because the Minister is admitting that what has gone wrong is not being reported in 

this  Paper.    The  progress  of  a  Ministry  can  only  succeed  if  the  Minister  is  able  to 

identify the problem areas.  What use is a Report that is only telling us the good part 

of the Ministry.  Well I am telling you, Mr Speaker, and Members in this Honourable 

House  and  our  people  listening  in  is  that  the  Ministry  of  Education  today  is  not 

providing what our school children should be getting.  Every time you raise a subject 

with either a teacher or an administrator they say  - </span><span>sorry we haven’t got any money.  

And  that’s  quite  true,  Mr  Speaker,  because  it  is  common  knowledge  today  that  the 

</span><span>schools are selling raffles.  We have to admit, Mr Speaker, where the weaknesses are, 

where  the  needs  are  so  that  our  people  will  come  together  and  fully  support  those 

weaknesses.  Let us change our attitude, Mr Speaker. Our attitude towards the future 

is  to  look  at  what  is  happening  today  and  if  we  have  done  wrong  in  this  area  we 

should admit and let our people know and let us work together. 

</span></div><div><span>You  know,  Mr  Speaker,  a  lot  of  our  well  educated  school  teachers  have  left  this 

country.  In the present  time also, I came across an incident where I saw a very bad 

relativity  between  payments  of  certain  Government  employees  to  other  Government 

employees  in  other  Ministries.    I  am  sure  the  Education  Ministry  is  no exception to 

this.  I can quote an example - MOID employed a doctor to work on an island in the 

Outer  Islands  at  $8  an  hour  for  eight  hours  a  day.    And  if  you  looked  at  another 

administration officer he is getting $12 an hour for eight hours a day.  How can you 

compare a professional person of a very high educational background for $8 an hour 

to $12 an hour?  There is no relativity there.  And the teachers are also an example of 

</span><span>this, Mr Speaker.  Teachers could be paid at $6 an hour compared to another position 

</span><span>in  Government  which  has  no  comparison  to  a  teacher’s  qualification.    What  is  the 

</span><span>problem,  Mr  Speaker?    Because  the  Government  has changed the rules so that each 

Ministry dictates what is paid out to it's staff.  The Public Service Commission does 

not  have  anymore  say  in  looking  at  the  relativity  of  the  different  Ministries  in  their 

salaries.  And today, the Head of the Ministry decides who gets what.  And you know, 

Mr Speaker, and everyone else knows that within the Ministry of Education, there are 

so  many  more  teachers  employed  than  a smaller Ministry.  The differences between 

the allocations in the Budget for the bigger and smaller Ministries - there is not much 

</span><span>difference.    This  is  where  some  of  the  problems  lie,  Mr  Speaker,  where  the  smaller 

</span><span>Ministries can afford to pay higher salaries and the bigger Ministries, like the Ministry 

of Education, cannot pay high salaries to their staff.  These are some of the things, Mr 

Speaker,  that  I  want  the  Minister  to  tell  us  the  people,  the  teachers  and  the  parents.  

</span></div><div><a>Page 20</a></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>489 

</span></div><div><span>He's too shy to say that he can't afford to increase the salaries.  He's too shy to say that 

he  is  depending  on  the  parents  and  the  committees  to  raise  funds  to  support  the 

schools.  He's too shy to say that he is depending entirely on the school committees to 

raise funds.  And he gets up to talk about his big ideas to us and to the people of this 

country.  And this is one issue, Mr Speaker, that every one of us must bear in mind.  

The worst time for that is coming and that is the campaigning time.  We get up and 

say that we can do this and we can do that.  There is a saying, Mr Speaker, "make the 

best  use  of  what  little  you  have".    What  resources  you  have  in  the  Ministry  of 

Education make the best use of them.  But as I said earlier, the area of relativity has 

been ruined by this Government after they had changed the Public Service Act and the 

implementation of that FEM Act has spoiled everything that used to be good for the 

public service including the Ministry of Education.   

</span></div><div><span>Systems within the Ministry of Education about educating our children is one that we 

can  use  as  guidelines.    But  it  is  never  the  answer  for  the  education  of  your  child.  

Because I believe, Mr Speaker, the education of the child must come from the home.  

If  you  want  your  child  to  be  well  educated  it  is  up  to  you  parents  to  do  something 

about it in your homes first.  That is right, that is right.  In any profession it all starts at 

the home because our children are watching us.  What I meant to say, Mr Speaker, is 

that our children learn from us.  Our children copy what we do.  Our children become 

better by us.  Our children can also go downhill by us.  You can turn your child into a 

well educated child if you do your job well at home.   And if you want the support of 

that  child  to  continue  from  the  home  to  the  school  -  tell  the  parents  what  is  wrong, 

admit your mistakes to them and get their co-operation and support.  That is the only 

way I see it. 

</span></div><div><span>So, Mr Speaker, I stand to ask the Minister to tell us more as he said he hasn't been 

able  to  tell  us  everything.    I  am  asking  him  to  tell  us  of  all  the  weaknesses,  the 

mistakes made and all those things that he's not telling us.   

</span></div><div><span>MR  SPEAKER:    </span><span>Thank  you  Honourable  Member.    The  Minster  of  Education,  the 

Honourable Ngereteina Puna. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:  </span><span>I am replying, Mr Speaker.  I would like to claim my privilege to 

reply.  Thank you to the two leaders from the Opposition benches.  As I listened to the 

Leader of NAP, the Honourable Member Norman George, when he started I thought 

</span><span>he  was  going  to  tell  me  some  big  things,  but  he  ended  up  telling  me  small  things.  

</span><span>Small things like not being allowed to visit the schools.  Now, can he tell me whether 

he was ever barred from visiting Enua Manu school? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Yes. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:  </span><span>When? 

</span></div><div><span>MR N. GEORGE:  </span><span>Last year. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. N. PUNA:  </span><span>I am calling you a liar.  On the contrary, Mr Speaker.  I heard he 

invited himself to go to Enua Manu school and he went in.  Nobody told him not to go 

in.  And he attacked me.  He's forgetting that I have a daughter who teaches there.  Let 

</span></div><div><a>Page 21</a></div><div><span>490 

</span></div><div><span>3 June 1998 

</span></div><div><span>me  clarify  this  -  Government  does  not  stop  anybody,  including  politicians,  from 

visiting  our schools.  What else does the Honourable Member, Norman George, want 

me to say?  There has been no instruction to the schools from my office indicating that 

politicians  are  not  allowed  to  enter  the  schools.    The  schools  have  open  days,  like 

parents' days and we are expected to go along and have a look at what is happening.  

And we are also expected to visit, at anytime, and see what is going on in our schools.  

There is no need to stop us from entering the schools.   

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Norman George said that there is a teacher that he knows of who has 

been  teaching  for  thirty  years  who  cannot  spell.    Let  me  remind  the  Honourable 

Norman George and everyone in this House that we are all here where we are today 

because  of  those  teachers  who  have  been  in  the  schools  for  all  these  years.    That  is 

why we are here. 

</span></div><div><span>This Ministry is undergoing intensive refresher training courses.  And I would like to 

ask  the  Honourable  Norman  George  to  pay  a  visit  to  the  Ministry  of  Education  and 

talk to the people there.  Find out for himself.  He'll be amazed at what is going on.  

All  right  if you come I will take you around myself.  And he attacked the grade six 

examination which we put in place.  Yes, I inspired it but it has been accepted as part 

of the annual program for our schools and they look forward to it.   

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>I will have to interrupt the Minister.  It is time to adjourn. 

</span></div><div><span>The Honourable Minster, Vaine Tairea. 

</span></div><div><span>HON. V. TAIREA: </span><span> Mr Speaker, I would like to move a Motion: 

</span></div><div><span>That this Parliament do now adjourn until the 1st of July 1998, at 1.00 p.m.

</span></div><div><span>Seconded by Mr M. Aperau 

</span></div><div><span>The question is: 

</span></div><div><span>That the Motion be Agreed to 

</span></div><div><span>Motion Agreed 

</span></div><div><span>Can an Honourable Member please close us with a Prayer. 

</span></div><div><span>Prayer 

</span></div><div><span>MR SPEAKER:  </span><span>Parliament is now adjourned until 1.00 p.m., Wednesday 1st July.
