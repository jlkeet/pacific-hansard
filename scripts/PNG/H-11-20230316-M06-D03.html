THIRD DAY<br>
Thursday 16 March 2023<br>
The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 10 a.m, and invited Reverend<br>
<br>
Bernard Siai, Moderator of the United Church representing Papua New Guinea Council of<br>
<br>
Churches, to say Prayers:<br>
‘God is the King of all the earth, sing to him a psalm of praise. God reigns over the<br>
nations and is seated on his holy throne. The nobles of the nations assemble, as the<br>
people of the God of Abraham, for the kings of the earth belongs to God, and he is<br>
greatly exalted.<br>
Almighty God, we thank you that you are the King of this universe. Every leader<br>
that is exalted by nations, they worship you and declare that, God, you are above<br>
every god. This morning, Father we come in your presence knowing that as a nation<br>
and our leaders, we have fallen short of your glory in many ways.<br>
This morning, in this special occasion, we pray Father in the name of Jesus, that you<br>
forgive us as your people. With the Blood of Jesus, cleanse us so that in this special<br>
occasion of the dedication of our Governor-General, we do it with a righteous heart<br>
so that your blessings will be upon our Governor-General.<br>
Bless this hour of prayer and our dedication. We pray that the Holy Spirit will be in<br>
the midst of us and our leaders, as we together as a nation with our leaders, dedicate<br>
our Governor-General.<br>
Holy Spirit, we ask you to fill our Governor-General, Sir Bob Dadae with wisdom,<br>
understanding, discernment and knowledge. Father, we pray that you grant him your<br>
favor, increase his faith and prepare him to pursue your excellence. Draw him to you<br>
and cause him to know and fulfill your purposes. God, we pray that you also fill him<br>
with sound and godly counsel, for without your counsel, he will not be able to<br>
perform his duties as expected by our leaders and our nation as a whole.<br>
We pray Father, that you will impart your wisdom and revelation to him, as he<br>
performs his role as the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea. Keep his heart and<br>
motives pure, willing and obedient to your will and in what he does, may he glorify<br>
your name.<br>
<br>
02/03<br>
God, we thank you for Sir Bob Dadae. We thank you that he is one more time<br>
appointed for second term knowing that he has that leadership skill and he is able to<br>
perform in that particular office.<br>

And this morning, God, in your presence together as a nation with our leaders we<br>
bring our Governor-General to you and we dedicate him to you God. We pray for<br>
your special blessing up on him.<br>
We thank you that he is a man who speaks publicly about his relationship with you<br>
and his faith. This morning, God, we thank you, together we stand with him and we<br>
dedicate him and every one of us into your mighty hands for your use today,<br>
tomorrow and for evermore, in Jesus your mighty and powerful name we offer our<br>
prayers. We all say together, Amen.’<br>
