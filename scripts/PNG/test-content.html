QUESTIONS<br>
District Treasury operating in POM — Enga Province<br>
<br>
Sir PETER IPATAS -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, I direct my questions to the<br>
Minister for Finance. I have made representation to the Minister and his Secretary to establish<br>
whether a District Treasury from my province is operating here in Port Moresby.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, since the last representation I have not been facilitated with a<br>
response.<br>
<br>
(1) Can the Minister confirm that this particular district treasury is operating in Port<br>
Moresby, outside of the district and also outside of our province?<br>
(2) If this is so, what will the Minister do to rectify this because this is not proper?<br>
<br>
Mr RAINBO PAITA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Minister, for Hansard purposes please, address the Chair<br>
as Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr RAINBO PAITA -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the good Governor for<br>
his question relating to one district in Enga province which its district treasury operating<br>
outside of the province.<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 5:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I have not seen any documents regarding this issue but I have heard<br>
rumours within my department that the Governor visited the Department Secretary in regards<br>
to that issue and I have not yet received that letter from the Ministerial office but I will follow<br>
up today and if there is such a practise. I understand when there are special circumstances for<br>
example, when there were fights in Mendi, there were steps taken for normal government<br>
process to take function like treasury and other relevant district services.<br>
<br>
In respect to the question, I will see relevant offices and respond accordingly.<br>
<br>
Youth Unemployment<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES NOMANE - My question is directed to the Minister for Treasury. From<br>
the last Parliament Sitting were we voted the Governor-General there were few things that<br>
happened. We had droves of young men and women outside the Stanley Hotel in the thousands<br>
applying for about twenty jobs, minimal labour jobs -<br>
<br>
03/01<br>
<br>
Waiters, waitresses. We had 700, degree holders apply to become teachers at the<br>
University of Goroka. We’ve recently had the Lae Biscuit Company shut down for two weeks<br>
because it can’t sell its products. We’ve got a youth bulge issue in the country that the House<br>
must take note of, Mr Acting Speaker. There’s, too many young people without any prospects<br>
or opportunity for employment in the country.<br>
<br>
So my question to the honourable Treasurer is, what is the Government’s plan for<br>
employment? How do we address this issue of youth unemployment? What do we do to<br>
increase the number of people that are gainfully employed so this can directly address the rising<br>
crime rate that we are seeing in the country now. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I want to the thank the<br>
Vice Minister and the honorable member for his very timely question on what plans the<br>
Marape/Rosso Government has to creating jobs in our country.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, there are a number of initiatives at a very high level that this<br>
Government has taken to create jobs and this is one of the very key initiatives that our<br>
Government has been working on and must continue to work on.<br>
<br>
Ata high level from a budget perspective, Mr Acting Speaker we continue to restructure<br>
our budget to ensure that we pump more money into those economic activities that will create<br>
jobs. I’m referring here to our capital budget which three years ago when we took office was<br>
<br>
3<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
sitting around at about a K4.6 billion this year as the honourable member knows in his planning<br>
documents, we’ve increased that to K9,7 billion. Of that particular budget our Public<br>
Investment Promotion Public Investment Project component, we’ve increased it to a little bit<br>
over K3 billion when we took over office to around about K6. 6 billion, a 220 per cent increase.<br>
At a high level from a budget perspective, that’s what we have done. But of course Mr Acting<br>
Speaker, there are other issues when we talk about creating jobs.<br>
<br>
If you recall Mr Acting Speaker, I had answered this question back in about 2020 when<br>
I was asked and I mentioned that then that the jobs growth for any Government will be<br>
delivered by pro- job and pro - growth policies. With our Government as you know. Vice<br>
Minister we have a target at ten thousand jobs in the formal economy and many more in the<br>
informal economy which covers of course our SMEs and rural workers.<br>
<br>
So one of our first targets is, we need to make sure to make PNG an internationally<br>
competitive economy, including through ensuring our wage rates are brought into line with<br>
regional averages. Of course higher wages can mean less jobs in an economy such as PNG. So<br>
it’s always about getting the right balance.<br>
<br>
The Marape/Rosso Government is very much focused on building the agriculture,<br>
fisheries and tourism sectors and increasing of course downstream processing. And of course<br>
last weekend we saw the results of some of the good work being completed and implemented<br>
in the Gazelle Electorate. Of course we need to continue to look at greater funding in our<br>
infrastructure and we have done that by setting PNG Connect as our signature policy and in<br>
this year’s budget, I am very pleased to advise our country and the House that we have<br>
implemented one of the legislative changes that we made which was to ensure that 5.6 per cent<br>
I think it is, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue forecast is put aside for that particular<br>
04/01<br>
<br>
I think six per cent, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue focus is put a side for<br>
that particular program. This year if I recall correctly we had budgeted K1.2 billion. So that’s<br>
some of the things that we’ve been doing so far.<br>
<br>
In agriculture for example, some of the exciting initiative that we have taken we’ve<br>
properly invested in a state equity fund of K40 million last year. It was to support the expansion<br>
of large-scale projects.<br>
<br>
We have created new ministry of Coffee and Palm Oil to ensure a focus of these key areas<br>
of investment. We have significant investment in roads like we’ve mentioned. I’m very happy<br>
to provide a detail statement or perhaps my colleague minister for Works can do that to detail<br>
<br>
4<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
the record number of contracts that have been issued and to explain in a way that our people<br>
can understand. I won’t go into some of the examples of the roads projects which we’ve<br>
covered already here.<br>
<br>
So, I will just move on very quickly to fisheries investment. In this particular space we<br>
need to properly invest in our Pacific Marine Industrial Zones. Last year off course, we Budget<br>
K100 million and this year we have our new effective Minister for International Trade and<br>
Investment working on that. Off course, we also need to expand our rural jetties. Last year we<br>
have budgeted K4 million and this year I think we double that amount.<br>
<br>
In tourism again an untouched and a huge potential for our country that we continue to<br>
talk about. I will leave some more detail discussions to the Minister for Tourism, Arts and<br>
Culture.<br>
<br>
But lastly, other initiative that help us create more jobs is to deal with the greatest barrier<br>
of doing business in our country. And we’ve heard in the last three and the half years and in<br>
fact before that when we took government that foreign exchange reforms together with reforms<br>
to the Central Banking Act must take place. And I’m very happy to advise that later this<br>
afternoon I will touch a little more on that.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Granting of Tourist Visa on arrival<br>
<br>
Mr SASINDRAN MUTHUVEL - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My question is<br>
directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and acting Minister for Immigration. The Treasurer<br>
recently spoke about the importance of tourism, as we all know it is a multibillion-kina<br>
industry. I don’t know the reason why it is very difficult to get visa, complain raised by the<br>
tourist.<br>
<br>
It’s a multibillion-dollar industry but to get visa to enter the country is the most difficult<br>
tasks.<br>
<br>
Can the Acting Minister for Immigration and the Deputy Prime Minister assure this<br>
House that the promised visa on arrival that was agreed to 2015 when the President of India<br>
visited Papua New Guinea can be revisited because we are expecting another visit from the<br>
Prime Minister of India this year?<br>
<br>
So, can we grant on arrival tourist visa for India because they are ranked third in the world<br>
economy and at the moment they are in fourth place.<br>
<br>
So, the Minister can clarify as to why we delay in giving tourist visa to India and other<br>
countries as well.<br>
<br>
Ss)<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr JOHN ROSSO - Thank you, very much Acting Speaker, and I appreciate the good<br>
Governor of West New Britain for raising this very critical question.<br>
05/01<br>
<br>
The case regarding tourist visa is a very big issue and it is not an easy solution for us to<br>
Just give visas. This means interacting with Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign<br>
Affairs just recently updated us that he is working on rectifying a lot of the issues that we<br>
have had with the backlog of Foreign Affairs problems associated with other countries so that<br>
we can be able to allow visas to be done and issued.<br>
<br>
One thing which we have uplifted is the Business Visas which now are 12 months<br>
business visas which is short-term where businesses can apply only once and work quickly in<br>
a month go back so they don’t apply every time they want to go. So it makes it a quicker and<br>
easy turn-around time in light of the upcoming mines and also for our current businesses in<br>
Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
Quite rightfully said so the good Governor has mentioned Tourism which is a very<br>
important aspect that we need to look into and sort out. We are in constant talks with our good<br>
Foreigner Affairs Minister and he has also just updated me also that Indonesian and Indian<br>
diplomatic visas will be on arrival for the diplomatic staff that is coming in from them and we<br>
will also be looking at the Philippines and Koreans Visas.<br>
<br>
So, we are working at rectifying a lot of these things he also mentioned that some of<br>
these have been backlogs for over eight years that have not been done and he is now sorting it<br>
out with our immigration office to rectify a lot of these issues.<br>
<br>
So, yes we are working on it and it is very important and we will be able to sort it out<br>
and announce it to Parliament in the following months.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Supplementary Question<br>
Shortage of Processing Officers<br>
<br>
Mr GARRY JUFFA — My question is also to the Deputy Prime Minister and it is in<br>
relation to the same subject.<br>
<br>
Can the Minister advise us if there is an intention or plan to expand the services?<br>
<br>
6<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 9:<br>
Because currently what is happening is they are facing a staffing capacity issue and in<br>
many of the areas where we have migration officers operating, you will find that they are over-<br>
burdened with work. The number of people coming into the country has increased significantly<br>
but the number of officers responsible for managing or processing them has not increased so<br>
can the minister elaborate on this case?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr JOHN ROSSO - Thank you, for that supplementary question. Just to elaborate on<br>
that we have realized that there is a backlog on a lot of these and recently the Chief Migration<br>
Officer has allowed for 28 extra staff to sort out the backlog that we are working on at the<br>
moment. We are also looking at setting up a couple of offices, one will be in Lae to process<br>
passports for people in the Momase and Highlands areas. But for the long line of visas for<br>
coming into the country, yes we have noticed the problem and we have recruited 28 people to<br>
sort out the issues.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Policing Measures To Curb Crime<br>
<br>
Mr JACOB KOP MAKI - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and my question is<br>
directed to the Minister for Internal Security.<br>
<br>
There are Warlords in Hela Province holding resources in capacity and demanding<br>
ransom, young girls have been taken hostage and repeatedly raped; their criminal acts have<br>
gone viral on social media and circulated which has created fear amongst citizens of this<br>
beautiful Nation.<br>
<br>
Recently, an innocent taxi driver was hacked to death by unknown criminals near Edai<br>
Town which also went viral on social media. This is so scary and many innocent lives are<br>
being put at risk; our citizens and foreigners are living in fear.<br>
<br>
Can the Minister tell this country through this Floor, what measures have the Police<br>
Department taken so far to deal with the Warlords in Hela and the senseless killing along Papa<br>
Lealea Road? If nothing has been done about them can you explain to the Floor, so that the<br>
people of Papua New Guinea can be aware because this has gone viral?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr PETER TSIAMALILI — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and I would also like to<br>
thank the Member for Mul-Baiyer for asking his question.<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 10:<br>
From the onset, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members in this<br>
House from each province you —<br>
<br>
06/01<br>
<br>
Whilst I have this opportunity, I want to say thank you to all the leaders in this House.<br>
When we first met in this Parliament, we said that law and order issue is for all of us. Now, I<br>
want to appreciate you all for the work you as leaders are doing and also appreciate all of you<br>
for work collaborations with your PPCs because we encourage all PPCs to work closely with<br>
the district or you open members including the governors to ensure that they have full visibility<br>
in collaboration and in alignment in curbing the law and order issues.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I must make it clear that there are no warlords in this country. We<br>
must remove that phrase. These are just criminals. We must not label them otherwise.<br>
<br>
So, to answer your question in relation to incidents in Hela province, as you and other<br>
leaders would know, we&#x27;re working closely with the leadership on the ground. Now more than<br>
ever, we need leadership. We are stretched as a force and we all know that. We have only five<br>
thousand men managing and enforcing our law and order issues. We&#x27;re making every effort<br>
and we have started with the recruitment. We&#x27;ve also identified areas within the force that needs<br>
special attention. Our CID and forensic are addressing that. We are recruiting as I speak.<br>
<br>
With the issue up in Hela province, we have special policing zone for western front and<br>
again we are working closely with the leadership on the ground. We&#x27;re making every effort for<br>
us to manage this scenario that is happening in the Western Front up in Hela province and also<br>
across the country.<br>
<br>
So, I am just asking for support from you leaders. This is not going to happen overnight.<br>
This issue did not just happen in 2023 or 2022 or 2021. This is a combination of the neglect<br>
our force had over a period of 10 to 15 years.<br>
<br>
I&#x27;m probably having sleepless nights and I’m taking that responsibly to ensure that we<br>
work together with our operational side of the police.<br>
<br>
There will also be some amendments that will be coming to the Floor for us to make<br>
some more strong laws or enforce strong laws to deter this type of actions by our citizens.<br>
<br>
So, with that, Honourable Member for Mul-Baiyer, I hope that I have answered your<br>
question. We&#x27;re doing everything possible to ensure that we address the lawlessness that is at<br>
the forefront of this country.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>

Sir Puka Temu — Point of Order!<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - What is your point of order?<br>
<br>
Sir Puka Temu — Honourable Acting Speaker, the good Member clearly asked the<br>
Honourable Minister what the force is doing with regards to some of those specific incidents.<br>
Some photographs of these criminals went viral on Facebook so, tell the country what the force<br>
is doing rather than making a general statement. Are there people going out there looking for<br>
them here in Boiera and up in Hela? This is because their pictures were posted on Facebook.<br>
Tell the country what you are doing and when you are going to apprehend them.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
07/01<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - The Honourable Members Point of Order is in regard to the<br>
question the Honourable Member for Mul-Baiyer has asked regarding the incident that<br>
happened and the Members want you to inform the House on what actions have been taken on<br>
this particular incident that took place. Can you answer the questions raised by the Honourable<br>
Member?<br>
<br>
Mr PETER TSIAMALILI — Thank you Acting Speaker, firstly the social media and<br>
the type of exposure that the platform has also impeaches on the Ministry of Communication<br>
because we are talking about the cyber-crime space. And also, the general public using this<br>
platform to expose all these sorts of behavior now are days.<br>
<br>
In terms of the prosecution of these culprits which were already exposed the cyber-crime<br>
officers have been assigned to look into such incidents. Before the police officers carry out the<br>
prosecution they have to follow the processes in place by visiting the crime scene and take<br>
reports.<br>
<br>
With that I want to assure the House that the police have taken action but will go through<br>
a process. On the question of the progress report of the incident in Lealeah, I assure the House<br>
that I will get an update report and report back to Parliament.<br>
<br>
In relation to the process, we have already initiated and I will report on its progress as to<br>
the arrest of the culprits.<br>
<br>

Status of Carbon Trade Secretariat<br>
<br>
Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE -— In 2021, the Parliament passed the Climate Change<br>
Management Act. One of the reasons for that particular Act is to have in place a Secretariat to<br>
monitor the carbon trade activities in the country. Because of no Secretariat in place there was<br>
a moratorium that was imposed by the previous minister, whilst it was in place there were some<br>
organisation like NIHT and FORSET who went to some parts of my district and signed some<br>
carbon trade activities with some of my people.<br>
<br>
My questions are:<br>
<br>
(1) What is the Government’s position in relation to this carbon trade in our country?<br>
<br>
(2) Is the moratorium on the carbon trade activity in place as yet or not?<br>
<br>
(3) What action will the Government take on these two particular companies in Pomio<br>
now especially the FORSET and NIHT, who are actually causing some chaos and confusion<br>
amongst my people?<br>
<br>
Mr SIMON KILEPA -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, firstly, I would like to thank the<br>
Member for Pomio for his questions. Before answering the questions, I would like to thank the<br>
people of Lufa for electing me as their mandated leader to represent them on this Floor of<br>
Parliament.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I would like to thank the Marape/Rosso Government and my party leader,<br>
United Resource Party for entrusting me with this Ministry. Thirdly, I would like to thank the<br>
Opposition Leader and our brothers in the Opposition. And I would also like to acknowledge<br>
our two lady leaders in the House.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the NIHT and the FORSET are based on volunteering carbon scheme<br>
and they have been in the country since 2019. The moratorium that was in place has lapsed in<br>
2021. Actually they were here before the moratorium was placed by the former minister.<br>
<br>
But right now, we are working on the carbon trade markets regulations which is now with<br>
State Solicitor so once the certificate on necessity are done and approved by the State Solicitor,<br>
we will then remove the moratorium.<br>
<br>
08/01<br>
<br>
Right now, there is a moratorium for voluntary market so there is no new company<br>
coming in for voluntary markets. Currently, the regulation is being scheduled for the certificate<br>
of necessity. As for NITH, they are operating in New Ireland since 2019 and they have been<br>
<br>
10<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 13:<br>
operating under the Climate Change Development Authority to deal with the voluntary carbon<br>
credits.<br>
<br>
The report on ABC was done in the forestry area, but that is not covered in the area that<br>
it is operating to conserve the forest. It is done away from the area, in the logging areas to give<br>
disrepute to our credits, in saying that PNG does not have the capacity or the credits. We have<br>
the credits and we are looking to modify the credits with the PNG Forest Authority and other<br>
relevant stakeholders at this moment.<br>
<br>
As for the question asked by the Member for Pomio, I will check with my staff and will<br>
come back with an answer on his electorate. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE - Point of Order! Thank you, to the two ministers for<br>
answering my questions. I have another question in regards to what he said about the two<br>
companies being there before the moratorium.<br>
<br>
(1) Can your ministry conduct an audit on the works of the companies in my district<br>
because there has been some misunderstanding between the people there?<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Member, your point of order has already been<br>
answered when the Minister said he will go back to his ministry and do a specific report on<br>
your electorate and report back to you. Minister do you have anything to say on that or I will<br>
rule out the point of order?<br>
<br>
Mr SIMON KILEPA — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. As I have stated earlier, I will<br>
go back to my Ministry and get the right information to come and present to the Member for<br>
Pomio.<br>
<br>
Expansion of National Development Bank in rural areas<br>
<br>
Sir PUKA TEMU - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the<br>
minister responsible for the National Development Bank. I do not know if that will be the<br>
Minister for State Owned Enterprises.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I would like to ask the question to the honourable Minister in regards<br>
to access to credit for the rural masses. We can acknowledge today, that our banking systems<br>
mostly operates at the provincial level, and with regards to some of them with very bad or<br>
difficult policies and loans and many other conditions. Our rural masses miss out big time.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, once upon a time, the National Development Bank had a branch in<br>
Kupiano in Abau District. That has over time, lost its extension. Recently, 10 years ago, there<br>
<br>
11<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 14:<br>
was another attempt by the National Development Bank to continue to build facilities for access<br>
to credit for our rural masses.<br>
<br>
My question is;<br>
<br>
(1) Would the Minister consider a program of picking up the establishment of National<br>
Development Bank branches at the district level?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to also thank the<br>
Member for Abau, Sir Puka Temu, for this important question. This question also applies to<br>
many of our leaders in Parliament today.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the bank until 2017, received direct funding from the government<br>
through the National Budget to be able to continue to provide service and also to cater for<br>
expansion of its services to many of our rural areas. That stopped when the government stop<br>
providing funding to them.<br>
<br>
The NDB is not a normal commercial bank as we are familiarised with. It is a<br>
development bank and under the rules of operation, it is only allowed to charge interest on the<br>
monies that it lends at the rate below four to three per cent, which is just enough to keep its<br>
operational expenses going. It is not meant to make profit for its shareholders.<br>
<br>
That is the situation with the bank that we all have to understand. If we do allow to charge<br>
interest more than four per cent, it will be able to make some money. In the case of expansion<br>
in rural areas, the bank has through some of its internal sources been able to establish some<br>
branches in collaboration with some of our leaders.<br>
<br>
For example, a couple of years ago, the former Member for Maprik allocated some of his<br>
DSIP funds and we were able to have a branch constructed in Maprik, and that was opened by<br>
our Prime Minister. Another example would be the case for Tari District. That bank was opened<br>
by the Prime and myself.<br>
<br>
It is open to our members to allocate some funding to be able to open up branches in your<br>
electorates. The bank will try and come up with the balance and together we can work in<br>
partnership to open those.<br>
<br>
As I have said earlier, these are the circumstances that the bank is allowed to operate in<br>
if the interest rates are below four per cent, which is not enough to actively enable the bank to<br>
make a decision written on the investments.<br>
<br>
12<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 15:<br>
It is open and up to all of us to work together. We will expect a contribution from our<br>
local members and the bank will contribute its share and start allocating staff and the technical<br>
equipment that will be installed in those premises to be able to run an operation for our people.<br>
<br>
I do not wish to repeat but the bank is prepared to work with our members as long as<br>
there is a contribution from the members. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
09/01<br>
Tolukuma Mine Closure<br>
<br>
Mr CASMIRO AIA - Thank you Acting Speaker. Thank you for recognizing the<br>
people of Goilala to speak in this Honourable House.<br>
<br>
By way of background, before I direct my question to the Minister for Mining.<br>
Tolukuma is a mine that for some unknown reason changes ownership from time to time. The<br>
ownership must have been changed four to five times.<br>
<br>
Before petroleum came in and it was given to Asidoko and now the mine was<br>
unofficially or deliberately or I don’t know by mistake or by design shut down. The future of<br>
the mine is not in the clear visibility.<br>
<br>
In recent times there was a K20 million promised to the land owners. All my people<br>
flocked down to the city and have been here for almost some months now and they keep on<br>
congregating at APEC Park at the back of the Post Office along Angau Drive to see whether<br>
that money is going to be made available.<br>
<br>
Can the good Minister, clearly state the status of this K20 million that was promised to<br>
the people? Number two clearly demarcate or specify the purpose of that money. Is it for the<br>
employees who are being laid off or is it for the landowners? There needs to be some<br>
understanding, so they are not wasting their time walking down. We walk for five days to get<br>
here until God will, we&#x27;ll build our roads. My people they have walked all the way here and<br>
they have been here for some months now.<br>
<br>
Can the good minister for the sake of my people, provide some clarity regarding this<br>
money so my people can go back to the village and hide in the bush? Thank you, Deputy<br>
Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Minister for Mining.<br>
<br>
Sir ANO PALA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and thank you Member for Goilala<br>
for that question. Mr Acting Speaker, I am not aware of this K20 million committed for the<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 16:<br>
landowners or for the mine but I will look into it. I will find out what was this K20 million for<br>
and advise on the status of the funds. I understand that the Tolukuma mine is not closed. When<br>
a mine is closed there is a mine closure procedure one has to go through and I don’t think that<br>
the mine closure procedures has been activated. This is because of the status of the mine which<br>
I think was not being closed. | think the mine is in transition at the moment. It has passed on<br>
from one investor to another and it appears very clear that the mine at the moment is not<br>
profitable. That is why investors are reluctant to put in more money.<br>
<br>
10/01<br>
<br>
The main reason why the mine is not profitable is because of the fly in and fly out<br>
arrangements. That is, operation is conducted by way of helicopter flight and if you are going<br>
in and out by helicopters, it’s a very, very expensive process. But there are also some investors<br>
looking at the way forward but that most important infrastructure that we need to build in that<br>
area is a road from Moresby all the way to Goilala. And that is the only way that mine can be<br>
profitable.<br>
<br>
So, it is something that the government will look at down the line because I feel that<br>
there is a very big potential for that mine but we have to make it viable. And the only way we<br>
can do it is to build that road to encourage businesses to go in. At the moment the only way to<br>
go in is fly in and fly out and the businesses are not very encouraged to spend the money. So<br>
that’s where we are on that mine and I’m just hoping that we will find a way.<br>
<br>
I’ve just recently received an offer and I will be talking to you and governor; our good<br>
governor to take up this offer from one of the big mining companies in the country to do scoping<br>
work free of charge. So, I will be referring it to you and the governor if you are in agreement,<br>
you can invite this company to go and do the scoping work so that you will be able to then put<br>
the figures before the government for us to consider but the main question for the K20 million,<br>
Member for Goilala, I will go back and look at where these funds are, if they are there and if<br>
they have been committed, and I will advise you on the status. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Honourable members, we have two more minutes for<br>
question time but seems there is no questions to be asked, so I’ll ask the Minister for Treasury<br>
to make his Ministerial Statement. Honourable Minister.<br>

MINISTRY OF TREASURY —- ECONOMIC UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTING THE<br>
VISION — MINISTERIAL STATEMENT — MOTION TO TAKE NOTE OF PAPER<br>
<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY (Kavieng -Minister for Treasury) — Mr Acting Speaker,<br>
the Marape/Rosso Government is an open and transparent government. This means keeping<br>
our Parliament and our people informed of key economic developments. I am pleased to<br>
provide another economic update this afternoon. There are many economic issues facing our<br>
country and time is short and I will focus on key international budget and inflation issues since<br>
the 2023 Budget Statement.<br>
<br>
On an international update, Mr Acting Speaker, the international outlook at the time of<br>
the 2023 budget was gloomy and uncertain. As expected, the World Bank’s January economic<br>
outlook documents slashed its global growth outlook from three to one -<br>
<br>
11/01<br>
<br>
The World Bank, January economic outlook document, slashed its global growth<br>
outlook from 3 to 1.7 per cent for this year. This is the third worst growth performance in the<br>
world economy in the last 30 years. And 2020 was also one of the three worst years. The world<br>
bank estimates growth in PNG will be .8 of a per cent less in 2022 and 2023 this year and<br>
forecast just six months ago.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, we had built much of this into our growth forecasts and as previously stated<br>
our Papua New Guinea economy is doing so much better than most other countries. Indeed,<br>
the new World Bank forecast for PNG of real growth of 3.5 per cent is still more than double<br>
the world average. Despite this bad global news there is no need to panic. The Marape<br>
Government was able to steer our country’s economy through the dangers of the COVID-19<br>
pandemic. Papua New Guinea will weather the latest storm much better than most other<br>
countries. And once again we will be responsive, responsible and caring.<br>
<br>
On our 2023 Budget Implementation status PNG’s financial accounts for 2023 opened<br>
on January 9&quot;&quot; 2023. Now it is time to implement our historic 2023 Budget. This year we will<br>
see the highest level of government expenditure in our country’s history K24,567 million all<br>
of this within a responsible program of budget repair and reconstruction which will see Papua<br>
New Guinea return to a budget surplus target date of 2027 and the start of reducing our<br>
country’s debt.<br>
<br>
Let me highlight some key expenditure priorities as we implement the PANGU<br>
platform from the 2022 Election. Infrastructure expenditure will increase from K4668 million<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 18:<br>
in 2018 to K9796 million this year more than double. This is also being delivered with more<br>
local content and more local job opportunities. Within that capital budget of K9796 million,<br>
PNG’s Public Investment Program or PIP component has increased from K2041 million in<br>
2018 to K6615 million this year as I mentioned a little earlier during question time.<br>
<br>
This is an extraordinary increase of over 220 per cent. The Marape/Rosso Government<br>
is the infrastructure government. Responsible investments in physical capital to support growth<br>
in our economy. We are also supporting major increases in human capital spending. Our health<br>
funding will reach K2311 million this year, a 34 per cent increase since 2021. Education will<br>
receive K1650 million, a 51 per cent increase from 2021.<br>
<br>
Law and justice will reach K1,787 million, a 41 per cent increase from 2021 and this is<br>
supporting the police recruitment campaign, wasn’t it great...<br>
<br>
12/01<br>
<br>
This is supporting the police recruitment campaign. Wasn’t it great to see so many of<br>
our young people applying in January this year, over 80 000 applicants.<br>
<br>
We have committed increased salary funding for a steady five percent increase in the<br>
numbers of teachers, doctors and nurses through to 2027 and then a 10 percent increase each<br>
year after that. Just have a look at our 13-years plan, making sure that our new schools and<br>
hospitals will have the necessary stuff.<br>
<br>
The economic sector will receive K989 million a 46 percent increase from 2021 witha<br>
much greater focus on supporting our farmers and agriculture and SMEs.<br>
<br>
Funding for provinces will increase from K50138 a 30 percent increase from 2021,<br>
giving our good governors more resources to implement their key activities at the decentralised<br>
level.<br>
<br>
The major challenge for the 2023 Budget is now ensuring that this record level of<br>
funding is spent well and benefits our people. There is much hard work ahead for all of us to<br>
ensure that this occur.<br>
<br>
The 2023 Budget is being delivered with a Budget repair of a K1 billion reduction in<br>
the deficit.<br>
<br>
A low-cost financing strategy which has lowered debt interest costs from 6.5 percent to<br>
4.2 percent, thereby generating interest, cost savings of K1353 million in 2023 alone.      All<br>
in the context of a tough global environment, with many countries expected to fall into<br>
recession whilst, PNG grows at double the world rate.<br>
<br>
16<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
Our country is doing better than most, because of the good economic policies of the<br>
Marape/Rosso Government, guided by the Pangu Party vision of leaving no district or person<br>
behind. Do not believe the lies of social media or some of those sitting on the other side.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the 2023 Household assistance package, despite the good economic<br>
news looking forward, we must remember that PNG has frankly some of the worst social<br>
indicators in the region. Too much poverty, and living standards for most of our people are<br>
simply not high enough. This Government knows the cost-of-living pressures faced by families<br>
around the nation and for the first time in PNG history, the Marape/Rosso Government<br>
developed a package to help some of those pressures with a K587 million in 2022 and K590<br>
million in 2023. A total of K1177million in assistance to our households and our people. No<br>
other Government has ever delivered such a household assistance package.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased that he IRC has written to all employers with new tax<br>
schedules applied from the 1* of January 2023. This is providing tax cuts of up to K63 per<br>
fortnight for all those earning K20 000.00 or more for 2023.<br>
<br>
As mentioned in the dailies our NASFUND estimates will benefit over 98 per cent of<br>
their members.<br>
<br>
13/01<br>
<br>
Most of them in the younger age group. From the 1“ of January this year we are also<br>
continuing for another six months the removal of all excised taxes on fuel. This will save 61<br>
toea per litre of petrol costs and 23 toea per litre of diesel costs. From the 1* of January this<br>
year we are also covering the cost of social project fees in 2023. For example, a family no<br>
longer has to pay the project fee of K220 for each children attending secondary schools. This<br>
program helps ensure that relief gets out to the furthest parts of our country. The cost of living<br>
relief is greatest for those most in need. Those families with the most mouths to feed while<br>
letting their children attend school rather than work in the gardens.<br>
<br>
Responsible, caring, budgeting the Marape/Rosso Government supporting families in<br>
ways never before experienced in Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
On inflation, the National Statistics Office (NSO) has released its estimates of inflation<br>
for the September quarter of 2022. The NSO estimates inflation of those three months was 1<br>
per cent, this is half the inflation rate of 2 per cent for the three months of the June quarter of<br>
2022.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the Government keeps a very close eye on inflation. It knows that<br>
some key items have had very high price increases. This is why we introduced a 1177 million<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 20:<br>
household assistance to help deal with some of these costs of living pressures. The good news<br>
is that the overall current level of inflation of 6.3 per cent is below PNG’s long term average<br>
rate of 7 per cent. The Treasury and the Central Bank along with the international institutions<br>
are predicting the inflation rate will be below 6 per cent this year and fall towards 5 per cent<br>
next year.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, this means that we are not expecting high inflation this year. Once<br>
again, beware the funded scab campaigned by social media and the so called PNG empty tank.<br>
These inflation figures are gathered by the NSO across many areas of the country and go into<br>
detail on over 120 items and services. As a responsible government we will continue to closely<br>
monitor inflation levels. If things get worse, we will look at options to do more within the<br>
context of sustainable budget repair.<br>
<br>
Our international engagement, Mr Acting Speaker, one of the great strengths of the<br>
Marape/Rosso Government is its willingness to engage constructively and honestly with the<br>
international community. I have had the honor to have had three good discussions with<br>
Australian Treasurer Jim Charmers already in 2022 and 2023. These discussions include shared<br>
economic and trade opportunities such as labor mobility and good cheap financing options.<br>
<br>
On the international monetary fund program, Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased to<br>
foreshadow to this Parliament that PNG stands ready to enter into a funded program with the<br>
international monetary fund or the IMF. Our first program in nearly 20 years. We commenced<br>
this partnership back in 2019. We knew the IMF were critical for restoring international<br>
confidence in PNG’s economic management. We saw then as a source transparency and<br>
14/01<br>
<br>
We knew the IMF were critical, for restoring international confidence, in PNG’s<br>
economic management. We saw them, as a source of transparency and expertise. This<br>
engagement, was also important, for the K1.2 billion, in cheap funding they provided to us in<br>
2020, to deal with the then 20 per cent fall in our revenues, due to the COVID-19 pandemics.<br>
<br>
All countries were also assisted by the IFM, with an increase in quotas in 2021. We now<br>
stand ready, To engage in a program, that will likely contribute K310 million or possibly K614<br>
million this year, to support our Budget repair, and a total of up to K3,250 million over the next<br>
three years.<br>
<br>
Importantly, agreement to this program, is also vital for securing support from other<br>
countries. Without a program, Australian legislation would require the K1,800 million we<br>
received just in December last year, actually having to be repaid now and little prospects, of<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 21:<br>
success, for the request of K1,500 million this year reflected in our financing plan. We will<br>
also approach Japan and other partners, including the World Bank, ADB, for support and they<br>
are all linked, to the IMF program. The alternative to this of course, is going back to expensive<br>
commercial loans and of course being able to borrow significant the less than what we are<br>
currently doing today.<br>
<br>
The guiding principle for engaging with the IMF, has been support for the Marape/Rosso<br>
Government’s economic reform program. The IMF are extremely satisfied, with our program<br>
of economic repair and reconstruction. They are also pleased, with the progress we have been<br>
making on good governance reforms, especially those around the Independent Commission<br>
Against Corruption.<br>
<br>
They are keeping us honest, pushing our institutions, to release more transparent<br>
procurement data. They also working closely with us, on reform of our monetary and foreign<br>
exchange rate practices. We are sure, they will welcome and respect, our own local expertise,<br>
provided through PNG’s own Independent Advisory Group, on BPNG reform. There have been<br>
hiccups along the road, yes and I expect, there will be hiccups in the future. Overall, however,<br>
it has been a productive partnership. And we must on occasions, take a hard-headed approach<br>
to our national interests, including linked funding support. Like all negotiations, this will<br>
require some give and take, on both sides.<br>
<br>
At the end of this statement, members of Parliament, I have attached details on the<br>
program for this Parliament. This covers the details of the loan terms and expected<br>
disbursement schedule. It includes all of the quantitative and qualitative conditions, for the first<br>
12 months, we have 18 of those and this is part of our rolling three-year program. I will continue<br>
to provide regular updates to the IMF on this IMF program, including any updated conditions.<br>
And I welcome Parliamentarians to a briefing at our Treasury to go through the program and<br>
would hope we can organize a broader meeting with the IMF with those of you that have time<br>
and might be interested during their next visit. So, I commend this program to the House.<br>
<br>
For good health in 2023, Mr Acting Speaker, at this time, I must also note, the tremendous<br>
loss to the country, of the sudden death of Sir Wilson Kamit.<br>
<br>
I commend this program to the House.<br>

<br>
Sir Wilson was the first Bank of PNG Governor, following the reforms of Sir Mekere<br>
<br>
Morauta. He held the position from 1999 to 2009.<br>
              These were good years economically for PNG.<br>
<br>
I have been honoured, to have him as one of the three members of the Independent<br>
Advisory Group, on modernizing the current Central Banking Act. He has made a great<br>
contribution to PNG, and I was greatly saddened, by his sudden passing. My sincere<br>
condolences to Lady Winifred, his family, and colleagues.<br>
<br>
I would also like to thank Mr Jim Hagen, our key contact within the Australian<br>
Treasury, for all the support, he has provided to PNG and the wider Pacific, over many years,<br>
and wish him well in his retirement.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, New Ireland is a matrilineal society. During the Xmas Break and<br>
the first two months of 2023, I met with over 4,000 mothers and youths, to listen to their views<br>
on priorities for 2023. My clear view is that the Marape-Rosso Government is doing the right<br>
things for our mothers, our youths, and our people. There is still a long path to travel before we<br>
reach the living standards that our people deserve but we are taking the right steps forward.<br>
<br>
A record K24,567 million 2023 budget, with spending, focused on key priority areas.<br>
K1,177 million assisting households with the cost of living pressures, budget repair of K1,000<br>
million. Economic growth policies focused on rural areas, delivering double the world average<br>
at 3.5 per cent. Inflation moderating to under 6 per cent moving to greater economic<br>
independence. Working constructively and openly with international partners. Implementing<br>
the PANGU Vision, all within our available resources.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Motion (by Mr Rainbo Paita) agreed to —<br>
