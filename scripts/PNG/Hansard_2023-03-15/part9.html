<p>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT-MOTION TO TAKE NOTE OF PAPER</p>

<p>Resumption of debate (from 14 March 2023) <i>-Leader of Government Business, in continuation).</i></p>


<p>Mr <span>JAMES MARAPE </span><span>(Tari-Pori - Prime Minister) - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I just want to apologise to the Chair for interrupting a process during Question</span></p>
<p>time<span>. </span>I just felt that Parliament must maintain decorum. Question t<span>i</span>me must be short<span>, </span>sharp precise and to the point. Matters that re<span>l</span>ate to debate be refrained from to the best of our ability and be discussed in debate and the matters that the Member for Ia<span>l</span>ibu-Pangia raised are very important and are in response to our economy and in response to a statement that our Treasurer made yesterday on the status of our economy on job creation and everything that relates to the health of our country's economy<span>. </span>Therefore, it is prudent that we bring this matter up for debate in the next few minutes so that the country fully appreciates<span>.</span></p>
<p>Sometimes in a world of misinformation<span>, </span>especially fuelled by politics<span>, </span>the ugly head of politics does appear in our society<span>, </span>in social media, in commentaries in the media proper but correct information is important to assist our people, our country, our economy to be encouraged that we are moving at a right place.</p>

<p>16<span>/</span>01</p>
<p>The Treasurer must be commended<span>. </span>Anybody can run an economy in good times.</p>
<p>Our Treasurer must be commended because he steered our country<span>'</span>s economy in four hard years <span>- </span>period; on record. I mentioned four hard years<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker because when we took Government in 2019, the economic fundamentals were so weak, it was eroded.</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister knows very well the economic conditions passed over to my Government. I was his Finance Minister. The reason why I resigned was because of his appetite for unhealthy and unsustainable debt. He is least qualified to talk about managing the economy and I just give you one pointer<span>, </span>I reminded him a<span>lr</span>eady on this Floor of Parliament. What was the rational of going to a Credit Suisse commercial bank and borrowing with a two<span>-</span>year repayment rate at 8.8 per cent in 2018? When you talk about the economy's liquidity drying up<span>. </span>In 2018<span>, </span>there was a clearest evidence that we were at the precipice, we were falling into an economic abyss that we could not step out from<span>.</span></p>

<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, when we talk<span>, </span>we talk with context to allow the economy to regrow and the Treasurer is in the jump seat at the moment. Let's give h<span>i</span>m full support to ensure that he runs the economy to bring our country to a balanced budget at the very earliest. We anticipate by 2027 and a 13-year road map to bring our country out of the bondage of debt that we have carried for so long<span>. </span>These debts precede O<span>'</span>Neill<span>'</span>s Go<span>v</span>ernment'<span>, </span>and precedes Somare<span>'</span>s Government. <span>T</span>hese are part o<span>f </span>our national debt profile that we<span>'</span>ve been carr<span>y</span>ing sinc<span>e </span>1975 when <span>we </span>started off<span>, </span>wh<span>e</span>n our <span>e</span>conom<span>y w</span>as a Kl billion economy.</p>
<p>And I just want to encourage this House, our National Parliament and our country. We are trying our absolute best in these tough times. You only have to look at the statistics of our budget delivery. Our budget delivery is not all debt-driven budget. Our budget delivery; a substantial majority of it is funded by our internal revenue. On record IRC is collecting much better today than they have ever collected in the past. In fact, at a much higher level'</p>
<p>Last year, IRC collected around K13 billion and that's a record. On average, before IRC was collecting below Kl0 billion. Customs likewise is collecting above K3 billion. On record, Customs has never collected above K3 billion. These are collected in tough times. Increasing efficiency by appointing good people, we are starting to see better performance in our internal revenue sector and IRC is doing very well, Customs is doing very well. We are not only assisted by the high oil price. We are assisted by the increased efficiency within and our budget support that is carrying the economy.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker there are some good news, we've seen an increase in export from agriculture, starting 2021.</p>
<p>Mr Speaker, I returned from <span>East </span>New Britain over the weekend. In East New Britain, away from oil and gas dependency, away from mining dependency is an economy that has been running on agriculture and forestry - especially sustainable forestry.</p>
<p>Look at the 500 people now employed in a new veneer plant that we commissioned in 2021. Two years, on we have 500 new people employed in remote Lassul LLG in the Baining part of the Gazelle Electorate. So these are evidential work happening in tough times going forward.</p>

<p>17/02</p>
<p>The last four years, Mr Acting Speaker, when our Government we arrived in 2019,</p>
<p>we inherited weak economic fundamentals, then in 2020, Covid-19 arrived in PNG and induced a global economic shutdown. The effect carried on into 2021 and yet we had the General Election coming up in 2022. We had to be expansionary but within responsible budget approach.</p>


<p>The Treasurer has a clear road map before us. The result of the road map assisted with very cheap concessional US dollar denominated borrowing where we were able to retire 2019 at the K18.956 billion expenditures <span>We </span>retired 2020 at the K19.398 financial expenditures. We retired 2021 at the K20.131 billion financial expenditures. We retired 2022 at the K23<span>.3</span>74 money expenditure.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the sum of all these is over K81 billion being spent in our economy in the last three going four years<span>. </span>You ask me what is the result of these spending<span>, </span>well our public servants are paid on time like never before. I speak as former Finance Minister there were days when public servants were paid behind because Waigani public accounts had no liquidity. And the former Prime Minister knows that how he runs through his friends at Central Bank asking for treasury bill and inscribe stock to be printed<span>.</span></p>
<p>We deliberately choose to move a way from treasury bill and inscribe stock going to cheaper US dollar denominated borrowings that had zero per cent at long-term five-year grace period. This is the Treasurer's track record in the last five years. Collecting debt financing as well as internal revenue raise financing on time delivering an K81 billion in the last three or four years of expenditures in our country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the net result is this, our economy grew from K79.6 billion when we took over from 2018 to a K113 billion as listed by World Bank and IMF.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>you ask me how does the macro statistic deal with everyday person? Our disbursement through our districts and provinces over the last four years, we have given K4.4 billion to our districts and provinces. If nothing is happening on the ground, members of Parliament, those who came in today, you ask the former members of Parliament. Our people out there, if nothing is happening on the ground, go to Ombudsman, Finance Department, Reporting Department in DIRD.</p>
<p>But as far as National Government is concern and for instance, speaking from Tari perspective, my district received K15 million each for the last three years. I have five contractors running work in my district. These contractors employ 200 up to 500 persons each at any time depending on the scope of work.</p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker, when someone asks me, 'how many jobs have you created? The DSIP, PSIP program directly or indirectly has put over 10,000 people in employment, not just in Port Moresby where foreign workers were pushing wheelbarrow like it was in the last eight years, but in all parts of our country including the Oppositions' district. We were fair enough to give money to them.</p>


<p>You ask all members of Parliament, they have employed through their district and provinces. Employment programs that are running through the contractors, especially local contractors who are beneficiaries to government disbursements. Their worked has been out there through the DSIP<span>, </span>PSIP program nation wide with the 100 per cent foot print<span>, </span>we have created over 10,000 jobs directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>I come to bills at the Works Department, we have today over 274 road contractors running through consistent funding including retiring over K2 billion worth of contract the O'Neill Government gave never funded on record. Ask the Works Secretary, he will confirm this. In fact, he came out to media already. We<span>'</span>ve delivered and retired outstanding contracts valued over K2 billion, and including today, over K4 billion worth of contract that is running.</p>

<p>18/02</p>
<p>All these 274 Contractors are employing Papua New Guineans because our</p>
<p>government chooses to engage more local contractors - SME type of contractors, than the previous government which was very friendly to contractors from outside coming in to work in our country.</p>
<p>Contracts at the Department of Works and other State issued contracts have created over 10,000 jobs as a medium-term or immediate-term stop-gap approach to keeping our people engaged and employed so our economy is lubricated with kinas going to their pay packets and our people engaged in our economy.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, not only this, but for the first time, our generation of leaders on this side have invested money into SME Programs. On record, since 2020, this is the first leadership team that has invested money into SME Programs. You can go to BSP or NDB and they will give you indications that these SMEs are borrowing cheap concession funds at six per cent to ensure that they have start-ups and their business is supported. So, the SME funds, we are providing and these businesses will be directly or indirectly creating employment out there in the market to advance the cause of SME, especially our focus on agriculture and downstream processing in our country<span>. </span>We put money to support freight subsidy, we have put money for price support and to add to this area of focus. we have put money this year for state equity and additional land acquisition to support businesses in our country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, our government knowing very well where we are led by the</p>
<p>Treasurer, has made clear investment choices to diversify away from total reliance and mining and move into other aspects of our economy which we feel can have a greater catchment of our people and bring the majority of our people into economic involvement not just for today but more <span>importantly </span>for our future.</p>

<p>Our focus on downstream processing remains our number one area. <span>You </span>may not know it yet, Members of Parliament and the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, but things are</p>
<p>turning around. I point to you all to my trip to Lasull, who would have given them a fair chance, aren't they not Papua New Guineans? The Bainings<span>, </span>are locked out there in the bush forever.</p>
<p>The Honorable Jelta Wong and I arrived in 2021, and today 500 Bainings are employed for the first time and this is the story that I would like to tell.</p>
<p>I would like to commend all the Governors and Members of Parliament who are working with us to advocate and move quickly into downstream forestry, downstream agriculture, and downstream fisheries.</p>
<p>We have invested in a program for the resuscitation of PMIZ to ensure that the fisheries sector also is lifted up and processing fish catchments in our country. This has been our focus and we will not deviate from it because this focus will create tens and thousands of jobs directly and the spin-off beneficiaries indirectly going forward.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>the Treasurer is at work. I would just want to conclude by pointing to a few commentaries lately. <span>Business Advantage </span>is a book that's published not by the Marape Government but by our business community. In their recent publication, they made a few interesting observations and I would like every leader here to get a copy of these observations. They did indicate the challenges of operating businesses in our country and <span>I </span>do admit to the challenges<span>. </span>We will work with the manufacturing council, and the business council to ensure these challenges are addressed. The hardest challenge was the Forex access. Forex access was still a problem in 2018 going back to 2016.</p>

<p>19/02</p>
<p>When the economy should have been traveling to good times when LNG returns</p>
<p>was to have hit the economy and made big impact yet we choose to be hostile to our people by very unworthy investments in years 2014 to 2015, that we were in government.</p>
<p>Today the business community places Forex as the number one challenge and we have worked to retire this challenge. The Central Bank is now putting 100 million dollars to the market every month to ensure the business community have access to Forex<span>.</span></p>
<p>This was a far cry from what was a 30 million dollars threshold that Central Bank had previously. Our Treasurer has brought a reform to ensure Central Bank is liberated without compromising the independence<span>, </span>prudence and the fiduciary in their responsibility.</p>

<p>The Central Bank today reports to a board not just the Central Bank <span>Governor </span>doing things with a Prime Minister at Paddys or Bacchus Bar.</p>
<p>(Laughter in the Chamber)</p>

<p>Mr JAMES MARAPE <span>-</span><span>That was the past, I got to admit because I was on the side witnessing these conversations.</span></p>

<p>(Laughter in the Chamber)</p>

<p><b>Mr Peter O'Neill </b><span>- </span>Point of Order! For our Prime Minister to try and put in question the integrity of Papua New Guinean professionals, these are career bankers you know. So<span>, </span>you should be proud of their achievements rather than coming here mocking them because you have a privilege. There are Papua New Guinean<span>'</span>s struggling out there and they need a serious answer<span>, </span>clear policies and programs from you. Why can't you man­ up and do it after four years<span>.</span></p>
<p>This is a matter that is of number one concern in this country, unemployment, Forex and so forth<span>. </span>I am just replying to him and he is the Prime Minister of our country and he has to be serious about what he is doing.</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- </b>Honourable Member, you are trying to debate which I can allow you time during the Grievances Debate<span>. </span>But for now, please allow the Prime Minister to complete presenting his statement.</p>

<p><b>Mr JAMES MARAPE </b>- Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>point spoken<span>, </span>taken and responded. But, let me say this in the Business <span>Advantage</span><span>, </span>'100 CEOs Response<span>'</span>, they have made some interesting findings<span>.</span></p>
<p>Firstly<span>, </span>the Forex issue which the government has responded and today we have a 100 million dollars on the market every month.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>it has never been a Forex issue. I stand here today to be corrected on the records of past Treasurer<span>, </span>past Central Bank records and past government records. The average of Forex reserve under Mr O<span>'</span>Neill has always been at K6 to K7 billion in Forex. <span>T</span>he average of late Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare was around K8 to K9 billion when National Alliance was in office.</p>

<p>Toda<span>y </span>in three hard years<span>, </span>we have <span>n</span>ow gone past the K<span>1</span>4 billion threshold and <span>w</span>e have e<span>l</span>even months of cover. It has never been a fiscal policy issue but has always been monetary policy and the way Central Bank was operating. We have unbundled this and i<span>t</span></p>
<p>has taken some efforts but we have unbundled this carefully so that the market has Forex that they require.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, to the business community, we are mindful of what you need to do. And I want to encourage all our business community to assist us by partnering with us, by working in the downstream processing focus. We will come to you all agriculture, forestry and fisheries companies in our country.</p>
<p>First preference and priority, we will come to you all who operate and do business in our country before we go elsewhere. Partners in the downstream processing space area is core signature policy that differentiates between me, Mr O'Neill and others of the past.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we can no longer depend on the hype, boom and bust cycle of the oil and gas and mining project.</p>

<p>20/02</p>
<p>We must move seriously into down streaming of our resources, the reason why</p>
<p>Minister Marn and the other ministers in the agriculture sector are working into that space. Mr Acting Speaker, these areas will create more sustainable job for us<span>. </span>I want to encourage the business community that have spoken, that we are listening to you. Partner</p>
<p>with us in this space as we work together for the long term sustenance of our country.</p>
<p>I want to quote from a Westpac senior economist.</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER</b><span>- </span>Honourable Prime Minister, <span>I </span>will interrupt you. Your 20 minutes of debate has lapsed. I will allow you two more minutes to sum up.</p>

<p><b>Mr JAMES MARAPE </b><span>- </span><span>Thank </span>you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to quote from a senior Westpac economist in the same report. It says; "profit<span>, </span>investment and recruitment expectations have improved with recruitment sediment at a record high." This is from Westpac, not from James Marape, high as 84.6 per cent from 56.8 per cent in 2022.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we are not imbeciles running this country. We have learnt from the past mistakes. We are diversifying our economy and are empowering all parts of our country. We are working and the Papua LNG feed was signed.</p>

<p>Within next year<span>, </span>FID will be announced and 10<span>,</span>000 jobs will be created, but <span>we </span>want to bring this 10,000 jobs into our country. <span>That </span>is why <span>Kumul </span>Petroleum and the <span>Education </span>Department is working with Total, to train more Papua New Guineans to work in that space.</p>
<p>We have sequenced P'nyang LNG back to back from Papua. Porgera have already employed 1,000 people in preparation of the reopening of the mine. When it is re-opened, 3,000 workers will be employed, but in better terms for our country and not the terms that we were living with for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, big projects will be running but our government remains focus in the downstream of our renewable resources. Don't listen to negative naysayers in the media and in the Opposition, especially, the former past.</p>
<p>I will take good advice from the Opposition Leader<span>, </span>who has no input to our country, thus far from government, he is a credible critic in the Opposition. But I will not take advice from a former Prime Minister, who has had the opportunity to construct this country, but ran this country for himself. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p><b>Mr PETER O'NEILL </b>(Ialibu-Pangia) <span>- </span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>for giving me this opportunity to rebut some of the misleading statements coming from a sitting Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I said what I had to say about the statement from the Treasurer. There are few misleading points that the good Prime Minister has raised. When we were in government, we had debts. With those debts, I built the infrastructure in the country. We left it with K28 billion worth of debt in the country. Today it is K53 billion.</p>

<p><b>Mr JAMES MARAPE </b><span>- </span>Point of Order! Please, do not keep on misleading the Parliament. It is not K28 billion, it is a K39 billion debt you left behind. IMF and Central Bank have confirmed this. All that have been borrowed publicly and all that is hidden in the state-own enterprises, and every other debt we are carrying were put to the table. We inherited and were sitting at a K39 billion debt, which was already above 35 per cent debt to GDP threshold, that <span>Fiscal Responsibility Act </span>allowed for.</p>

<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister, thank you for your point of order. I will ask the honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia to continue with his debate.</span></p>

<p><b>Mr PETER O'NEILL-Mr </b>Acting Speaker, when the honourable Prime Minister was speaking<span>, </span>we did not interrupt him, despite all the facts he was presenting was wrong. All he has to do is to look at his own annual budget outcomes that he tabled on this</p>
<p>Parliament, to see the figures I am calling. That is the only document that we can depend on, and that is the government's official position.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, today we have K53 billion worth of debt but the only construction of things happening, is the so called Connect-PNG. We will see the outcome of it very soon in regards to who is getting the contract, who is doing the work and who is not doing the work, and who is getting paid.</p>

<p>21/02</p>
<p>Those things are now being asked by the same people that you have brought into</p>
<p>the country, the IMF. They are asking about the procurement processes and the names of people who have got contracts, so it will be very interesting and we look forward to seeing them working with you over the next 12 months to give you all the conditions that they have listed and you have tabled on this Floor of Parliament to complied with.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by some of the things that they are saying but you know that getting K3.25 billion bail from IMF is not easy. It is going to be a challenge. They are going to tighten the noose and we are going to struggle to survive this is what we are missing in this point. In may 2020 despite what the Prime Minister is saying, there is a club in Paris called Paris Club made out of the World's most developed economies.</p>
<p>There are no Africans, Chinese or many Asians but the world's most developed economies. And they suspended all the repayments of loans for PNG in May 2020. The Treasurer needs to give some of the details on that to the House<span>. </span>Why did they suspend the repayments? It is only because when we are not able to repay the loan, they suspend it so they give us breathing space. When we have serious physical issues and these are all on the websites that you can google and find out for yourself.</p>
<p>These are serious concerns and we can say that we have record spending and record revenue here but that is not reflecting on the state of the economy. This is what we are arguing about and this is what we are trying to get; the real picture of what is happening on the ground. People are struggling to go and find a job or even holding onto a job that they have. These are real situations when you have 10,000 going into some hotel here to look for a job.</p>
<p>This is the reality that we are faced with and it is not about political point scoring exercise as we are not going to the polls so we have to please anyone<span>. </span>Be the government that is for the people, take on advice, criticisms and comments and assess why people are complaining. I think when you look say we are pay 6- 8 per cent interest rates that is only</p>
<p>one loan that we got and that was the sovereign loan. and I admit that and we were advised by treasury that it was the path to follow.</p>
<p>It is only US$600 equivalent to K1.8 billion out of a K53 billion loan book that we have. And you can refer to one point and of course, we could have made better decisions but right now you are not getting free money. Do not come and talk about zero per cent interest rate here and mislead the Parliament. Look at IMF, they are lending at 2.4 per cent for 5-year grace period and 10-year loan repayment period. I do not know loan agreements about the Australian loans because you have not tabled the documents on them but we have checked them through the internet. And these are realities that you are not telling the nation and that we are in a serious crisis. And if you do not match the revenues that you have projected for this year, you will have a spending crisis, because your ability is just to continue spending because you have a K24 billion budget. It is time to rein in the spending and cut the non-priority areas. If we all have to make sacrifices, let us make them. The country needs us to stand up for our people.</p>
<p>If we have to cut back on the things that we are doing and the excesses that we are</p>
<p>having we must cut back. IMF is a very good example, their team coming here is an indication that not all is right and that is why we need to take heed of the advice that they are trying to bring in. when you are going to affect the public service machinery and the central bank operations, treasuries operations and introduce new tax and tax administration of this country; these are serious reforms.</p>
<p>If they are asking you to do it, there are timeline to achieve before end of December 2023. So, this is not something that we are going to sit here and play politics about. It is about the reality facing our country we are the only country apart from Pakistan and Sri Lanka in this program now. That's not something we should be proud of, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>22/02</p>
<p>Yes, we've had tough times, we've had Governments come and go but we all must</p>
<p>put our heads together and try and rescue ourselves from the position we are in because all is not well. So I know that we are trying to bring services to our rural communities and look after our own electorates but if the country is not stable and the economy <span>is </span>not <span>performing </span>well we will not deliver and that is a fact.</p>

<p>So I urge the Members of Parliament, yes Prime Minister and I can carry on and talk about these things, but you know it has to be factual. The reality on the ground, what</p>
<p>is happening to our people. this is not about politics, elections are finished. Accept what's going wrong and put our country back on track, that's all we are asking<span>. </span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker</p>

<p><b>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY </b>(Kavieng <span>- </span>Minister for Treasury) <span>- </span>Thank you Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to continue to debate this morning. Thank you to the honorable member for some of his very convoluted and confusing questions this morning. So a lot has been said this morning and a lot of it has been assumptions, very wrongful ones Mr Acting Speaker and I will try my best to correct some of those and put into context what our Government is trying to do</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, when I try to go through some of the questions that was asked this morning, I would say the honorable member himself doesn't know how many questions were asked because as he went on about asking the first three questions he started making some more comments, and he sort of got out of control and he got confused as to which ones of those were questions and which ones of those were lies. So let me try and correct some of those today ifI may.</p>
<p>I <span>am disappointed that some of us in this House continue to talk down the economy and create doubt in the public's mind in relation to the direction of our economy and the growth of our economy. We continue to hear statements like people are suffering, families are suffering, but you know no one provides any facts and the data that we have used in Government and have been for nearly half a century don't support those. And I'll give examples this morning</span></p>
<p>In relation to the question, where is growth coming from? Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday's statement, I have answered all of these through the three, four or five questions that the honorable member has asked<span>. </span>If he spent some time reading my statement, spent more time going through some of my media releases. He'd realize that I have answered all of them and I would encourage him to spend more time reading my statements going through the Treasury website because not only will you be a better informed member of Parliament, I think you would be a better person as a result of it.</p>


<p>So in relation to growth, Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday's statement. I mentioned that the growth forecast for this year was 3.5 per cent. It's very clear, that's from the World Bank, in <span>fact </span>the <span>IMF I </span>didn't mention forecast growth <span>at </span>3.7 per cent. Where does this come from? Because he keeps saying and insinuates that there is no growth and that could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p><a>23/02</a></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, growth is calculated through monitoring nominal GDP. PNG</p>
<p>economy is broken up into 19 sectors it starts at agriculture, forestry and fisheries number one oil and gas extraction<span>, </span>wholesale and retail trade, and I hope I can remember to respond to some of the comments that were made this morning in relation to a big biscuit company in Lae claiming that they were suffering. And it goes all the way down to the 19<span>th </span>sector called water supply and waste management.</p>
<p>So if you have a look at that, Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>the way it<span>'</span>s monitored is <span>t</span>hey start off with the breakup of our GDP forecast. Last year was around about Kl 07 billion and this year<span>, </span>as Prime Minister has mentioned so often<span>, </span>is forecast to be K<span>l </span>13 billion. These are just facts on how growth is estimated. So that<span>'</span>s where it<span>'</span>s coming from<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Going through some of the very unsubstantiated questions he asked<span>, </span>he talked about our record K24.5 billion Budget, well he got that right. We both agreed on that. And he<span>'</span>s asking how does this help fami<span>l</span>ies<span>.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>ifhe bothered to listen yesterday he would have noticed in page 6 of our statement and I would like to repeat this for his purpose and also respond to his comments to his former best buddy in governments gone passed<span>, </span>the Minister for Higher Education<span>, </span>to give more detail. Well<span>, </span>yesterday<span>, </span>I gave you 12 pages of detailed numbers and so on our record Budget and how does this help families, I did say yesterday that for the first time in PNG's history our Government, the Marape Government developed a package to help address some of these cost of living pressures<span>.</span></p>
<p>If we all recall K587 million we pumped in and K590 million this year; a total of Kl .17 million that we've given to families. No other government including your own<span>, </span>honourable leader, has ever delivered such a household assistance package.</p>
<p>So let's stop saying that we<span>'</span>re not trying to help our families, the facts are clear. I also mentioned yesterday that the IRC had written to all employers early this year with new tax schedules that will apply from the 1<span>st </span>of January<span>. </span>The other assistance that we offer are that we are providing tax cuts, or the IRC are providing tax cuts of up to K63 per fortnight for all of those earning K20 000 or more.</p>

<p>T<span>o further demonstrate that many more families are benefitting it was mentioned in both dailies earlier this year by Nasfund</span>, <span>who estimated that the household package will benefit over 98 000 of its members</span>. <span>So tens of thousands of our families are benefitting,</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker. Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands so let's stop making unfounded allegations like so many families are suffering<span>. </span>Be a little more positive, be a bit more accurate, be truthful and talk about the families that are benefiting. And if that was not enough and you say it's only benefiting those that earn K20 000 or more, it benefits those who live in our rural areas. From the beginning of this year 1<span>st </span>of January</p>
<p>I also mentioned yesterday and gave a detailed report that we're also covering the cost of school project fees for this year. So for example, a family no longer has to pay a project fee of K220 for each of their children attending secondary school.</p>

<p><a>24/02</a></p>
<p>So, this program helps ensure that our household assistance package gets out to</p>
<p>those in the rural areas and those that need the help the most. So, that's an example of the help that we are getting from this Budget and I would ask the honourable members to stop downplaying some of the positive things that we are doing and be more balanced with your response.</p>
<p>He then asked another question this morning to members of Parliament that this year we are proposing to receive Kl .5 billion as part of our financing plan to deal without deficit. Well that figure is pretty right so, we agree on that figure. And then, he also mentioned the K3.25 million funding that we hope to get from the IMF in the next three years. He then asked a question, what is the debt to GDP ratio when we affect these particular loans.</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, I<span>'</span>m very happy to assure the honourable leader, members of this House and the people of our country that these financing plans that include the two loans that he mentioned comply without debt control laws. So, for example, to answer specifically his question on the debt to GDP which would apply over the next three years so that's 2024, 2025 and 2026. Our debt to GDP focus for next year sits at 52.2 per cent<span>, </span>2025 projected 51. 3 per cent and 2026 dropping down to 49.2 per cent.</p>
<p>So clearly, Mr Acting Speaker, the way in which we undertake our financing plan including every single loan that we take complies with our <span>Fiscal Responsibility Act, </span>unlike during their time in government.</p>

<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>when we took office in 2019<span>, </span>you will all recall, we had a raging debate on whether the Budgets by the then government were accurate or whether they were fake<span>. </span>The argument was resolved when finally, we asked and agreed to an independent umpire and who was that? There was the IMF and their ruling were conclusive</p>
<p>and I suggest that might be the reason why a bit of bad blood started coming out with some of the attitudes that we had with the IMF.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, for example, to demonstrate how a government should not manage its Budget and to demonstrate how a government breaches its own law, let me just give you very quickly some facts.</p>
<p>In the 2019 Budget, the previous government Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook numbers on revenue, they had forecast and announced so gloriously on this Floor, if I can remember sitting on the other side, that their revenue figures would be and were on target to be K14 billion. We totally disagreed, if you all recall and we suggested and claimed and stated it was K12.9 billion. So, then we asked IMF to intervene, they were in Papua New Guinea on a country visit and they assessed the revenue was actually K13 billion. What does that mean? It means that the forecast by the government in relation to revenue was down to K987 million. There figures were out by about a billion kina.</p>

<p><a>25/02</a></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker on expenditure, the MYEAFO figures said that it was on target</p>
<p>to reach K16.3 billion. I stated clearly in that year that the figures should have been around Kl 7<span>.</span>5 billion. The IMF stepped in as the agreed umpire and said it was Kl 7.6 billion. What was this mean? The Government than expenditure figure was overspent by a record Kl .2 billion.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have an extraordinary situation where the government's revenue was down by down by a billion kina and the expenditure was up by a billion kina, was that a mistake, or was it deliberate? How could you possibly make a mistake of Kl billion when you are putting together the National Budget?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, it gets worse, the deficit they said would be K2.3 billion and I said as Shadow Treasurer it would be closer to K4.5 billion. Well, guess what? The IMF came in and said that the deficit was actually K4.6 billion, and the government then was out by K2.2 billion in their deficit.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, why I am sharing these significant figures with you is because<span>, </span>I will now get to the point because my friend likes to talk about debt to GDP so let's just compare our records, the Marape-Rosso Government with the O'Neill Government.</p>
<p>The O'Neill Government MYEAFO than from debt <span>to </span>GDP<span>, </span>they estimated it was sitting at 31.8 per cent, and if you recall our ceiling was 40 per cent so on paper as this Parliament was being told they were within our debt control ceiling<span>. </span>We said from the</p>
<p>Opposition that it was actually in a serious breach at 41. 2 per cent and guess what? The IMF umpire said it was 41.3 per cent. So, the government then was in clear breach of our debt control laws.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, what do we do? The Marape-Rosso Government had to clean up that mess. We came in, restructured the budget, and were faced for the first time undertaking a budget cut which we elected to be Kl.132 billion which we were forced to make so that we could comply with the Debt Control Laws. Then we were criticized for making these Budget cuts and as a result, we had to make some loans and were criticized for it but we were paying off their loans. It is a difficult world, isn't it?</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, just to demonstrate to you the difference between the Marape-Rosso and the other government on how we managed not just the economy but specific items like debt to GDP. I also noticed that there was a question asked whether embarking on a three-year IMF Program is a bailout.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I want to categorically deny that the Marape-Rosso Government is undertaking a three-year IMF-funded program because it's a bailout. The former Prime Minister gave some examples of countries how not to copy when we are managing our economy and I agree with him but can I repeat again, I am starting to repeat a little bit more than I like.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, as has suggested the main reasons why countries embark on an <span>IMF </span>Program is because they are experiencing economic stress and economic duress, specifically they normally had a balance of payment problem but both circumstances do not apply to Papua New Guinea.</p>

<p>26/02</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I say that because if you look at our balance of payments I</p>
<p>shared with the Australian Government during our ministerial forum, our balance of payments at the end of 2021, the last available figure was set around K4 billion. Our current account balance of payment was around a record of K19 billion.</p>
<p>So, Mr Acting Speaker, I'm quoting his favourite institution, the Central Bank that he always likes quoting I'm using the same figures so we both agree there.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we do not engage with the <span>IMF </span>because this <span>is </span>a bailout. We engage with the <span>IMF </span>for two specific reasons and they are as follows:</p>
<p>We want to use a credible international <span>partner </span>to endorse our reform package</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>As we continue with our expansionary policies for driving up our PNG economy, we need to borrow funds and he is the point of difference between the Marape­ Rosso Government and the previous governments<span>. </span>We focus all of our financing on cheap good concessional loans.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have not and I hope we don't go down the track of engaging with expensive commercial loans and to be able to access concessional loans, two things happen; not only do you pay lower interest like we have done this year, and I mentioned yesterday in my speech where we've reduced the cost of interest and this year we're making a saving of Kl.3 billion. Why don't some ofus talk about some of the positive things that his government is doing? Why do we continually talk down on our economy? Mr Acting Speaker, Kl .3 billion savings this year and where does that go? Probably to most of the DSIP and infrastructure development funds that Ialibu-Pangia will also benefit from.</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER </b><span>-</span>The honourable Minister, I remind you that your 20 minutes<span>' </span>debate time has lapsed but for the importance of this debate I'll give you another two minutes to sum up your debate. However<span>, </span>I'd like to inform you that when you are debating, you have to look at the Chair and debate<span>, </span>do not look at your colleague Members and debate.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY </b>- Certainly<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker, your wish is my command. So, to finish off with the IMF, the second reason why we use and why we need to engage with the IMF is because all of the financing that we will require to continue increasing our development budget until we reach that very important target date of 2027 to achieve a budget surplus and until we reach that very important date of 2034<span>, </span>where we will give the government of the day the option for zero sovereign debt.</p>
<p>It is that all financing is contingent upon the IMF endorsing all of our programs going forward. So, when we talk about getting assistance from the Australian and Japanese Government, getting programs and assistance from the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral partners<span>. </span>There is a condition which they place and the IMF must endorse our 5-year fiscal framework.</p>

<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>to conclude<span>, </span>we don't go down this parth<span>, </span>then we are forced to go down the alternative that he took and that is, going for commercial loans not only would you pay more but you will be able to find less and you will not be able to grow the budget</p>
<p>that Marape-Rosso Government has done in the three years that we've been in government. If you study carefully the 13-year plan<span>, </span>I'll invite you for a free lunch at the Treasury and explain to you in detail the benefits of our 13-year plane.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>


<p>finish.</p>

<p><a>27</a><span>/</span>02</p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>I was about to interrupt you on your time but you</span></p>

<p><b>Mr JOSEPH LELANG </b>(Kandrian-Glouchester <span>- </span>Opposition Leader) - Thank</p>
<p>you, Mr Acting Speaker. I was hoping that this important matter will be debated at a later time, but I am also happy that it has been brought forward.</p>
<p>I want to add to this debate by discussing a few things that we have heard from the Treasurer about the downturn on the global economy with World Bank revising the growth downwards. Obviously, with the COVID-19 effects still being felt around the world, some economies have recovered while some are still yet too.</p>
<p>As a nation, we are affected in so many ways. Now we are talking about a possible IMF standby arrangement and a structural adjustment program also from the world bank. I am thankful that during the Minister's presentation, the paper has attached schedule outlining the quantitative and the qualitative performance criteria's, including the structural benchmarks. My comments will be focused on that in this debate.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, from what has been presented, this is a loan that will be repaid in about five and half years and the maturity is ten years, meaning that the responsibility ofrepaying that loan will be left to the next government after the elections in 2027. I want to outline some of the measures that will be imposed on us.</p>
<p>As I have said, this is like a carrot. If they give us the money, we will give them the carrot. It comes with a lot of conditionality's, that have just been outlined. I want to also add that there are a lot of risks associated with this particular program.</p>
<p>Firstly, the K3.25 billion loan will be disbursed over 38 months, a six-monthly dispersal. It addresses the fiscal, monetary and the external sector of our economy. The issue of risks arises when you look at the timing. We have a global economy that has been revised downward. We are still in the COVID-19 pandemic situation<span>.</span></p>

<p>I am hearing, seeing and reading from our domestic economy, that many of our sectors are struggling. For business houses, the issues of inflationary pressures are still out</p>
<p>there. And so, when we look at the timing issue<span>, </span>is there a risk? The reason why I am saying this, and one of the things that is not shown in the quantitative performance criteria, is the growth.</p>
<p>Usually, under IMF standby arrangements and programs, they list everything,</p>
<p>including growth GDP. That is missing. I will rely on empirical evidences of other countries, that do undergo structural adjustment programs from the IMF. And, usually it starts with a contraction in the economy.</p>
<p>As you will note from the quantitative schedule as well, the size of the budget deficit has been fixed. In fact, it has been reduced from this year's estimated budget deficit of around 5.9 per cent.</p>

<p><a>28/02</a></p>
<p>So, the size of the budget is going to be tightened up. Within that context obviously</p>
<p>in other parts of the globe and when we study these things and initially when you start a project the size of the economy will contract. And I was just hoping that they would put that kind of quantitative indicators there so that we can see how the economy will be performing under an IMF program.</p>
<p>That is something that is missing and I am pretty sure the officials have discussed that here and that is one of the risks. Another thing that is missing here is that you know there are various portions of our population within our society that are disadvantaged. When you have this kind of programs the government must build into a social intervention program. Whilst we are implementing this we must also target and protect our budget that flows towards assisting the portion of our population that are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>If the Treasurer is talking about the household assistance program build that inside the measure. We must not build it outside as it might be cut off through deficit and this is the reason why I am trying to add in my debate is that those two elements are missing. And if we can have them on will be a good idea. The other issue is the one on exchange rates and I just want to caution, while I know that the fund has been very adamant that we need to remove our exchange rate and let the market clear the exchange rate value and obviously we all know that it will go down.</p>

<p>My <span>concern </span>is that we have a huge debt in external loans and when we do <span>that </span>and I mean the Treasurer<span>, </span>the government and its officials need to study this <span>very </span>well. Is he going to lead us into default because we have almost US$6-7 billion in external debt alone? I am raising this concern because by looking at the quantitative performance criteria of the</p>
<p>fund, you will notice that when the fund hits and by the end of this year the foreign reserves level will drop from the current US$3.26 billion to US$ 1.76 billion. That is one of the effects and it is part of the criteria. I am just thinking around it and that is risk.</p>
<p>If we use the ratio of a kina to US <span>O</span>.28 cents that is going to be around K5-6 billion in foreign reserves by the end of this year under the program and I am pretty sure that they will try to show up our connections through all those loans. I just want to add that as a risk, given that we are already affected. Many of the business houses are already affected by the foreign exchange issues that we are having.</p>
<p>These are the risks that I want to highlight and some of the missing links that we need to look at. The last thing I want to say is that, I came across a gentleman which most of you may know; he was a former professor at UPNG back in the 60s. Professor Clunnis Ross; I think he was there with Professor Ross Gamer during those times. I met him during my studies during one of the IMF and World Bank negotiations and we were doing this mock negotiation and so he introduced himself and I had a chat with him and this is what he said, 'PNG you shouldn't be running to the IMF and the World Bank'.</p>

<p>29/02</p>
<p>There are only two countries in the world that is PNG and Botswana<span>. </span>You have so</p>
<p>much minerals, gas, diamonds and resources and you are able to stabilize your economy with the Minerals Stabilization Fund in those days. And so he said this is a good thing, you can sort out your issues and show to the other countries that you can do it. So I thought that I can leave that as a parting message on my debate.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p><span>Mr DON POLYE </span>(Kandep - Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and Sports) <span>- </span>Mr Acting Speaker I would like to join in the debate, I'm not one very keen to gag on other leaders talking, I will have to listen to them. But always have this view that under three conditions we should stop any mislead is the varsity of facts presented to the Parliament and to the people when the facts are not correct and misconstrued. I think it's a duty of all of us to say if the facts are not true; to establish the facts in black and white like the honourable Treasurer has done. So, the misinformation must be corrected and I think the <span>Treasurer </span>has adequately done that.</p>
<p>If the Opposition, or any member on the Floor of Parliament and anybody who would like to rebut what the Government is doing. There must be an alternative policy, or</p>
<p>in this case, if one was in Government before and for instance, we have two former Prime Ministers here. <span>The </span>Rt Honourable Sir Julius Chan<span>, </span>the former Prime Minister<span>, </span>one of the best we had and the Honourable member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O'Neill. For such people of that category to speak, they must also tell what they did and what the present Government is doing against what they did. Therefore, what they did, did bring such positive results and return on investments they did and they can compare that with the current Government.</p>
<p>In <span>those circumstances the former Prime Minister fell very short to explain and justify his points and therefore if one was listening to the argument presented, you would be inclined with the 100 per cent surety to believe what the Treasurer had presented in support of what the Prime Minister had said rather than to listen to the opposing argument.</span></p>
<p>The third category of argument should be the one who comes before to discuss the issue must come with clean hands and in law, it is the maximum principle of equity, I have clean hands. But I think in this case I find it very difficult to forget very fresh memories recently. What they had done; they had hurt this country so much and then speak as if they have clean hands</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr Acting Speaker, I had to intervene and raise a point of order because I have vivid memories of the very issue that was raised. Let me mention just one or two before I support the Treasurer in his statement yesterday. On the statement presented, I would like to advise and guide all the members of Parliament that the facts here are perfect. In other words, the figures and status here are very true. You can search it, you can google it, you can ask the World Bank, IMF and other Sovereign nations of the facts about Papua New Guinea; you will find that it is true. For instance, PNG's GDP growth is 3.5 per cent. The world will shrink down 1.7 per cent from the 3.5 per cent growth. That is a fact. I will support.</p>
<p>When we talk about employment, that was the advice that was given to some of us when we were the Prime Minister at that time; that <span>is </span>when we get the money we put elsewhere and not create employment. Buying shares in other countries could not provide employment. That would destroy employment.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, you look at Hansard in the Parliament, I was on the other side as leader of the Oppositions and I usually give that advise too.</p>


<p><a>30/02</a></p>
<p>Ifwe get such money, K3.1 billion which is almost 90 per cent of the development Budget of Papua New Guinea at that time. In other words<span>, </span>you are getting the Development Budget of Papua New Guinea and putting it into a speculative market. If you did that, then you will be able to see in the next 10 to 20 years, unemployment, inflation, foreign reserves with challenges, cash flow situations. We will see all of this because Papua New Guinea is a growing economy, we need to strengthen it to a mature economy and people will never listened and now I hear the same people crying over spilt milk. They are saying, there's 10 000 people who are looking for jobs, and there are none created? You were in that position; you had a decision making power to do that.</p>
<p>The other thing that we raised was, do not give jobs to foreigners. We give our people jobs in the construction industry. That was the call that was made genuinely and sincerely. Not just by a leader of the opposition or somebody who opposed policies of the former Prime Minister of his Government. But we said, don't give jobs to overseas people. Now what has happened? Now overseas people are coming in. They have their own companies with their own interests and they kill our local interest.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we must speak strategically and see what we have done; learn from the past and correct the future. Some of us we just talk without thinking about what we have done. Another thing is the debt level. Our debt levels were really high<span>, </span>and I always reminded him that our debt levels must never go up because we will destroy our economy</p>
<p>I would like to hear a new member of parliament talk about this issue not the same members of parliament who has been here in Parliament for many years.</p>
<p>Now the Marape<span>/</span>Rosso government has come in and is trying its best to clean up an issue that was created by people who never listened in the past. And now those who want to complain must have clean hands. I know that these a fair comment that I'm making so we understand for the future and we must speak the truth and the truth will set us free<span>.</span></p>
<p>On the issue of quantitative and qualitative performance criteria that I heard the good leader of the Opposition mentioned that we will implement such programs and therefore see this growth. You look at the performance of the Government, we already have a growth of 3.5 per cent as per hour and we are going on the right track. The IMF did not come and tell us how to grow it, we are already growing. But if there is an argument that we are not seeing it<span>, </span>then the responsibility lies on your MP<span>'</span>s<span>, </span>the public service and those that have the responsibility mandated to amend the programs of Government. The implementing issue is not the same as the policy issue. The Marape<span>/</span>Rosso government is</p>
<p>giving the right policy perspective, statistics are correct and the leadership is in the right direction<span>. </span>Now the challenge has come to what the Treasurer was saying yesterday. He said that the Budget must be effectively implemented so this lies solely on the members of parliament, district administration, the provincial administration<span>, </span>the Governors, the District Secretaries and so forth. It's now up to this House as to how implement the programs to the public service.</p>
<p>Let me specifically talk about the areas I'm entrusted to look after in the area of Education. I am happy that the Budget provides Kl .65 billion for the Education sector. It's good that we spend money in that area. Not to invest in some stock exchange or business.</p>

<p><a>31/02</a></p>
<p>It is good to put Kl .65 billion<span>. </span>That is<span>, </span>about 51 per cent increase to skilling our</p>
<p>Papua New Guineans and that's a very good thing. If you look at what the Prime Minister has said. In the next five years<span>, </span>we would like to see 30,000 non<span>-</span>school leavers have spaces in all the universities and technical institutions and that is where the money is. As a responsible minister<span>, </span>what I'm doing is<span>, </span>I am looking at ways to improve the skills of Papua New Guineans with employment, but the employability of Papua New Guineans is very important. If they have no skills<span>, </span>it is very difficult for them to get a job<span>. </span>Even though we have the population<span>, </span>we will still cry. We want employment but if we don't train our Papua New Guineans to be employed in the gas industry; the mining sector; the agriculture sector; the construction industry and in all the other areas<span>, </span>then you'll find that employment will be a problem because we have not produced skilled people.</p>
<p>What are you doing with this policy? Are we creating and developing skills that</p>
<p>are most relevant for Papua New Guineans so that they could have an employment?</p>
<p>The infrastructure development that the Treasurer mentioned is a key area. If you look at all our institutions, universities and colleges, we are doing infrastructure rehabilitation for science labs, classrooms and dormitories. We have K200 million in partnership with ADB to implement the program and I am happily implementing it because we would like to see the quality of our institutions when quality graduates come out from these institutions. So, we are implementing the government's policy<span>. </span>If we had the Kl .56 billion in that sector<span>, </span>we should have implemented it already<span>.</span></p>
<p>Now<span>, </span>in support of what the Treasurer said yesterday on <span>e</span>ffecti<span>v</span>e implementation of the budget, it is the pub<span>l</span>ic service. All of us have a duty to our districts<span>, </span>the DSIP we</p>
<p>get is a lot of money. It is Kl0 million as for the budget but it will be K20 million for this year and in the coming years.</p>
<p>When we talk about employment or any economic growth, it actually lies with the individual MPs, the district administrators, finance managers and everybody on the ground. Like in Kandep District, I hold meetings with them to discuss how to convert that money into employability and economic growth and then link it to the Enga Provincial Development Plan Vision 2050 and Medium-Term Development strategies of the National Government. So we already have the solutions to the job we are doing.</p>
<p>We have the strategies and means of ways to solve those issues and yet you are complaining. We should not be complaining, we should be happy and be cheerful. You have a government that is putting a lot of money but it's up to individual MPs and their public service administration to implement to achieve the intended returns.</p>
<p>I was complaining on the other side when the Member for Ialibu-Pangia was the Prime Minister. I have your debt level has gone up to K35 billion. I heard the Prime Minister James Marape said K29 billion because on the balance sheet of Treasury it was K29 billion but if you look at the money that was used <span>through </span>the SOEs, it goes up to K35 billion. You will find some of these SOE's don't have the money to invest to make more money for themselves.</p>
<p>Like the PNG Power and other SOEs, money must be there as a capital? But when you get a loan and start to build up debts like I alluded to earlier, actually the money that were there in the SOEs under the leadership of former Prime Minister to my knowledge is K35 billion. On the Treasury balance sheet is K29 billion so it is a challenge for this side of the House to see how we can manage it. We can scale it down but at the same time, we grow the economy, create employment for our people and implement programs as well as looking at the rural sector through the DSIP funds.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the public service is a very important area. I think that the implementation part is an issue and a challenge there.</p>

<p>On the leadership side, I think we are doing well as a government, but the only challenges we have are in individual public service in every sector. The public service needs to wake up to the reality. The leadership in the public service needs to be addressed and according to the <span>Treasurer </span>we have heard the statement, that is being addressed adequately through <span>the </span>partnership that the State has <span>with IMF. </span>We are addressing by <span>way </span>of upgrading the skill, capacity and the capability of public service to implement these programs.</p>
<p>32/02</p>
<p>So we should stay focused on implementation and fixing the problems and</p>
<p>challenges in the areas that we are entrusted.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I believed that what a government can do under certain circumstances has been done adequately. When you look at it, there are many alternatives to take but with the current situation and circumstances that are presented<span>, </span>created in the past and some challenges like Covid-19 and the inflation present, the Marape-Rosso Government is implementing programs that are right. I think we should change our mindset both the Government and the Opposition to look at what we must do to make areas we are lacking better than always barking at the government.</p>
<p>The Government at the moment under all circumstances is doing well and should be supported. I ask the Opposition to support the government by doing what they can do rather than giving misconstrued facts or forgetting the past. I think the direction we should take, is to learn from the past and build on from the present into the future. We must look into the future as a nation of competency and affluence and that is where we are going.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion as far as the Marape<span>-</span>Rosso Government is concerned, we are doing well. We support the Treasurer and his economic management regardless of the challenges, dynamics<span>, </span>and conditions we see today learn from the past and let's move forward. I encourage us to discuss and debate very fruitfully like this but with facts and if you are clean and you give suggestions, I think it is worth listening to, but if you have contributed to the problems it's all right too, you can learn from your mistakes. This Government is moving in the right direction and the country needs to support it.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>Motion (by <span>Mr Rainbo Paita) </span>agreed to -</p>
<p>That the debate be adjourned to a subsequent siting to allow the other Members to contribute.</p>
