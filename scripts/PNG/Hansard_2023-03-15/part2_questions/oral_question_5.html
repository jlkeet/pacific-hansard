<h3>National Development Bank</h3>
<h2><a>National Development Bank</a></h2>
<h2>Mr SAM BASIL JNR <span>- </span><span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the Minister for State-owned Enterprises. We have the SME credit scheme of K200 million that stated in 2019 till today. My people of Bulolo district are more dependent on alluvial gold operations, agriculture and PMVs.</span></h2>
<p>Can the good Minister advise us whether the National Development Bank (NDB) has allocated funds for lending to each district or province?</p>
<p>My district has no NDB office<span>, </span>therefore, can they open a branch that can serve Menyamya, Wauwaria and Kaintiba also Marawaka and part of the Huon Gulf?</p>
<p>Are the people of Bulolo and others throughout the country eligible for the NDB SME loans as we are not seeing it on the ground?</p>
<p>Could NDB have specific loan tailored to alluvial mine under the SME Credit Scheme?</p>

<h2>Mr WILLIAM DUMA <span>- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I would like to thank the very good Member for Bulolo for this very important questions</span><span>.</span></h2>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the Marape Government had recognized the importance of SMEs in the economic development of our country and it quite rightly and correctly allocated K200 million in its budget two years ago.</p>

<h2><a>10/02</a></h2>
<p>Of that K200 million, Kl 00 million was allocated to Bank of South Pacific to</p>

<p>provide as a guarantee to encourage that bank to go down the path of helping us and to provide loans to SMEs as well as other Papua New Guinea-owned businesses. <span>And </span>from that balance of K100 million, K20 million was allocated to the Department of Commerce</p>
<p>where on a number of occasions during those times at least Kl million was given to most of the electorates, who requested for to help them with their SME programs<span>.</span></p>
<p>The balance of K80 million was allocated to the NDB and then NDB came out and quite clearly in the media shared out the guidelines for our people to follow when applying for loans.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we must all understand that when the bank says it will lend money to the people, the people on their part also have to meet the requirements, nothing is free in life. And the Government had honourable intentions and allocated K80 million strategically for SMEs including our people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. There was a special allocation for those operating SMEs in that part of our country and as long as our people are able to follow the guidelines, they can be able to access those funds.</p>
<p>I'm advised by the CEO ofNDB that the K80million was allocated right throughout the country and that they've run out of those funds and now it is up to us in this government and this parliament to ensure that we then in the next budget allocate more money for our people. It is not only the function of myself as minister, or the prime minister to allocate money. This is something we all have to work together and ensure that we allocate enough money for our people.</p>
<p>In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining, the idea of existing SMEs is to ensure that money is allocated to all our Papua New Guineans who involve in all sectors of business including alluvial mining and there is nothing stopping our landowners from trying to have access to be used for alluvial mining. So, when there are funds that are available, we can all encourage them to apply for and ensure that our people get help in terms of loans. So, there is no specific provision for alluvial mining business people to be allocated money but the money is meant for our people who are involved in the general SMEs.</p>

<p>So, <span>I </span>understand also Mr Acting Speaker, that the NDB has some internal funds from its savings which is now allocated to continue to help fund our people so I am sure there is money there. It is a matter of our people making sure that they approach the bank representatives. Unfortunately, NDB will not be present in every centre of this country. It is present in more specific areas. Our people must make the effort to travel there themselves and apply for the <span>loan </span>and of they qualify for the loan, there should be nothing stopping them from benefitting from those funds. <span>Mr Acting </span>Speaker, thank <span>you.</span></p>
