<h3>Contracting SME's to Deliver School Supplies</h3>
<h2><a>Contracting SME's to Deliver School Supplies</a></h2>
<p><b>Mr PATRICK BASA </b><span>- </span>Good morning, Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>and the Prime Minister, Governors and the colleague Members of Parliament. My question is in regards to the contracts for the supply of school materials and I therefore direct it to the Education Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, Waigani Department of Education chooses to use SMEs to distribute important materials when schools have already started and well into the first term.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, schools everywhere are struggling mostly those in the rural</p>
<p>communities and remote locations like my district in Kabwum.</p>

<h2><a>02/02</a></h2>
<p>Many cannot coup with increased number of students enrolled, problems with late</p>
<p>transfer of teachers and even the remote schools there is no teachers at this stage and very poor infrastructures and so on.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, hearing about another million-kina worth of contract for the supply of materials. I want to ask the Minister the following questions.</p>
<p>Why can't the supply of school materials be done by the respective provincial education boards in collaboration with the district education authorities and the district leaders like us?</p>
<p>Minister are you aware that this arrangement of using selected SMEs have failed in the past?</p>
<p>What is the criteria for selecting the SMEs and do they have capacity to cover the remotest schools like in Kabwum?</p>
<p>Minister can you give an undertaking to provide an audit report on the procurement of these contracts and present a report to the Parliament for our comments?</p>

<h2>Mr JIMMY UGURO <span>-Thank </span><span>you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the Member for Kabum for his good questions, regarding the school supplies and the commodity component of the school supply throughout the country.</span></h2>
<p>This has been an ongoing program which was initiated by the previous governments and we are continuing on it.</p>

<p>As I mentioned previously<span>, </span>this contract was awarded to a company in 2017, which was a two-phase contract which commenced work in 2017 and ended in 2022. But starting</p>
<p>this year, the Government has decided to allow the 22 provincial government with the engagement of SMEs in each province to consider taking the contract. We will do an advertisement shortly for all SMEs in all provinces to apply for the contracts.</p>
<p>As I stated in the annual report in 2021, that for the first time our government recognizes about 32 SMEs to take part in a contract totaling K27 million to the local distributors. A K74 million contract has been signed by the supplier and we have sub contracted 32 SMEs throughout the country to distribute the school materials throughout the provinces. And it's on going and few other provinces have yet to receive these supplies. But we are closely monitoring our local SME contractors which some have already delivered on the distribution and some not yet.</p>
<p>But, I have instructed the department to carry out an audit on it and I will make sure it's properly done. I have also instructed the department for an audit report on how these contracts have been awarded to these local distributors.</p>
