<h3>Promote Police Officers</h3>
<h3>Promote Police Officers</h3>
<h3>Mr GABRIEL KAPRIS <span>- </span><span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the Minister for Internal Security and I would like the Prime Minister to take note.</span></h3>
<p>As we all know Law and Order is a priority one to address and my short questions are in regard to the Police command and control structure <span>that </span>is being implemented by<span>.</span>the Department of Police throughout <span>the </span>country.</p>

<p>In <span>East Sepik, we have a problem </span>with <span>the command structure. The </span>Police <span>personnel that run the district have to be qualified officers at the Inspector or Senior </span>Inspector <span>ranks to be able to conduct police work in the respective districts. Maprik District</span></p>
<p>has been without a senior police inspector for some good years and it is now affecting the law and order situation.</p>
<p>We have regular hold-ups along the Sepik Highway right through to Nuku/Lumi and we have had a number of deaths but the Police personnel are not able to address the situation because they have an issue with the command control. A junior officer cannot give commands to the other officers because they are in the same rank and this has been affecting the performance of the Police personnel in my province.</p>
<p>Can the Minister look at promoting the officers who are qualified and are able to be promoted to Senior Inspector?</p>
<p>I want you to give special attention to Maprik as it has been without a Senior inspector for a long time.</p>
<p>Can the Minister look at other Police Personnel who have logged their applications to the Head Office, Human Resource Department, to be considered and appointments be made?</p>

<h3>09/02</h3>
<p>That is my question, Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>if the Minister can respond accordingly. I</p>
<p>will need answers and get a senior inspector to Maprik as soon as possible. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Mr PETER TSIAMALILI <span>- </span><span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. I also thank the member for Maprik for his valid questions. I think I will again re-emphasize on our Police Force that we are manpower stretched. At the same time I heard your question in particularly to the instance where you have witnessed an officer who is not performing his/her duties in terms of command and control. That is something at the operational level. The COP and our good Deputy Commissioner for operations including our ACPs in the provinces are strongly looking at and are reviewing. It is not just in Maprik, I think it is all across our country.</span></h2>

<p>In our recent discussions with our good governors there were some discussion about how we can empower the provinces a lot more which will empower the districts too. We are looking at some reforms that I would like to implement this year 2023 to address those gaps. Coming back to your situation in Maprik<span>, </span>my good Member, I will ask the Cop Commissioner to <span>look </span>into <span>it. </span>As it is<span>, </span>it is an operational matter where I <span>can </span>go directly to you and see how we can help you to better manage your law and order space.</p>
<p>I guess that is across all of us. Again, I will re-emphasize, the PPCs were specifically asked to have a dialogue or consultation with each district to develop plans. Those are some of the areas that you will have to highlight within your plans on the challenges that you are facing so it is reflected in your plan. I will emphasize again, that your plan is very important and in your plan you will highlight those challenges. The Member for Maprik I take heed of your question so I can talk directly with you to find solution for the situation that you are facing. Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
