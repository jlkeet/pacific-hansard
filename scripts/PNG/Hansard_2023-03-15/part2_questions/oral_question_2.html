<h3>Supplementary Question Closure of companies in PNG</h3>
<h3>Supplementary Question Closure of companies in PNG</h3>
<h3>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA <span>- </span><span>Mr Acting Speaker, recently, we have seen in</span></h3>
<p>the media the closure of many companies operating in PNG. Today, we have heard some good news from the Minister of Education. My concern is in regards to what he mentioned. He said, every three years they will look at those companies. My questions are as follows;</p>
<p>(1) Why can't they do the books every year, so that we make certain that we deal with the pertaining issues already with the current suppliers?</p>
<p>We have not addressed the issues that have been affecting us and we have gone ahead to deal with the new 32 SME groups.</p>
<p>(2) What assurance do we have, that these 32 will perform better than the previous group?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have existing companies who are capable of doing the job better. They have the capacity and yet we want to get the new 32 groups. We have reputable <span>companies </span>like Theodist, Moore Printing and Stationary<span>, </span>and Seeto Kui Stationary. They have been operating in <span>Papua </span>New Guinea for a <span>very </span>long time. They have been here since <span>Adam was </span>a boy.</p>

<p>Now we want to give it away to people who have got no experience at all.</p>
<h2>Mr GARRY JUFFA <span>- Point of Order! That is misleading. They were not here since Adam was a boy. I just want to clarify that.</span></h2>

<h2>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Honourable Governor, your point of order is out of order. Honourable Deputy Opposition Leader, do not make a statement to debate on what you are trying to ask. Get straight to your point.</span></h2>

<p><b>Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA </b><span>- </span>My question is; are these companies fit and proper to operate? Papua New Guinea needs to have consistent suppliers with reputation to operate<span>. </span>The millions that we are spending belongs to our people. Thank you<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<h2>Mr JIMMY UGURO <span>- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. In the past, there were only four contractors contracted to our four regions. Our government has now increased the contractors to 32 to operate in the country.</span></h2>
<p>We are monitoring and assessing them for their performance. As I have said, this is the last contract. From this year onwards, we are going to give opportunities to provinces. We encouraged those suppliers and the reputable contractors that you have mentioned, to also apply when the positions are advertised.</p>
<p>The Minister does not give out contracts. There is a process that we follow, and NEC always has the last say on a contract being given. Thank you<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
