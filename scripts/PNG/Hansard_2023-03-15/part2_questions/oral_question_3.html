<h3>Power project in Eastern Highlands Province</h3>
<h2><a>Power project in Eastern Highlands Province</a></h2>
<h2>Mr WILLIAM HAGAHUNO <span>- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the Minister for State Enterprises</span><span>.</span></h2>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the much talked about $890 million Ramu 2 Hydro-power Project is located in the Eastern Highlands Province. It is between my electorate, the Obura</p>
<p>- Wonenara electorate and your electorate. Our people have prepared and have been waiting for this project to materialised for the last 19 years.</p>

<p>This is a big project, and apart from the Ramu 1 Project, which my people have not been receiving much benefit from, this project proposes to give free equity to the Morobe Provincial Government and the landowners<span>, </span>as well as the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the landowners.</p>
<p>This has come as a relief to the landowners, who have been silently providing and generating power to develop Papua New Guinea. That is for the two Momase provinces and the five highlands provinces.</p>

<h3>04/02</h3>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, we have been waiting and this is one of five highlands</p>
<p>provinces and it is one of the single biggest projects. And as long as the Ramu river keeps flowing and as long as we continue to exist, this project will continue to bring benefits to this nation. My questions are;</p>
<p>When will PNG power sign the agreements with the Provincial Governments and the landowners for this very important project?</p>
<p>When will this important resource project Ramu2 Hydro-power project commence?</p>
<p>Why is this project taking too long?</p>
<p>I ask these questions because m people and the affected areas of Morobe Province especially those in Markham and those in Obura/Wonenara electorate have been anticipating and expecting this project. The government has not come clear as to when this project will commence<span>. </span>It is not fair to keep the people waiting when nothing is coming forth. Please I want answers for these questions.</p>

<h3>Mr WILLIAM DUMA <span>- </span><span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. Thank you, Member for Kainantu for asking these important questions. The Ramu2 Hydro-electric project is about</span></h3>
<p>$940 million Dollars so that would be about K3.2 billion and was initiated back in 2016. To date KCH which owns PNG Power has spent close to K60 million to conduct the normal hydrological engineering cost management analysis and all other studies associated with it<span>, </span>in getting a huge hydroelectric scheme off the ground.</p>

<p>It has taken a long time for the project components including PNG Power to develop this project. Thanks to the Government of Prime Minister Marape, who in late 2009 a Power Purchase Agreement was signed between the project proponents and PNG Power. In 2021 the Project Implementation Agreement was signed between the GovernorÂ­ General representing the state and the developer. This project has progressed to such a stage where on the 28 November 2022 this government authorized Treasury to issue a normal state guarantee. Not those guarantees that you find in other projects but the normal state guarantee that will protect the interest of the state to support this project.</p>
<p>And discussions are being held between KCH, PNG Power and the department of Treasury for the issue of the state guarantee. Once the state guarantee is issued it will pave the way for the project proponents to reach a financial closure. Once that is done then they will negotiate with the Wafi/Golpu Mine to sign an off-take agreement that will underpin the economics of this project.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is owned by this country and it is important that we on both sides of this House support this project. It is a project where the long-suffering landowners of Eastern highlands and their provincial government are the people who have been supplying power from the Yonki-Hydro Dam. They have not received many benefits from the government for over many years since the operating this project in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>This time around, this government under the leadership of Prime Minister Marape has recognized the contribution made by the people of eastern highlands and it has decided to allow in addition free equity to be given to the eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the shareholders for 20 per cent of that project. Another 20 per cent equity to the people of Morobe who then will host the Wafi<span>/</span>Golpu.</p>
<p>This is the first time any government has recognized the people contributing to power through the hydro-electric project.</p>

<h3>05<span>/</span>02</h3>
<p>And in addition the government has about Kl0 million in development grants for</p>
<p>the affected landowners. So, very soon once the guarantee has been signed, I can assure you the good Member that representatives from KCH and PNG Power will then approach the Morobe Provincial Government and the affected landowners, the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the landowners to sign their project benefit agreements<span>.</span></p>
<p>So Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>it is a build, owned and operated transfer agreement that will enable the developer who will be spending about K3.2 billion to recover his investment and then transfer ownership to PNG which will own only 60 per cent and then the Morobe and Eastern Highlands Provincial governments and landowners will own the balance.</p>
<p>It<span>'</span>s a first project where provincial governments and the affected landowners and the state will own joint-ownership<span>. </span>Hopefully it will pave way for future projects to follow that precedence where our people are acti<span>v</span>e participants in very important resource projects like this<span>.</span></p>

<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure the good Member that we are nearly there<span>, </span>it<span>'</span>s not too late. As soon as we have signed the guarantee and project laws has been reached, then</p>
<p>construction  hopefully  will commence.  And the landowners  and the provincial governments will be invited to participate in those spin-off activities while waiting for the construction to take place. And then once ownership has then been transferred, they will then be equity owners, free-carry the equity after 25 years.</p>
<p>So I can assure the good member that we are doing everything we can to progress this very important resource project. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<h2>Mr GARRY JUFFA <span>- </span><span>Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation perhaps after question time as I am mindful that members may want to ask questions. I stood yesterday but I was not recognised so today I am asking ifl can be given the opportunity to do that. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</span></h2>

<h2>Mr ACTING <span>SPEAKER-Honourable Governor of East Sepik, I will ask you to raise your question but before that let me respond to the Honourable Governor of Northern. I will direct the Clerk to report to you and you can inform him on your matter and we will fit you into the schedule of the session.</span></h2>

<h2>Mr ALLAN BIRD <span>- Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, my question is directed to the hardworking Minister for State Enterprises.</span></h2>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this is in relation to the constant blackouts and the issues affecting PNG Power Limited. To preface my question, over the last couple of months<span>, </span>we have been experiencing series blackouts all across the country<span>. </span>And whilst we have been experiencing blackouts for the last 15 years or so, it's actually become worse in recent times.</p>
<p>I think Papua New Guineans everywhere including in my province of East Sepik have been complaining quite loudly and it's only fair that these questions be put to the Minister on the Floor so that he can explain to the people of Papua New Guinea, what the issues are and how quickly they can be fixed.</p>

<h2><a>06/02</a></h2>
<p>Now my understanding from East Sepik is that our current generators have been</p>
<p>hired from someone<span>, </span>perhaps 15 years ago. So PPL is paying for the hire of these machines to supply power to East Sepik. I understand also that in other parts of the country there are private power suppliers and these private power suppliers sell power to PNG Power at a</p>
<p>rate of about 33 toea per kilowatt. PNG Power then on sells the power for domestic uses at around 60 to 70 toea per kilowatt and to commercial users at 90 toea per kilowatt. So it enjoys a healthy growth margin, from what's it's supposed to pay and from what it on sells. From my own recent investigations, I could be wrong and stand corrected in the</p>
<p>House, is that PNG Power currently owes all its suppliers approximately K600 - K800 million in debts which it is unable to pay? One of those suppliers is currently in Court seeking restitution from PNG Power.</p>
<p>I want to also go on the record and appreciate the work of the Minister for State Enterprises in the last few weeks where he directed Kumul Holdings which is the owner of PPL to pay for the fuel to keep our provinces running even though they are still rationing power.</p>
<p>Now the Minister stated just recently in answer to another question <span>t</span>hat this</p>
<p>company is owned by the people of Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Provide Financial Report of PPL</p>
<p>Being that as it is<span>, </span>can the Minister furnish a financial report to this House so that all members and the people of Papua New Guinea can appreciate the financial position of PPL?</p>
<p>I understand that Kumul Holdings is trying to build up the balance sheet of PPL so that it can sell it some point at a profit. Now I want to know how long that process is going to take<span>.</span></p>
<p>Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</p>
<p>If PPL currently owes K800 million or so to its suppliers<span>, </span>how long will it take for it to trade out of that difficulty and how long will it take for it to build up the value<span>, </span>and therefore we should be able to sell it a profit.</p>
<p>I would like a commitment on this Floor this morning from the good Minister to tell the people of Papua New Guinea how long it will take. Give us a time frame<span>; </span>is it going to be six months, one year or five years? How long will it take before the people of Papua New Guinea can expect the reliable power supplies that they pay for? I also understand that 30 per cent of power produced by PPL is stolen by certain individuals.</p>
<p>What is PPL doing to recover this power that is being stolen? What kind of contracts is PPL doing with whoever it is that is currently draining the life out of this count<span>r</span>y?</p>
<p>Could the Minister provide to this House a list of all the contracts in the interests of transparency and accountability so that we and the people of Papua New Guinea can</p>
<p>know? We all want to understand what is affecting PNG Power, what can be done to fix it and how soon can they be fixed.</p>
<p>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p><b>Mr WILLIAM DUMA-Thank </b>you Mr Acting Speaker I would like to thank the good Governor of East Sepik Province for raising these very important questions. Of course, everyone has been complaining about PNG Power. I can say that we have no quick answers and no quick solutions to this important national asset of ours. I<span>'</span>ll try to answer some of those questions, starting with the last question.</p>

<h2><a>07/02</a></h2>
<p>In relation to the kind of contracts that PNG Power has, usually under the law every</p>
<p>year it submits through Cabinet what is known as annual operating plan and that usually contains schedule of contracts that entered into by PNG Power and of course the financial situation<span>. </span>And of course, I will now seek Cabinet's approval following process then in due course to present a statement to this Parliament about this very important national-owned company<span>.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is definitely not on sale now, we are not going to sell this important company through a fire-sale which will result in us in getting no value for an important national asset. We have the power<span>, </span>mechanism, and controls to work together to tum this company around, which have been allowed over many years not the last five years or this government took office since 2019 for this country to be in the stage where it is now. Over the many years, we've allowed this company to go down this pathway, we are not really proud of a company like that.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>yes, PNG Power owes various creditors substantial amounts of money; two of them have actually taken PNG power to court. And I can announce to this Parliament that we've reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by our people<span>. </span>They recognized that their own national-owned company is in trouble and they have agreed to allow PNG Power time to trade its way out these difficulties.</p>
<p>It is not a company that can be easily sold at fire-sales just to get out of a mess like the one it is in now. So<span>, </span>they have allowed PNG Power to trade its way and has been making payments.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, so my short answer is, in the immediate term and even in the near future PNG Power will not be sold at that fire-sales prices where our people will not get a decent return on this company and its assets<span>.</span></p>
<p>Going back to the case of East Sepik and particularly Wewak town, it is known as a sea center where PNG Power does not make any profit. That is not the only town there are many others who are regarded as sea center, which PNG Power continues to try its best to ensure that at least some power eventhough there's no return on PNG Power investments.</p>
<p>And for those of us who maybe thinking that the way out for PNG Power is to transfer ownership of those centers to them, I can tell this Parliament that the provincial governments will come running back to this government for funding because most of them are not making money. And PNG Power has been providing services because of community service obligations.</p>
<p>And we have had difficult with reliability of power mainly from Puma who continues to bully us using its dominant position in this country. It is something that we all working together to make sure that we have secure and reliable power supplies<span>. </span>It's an ongoing work in progress. I admitted there are problems, I will never deny it but this sort of things take time actually to resolve and manage.</p>
<p>In relation to the issue of about 30 per cent of the power being stolen, yes, there have been some instances where our own employees of PNG Power have colluded with the outsiders to steal power. And on many occasions when they are having been discovered and found they have been terminated on the spot.</p>
<p>It is a heavily unionist company compared to the others. The presence of union comprised of about 700 members employees of PNG Power, you wouldn't believe it. So<span>, </span>you may have read recently that PNG Power had to go to court to obtain that restraining order to prevent the union from calling a strike and the National Court has granted that Order. We are using that as an opportunity to stabilize the operation of the company.</p>
<p>As I said earlier in this Parliament by December this year<span>, </span>we should have some results which we all can be proud of<span>. </span>It is not a company where we<span>'</span>ve ignored, we've invested a lot of time, we have worked on the many issues, there's a lot of literature on this company telling us what to do<span>.</span></p>
<p>Very soon with the approval of the Prime Minister<span>, </span>there is a rescue package that has been proposed to Cabinet. Cabinet should be able to approve it. Thank the good Governor for asking those questions.</p>
<h3>08/02</h3>
<p>I am not sure if I am answering all the questions but in general, my answer to his</p>
<p>question is yes, it is a problem Company but we are not sitting back and allowing it to go down further, instead we are doing everything we can to rescue it and turn it around. In areas where there are key centers that are having issues, we have asked Australians to help us by paying for the cost of solar power. Recently, in Darn, PNGSDP and PNG Power came to an arrangement where our people in Darn can be able to enjoy reliable power through solar power. We are also looking at supplying power to Wewak through the installation of a solar power system but the challenge for us now is to identify suitable State-owned land which we can then use to restore the much-needed solar power. The solar power system will then be able to complement the energy that is provided by the diesel generators.</p>
<p>Lastly, Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power had an arrangement with a company, I should not mention its name because it's a company which had a dominant position in providing diesel-powered gensets to PNG Power. We have recognized that they were overcharging, there was collusion between employees and that company and we have slowly phased them away, so as soon as we have our own money we will then be able to buy our own generators.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have assured the good Governor and the people of Papua New Guinea that this government is doing everything to make sure this company comes back to life.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
