<h3>Status of the Economy</h3>
<h3>Status of the Economy</h3>
<h3>Mr PETER O'NEILL <span>- </span><span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, and thank you for giving me this opportunity to ask a few questions to our good treasurer, the Honourable Ian LingÂ­ Stuckey, on a few things about the economy</span><span>.</span></h3>
<p>In recent times, Mr Acting Speaker, the treasurer has announced that our economy is doing very well. He has projected that the economy will grow by 3.5 per cent this year when rest of the world is expected to grow by 1.<span>7 </span>per cent.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I just want to ask the treasurer these questions:</p>
<p>(1) Where is this growth coming from? Because the rest of the country and the economy is struggling to perform, businesses are shutting down, and most of our exports</p>
<p>- coffee, cocoa, fisheries, forestry are all on the decline. So<span>, </span>what is driving the growth that you are saying that we are experiencing in this country?</p>

<h3>11/02</h3>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I feel that<span>, </span>this is in my view<span>, </span>the growth is driven by LNG</p>
<p>exports<span>. </span>When LNG exports are enjoying a very high global prices as a result it is seen as PNG economy is doing well<span>, </span>but I can assure that the economy is certainly not doing well. A lot of people are unemployed and of course that leads me to the second question.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>in recent times the Treasurer had announced that they have created over 10 thousand jobs over the last three years. Now<span>, </span>can the Treasurer inform this House and the country which sectors have delivered those 10 thousand jobs<span>, </span>whether they are in Fisheries or Forestry or Agriculture; please inform this Honourable House so that we can know where the growth is because suddenly on the ground<span>, </span>a lot of people are finding it hard to find new <span>j</span>obs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I can assure you that people<span>, </span>especially our school leavers who are not properly skilled are facing a lifetime of unemployment and that means that in their life time they might never get a job. So, Mr Treasurer, can you please inform this Honourable House about where this job growth that we are going to experience<span>.</span></p>

<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the third question is about expenditure and the Treasurer has proudly stated over many locations that this government is making record spendings. Record spend<span>i</span>ng in this year is projected to be about K24.5 billion<span>, </span>of course you are saying that the record spending will deliv<span>e</span>r the growth but<span>, </span>Mr Act<span>i</span>ng Speak<span>e</span>r<span>, </span>those r<span>e</span>cords spending is not helping strugg<span>l</span>ing families<span>. </span>The household assistance package of K<span>l</span>.1 billion that the Treasurer had announced is not helping families to put food on the table<span>. </span>It</p>
<p>is only assisting fuel prices to be subsidized for people who own cars and those who are able to afford to have those luxury items. It is certainly not putting food on the table for young Papua New Guinean families and many of them who are struggling to even have a job. So, Mr Acting Speaker, can the Treasurer tell us how this assistance program will assist our families throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the other question that I want to ask is about inflation<span>. </span>The Treasurer proudly announces on many occasions that the inflation in our country is at 6.3 per cent which is much lower than average long-term inflation of about <span>7 </span>per cent. That's what he's announcing.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, but the real prises in the store goods is a very different story Mr Treasurer. In 2019, the price of bully beef was at Kl 1.90 and today it is about K20. So, Mr Acting Speaker, <span>I </span>don't know where the calculation of inflation <span>is </span>coming from and <span>I </span>know I've got confidence in our public servants at our National Statistical Office but the reality on the ground is different.</p>
<p>How is the Treasurer developing this tragedy to address inflationary issues in the country? Why <span>I </span>ask this question is because, Mr Treasurer, for many Central Banks around the world to curb the raising of inflation around the world, the interest rates have been increased around many global economies which is trying to curb the inflation increases. Whereas in PNG, the strategy adopted by the Central Bank and Treasury is to have a steady and unchanged interest rate regime. Now, if you maintain an interest rates at that level, how are you going to curb inflation from continuing to grow? So, Mr Acting Speaker, that is my question on inflation and interest rates.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, my sixth question that I want to ask is; now the Treasurer has announced publicly that he has allowed International Monetary Fund to come in and introduce a program in PNG after 20 years. Now, reading through, we are going to borrow an additional K3.25 billion over the next 3 years.</p>

<p><a>12/02</a></p>
<p>Now, before I ask questions in relation to the International Monetary <span>Fund, </span>the</p>
<p>Treasurer <span>in his statement has confirmed that last year in December, he borrowed Kl.8 billion from the Australian Government. This year he will borrow another Kl .5 billion in addition to the K3.25 billion that will be borrowed from IMF.</span></p>


<p>With all these borrowing, Mr Acting Speaker, what will be our debt to GDP ratio? I think your estimates of 53 per cent for the year end will be surpassed thinking that it will</p>
<p>go up close to 60 per cent. Mr Treasurer, if you can inform this honourable House the debt to GDP ratio that you are going to achieve as per your budget estimates of 2023.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, with the Treasurer borrowing from IMF; can he confirm that we are probably the third or fourth country in the world to ask IMF for help after Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Now K3.2 billion over the next three years comes with conditions and this is not an assistance to support a budget Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
<p>Can he confirm that this is a bail out because our economy is struggling to meet revenue targets you have set Mr Treasurer? Mr Treasurer can you confirm also that the conditions that IMF has put which is on the schedule that you have presented to this House Mr Acting Speaker. These conditions include; (1) is that they will make changes to the <span>Central Bank Act.</span></p>
<p>Can you confirm or deny that these changes will include what they call flexible foreign exchange policy?</p>
<p>Does that mean that they will review the valuation ofkina and are going to devalue our kina?</p>
<p>The second issue is that; they are saying that new tax measures from IMF and its on your attachment, Mr Acting Speaker. This House needs clarity and detail as to why you have an obligation to this honourable House and the country.</p>
<p>What are the new tax measures that we are talking about? Are we going to put more burden on our people and are you going to increase salaries and wages tax? Are you going to increase company tax and what are the new measures?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, why I asked all these questions is because they are also proposing that we need to restructure our public service machinery. And that's the third condition that they are putting. How many more people are you going to terminate in the public service machinery so that you can have savings to fund your budget?</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, that is what they are trying to achieve. When you read what they have put to you then you will understand. They touched on staffing and remuneration guidelines, which they are referring to people who are struggling on the street to feed their families.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, these borrowings come with very serious conditions</p>


<p><span>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- </span>Honourable <span>Member, I </span>will interrupt <span>your </span>questions. Our question time has lapsed and you have raised many important questions already. Can you get straight to the question and let <span>the </span>Minister respond?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Mr PETER O'NEILL </b><span>- </span>Mr Acting Speaker, I will finish shortly but all these questions are touching the economy and everybody's life in this country<span>. </span>We are talking about eight to ten million people and how they are going to survive when all these economic conditions come.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>IMF is renowned around the world.</p>

<p><b>Mr Don Polye-Point </b>of Order! I think for ordinary members of Parliament<span>, </span>to ask such detailed questions like this is another issue<span>. </span>But for someone who was the former Prime Minister of a Government before that created some of these problems, he should tell what programs did he put in place to address the same issues because we are trying to solve the problem that he created<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>(Member<span>s </span>interjecting)</p>

<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Honourable Member your Point of Order is out of order. I have asked the member to ask his questions. I will allow him to summaries his questions</span><span>.</span></p>

<p><a>13/02</a></p>
<p><b>Mr PETER O'NEILL </b><span>- </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I know the good Member for Kandep</p>
<p>loves to intervene and talk<span>, </span>but he should realize that the last time IMF was in this country, both of us were still in government. That was over 20 years ago and our peop<span>l</span>e suffered from that. When the Somare Government was in power<span>, </span>we have never dealt with IMF because of these kind of conditions<span>.</span></p>
<p>We survived without IMF so learn to live within your means. What we are trying to tell you, is to provide us with proper details so that we can have a good debate about issues that are confronting our nation. Thank you<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p>


<p><b>Mr </b><span>J</span><b>AMES MARAPE </b>- Point of Order! Mr Acting Speaker, <span>I </span>appreciate you manag<span>i</span>ng questions on th<span>e </span>Floor of <span>P</span>a<span>rl</span>iament. <span>M</span>emb<span>e</span>rs of <span>P</span>arliament<span>, a</span>nd esp<span>e</span>ciall<span>y </span>senior members<span>, </span>must not use question t<span>i</span>me to make statements.</p>
<p>The former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia wants to debate on the Treasurer's statement from yesterday<span>. </span>I will be re-opening<span>_</span>thi-s with a statement in-reply<span>. </span>That will be the opportunity for him to make his statement.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, please control members of Parliament who discuss and use question without notices as opportunity to make statements. I ask members that if you are men enough to ask questions, or point to a matter that is of national importance<span>, </span>be men enough to sit through and listen to all responses. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>(Members interjecting)</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER </b><span>- </span>Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia<span>, </span>resume your seat and I will make a ruling on your question.</p>

<p>(Members interjecting)</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING </b>SPEAKER<span>-</span>Honourable members<span>, </span>upon advice<span>, </span>the questions that the Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia have asked, is before Parliament. And whatever statements that relates to a bill that is before Parliament<span>, </span>ministerial statements, would not be raised on question.</p>
<p>Therefore<span>, </span>I made the ruling that the Minister will not respond to the questions asked by the Member for Ialibu-Pangia<span>. </span>The honourable Member's questions can be reserved for when the debate on this Bill comes.</p>

<p>(Members interjecting)</p>

<p><b>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY </b>- Point of Order! Thank you<span>, </span>Mr Acting Speaker. I understand that the honourable Member had asked his questions within question time. I should be allowed to respond to it, even though, they are very convoluted.</p>
<p>I would want to address this matter because it is of national importance and because he has misled this Parliament and the people of this country.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I need to correct him.</p>


<p>(Member<span>s </span>interjecting)</p>
<h2>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Minister, upon advice on your point of order. I have already made a statement that the matter is before Parliament; No:27 and it will come on during this session.</span></h2>

<h2><a>14/02</a></h2>
<p>Therefore, I can allow for you to explain on that, when the bill notice is called, I</p>
<p>can give you time to respond to the question asked by the Member.</p>
<p>Right now, I cannot allow you to answer because according to the Standing Orders, we cannot debate on that or respond to a question on that. So, when the bill is called, I will allow for you to make your statement in response to the question.</p>

<h2>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY <span>- </span><span>So to clarify, you would like me to correct his very wrongful assertions that he raised this morning during the response to my statement.</span></h2>

<h2>Mr ACTING SPEAKER- <span>Honorable Minister, please resume your seat as I have already made my ruling and I will give you time when this matter is called before Parliament.</span></h2>
