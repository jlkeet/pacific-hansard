<h2>Mr GARRY JUFFA <span>(Northern) - I seek leave of Parliament to make a personal explanation.</span></h2>

<p>Leave granted.</p>


<p><b>Mr GARRY JUFFA </b>- The issues that I wish to make an explanation about are in relation to news items that were run in <span>The National </span>newspaper on Friday 10<span>th </span>March 2023. These are misleading news items; false reports and I wish to make some clarifications in relation to these<span>. </span>Whilst we all appreciate the media and the very important work that they do<span>. </span>The hard work that many of our good journalists perform<span>, </span>they have a responsibility to report the truth because they are in a very serious position of power whereby they manage information and thus influence perception.</p>
<p>This is not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and worldwide because we are now part of the global community and all the information and news items are reported are carried far and wide throughout this world. On March 10, 2023, <i>The National </i>newspaper ran a front-page news item that read <span>'</span><i>School Girls abducted' </i>in a very highly sensational manner and it reported that four girls attending the Popondetta Secondary School were abducted at the St Franciscan Anglican Brothers' retreat at the CTC ward in Northern, Police say. That what it stated. The fact of the matter is and after investigations by my office, the administration and the police<span>, </span>we found that no such incident had occurred. No girls were abducted, there however was a very minor incident where students who were at the retreat were accosted by one man and he was chased away by the staff at the church.</p>
<p>Yet, <i>The National, </i>a foreign-owned newspaper just like the other daily decided to run this report without carrying out its work with due diligence. For us in the province it is quite disturbing and something that we would like the newspaper to correct appropriately. The other item also a false report which they reported is the item in relation to my election petition<span>.</span></p>
<p>In that particular item the headline read; <span>'Governor </span><i>to stand trial' </i>and then it reported that the Northern Governor Garry Juffa will stand trial on three counts of bribery allegations against him and the election petition filed by his contender Jean Parkop.</p>

<p>15/02</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is; this is a petition that is going to trial. I am not going on</p>
<p>trial. I am not accused of bribery and in fact three persons have been named in this petition or alleged to have committed bribery, I'm not one of those three persons<span>. </span>This newspaper decided to report this fake news. It is now reported not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and in the world. And all of this is also reported online using the internet in breach of our cybercrime laws.</p>
<p>The third fake report or false report is a letter to the editor. This is something that I would like us to seriously consider, letters to the editor contain opinions of people, sometimes making serious allegations that are not facts but are printed by <span>the </span>newspapers as if they are factual. And I thought it's important that I make this clarification here, especially for the print media because they have done this on a number of occasions.</p>

<p>In fact, just yesterday, they ran a front page story in relation to a statement that the <span>Treasurer </span>made and he answered the question at a high level and from his perspective as</p>
<p>the Treasurer. He's not mandated to table specific programs on behalf of other ministerial port folios that since taking office three and half years ago. This government has increased the capital budget from K4.6 billion to K9.7 billion doubling funds for critical and national projects that directly create jobs.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I ask our media to make a conscious and concerted effort to be factual in your reporting. Report the facts. Don't mislead our people. Don't create negative perceptions based on lies, innuendos, rhetoric, without facts, without evidence. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
