<p>Motion (by <span>Mr Rainbo Paita) </span>agreed to -</p>
<p>That Mr Theo Pelgen be appointed member of the Permanent Parliamentary Committee On Culture and Tourism.</p>

<p><span>Mr RAINBO PAITA </span><span>- </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>thank you. I would like to thank Members on both sides of the House for sitting through this session. As I stated earlier I</p>

<p>noticed some Members wanted to debate on the issue of our economy but the swearing in of the Governor General is a pressing issue that is upon us tomorrow so I would like to move that we adjourn Parliament to tomorrow at 10.a.m</p>
