<p>Sitting suspended.</p>

<p>The Acting Speaker again took the Chair at 10.55 a<span>.</span>m., and invited the Member for Nawae, <b>Honourable Theo Pelgen </b>to say Prayers<span>.</span></p>

<p>'We entered this world as equals, we are small, we are naked<span>, </span>we are pure of sin and hate. We cannot be judged as our souls have not been spoiled<span>. </span>As we grow, we are spoiled with the goodness and with the temptation of biting that forbidden fruit. Who knows for what reasons are these temptations<span>, </span>good or evil<span>, </span>right or wrong, but only ourselves. We are in this House to worship<span>, </span>praise, teach and learn.</p>
<p>We have been appointed by our people to become the servants to deliver to them what is required. There is only one true spiritual judge that is always looking down upon us and the same judge to greet us at the mighty gates as we walk hand in hand as equals.</p>
<p>Once again, we enter this new world and we can only wish that these gates are open for us to travel into the next phase of our journey in spirit<span>, </span>accepted or forgiven of any wrong doing so help us God. Amen.'</p>
