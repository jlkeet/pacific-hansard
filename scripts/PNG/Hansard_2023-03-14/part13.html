<h3>Tolukuma Mine Closure Mr CASMIRO AIA-Thank you Acting Speaker. Thank you for recognizing the</h3>
<p>people of Goilala to speak in this Honourable House.</p>
<p>By way of background, before I direct my question to the Minister for Mining. Tolukuma is a mine that for some unknown reason changes ownership from time to time. The ownership must have been changed four to five times.</p>
<p>Before petroleum came in and it was given to Asidoko and now the mme was unofficially or deliberately or I don't know by mistake or by design shut down. The future of the mine is not in the clear visibility.</p>
<p>In recent times there was a K20 million promised to the land owners. All my people flocked down to the city and have been here for almost some months now and they keep on congregating at APEC Park at the back of the Post Office along Angau Drive to see whether that money is going to be made available<span>.</span></p>
<p>Can the good Minister, clearly state the status of this K20 million that was promised to the people? Number two clearly demarcate or specify the purpose of that money. Is it for the employees who are being laid off or is it for the landowners? There needs to be some understanding, so they are not wasting their time walking down<span>. </span>We walk for five days to get here until God will, we'll build our roads. My people they have walked all the way here and they have been here for some months now.</p>
<p>Can the good minister for the sake of my people, provide some clarity regarding this money so my people can go back to the village and hide in the bush? Thank you<span>, </span>Deputy Speaker.</p>

<h3>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Honourable Minister for Mining</span><span>.</span></h3>

<p><span>Sir ANO PALA </span><span>- </span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and thank you Member for Goilala for that question. Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>I am not aware of this K20 million committed for the</p>
<p>landowners or for the mine but I will look into it. I will find out what was this K20 million for and advise on the status of the funds. I understand that the Tolukuma mine is not closed. When a mine is closed there is a mine closure procedure one has to go through and I don't think that the mine closure procedures has been activated<span>. </span>This is because of the status of the mine which I think was not being closed. I think the mine is in transition at the moment. It has passed on from one investor to another and it appears very clear that the mine at the moment is not profitable. That is why investors are reluctant to put in more money.</p>

<p><a>10/01</a></p>
<p>The main reason why the mine is not profitable is because of the fly in and fly out</p>
<p>arrangements. That is<span>, </span>operation is conducted by way of helicopter flight and if you are going in and out by helicopters<span>, </span>it<span>'</span>s a very<span>, </span>very expensive process. But there are also some investors looking at the way forward but that most important infrastructure that we need to build in that area is a road from Moresby all the way to Goilala<span>. </span>And that is the only way that mine can be profitable<span>.</span></p>
<p>So, it is something that the government will look at down the line because I feel that there is a very big potential for that mine but we have to make it viable. And the only way we can do it is to build that road to encourage businesses to go in. At the moment the only way to go in is fly iri and fly out and the businesses are not very encouraged to spend the money. So that's where we are on that mine and I<span>'</span>m just hoping that we will find a way.</p>
<p>I<span>'</span>ve just recently received an offer and I will be talking to you and governor; our good governor to take up this offer from one of the big mining companies in the country to do scoping work free of charge. So, I will be referring it to you and the governor if you are in agreement, you can invite this company to go and do the scoping work so that you will be able to then put the figures before the government for us to consider but the main question for the K20 million, Member for Goilala, I will go back and look at where these funds are<span>, </span>if they are there and if they have been committed, and I will advise you on the status. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER </b>- Honourable members, we have two more minutes for question time but seems there is no questions to be asked<span>, </span>so I'll ask the Minister for Treasury to make his Ministerial Statement. Honourable Minister.</p>
<p><a>MINISTRY OF TREASURY -ECONOMIC UPDATE ON IMPLEMENTING THE VISION - MINISTERIAL STATEMENT - MOTION TO TAKE NOTE OF PAPER</a></p>

<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY <span>(Kavieng -Minister for Treasury) - Mr Acting Speaker, the Marape/Rosso Government is an open and transparent government. This means keeping our Parliament and our people informed of key economic developments. I am pleased to provide another economic update this afternoon. There are many economic issues facing our country and time is short and I will focus on key international budget and inflation issues since the 2023 Budget Statement.</span></p>
<p>On an international update, Mr Acting Speaker, the international outlook at the time of the 2023 budget was gloomy and uncertain. As expected, the World Bank's January economic outlook documents slashed its global growth outlook from three to one -</p>

<p><a>11/01</a></p>
<p>The World Bank, January economic outlook document, slashed its global growth</p>
<p>outlook from 3 to 1.7 per cent for this year. This is the third worst growth performance in the world economy in the last 30 years. And 2020 was also one of the three worst years. The world bank estimates growth in PNG will be .8 of a per cent less in 2022 and 2023 this year and forecast just six months ago.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we had built much of this into our growth forecasts and as previously stated our Papua New Guinea economy is doing so much better than most other countries. Indeed, the new World Bank forecast for PNG of real growth of 3.5 per cent is still more than double the world average. Despite this bad global news there is no need to panic. The Marape Government was able to steer our country's economy through the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papua New Guinea will weather the latest storm much better than most other countries. And once again we will be responsive, responsible and caring.</p>
<p>On our 2023 Budget Implementation status PNG's financial accounts for 2023 opened on January 9<span>th </span>2023. Now it is time to implement our historic 2023 Budget. This year we will see the highest level of government expenditure in our country's history K24,567 million all of this within a responsible program of budget repair and reconstruction which will see Papua New Guinea return to a budget surplus target date of 2027 and the start of reducing our country's debt.</p>
<p>Let me highlight some key <span>expenditure </span>priorities as we implement the P<span>ANGU </span>platform from the 2022 <span>Election. Infrastructure </span>expenditure will increase from <span>K4668 </span>million</p>
<p>in 2018 to K9796 million this year more than double<span>. </span>This is also being delivered with more local content and more local job opportunities. Within that capital budget of K9796 million, PNG's Public Investment Program or PIP component has increased from K2041 million in 2018 to K6615 million this year as I mentioned a little earlier during question time<span>.</span></p>
<p>This is an extraordinary increase of over 220 per cent. The Marape/Rosso Government is the infrastructure government. Responsible investments in physical capital to support growth in our economy. We are also supporting major increases <span>in </span>human capital spending. Our health funding will reach K2311 million this year, a 34 per cent increase since 2021<span>. </span>Education will receive K1650 million, a 51 per cent increase from 2021.</p>
<p>Law and justice will reach Kl,787 million, a 41 per cent increase from 2021 and this is supporting the police recruitment campaign<span>, </span>wasn't it great<span>...</span></p>

<p>12/01</p>
<p>This is supporting the police recruitment campaign. Wasn't it great to see so many of</p>
<p>our <span>young </span>people <span>applying </span>in January this year<span>, </span>over 80 000 applicants<span>.</span></p>
<p>We <span>have committed increased salary funding for a steady five percent increase in the numbers of teachers, doctors and nurses through to 2027 and then a 10 percent increase each year after that. Just have a look at our 13-years plan, making sure that our new schools and hospitals will have the necessary stuff.</span></p>
<p>The economic sector will receive K989 million a 46 percent increase from 2021 with a much greater focus on supporting our farmers and agriculture and SMEs.</p>
<p>Funding <span>for provinces will increase from K50138 a 30 percent increase from 2021, giving our good governors more resources to implement their key activities at the decentralised level.</span></p>
<p>The major challenge for the 2023 Budget is now ensuring that this record level of funding is spent well and benefits our people. There is much hard work ahead for all of us to ensure that this occur.</p>
<p>The 2023 Budget is being delivered with a Budget repair of a Kl billion reduction in the deficit.</p>
<p>A low-cost financing strategy which has lowered debt interest costs from 6.5 percent to</p>
<p>4.2 percent<span>, </span>thereby generating interest, cost savings of <span>K1353 </span>million in 2023 alone<span>. </span><span>All in the context of a </span>tough global <span>environment</span><span>, </span><span>with </span>many <span>countries expected </span>to <span>fall </span>into recession whilst<span>, </span>PNG grows at double the world rate.</p>
<p>Our country is doing better than most, because of the good economic policies of the Marape/Rosso Government, guided by the Pangu Party vision of leaving no district or person behind. Do not believe the lies of social media or some of those sitting on the other side.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the 2023 Household assistance package, despite the good economic news looking forward, we must remember that PNG has frankly some of the worst social indicators in the region. Too much poverty, and living standards for most of our people are simply not high enough. This Government knows the cost-of-living pressures faced by families around the nation and for the first time in PNG history, the Marape/Rosso Government developed a package to help some of those pressures with a K587 million in 2022 and K590 million in 2023. A total of Kl 177million in assistance to our households and our people. No other Government has ever delivered such a household assistance package.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased that he IRC has written to all employers with new tax schedules applied from the pt of January 2023. <span>This </span>is providing tax cuts of up to K63 per fortnight for all those earning K20 000.00 or more for 2023.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the dailies our NASFUND estimates will benefit over 98 per cent of their members.</p>

<p>13<span>/</span>01</p>
<p>Most of them in the younger age group. From the pt of January this year we are also</p>
<p>continuing for another six months the removal of all excised taxes on fuel. This will save 61 toea per litre of petrol costs and 23 toea per litre of diesel costs. From the 1<span>st </span>of January this year we are also covering the cost of social project fees in 2023. For example, a family no longer has to pay the project fee of K220 for each children attending secondary schools. This program helps ensure that relief gets out to the furthest parts of our country. The cost of living relief is greatest for those most in need. Those families with the most mouths to feed while letting their children attend school rather than work in the gardens.</p>
<p>Responsible, caring, budgeting the Marape/Rosso Government supporting families in ways never before experienced in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>On inflation, the National Statistics Office (NSO) has released its estimates of inflation for the September quarter of 2022<span>. </span>The NSO estimates inflation of those three months was 1 per cent, this is half the inflation rate of 2 per cent for the three months of the June quarter of <span>2022.</span></p>
<p>Mr <span>Acting </span>Speaker, <span>the Government </span>keeps a very close eye on inflation<span>. </span>It knows that some key items have had <span>very </span>high price increases. This is <span>why we </span>introduced a 1177 million</p>
<p>household assistance to help deal with some of these costs of living pressures. The good news is that the overall current level of inflation of 6.3 per cent is below PNG's long term average rate of 7 per cent. The Treasury and the Central Bank along with the international institutions are predicting the inflation rate will be below 6 per cent this year and fall towards 5 per cent next year.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, this means that we are not expecting high inflation this year. Once again, beware the funded scab campaigned by social media and the so called PNG empty tank. These inflation figures are gathered by the NSO across many areas of the country and go into detail on over 120 items and services. As a responsible government we will continue to closely monitor inflation levels. If things get worse, we will look at options to do more within the context of sustainable budget repair.</p>
<p>Our international engagement, Mr Acting Speaker, one of the great strengths of the Marape/Rosso Government is <span>its </span>willingness to engage constructively <span>and </span>honestly with the international community. <span>I </span>have had the honor to have had three good discussions with Australian Treasurer <span>Jim </span>Charmers already in 2022 and 2023. These discussions include shared economic and trade opportunities such as labor mobility and good cheap financing options.</p>
<p>On the international monetary fund program, Mr Acting Speaker, I am pleased to foreshadow to this Parliament that PNG stands ready to enter into a funded program with the international monetary fund or the IMF. Our first program in nearly 20 years. We commenced this partnership back in 2019. We knew the IMF were critical for restoring international confidence in PNG's economic management. We saw then as a source transparency and</p>

<p>14/01</p>
<p>We knew the IMF were critical, for restoring international confidence, in PNG's economic management. We saw them, as a source of transparency and expertise<span>. </span>This engagement<span>, </span>was also important, for the Kl .2 billion, in cheap funding they provided to us in 2020, to deal with the then 20 per cent fall in our revenues, due to the COVID-19 pandemics.</p>
<p>All countries were also assisted by the IFM, with an increase in quotas in 2021. We now stand ready, To engage in a program, that will likely contribute K310 million or possibly K614 million this year, to support our Budget repair, and a total ofup to K3,250 million over the next three years.</p>
<p>Importantly<span>, </span>agreement <span>to </span>this <span>program, is also vital </span>for secu<span>rin</span>g support <span>from other countries. </span>Without <span>a </span>program<span>, </span><span>Australian </span>legislation would require the <span>Kl,800 </span>million we received <span>just </span>in December last year, actually having to be repaid now and <span>little </span>prospects, of</p>
<p>success, for the request of Kl<span>,</span>500 million this year reflected in our financing plan. We will also approach Japan and other partners, including the World Bank, ADB, for support and they are all linked, to the IMF program. The alternative to this of course, is going back to expensive commercial loans and of course being able to borrow significant the less than what we are currently doing today.</p>
<p>The guiding principle for engaging with the IMF, has been support for the Marape/Rosso Government's economic reform program. The IMF are extremely satisfied, with our program of economic repair and reconstruction. They are also pleased, with the progress we have been making on good governance reforms, especially those around the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</p>
<p>They are keeping us honest, pushing our institutions<span>, </span>to release more transparent procurement data. <span>They </span>also working closely with us, on <span>reform </span>of our monetary and foreign exchange rate practices. We are sure, they will welcome and respect, our own local expertise<span>, </span>provided through PNG's own Independent Advisory Group<span>, </span>on BPNG reform. There have been hiccups along the road, <span>yes </span>and I expect, there will be hiccups in <span>the </span>future. Overall<span>, </span>however, <span>it </span>has been a productive partnership. And we must on occasions, take <span>a </span>hard-headed approach to our national interests, including linked funding support. Like all negotiations, this will require some give and take, on both sides.</p>
<p>At the end of this statement, members of Parliament, I have attached details on the program for this Parliament. This covers the details of the loan terms and expected disbursement schedule. It includes all of the quantitative and qualitative conditions, for the first 12 months, we have 18 of those and this is part of our rolling three-year program. I will continue to provide regular updates to the IMF on this IMF program, including any updated conditions. And I welcome Parliamentarians to a briefing at our Treasury to go through the program and would hope we can organize a broader meeting with the IMF with those of you that have time and might be interested during their next visit. So, I commend this program to the House.</p>
<p>For good health in 2023, Mr Acting Speaker, at this time, I must also note, the tremendous loss to the country, of the sudden death of Sir Wilson Kamit.</p>
<p>I commend this program to the House.</p>
