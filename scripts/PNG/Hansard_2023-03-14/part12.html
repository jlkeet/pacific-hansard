<h3>Expansion of National Development Bank in rural areas</h3>
<p>Sir PUKA TEMU <span>- </span><span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to the minister responsible for the National Development Bank. I do not know if that will be the Minister for State Owned Enterprises.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I would like to ask the question to the honourable Minister in regards to access to credit for the rural masses. We can acknowledge today, that our banking systems mostly operates at the provincial level, and with regards <span>to </span>some of them with very bad or <span>difficult policies and </span>loans <span>and </span>many <span>other conditions. Our </span>rural masses miss <span>out </span>big time.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, once upon <span>a </span>time, the National Development Bank had a branch in Kupiano in Abau District. That has over time, lost its extension. Recently, 10 <span>years </span>ago, there</p>
<p>was another attempt by the National Development Bank to continue to build facilities for access to credit for our rural masses.</p>
<p>My question is;</p>
<p>Would the Minister consider a program of picking up the establishment of National Development Bank branches at the district level?</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>Mr WILLIAM DUMA <span>- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to also thank the Member for Abau, Sir Puka Temu, for this important question. This question also applies to many of our leaders in Parliament today.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the bank until 2017, received direct funding from the government through the National Budget to be able to continue to provide service and also to cater for expansion of its services to many of our rural areas. That stopped when the government stop providing funding to them.</p>
<p>The NDB is not a normal commercial bank as we are familiarised with. It is a development bank and under the rules of operation, it is only allowed to charge interest on the monies that it lends at the rate below four to three per cent, which is just enough to keep its operational expenses going. It is not meant to make profit for its shareholders.</p>
<p>That is the situation with the bank that we all have to understand. If we do allow to charge interest more than four per cent, it will be able to make some money. In the case of expansion in rural areas, the bank has through some of its internal sources been able to establish some branches in collaboration with some of our leaders.</p>
<p>For example, a couple of years ago, the former Member for Maprik allocated some of his DSIP funds and we were able to have a branch constructed in Maprik, and that was opened by our Prime Minister. Another example would be the case for Tari District. That bank was opened by the Prime and myself.</p>
<p>It is open to our members to allocate some funding to be able to open up branches in your electorates. The bank will try and come up with the balance and together we can work in partnership to open those.</p>
<p>As <span>I </span>have said earlier, these are the circumstances that <span>the </span>bank is allowed to operate in <span>if </span>the interest rates are below four per cent, which is not enough to actively enable the bank to <span>make a decision written </span>on <span>the </span>investments.</p>
<p>It is open and up to all of us to work together. We will expect a contribution from our local members and the bank will contribute its share and start allocating staff and the technical equipment that will be installed in those premises to be able to run an operation for our people.</p>
<p>I do not wish to repeat but the bank is prepared to work with our members as long as there is a contribution from the members. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
