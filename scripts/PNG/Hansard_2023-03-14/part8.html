<h3>Granting of Tourist Visa on arrival</h3>
<p><span>Mr SASINDRAN MUTHUVEL </span>- <span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and acting Minister for Immigration</span>. <span>The Treasurer recently spoke about the importance of tourism, as we all know it is a multibillion-kina industry. I don't know the reason why it is very difficult to get visa, complain raised by the tourist.</span></p>
<p>It's a multibillion-dollar industry but to get visa to enter the country is the most difficult tasks.</p>
<p>Can the Acting Minister for Immigration and the Deputy Prime Minister assure this House that the promised visa on arrival that was agreed to 2015 when the President of India visited Papua New Guinea can be revisited because we are expecting another visit from the <span>Prime </span>Minister of India this year?</p>
<p>So, can we grant on arrival tourist visa for India because they are ranked third in the world <span>economy and at </span>the moment <span>they are </span>in fourth place.</p>
<p>So<span>, </span>the Minister can clarify as to why we delay in giving tourist visa to India and other countries as well.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr JOHN ROSSO <span>- </span><span>Thank you, very much Acting Speaker, and I appreciate the good Governor of West New Britain for raising this very critical question.</span></p>

<p>05<span>/</span>01</p>
<p>The case regarding tourist visa is a very big issue and it is not an easy solution for us to just give visas. This means interacting with Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs just recently updated us that he is working on rectifying a lot of the issues that we have had with the backlog of Foreign Affairs problems associated with other countries so that we can be able to allow visas to be done and issued.</p>
<p>One thing which we have uplifted is the Business Visas which now are 12 months business visas which is short-term where businesses can apply only once and work quickly in a month go back so they don't apply every time they want to go. So it makes it a quicker and easy tum-around time in light of the upcoming mines and also for our current businesses in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>Quite rightfully said so the good Governor has mentioned Tourism which is a very important aspect that we need to look into and sort out. We are in constant talks with our good Foreigner Affairs Minister and he has also just updated me also that Indonesian and Indian diplomatic visas will be on arrival for the diplomatic staff that is coming in from them and we will also be looking at the Philippines and Koreans Visas.</p>
<p>So, we are working at rectifying a lot of these things he also mentioned that some of these have been backlogs for over eight years that have not been done and he is now sorting it out with our immigration office to rectify a lot of these issues.</p>
<p>So, yes we are working on it and it is very important and we will be able to sort it out and announce it to Parliament in the following months.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
