<h3>QUESTIONS District Treasury operating in POM-Enga Province</h3>
<p>Sir PETER IPATAS <span>- </span><span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, I direct my questions to the Minister for Finance. I have made representation to the Minister and his Secretary to establish whether a District Treasury from my province is operating here in Port Moresby.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, since the last representation I have not been facilitated with a response.</p>
<p>Can the Minister confirm that this particular district treasury is operating in Port Moresby, outside of the district and also outside of our province?</p>
<p>If this is so, what will the Minister do to rectify this because this is not proper?</p>

<p>Mr RAINBO PAITA <span>- </span><span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</span></p>

<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Minister, for </span><span>Hansard </span><span>purposes please, address the Chair as Mr Acting Speaker.</span></p>

<p><span>Mr RAINBO PAITA-Thank </span>you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the good Governor for his <span>question </span>relating <span>to </span>one district in <span>Enga </span>province <span>which </span>its district treasury operating outside of the province.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I have not seen any documents regarding this issue but I have heard rumours within my department that the Governor visited the Department Secretary in regards to that issue and I have not yet received that letter from the Ministerial office but I will follow up today and if there is such a practise. I understand when there are special circumstances for example, when there were fights in Mendi, there were steps taken for normal government process to take function like treasury and other relevant district services.</p>
<p>In respect to the question, I will see relevant offices and respond accordingly<span>.</span></p>
