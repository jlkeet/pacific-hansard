<h3>Status of Carbon Trade Secretariat</h3>
<p>Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE <span>- </span><span>In 2021, the Parliament passed the </span><span>Climate Change Management Act</span><span>. </span><span>One of the reasons for that particular Act is to have in place a Secretariat to monitor the carbon trade activities in the country. Because of no Secretariat in place there was a moratorium that was imposed by the previous minister, whilst it was in place there were some organisation like NIHT and FORSET who went to some parts of my district and signed some carbon trade activities with some of my people.</span></p>
<p>My questions are<span>:</span></p>
<p>What is the Government's position in relation to this carbon trade in our country?</p>
<p>Is <span>the moratorium on the carbon trade activity in place as yet or not?</span></p>
<p>What action will the Government take on these two particular companies in Pomio now especially the FORSET and NIHT, who are actually causing some chaos and confusion amongst my people?</p>

<p><span>Mr SIMON KILEPA </span><span>- </span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker<span>, </span>firstly, I would like to thank the Member for <span>Pomio </span>for his questions. Before answering the questions<span>, </span>I would like to thank the people of Lufa for electing me as their mandated leader to represent them on this Floor of Parliament.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to thank the Marape/Rosso Government and my party leader, United Resource Party for entrusting me with this Ministry. Thirdly, I would like to thank the Opposition Leader and our brothers in the Opposition<span>. </span>And I would also like to acknowledge our two lady leaders in the House.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, the NIHT and the FORSET are based on volunteering carbon scheme and they have been in the country since 2019. The moratorium that was in place has lapsed in 2021. Actually they were here before the moratorium was placed by the former minister.</p>
<p>But right now, we are working on the carbon trade markets regulations which is now with State Solicitor so once the certificate on necessity are done and approved by the State Solicitor, we will then remove the moratorium.</p>

<p>08/01</p>
<p>Right now, there is a moratorium for voluntary market so there is no new company</p>
<p>coming <span>in for </span>voluntary markets. <span>Currently, the </span>regulation is <span>being scheduled </span>for the certificate <span>of necessity. As for NITH, they are operating in New Ireland since 2019 and they have been</span></p>
<p>operating under the Climate Change Development Authority to deal with the voluntary carbon credits.</p>
<p>The report on ABC was done in the forestry area, but that is not covered in the area that it is operating to conserve the forest. It is done away from the area, in the logging areas to give disrepute to our credits, in saying that PNG does not have the capacity or the credits. We have the credits and we are looking to modify the credits with the PNG Forest Authority and other relevant stakeholders at this moment.</p>
<p>As for the question asked by the Member for Pomio, I will check with my staff and will come back with an answer on his electorate. Thank you.</p>

<p><b>Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE </b>- Point of Order! Thank you, to the two ministers for answering my questions. I have another question in regards to what he said about the <span>two </span>companies being there before the moratorium.</p>
<p>Can your ministry conduct an audit on the works of the companies in my district because there has been some misunderstanding between the people there?</p>

<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- </span><span>Honourable Member, your point of order has already been answered when the Minister said he will go back to his ministry and do a specific report on your electorate and report back to you. Minister do you have anything to say on that or I will rule out the point of order?</span></p>

<p>Mr SIMON KILEPA <span>- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. As I have stated earlier, I will go back to my Ministry and get the right information to come and present to the Member for Pomio.</span></p>
