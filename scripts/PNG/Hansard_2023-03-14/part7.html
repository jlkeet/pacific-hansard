<h3>Youth Unemployment</h3>
<p><span>Mr </span><span>JAMES </span><span>NOMANE </span><span>- </span>My question is directed to the Minister for Treasury. From the last Parliament Sitting were we voted the Governor-General <span>there </span>were few <span>things </span>that happened. We had droves of young men and women outside the Stanley Hotel in the thousands applying for about twenty jobs<span>, </span>minimal labour jobs -</p>

<p>03/01</p>
<p>Waiters, waitresses. We had 700<span>, </span>degree holders apply to become teachers at the</p>
<p>University of Goroka<span>. </span>We've recently had the Lae Biscuit Company shut down for two weeks because it can't sell its products. We've got a youth bulge issue in the country that the House must take note of, Mr Acting Speaker. There's<span>, </span>too many young people without any prospects or opportunity for employment in the country<span>.</span></p>
<p>So my question to the honourable Treasurer is, what is the Government's plan for employment? How do we address this issue of youth unemployment? What do we do to increase the number of people that are gainfully employed so this can directly address the rising crime rate that we are seeing in the country now. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY <span>- </span><span>Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I want to the thank the Vice Minister and the honorable member for his very timely question on what plans the Marape/Rosso Government has to creating jobs in our country.</span></p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, there are a number of initiatives at a very high level that this Government has taken to create jobs and this is one of the very key initiatives that our Government has been <span>working </span>on and must continue to work on.</p>
<p>At a <span>high </span>level from a <span>budget </span>perspective, Mr Acting Speaker we continue to <span>restructure our budget to ensure that we pump more money into those economic activities that will create </span>jobs. I'm <span>referring here to our capital budget which three years ago when </span>we <span>took office was</span></p>
<p>sitting around at about a K4.6 billion this year as the honourable member knows in his planning documents, we've increased that to K9,7 billion. Of that particular budget our Public Investment Promotion Public Investment Project component, we've increased it to a little bit over K3 billion when we took over office to around about K6. 6 billion, a 220 per cent increase. At a high level from a budget perspective, that's what we have done. But of course Mr Acting Speaker, there are other issues when we talk about creating jobs.</p>
<p>If you recall Mr Acting Speaker, I had answered this question back in about 2020 when I was asked and I mentioned that then that the jobs growth for any Government will be delivered by pro- job and pro - growth policies. With our Government as you know. Vice Minister we have a target at ten thousand jobs in the formal economy and many more in the informal economy which covers of course our SMEs and rural workers.</p>
<p>So one of our first targets is, we need to make sure to make PNG an internationally competitive economy, including through ensuring our wage rates are brought into line with regional averages. Of course higher wages can mean less jobs in an economy such as PNG. So it's always about getting the right balance.</p>
<p>The Marape/Rosso Government is very much focused on building the agriculture, fisheries and tourism sectors and increasing of course downstream processing. And of course last weekend we saw the results of some of the good work being completed and implemented in the Gazelle Electorate. Of course we need to continue to look at greater funding in our infrastructure and we have done that by setting PNG Connect as our signature policy and in this year's budget, I am very pleased to advise our country and the House that we have implemented one of the legislative changes that we made which was to ensure that 5.6 per cent I think it is, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue forecast is put aside for that particular</p>

<p><a>04/01</a></p>
<p>I think six per cent, I stand to be corrected of our annual revenue focus is put a side for that particular program. This year ifI recall correctly we had budgeted Kl.2 billion. So that's some of the things that we've been doing so far.</p>
<p>In agriculture for example, some of the exciting initiative that we have taken we've properly invested in a state equity fund ofK40 million last year. It was to support the expansion of large-scale projects.</p>
<p>We <span>have created new </span>ministry of Coffee <span>and Palm </span>Oil to ensure a focus of <span>these key </span>areas <span>of investment. We have significant investment in roads </span>like we've <span>mentioned. I'm very happy to provide a detail statement or perhaps my colleague minister for Works </span>can <span>do that to detail</span></p>
<p>the record number of contracts that have been issued and to explain in a way that our people can understand. I won't go into some of the examples of the roads projects which we've covered already here.</p>
<p>So, I will just move on very quickly to fisheries investment. In this particular space we need to properly invest in our Pacific Marine Industrial Zones. Last year off course, we Budget <span>KlOO </span>million and this year we have our new effective Minister for International Trade and Investment working on that. Off course, we also need to expand our rural jetties. Last year we have budgeted K4 million and this year I think we double that amount.</p>
<p>In tourism again an untouched and a huge potential for our country that we continue to talk about. I will leave some more detail discussions to the Minister for Tourism, Arts and Culture.</p>
<p>But lastly, other initiative that help us create more jobs is to deal with the greatest barrier of doing business in our country. And we've heard <span>in </span>the last three and the half years and in fact before that when we took government that foreign exchange reforms together with reforms to the <span>Central </span><i>Banking Act </i>must take place. And I'm very happy <span>to </span>advise that later this <span>afternoon I </span>will touch a little more on that.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>
