<h3>Good healthin2023 Mr Acting Speaker,at thistime,I must also note,the tremendous loss to the country,</h3>
<p>of the sudden death of Sir Wilson Kamit.</p>

<p>Sir Wilson was the first Bank of PNG Governor, following the reforms of Sir Mekere Morauta. He held the position from 1999 to 2009.</p>
<p>These were good years economically for PNG.</p>
<p>I have been honoured, to have him as one of the three members of the Independent Advisory Group, on modernizing the current Central Banking Act. He has made a great contribution to PNG, and I was greatly saddened, by his sudden passing. My sincere condolences to Lady Winifred, his family, and colleagues.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank Mr Jim Hagen, our key contact within the Australian Treasury, for all the support, he has provided to PNG and the wider Pacific, over many years, and wish him well in his retirement.</p>
