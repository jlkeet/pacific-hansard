<h3>Supplementary Question Shortage of Processing Officers</h3>
<p>Mr GARRY JUFFA <span>- </span><span>My question is also to the Deputy Prime Minister and it is in</span></p>
<p>relation to the same subject.</p>
<p>Can the Minister advise us if there is an intention or plan to expand the services?</p>
<p>Because currently what is happening is they are facing a staffing capacity issue and in many of the areas where we have migration officers operating, you will find that they are over<span>Â­ </span>burdened with work. The number of people coming into the country has increased significantly but the number of officers responsible for managing or processing them has not increased so can the minister elaborate on this case?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Mr JOHN ROSSO </span><span>- </span>Thank you, for that supplementary question. Just to elaborate on that we have realized that there is a backlog on a lot of these and recently the Chief Migration Officer has allowed for 28 extra staff to sort out the backlog that we are working on at the moment. We are also looking at setting up a couple of offices<span>, </span>one will be in Lae to process passports for people in the Momase and Highlands areas. But for the long line of visas for coming into the country, yes we have noticed the problem and we have recruited 28 people to sort out the issues.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
