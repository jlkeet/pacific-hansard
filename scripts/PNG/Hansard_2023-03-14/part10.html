<h3>Policing Measures To Curb Crime</h3>
<h3>Mr JACOB KOP MAKI <span>- </span><span>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and my question is directed to the Minister for Internal Security.</span></h3>
<p>There are Warlords in Hela Province holding resources in capacity and demanding ransom, young girls have been taken hostage and repeatedly raped; their criminal acts have gone viral on social media and circulated which has created fear amongst citizens of this beautiful Nation.</p>
<p>Recently, an innocent taxi driver was hacked to death by unknown criminals near Edai <span>Town </span>which also went viral on social media. This is so scary and many innocent lives are being put at risk; our citizens and foreigners are living in fear.</p>
<p>Can the Minister tell this country through this Floor, what measures have the Police Department taken so far to deal with the Warlords in Hela and the senseless killing along Papa Lealea Road? If nothing has been done about them can you explain to the Floor, so that the people of Papua New Guinea can be aware because this has gone viral?</p>
<p>Thank <span>you.</span></p>

<p><span>Mr </span><span>PETER </span><span>TSIAMALILI </span><span>- </span>Thank you, Mr Acting <span>Speaker, </span>and <span>I </span>would also like to thank the Member for Mul-Baiyer for asking his question.</p>
<p>From the onset, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the members in this House from each province you <span>-</span></p>

<p><a>06</a><span>/</span>01</p>
<p>Whilst I have this opportunity, I want to say thank you to all the leaders in this House.</p>
<p>When we first met in this Parliament, we said that law and order issue is for all of us. Now, I want to appreciate you all for the work you as leaders are doing and also appreciate all of you for work collaborations with your PPCs because we encourage all PPCs to work closely with the district or you open members including the governors to ensure that they have full visibility in collaboration and in alignment in curbing the law and order issues.</p>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, I must make it clear that there are no warlords in this country. We must remove that phrase. These are just criminals. We must not label them otherwise.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question in relation to incidents in Hela province, as you and other leaders would know, we're working closely with the leadership on the ground. Now more than <span>ever</span><span>, </span>we need leadership<span>. </span>We are stretched as a force and we all know that. We have only five thousand men managing and enforcing our law and order issues. We're making every effort and we have started with the recruitment. We've also identified areas within the force that needs special attention. Our CID and forensic are addressing that. We are recruiting as I speak.</p>
<p>With the issue up in Hela province, we have special policing zone for western front and again we are working closely with the leadership on the ground. We're making every effort for us to manage this scenario that is happening in the Western Front up in Hela province and also across the country.</p>
<p>So, I am just asking for support from you leaders. This is not going to happen overnight. This issue did not just happen in 2023 or 2022 or 2021. This is a combination of the neglect our force had over a period of 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>I'm probably having sleepless nights and I'm taking that responsibly to ensure that we work together with our operational side of the police.</p>
<p>There will also be some amendments that will be coming to the Floor for us to make some more strong laws or enforce strong laws to deter this type of actions by our citizens.</p>
<p>So, with that, Honourable Member for Mul-Baiyer, I hope that I have answered <span>your </span>question. We're doing everything possible to ensure that we address the lawlessness that is at <span>the forefront </span>of <span>this </span>country.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sir Puka Temu <span>- Point of Order!</span></p>

<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span>- What is your point of order?</span></p>

<p><b>Sir Puka Temu </b>- Honourable Acting Speaker, the good Member clearly asked the Honourable Minister what the force is doing with regards to some of those specific incidents<span>. </span>Some photographs of these criminals went viral on <span>Facebook </span>so, tell the country what the force is doing rather than making a general statement. Are there people going out there looking for them here in Boiera and up in Hela? This is because their pictures were posted on <span>Facebook. </span>Tell the country what you are doing and when you are going to apprehend them.</p>
<p>Thank you<span>.</span></p>

<p><a>07/01</a></p>
<p>Mr ACTING SPEAKER-The <span>Honourable Members Point of Order is in regard to the</span></p>
<p>question the Honourable Member for Mul<span>-</span>Baiyer has asked regarding the incident that happened and the Members want you to inform the House on what actions have been taken on this particular incident that took place. Can you answer the questions raised by the Honourable Member?</p>

<p>Mr PETER TSIAMALILI <span>- Thank you Acting Speaker, firstly the social media and the type of exposure that the platform has also impeaches on the Ministry of Communication because we are talking about the cyber-crime space. And also, the general public using this platform to expose all these sorts of behavior now are days.</span></p>
<p>In terms of the prosecution of these culprits which were already exposed the cyber-crime officers have been assigned to look into such incidents. Before the police officers carry out the prosecution they have to follow the processes in place by visiting the crime scene and take reports.</p>
<p>With that I want to assure the House that the police have taken action but will go through a process. On the question of the progress report of the incident in Lealeah, I assure the House that I will get an update report and report back to Parliament.</p>
<p>In relation to the process, we have already initiated and I will report on its progress as to the arrest of the culprits.</p>
