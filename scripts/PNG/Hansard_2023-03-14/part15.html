<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mr Acting Speaker, New Ireland is a matrilineal society. During the Xmas Break and the first two months of 2023, I met with over 4,000 mothers and youths, to listen to their views on priorities for 2023. My clear view is that the Marape-Rosso Government is doing the right things for our mothers, our youths<span>, </span>and our people. There is still a long path to travel before we reach the living standards that our people deserve but we are taking the right steps forward.</p>
<p>A record K24,567 million 2023 budget, with spending, focused on key priority areas. Kl,177 million assisting households with the cost ofliving pressures, budget repair of Kl,000 million. Economic growth policies focused on rural areas, delivering double the world average at 3.5 per cent. Inflation moderating to under 6 per cent moving to greater economic independence. Working constructively and openly with international partners. Implementing the PANGU Vision, all within our available resources.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p>

<p>Motion (by <span>Mr Rainbo Paita) </span>agreed to -</p>
<p>That the Parliament take note of the statement and debate be adjourned to a subsequent sitting.</p>
