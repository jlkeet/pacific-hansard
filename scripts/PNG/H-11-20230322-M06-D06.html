<br>
QUESTIONS<br>
Media Policy<br>
<br>
Mr EREMAN TOBAINING JNR — Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for recognising<br>
the people of Kokopo, which is the fourth city in Papua New Guinea. My question is directed<br>
to the Minister for Information and Communication Technology.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, before I ask my question, I want to thank the Marape-Rosso<br>
Government through the Minister for choosing Kokopo for the very important dialogue meeting<br>
with the Pacific countries. I believe it is the first time for all the Pacific countries to come<br>
together for this very important meeting that was held in Kokopo a couple of months ago. Thank<br>
you.<br>
<br>
My question is that, as we face issues portrayed through the front page of the media,<br>
namely Post-Courier, The National, and some other so-called social media. And again, for us<br>
leaders and also the public; we have been tarnished and clarified that some of us are these types<br>
of people.<br>
<br>
This is happening and tarnishing our good Government including the Opposition.<br>
<br>
02/06<br>
<br>
We all understand that the Ministry and the Department of Information and<br>
Communication Technology is currently conducting a review of the media on the ICT policy.<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker and Minister, at the same time, there are concerns being raised by the<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 3:<br>
members of the public that the Government is attempting to suppress media freedom and<br>
freedom of speech using the new policy. I believe this Government has addressed this issue to<br>
protect the people of this country as well as leaders of our beautiful country. My questions are<br>
as follows;<br>
<br>
(1) Can the Minister clarify in simple terms, the internet and purpose of the current<br>
review of the media policy and what the new policy seeks to achieve?<br>
<br>
(2) Specifically, can the Minster explain how the new policy will protect both the media<br>
and freedom of speech, a right guaranteed under our Constitution?<br>
<br>
(3) Can the Minister also clarify whether the new policy seeks to regulate social media<br>
space, Facebook, WhatsApp, et cetera?<br>
<br>
(4) Can the Minister inform this House and the people of Papua New Guinea of the<br>
current status of the review and when the new ICT Policy will be approved by our Government?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker<br>
<br>
Mr TIMOTHY MASIU - Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and a very good morning<br>
to you and the people of Papua New Guinea who are listening to the radio and watching us<br>
on the television.<br>
<br>
I thank you for the questions that the Honourable Member for Kokopo has raised. I<br>
will be very happy to answer so that our people can understand where we are in terms of<br>
the review that my department is spearheading.<br>
<br>
Regarding the first question, Honourable Member, the intent of the draft National<br>
Media Development Policy is to establish an enabling framework to recognize and develop<br>
the media sector in Papua New Guinea to support our development agenda. Current<br>
research and recent consultations have led us to the consolidation of four main issues within<br>
the media sector.<br>
<br>
Firstly, is the concerns of journalism that we have today. By concerns, we observe<br>
the decline of quality investigative journalism, the impact of sub-standard reporting of the<br>
development agenda and the concerns of conduct ethics and accountability of journalists.<br>
<br>
Secondly, is the protection of journalists. My ministry through the Department of ICT<br>
is currently collating both, quantitative and qualitative data to verify the concerns of safety<br>
of journalists. We recognize that at the moment there is lack of protection mechanisms for<br>
journalists.<br>
<br>
Thirdly on the intent, is the coordination of Government information. My ministry<br>
has for the last three years looked at options on how to reorganize State-owned media<br>
<br>
3<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 4:<br>
outlets so that we coordinate dissemination of Government information better. We<br>
recognize that as a Government, we are lacking coordination in Government information<br>
dissemination to our people.<br>
<br>
03/06<br>
<br>
Fourthly on the intent, is the exclusion of SMEs. The Ministry has identified that SMEs<br>
particularly in the modern media space are not recognized as professionals and not given<br>
appropriate support.<br>
<br>
Based on these issues, the draft National Media Development Policy identifies four main<br>
objectives:<br>
<br>
(1) Facilitate and coordinate access to information for citizens and ensuring the media<br>
provides accurate, impartial, and balanced reporting on issues of public interest, including those<br>
affecting marginalised or under-represented groups.<br>
<br>
(2) Encourage media diversity and support the representation of local and regional voices<br>
in media content and ownership.<br>
<br>
(3) Ensure media organisations adhere to ethical and professional standards and promote<br>
responsible journalism that respects local customs and cultures.<br>
<br>
(4) Promote civic engagement and participation in media issues, including through<br>
partnerships between media organisations, civil society groups, and government agencies.<br>
<br>
By promoting access to information, media diversity, and responsible journalism, the<br>
policy aims to support the development of a more informed, engaged, and empowered citizens<br>
in Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
For your second question on how will the new policy help protect and promote media<br>
freedom and enhance freedom of speech, early this year, we released —<br>
<br>
Mr Allan Bird — Point of Order! Mr Deputy Speaker, with great respect to the<br>
Honourable Minister who is reading a statement to the House, it would be appropriate if he can<br>
present those answers to previous questions later on, as it is taking the opportunity for question<br>
time for other Members to raise their concerns.<br>
<br>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER — Honourable Governor, your Point of Order is in order. I can<br>
see that the honourable Minister has a written response in regards to those questions. I will ask<br>
the Minister to seek leave of the Chair to address the House and answer those important<br>
questions after question time, as this is Question time only.<br>
<br>
4<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 5:<br>
Mr TIMOTHY MASIU -— Mr Deputy Speaker, I think it is important to address these<br>
questions in detail as they are matters of public importance.<br>
<br>
I ask leave of the Chair to answer these questions after the question time.<br>
<br>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Leave granted.<br>
<br>
Ms KESSY SAWANG - Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker —<br>
<br>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Honourable Member for Rai Coast, after you the Chair will<br>
recognise the Member for Mendi. I have been here on the Chair and seeing him standing the<br>
whole week. After you, the Chair recognises the Member for Mendi. Please do continue<br>
Member.<br>
<br>
Ms KESSY SAWANG -— Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for acknowledging the<br>
womenfolk and also the mothers of Papua New Guinea. I also thank you for acknowledging<br>
the people of Rai-Coast.<br>
<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
<br>
Status Update On WASH Policy<br>
<br>
Ms KESSY SAWANG - My questions are directed to the Minister for Planning but<br>
since he is not here, I will direct my question to the Prime Minister.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, today is ‘World Water Day’ so let me give a brief background to<br>
my question.<br>
<br>
Papua New Guinea has a National Water Sanitation and Hygiene Policy from 2015 to<br>
2030. That policy actually highlights some very critical figures, that 89 per cent of people in<br>
urban areas only have access to clean water and 33 per cent in rural areas. For sanitation in<br>
urban areas, only 57 per cent of people have access to proper sanitation and in rural areas that<br>
is 13 per cent.<br>
<br>
04/06<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, 13 per cent of our people have access to basic sanitation, and as you<br>
<br>
may be aware in our PNG Strategic Plan 2010-2030, we have a national target that the<br>
)<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
government has set over a decade ago, that by 2030, 70 per cent of our people, both urban and<br>
rural, should have access to clean and safe water and sanitation.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, we have only seven years left, I want to raise a very specific issue<br>
on bringing the water to the house for families to access.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, when a couple in Papua New Guinea has a baby girl, automatically<br>
the task of carrying water becomes her responsibility. This task is slavery because as she grows<br>
up, she performs it starting from being a primary school student all the way to high school, and<br>
even when she becomes a mother and then grandmother. This task is done every day in the<br>
morning and afternoon.<br>
<br>
In 2018, the Government made an NEC Decision to establish the National Water,<br>
Sanitation, and Hygiene Authority. I agree with such an institutionalization of this issue of<br>
water because when we have this kind of organization that is directly responsible for WASH,<br>
we can accelerate our actions toward our national goals. This organization can also assist us in<br>
the districts to provide clean safe water and sanitation for our people. I do not know how far<br>
this organization has progressed.<br>
<br>
(1) Can the Prime Minister tell this House, especially the women and girls in this country,<br>
how far the Government has progressed in implementing that NEC Decision to establish a<br>
WASH Authority to look at these issues?<br>
<br>
On the other note, there are actually opportunities in Papua New Guinea —<br>
<br>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER -— Honorable Member, I will interrupt you here. I know the<br>
importance of the question you want to raise, but we have a Grievance Debate tomorrow so if<br>
you would like to debate more on this matter you will be allowed to do so.<br>
<br>
This is question time and we have limited time so, I will ask you to go straight to your<br>
questions and let the Prime Minister respond.<br>
<br>
Ms KESSY SAWANG -— Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have already asked one<br>
question.<br>
<br>
(2) In this year’s 2023 Budget, how much money has been allocated for WASH?<br>
<br>
(3) What is the progress on our national goal, as in how much progress have we made<br>
towards that 70 per cent accessibility to clean safe water and sanitation?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.<br>
<br>
)<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank the Vice Minister and<br>
Member for Rai Coast for asking these important questions in terms of how water can be<br>
connected to all the families right across the country to be used to benefit from an improved<br>
lifestyle.<br>
<br>
I know that we are running through the mid-life of the current WASH Plan that targets<br>
2030 for 70 per cent of our citizens and households to have access to clean and safe water, and<br>
sanitation.<br>
<br>
Just to answer one question quickly, there has been K7 million allocated for this year’s<br>
budget and I want to show appreciation to European Union and the Australian DFAT, and all<br>
our other development partners.<br>
<br>
We have a program of up to K600 million worth of contracts that Australian DFAT,<br>
ADB, European Union, and World Bank are all partners in, to help to maintain cost to possibly<br>
reach 70 per cent of our citizens and households in our country. So, the target of reaching 70<br>
per cent remains by 2030.<br>
<br>
In 2023 from indications, anywhere between 20 to 40 per cent depending on which part<br>
of the country we are at, but on average from 20 to 40 per cent delivery thus far.<br>
<br>
05/06<br>
<br>
I want to give an assurance to the honourable leader who has asked this question that our<br>
government is conscious about the need and rights for the people to have access to clean water.<br>
This is a commitment of our government that is why this year, we have K7 million parked as<br>
an indication of our support to counter fund this program going forward.<br>
<br>
In relation to when will the bill be coming, the bill that this government proposed to<br>
embrace is in its final stage. It will be completed very soon and this Parliament will have the<br>
opportunity to look at and pass the bill in relation to WASH.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, on the issue of an extra organization, we are a little bit careful about<br>
it. We already have the District Development Authority, provincial governments and our<br>
National Water PNG on our programs. Every new organization created in our country has a<br>
cost of recurrent maintenance apart from the development programs. We are conscious on<br>
creation of new authorities, but in the absence of that authority, this might happen in the future.<br>
<br>
The districts and provinces have funding allegations under the disbursement guidelines<br>
and the procurement process. The districts and provinces can run on programs for localized<br>
needs pertaining to the issue of water, health and sanitation of our people. Therefore, I would<br>
like to encourage all districts and provinces to embrace the WASH policy that my government<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
embraces in totality. It is our people&#x27;s right to have access to clean water wherever they are<br>
living.<br>
<br>
So, when you receive funding and run your districts and provinces, treat the need for<br>
water in as far as your people is concerned, as a key need at the national level. We have not<br>
deviated from the focus of delivering to our country&#x27;s 70 per cent of clean reliable water by<br>
2030. That focus remains and we are ramping up on our national policy and national focus. I<br>
encourage the districts and provinces to be mindful about this important need and get going.<br>
<br>
Our partnership with the development partners will remain into the future and I will let<br>
the Minister for Planning to deliver a statement in relation to the water, health and sanitation<br>
issue for people.<br>
<br>
Today is World Water Day, please use water wisely and as Members, let&#x27;s try to work in<br>
this program to give our people reliable and clean water.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
UOG - Teacher Training Programs<br>
<br>
Mr RAPHAEL TONPI — Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to ask this question to<br>
the Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and Sports.<br>
<br>
Is the Minister aware that the University of Goroka is the third largest of the seven<br>
universities in Papua New Guinea? So far, it is the largest teacher education institution in our<br>
country. I am happy that it is an institution which was primarily established for the purpose of<br>
teacher training which has over time developed into a university.<br>
<br>
What saddens me and therefore prompts me to ask these questions is that, the end product<br>
is missed from the quality of performance by students in our high schools and secondary<br>
schools in the country.<br>
<br>
Therefore, my questions are as follows;<br>
<br>
(1) Is the University of Goroka producing the same quality of trained teachers for the<br>
future of our children or in the name of continuous upgrade and review conducted over time,<br>
it has gradually deviated from the main focus of training quality teachers?<br>
<br>
(2) Can the Minister confirm or deny that the University of Goroka has deviated from the<br>
main teacher training, and therefore compromised the quality of teacher output?<br>
<br>
(3) If so, can the Minister put in place a review with the aim to assess whether proper<br>
teacher training is conducted to benefit the students?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 9:<br>
06/06<br>
<br>
Mr DON POLYE - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. These questions are critical and<br>
also very strategic in so far as the University of Goroka and all our universities, technical<br>
institutions and the colleges are concerned, whether it be a teaching college or nursing or any<br>
other institution.<br>
<br>
The question relates to all those tertiary institutions in the country, but UOG in particular.<br>
The questions probably refer to three areas: the quality and the relevance of students coming<br>
out of the lower institutions up to the higher education institutions; what the government is<br>
doing in particular with UOG; and if UOG has the diversified programs away from teaching.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, in terms of quality, I have not done a specific study to assess the<br>
quality. But generally, I’ve assessed the output and the performance, looked at the programs of<br>
universities and UOG has been no exception. I’ve looked at it and I’m looking at some of the<br>
programs of the University of Goroka at the very present time as I answer these questions from<br>
the Honourable Member for Mendi.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the quality in this country from a general observation, from the<br>
report I get is that, we have probably allowed the quality of education, especially the higher<br>
education, skilled development and academic knowledge to drop to a level that we now realise,<br>
we must improve. Quality is very important and it starts in the following areas.<br>
<br>
Firstly, Mr Assistant Speaker, is the governance and leadership on the campus of the<br>
University of Goroka. For other institutions, I have to some extent realised that the composition<br>
of governance and the vice chancellors or especially at the council level, and then right down<br>
to the structure of the management system. I think there’s been a lot of compromise where I<br>
find that the best people have not been appointed to leadership and governance roles at those<br>
institutions. UOG is being addressed in that perspective.<br>
<br>
I have confidence in the council, the vice chancellor and the team working there, but<br>
we’ll work together with them to address the leadership and governance issues to address the<br>
areas of quality.<br>
<br>
I’ve decided that under the Higher Education’s General Provisions Act, where it places<br>
the authority of appointment on the Minister, I’d like to inform the Parliament and the people<br>
that I will change that in the Act not to put the authority of appointing the council and the<br>
administration on the Minister. It will be done by a collective body and I am looking at the<br>
Higher Education Technical Council to make the decision and recommend to the Cabinet.<br>
<br>
So, we will free up politicizing of those positions at the council level or even through the<br>
council on the administration level and the vice’s level. We will put a collective decision-<br>
<br>
)<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 10:<br>
making body that will work with the National Executive Council to observe those and that’s<br>
where quality will start. When you put leadership and governance to the right composition then<br>
you will find that there will be right people available to drive quality down the whole institution<br>
especially, programs. That’s number one.<br>
<br>
Number two, how we are addressing the issue of quality. In terms of registering every<br>
university in Papua New Guinea or other institutions that comes under the Higher Education<br>
space, they must meet a national registration standard. That means they have to meet all the<br>
requirements to be called a university or higher education institution. That is being looked at<br>
and I’m doing it to make sure that UOG and other universities must qualify to be universities<br>
because they meet that standard of registration. That means every lecturer must be qualified or<br>
have an accreditation. That means those professors must earn that title professor because<br>
they’re doing research and work. Those that are in the dean level in those particular areas or<br>
the schools must also earn by the standards that we will implement.<br>
<br>
07/06<br>
<br>
So, registration is very important because when people are qualified to a certain level,<br>
they will impart knowledge to teachers to go and teach students, then the quality of education<br>
that the Member is referring to will be achieved because of quality registered institutions.<br>
<br>
The third point is the accreditation of the programs being taught there. The University of<br>
Goroka offers not only education and teacher training programs, but also other diversified<br>
areas. The programs that are being taught there must be accredited to a standard, not just to the<br>
university’s standard but also to the national qualification standard. The national qualification<br>
standard is coordinated and driven by the Department of Higher Education, Research, Science<br>
and Technology.<br>
<br>
That standard is bench-marked against some of the best practices in the world. The<br>
University of Goroka is correlating and working in partnership with a network of institutions<br>
and affiliated accreditation standards in the world so that we have the best programs offered to<br>
teachers. The accreditation of programs is very important because that is how we are addressing<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Another area that I also want to talk about is the research in these institutions. UOG must<br>
do research. There cannot be a university if it does offer research programs.<br>
<br>
The final area in terms of quality is the digitalization of some programs; online or virtual<br>
learning. We would like to increase the number of students that graduated from the University<br>
of Goroka with quality teaching skills. There are some programs that can be offered online to<br>
<br>
10<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 11:<br>
students who may not be able to attend the university due to lack of space, accommodation or<br>
learning facilities. Those are the areas that we are addressing in terms of the quality programs<br>
that must be taught.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, we have started a review. We also have external auditors on<br>
standby at the direction of the higher education sector or the department to conduct independent<br>
review of the programs at the University of Goroka.<br>
<br>
The other question was on UOG deviating from teaching to other areas. From my point<br>
of view, a university is a university, meaning they have a broader area of programs that they<br>
can administer. I do not see that as a problem if they deviate from teaching. Under the current<br>
circumstances, I am informed that every year, we need to graduate 800 teachers.<br>
<br>
The University of Goroka can only graduate 400 to 600 students in a year. The Divine<br>
Word Open Campus in East New Britain graduates 100 to 200 students per year to meet the<br>
mark of 800 but we still fall short of teachers.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the point that was raised by the honourable Member is a valid<br>
point. Why should we try to diversify when we are still not meeting the target of graduating<br>
800 teachers from UOG per year?<br>
<br>
That was one of the questions that I have raised with the vice chancellors’ committee. I<br>
have established a vice chancellors’ committee whose chair is at University of Technology.<br>
They will address these issues and assist UOG to rationalise the programs. Some programs that<br>
are taught in some universities are not relevant; for instance, environment, humanities and<br>
political science are taught in UOG, as well as UPNG.<br>
<br>
UPNG should be offering these programs so that the University of Goroka can<br>
concentrate on expanding more on the training of teachers. These programs are put in place so<br>
that all universities are cohesive and are working together. The same can be done for technical<br>
institutions and colleges so everyone can work together to complement or supplement each<br>
other to achieve the quality programs that I am talking about.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, we are addressing those issues vehemently, and we are keen to see<br>
improvement in the next three to five years. In this term of Parliament, I have a very strong<br>
conviction to improve the quality of education and increase the number of teachers that are<br>
graduating and going out to the schools. We will then find relevance in the programs that we<br>
are administering through these institutions.<br>
<br>
11<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 12:<br>
08/06<br>
<br>
Finally, Mr Assistant Speaker, I was asked a similar question about the National<br>
Polytechnic Institute by the Member for Gumine, after the question time, I would ask leave of<br>
the Parliament to answer those question as well. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Supplementary Question<br>
UOG Must Specialise In Teacher Training<br>
<br>
Mr BENJAMIN MUL - I heard that The University of Goroka (UOG) was set out for<br>
teacher training only. When we talk about quality, we must have proper training for teachers<br>
to train our students so that we can produce the best brains in our country.<br>
<br>
I heard that Goroka is introducing general courses, like those that are taught at the<br>
University of Technology and the University of Papua New Guinea. That is why I really want<br>
the Minister to do away with all this general courses and specialise only on teaching at the<br>
University of Goroka so that we have best teachers to teach our students in our country.<br>
<br>
When we talk about quality, we must have quality teachers’ college too, not only the<br>
University of Goroka but other teachers’ colleges too. Then we are going to produce quality<br>
students in our country and they are going to come and look after us in the future.<br>
<br>
Right now we are playing up with the country by playing up with the education and |<br>
really want to ask the Minister for Higher Education, can you do away with the general courses<br>
in the University of Goroka and specialise only on teacher training?<br>
<br>
Mr DON POLYE — | think in the course of answering the question, I did say that there<br>
is a team that I have formed called the University Vice Chancellors Committee and I have<br>
charged them to look at the courses taught in UOG as well as other universities to see how we<br>
can rationalize. That means that if we must tell UOG to cut down or abolish the other programs<br>
and focus on teachers training only, we will do that. There are strong reasons to do that and I<br>
have already given the assurance and by the next 3-5 years’, you will see that UOG is trimmed,<br>
right-sized, corrected and a quality institution, giving quality teachers to Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
Yes, I agree, but I will do it strategically and properly through the Committee that was<br>
established. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr STEVEN PIM ~ Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for recognizing the people of<br>
Dei. Since I was elected I have not said anything in the Parliament, my people might think that<br>

Page 13:<br>
I am mute, but I was trying to learn from the senior and experienced statesman in this<br>
Parliament. I have observed and now I feel like I want to let out some air.<br>
(Members laughter)<br>
<br>
Mr STEVEN PIM - First of all, thank you, Prime Minister. You are a good man, all of<br>
us have appointed you so you must recognize us too. I thank our party leaders and our governors<br>
of the country. I am thankful that we have some powerful governors and we the members<br>
appreciate the inputs that you have made to our country. I thank my party leader, Honourable<br>
Peter O’Neill, you are a good man, and you have built a lot of infrastructure. There has been<br>
both good and bad but he did his part during his term.<br>
<br>
Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER — Honourable Member, I will allow you to ask your<br>
question to which Minister you want to ask.<br>
<br>
Appointment of NAC Managing Director<br>
<br>
Mr STEVEN PIM -Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. My question is directed to the<br>
Minister for Civil Aviation and the Prime Minister can take note.<br>
<br>
This is in regards to the National Airport Corporation. It is a very important entity and in<br>
the recent past there was a lot of politics in terms of fighting for the managing director’s<br>
position.<br>
<br>
I understand after Joseph Kintau, there was another Managing Director and after that<br>
Managing Director, Rex Kiponge was the Managing Director and he performed exceptionally<br>
well but he did not meet some of the criteria. He did not work with the Minister, so the Minister<br>
brought in some legislations and the Minister then rightfully took control over the organization,<br>
I assume.<br>
<br>
09/06<br>
<br>
My questions specifically relate to the critical issues of safety, security and compliance.<br>
With that I make reference to a recent Post-Courier article dated Friday 10th March 2023, and<br>
I quote, ‘National Airport Corporation Managing Director Acting position illegally extended’.<br>
The article reported that the National Airport Corporation Board had met on 3rd March 2023<br>
and illegally extended the Acting Managing Director’s term for another three months. And I<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 14:<br>
believe it was without the consultation of the NEC and contrary to the Civil Aviation Act, which<br>
we passed in December.<br>
<br>
My four questions to the Minister are as follows:<br>
<br>
(1) Does the board’s action make the acting managing director’s appointment illegal and<br>
therefore create a legal vacuum in the managing director’s position and if so, does this violates<br>
Aviation Security and the Security by the Airport Corporation not to mention violates our<br>
International Aviation Treaty and Obligations?<br>
<br>
(2) Can the Minister inform this House whether or not the Acting Managing Director’s<br>
term has been lawfully extended by NEC for a further three months as required by law under<br>
the Civil Aviation Act?<br>
<br>
(3) If so, can the Minister inform this House if the Acting Managing Director has<br>
qualified and met the mandatory prerequisites listed under Section 147 (a) (f) Subsection (4) of<br>
the Civil Aviation Act, which the Acting Managing Director must certify before appointed for<br>
a further three-month period, one of which is the fit and proper person certification by CASA<br>
amongst others?<br>
<br>
(4) Can the Minister inform this House when will the substantive position for Managing<br>
Director of National Airport Corporation be formally advertised so that a suitable candidate<br>
can be finally appointed to the position to help restore public confidence and stability at the<br>
National Airport Corporation?<br>
<br>
Because it oversees a lot of multimillion-kina projects in terms of airport developments<br>
and related infrastructures.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to thank the<br>
Honourable Member for his series of questions in relation to NAC. I will do my utmost best to<br>
answer these questions. But if he wishes to have specific information, please forward a written<br>
request through my office and I am happy to respond to it on the Floor of Parliament.<br>
<br>
In relation to NAC Board, as you know the Marape-Rosso Government has made<br>
amendments to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority Act in December last year. In which it gives<br>
the minister the initial authority to respond to adverse situations like the one we experienced in<br>
NAC where you have an acting managing director not following the rules and requirements<br>
provided by CASA and the constitution of NAC.<br>
<br>
14<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 15:<br>
So, we had some issues in relation to that which gave rise to the amendment to the Civil<br>
Aviation Safety Authority Act and allows the minister to intervene and correct whatever needs<br>
to be corrected with the managing director.<br>
<br>
In relation to that particular amendment and the processes; at the first instances, the<br>
minister under the Act and the amendment is able to install an acting managing director for<br>
NAC. And same principle applies to New Sky Limited as well which comes under the same<br>
arrangement.<br>
<br>
If there is an extension required, then it has to go to NEC which we are in the process<br>
now to have that facilitated through NEC. So, I have not made a decision as yet and likewise<br>
to NEC on the extension.<br>
<br>
But in relation to the NAC Board, I am making a decision on the extension and I want to<br>
clarify here that the board only has the power to recommend to the minister and its up to<br>
minister and NEC to make that final determination. And really not different to any other<br>
statutory body where the board makes the recommendation for the minister responsible to take<br>
it up with NEC to make that final determination.<br>
<br>
So, we are in that process now going through and I want to assure the Member that we<br>
are acting on it and the recommendations from the NAC Board has been given to the Minister.<br>
10/06<br>
<br>
I have looked at the recommendations itself and I have done my own review on what<br>
needs to be done in the best interest of NAC. I am moving in that space and in due course, you<br>
will be made aware of the final decision.<br>
<br>
So, at this stage and point in time, the current Acting Managing Director, Mr Joseph<br>
Tupuri will continue until NAC makes that final determination. So, right now, there’s a process<br>
I need to adhere to, I have to go through PSC to get the final endorsement and from there I go<br>
to NEC for the final approval. So, we are in this stage at the moment.<br>
<br>
So, in relation to the NAC board having the authority to make extension not entirely, it’s<br>
only a recommendation to the Minster, to the shareholder and then I&#x27;l facilitate from there on<br>
in the best interest of NAC going forward.<br>
<br>
In relation to the current Acting Managing Director, Mr Joseph Tupuri meeting all the<br>
requirements, yes, he has met all requirements, he’s a fit and proper person. There’s no<br>
argument on that and that has been recognized by or endorsed by CASA independently from<br>
my input or any intervention from my part. This side has no question mark to it.<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 16:<br>
Unfortunately, it’s really sad that we have a lot of politics within NAC and therefore we<br>
are seeing all this negativity and the challenges with the senior management, with the Minister,<br>
and it’s happening before the public space which is not good.<br>
<br>
So, hopefully going forward, the Minister can impose his authority in terms of what needs<br>
to be done in the best interest of NAC and the travelling public, making sure safety and security<br>
is not compromised in anyway.<br>
<br>
In relation to a permanent appointment to the position of managing director, we going<br>
through the process again, at this stage, we have to continue with an extension of acting with<br>
specific instructions for the Acting Managing Director to carry out before a final determination<br>
is made. The part of the process for the acting extension will have to take place because we<br>
need to advertise.<br>
<br>
And as part of the process for advertising, there firstly needs to be first a vacancy on the<br>
position of the managing director. So, we need to terminate the former Managing Director, Mr<br>
Rex Kiponge to create this vacancy. Once the vacancy is created, we can advertise and then<br>
ask for expression of interest to recruit the best person for this job.<br>
<br>
The Marape-Rosso Government, wants the best person for the job. We have no time for<br>
politics, we have no time for continuing interjection and interference with the government’s<br>
policy of the day.<br>
<br>
We have a clear mandate and focus to make sure that we deliver safety and security at<br>
the highest level for our travelling public. And that is not going to be compromised by any<br>
managing director going in there trying to take control and make sure their interest continues<br>
while the Government can’t do much.<br>
<br>
So, we have fixed everything and are moving forward in that space. Unfortunately, we<br>
are not tracking as fast as expected. But that is the process that we need to follow so that’s no<br>
shortcuts or fraud and we follow due process. When we reach decision making. we will get the<br>
final approval.<br>
<br>
Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER -— Honourable Minister, your time has lapsed.<br>
<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT — Mr Assistant Speaker, my apology, if the Member<br>
would like to ask me to answer any series of questions in writing, I’ll be happy to respond to<br>
them specifically. But I hope that my response today has helped us all gain understanding on<br>
the situation with NAC.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>

ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS<br>
Media Development Policy<br>
<br>
Mr TIMOTHY MASIU — Mr Assistant Speaker, thank you for giving me this<br>
opportunity again. I also want to thank the Member for Kokopo for those series of very<br>
important and good questions that need good answers, because this is what our people want to<br>
know and hear.<br>
<br>
(1) Clarify the intent and purposes of the Media Development Policy.<br>
<br>
The intent of the draft National Media Development Policy is to establish an enabling<br>
framework to recognise and develop the media sector in Papua New Guinea to support our<br>
development agenda.<br>
<br>
Current research and recent consultations have led us to the consolidation of four main<br>
issues within the Media sector:<br>
<br>
e Concerns on quality of journalism.<br>
<br>
By concerns, we observed the decline of quality investigative journalism, the impact of<br>
substandard reporting on the development agenda, and the concerns on conduct, ethics, and<br>
accountability of journalists.<br>
<br>
e Protection of journalists.<br>
<br>
My Ministry through the Department of ICT is currently collating both quantitative and<br>
qualitative data to verify the concerns on safety of journalists. We recognise, at the moment,<br>
that there is a lack of protection mechanisms for journalists.<br>
<br>
e Coordination of government information.<br>
<br>
My Ministry has for the last three years been looking at options on how to reorganise<br>
state-owned media outlets so that we coordinate dissemination of government information<br>
better. We recognise that as a government we are lacking coordination in government<br>
information.<br>
<br>
,        e Exclusion of SMEs.<br>
The Ministry has identified that SMEs, particularly in the modern media space are not<br>
recognised as professional and not given appropriate support.<br>
<br>
Based on these issues, the draft National Media Development Policy identifies four<br>
main objectives:<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 18:<br>
e Facilitate and coordinate access to information for citizens and ensuring the media<br>
provides accurate, impartial, and balanced reporting on issues of public interest, including<br>
those affecting marginalised or under-represented groups.<br>
<br>
e Encourage media diversity and support the representation of local and regional voices<br>
in media content and ownership.<br>
<br>
e Ensure media organisations adhere to ethical and professional standards and promote<br>
responsible journalism that respect local customs and cultures.<br>
<br>
e Promote civic engagement and participation in media issues, including through<br>
partnerships between media organisations, civil society groups and government agencies.<br>
<br>
By promoting access to information, media diversity, and responsible journalism, the<br>
policy aims to support the development of a more informed, engaged, and empowered<br>
citizenry in Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
(2) How will the new policy help protect and promote media freedom and enhance freedom of<br>
speech?<br>
<br>
Early this year, we released draft version 1 followed by a version 2 of the National<br>
Media Development Policy. In both versions of the draft policy, we proposed for the re-<br>
establishment of the PNG Media Council as an independent arm to represent and maintain<br>
standards within the media professions.<br>
<br>
The ministry maintains the view that the PNG Media Council through its self-governing<br>
model is not doing enough to grow the profession and hold journalists accountable.<br>
<br>
12/06<br>
<br>
Through the Ministry’s proposal, the PNG Media Council would be empowered, hold<br>
mainstream media outlets accountable and establish protection mechanism for journalists.<br>
<br>
I want to inform Members of Parliament that we have had a consultation workshop and<br>
as a result, my department is working on identifying a model where we can find common<br>
grounds with all stakeholders.<br>
<br>
(3) Does the new policy seek to regulate social media space; Meta, WhatsApp, et cetera?<br>
<br>
I want to remind all that this policy is not about regulating but more on building capacity<br>
and recognition within the media profession.<br>
<br>
The department is reviewing whether to include provisions for oversight on social media<br>
platforms and we will inform in version 3 of the draft policy.<br>
<br>
(4) Current Status of Policy.<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, my department will be publishing a consultation report this week.<br>
Following this, the consultation itself is leading us to undertake a series of nationwide survey<br>
to better define our media landscape and ascertain data necessary to consolidate issues<br>
highlighted in the recent consultation workshop.<br>
<br>
My department is expected to be releasing version four (4) of the draft policy towards<br>
the end of April. This version four will be subject to further feedback. I expect to take it to<br>
Cabinet as early as May and should legislation be proposed; we should also start drafting<br>
process in May.<br>
<br>
This review is just like all the other reviews undertaken by this Government under the<br>
leadership of our Prime Minister, Honourable James Marape, and the Deputy Prime Minister,<br>
Honourable John Rosso.<br>
<br>
This country will be reaching 50 years and no one has touched the media space but this<br>
Government is doing it now, and I want to thank all Members of Parliament in doing this.<br>
<br>
ANSWERS TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS<br>
Chimbu Polytech<br>
<br>
Mr DON POLYE ~- Mr Assistant Speaker, I ask leave of the Chair to respond to previous<br>
questions asked by the Member for Gumine on the Gumine or Chimbu Polytech.<br>
<br>
Leave granted.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I will be brief but I have a written response in detail addressing<br>
the issues on the Chimbu Polytech that is established in the Gumine District. I delivered the<br>
letter with the response in detail and I would like to address those questions in brief because<br>
the questions were asked publicly on the Floor of Parliament.<br>
<br>
The procedure is good, it is operated between the departments of Education and Higher<br>
Education. Some funds were allocated to the Education Department whilst some funds were<br>
parked in the Higher Education Department.<br>
<br>
There was around K23 million allocated to Education Department and my colleague<br>
Minister will address that with the Member. There is K20 million in the Higher Education<br>
Department that is still there and about K600 000 of that was spent on technical expenditure<br>
and K19 million is still there.<br>

<br>
One major contract has been awarded by the Cabinet and six to seven others were<br>
awarded by the District Procurement Commission, through the authority of the National<br>
Procurement Commission. I have given details to the Honourable Member but the work was<br>
put on hold because of the elections. Now I have instructed my department to work with the<br>
Education Department to administer and implement the program. I would like to ask the<br>
Member to work with us in implementing it.<br>
<br>
The total money allocated by Marape-Rosso Government was K43 million, and of that,<br>
only K600 000 was spent from the money allocated to the Department of Higher Education. In<br>
regards to the K23 million in the National Education Department, the information I have is,<br>
that money is in the trust account and it will be expended. I urge the Honourable Member, on<br>
behalf of the people of Chimbu, to communicate with the Minister for Education.<br>
<br>
So, the project is on foot; I have instructed them to implement the program. We will work<br>
with this district and the District Procurement Commission to administer. I have given the<br>
details to him to follow through, and I urge him to work with me.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker.<br>

TREATY DOCUMENT — PAPUA NEW GUINEA — REPUBLIC OF PALAU -<br>
AGREEMENT RELATING TO AIR SERVICES — PAPER AND STATEMENT —<br>
MOTION TO TAKE NOTE OF PAPER<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT (Namatanai — Minister for Transport and Civil<br>
Aviation) — Mr Assistant Speaker, pursuant to statute, I present the following treaty document:<br>
Treaty Document — Independent State of Papua New Guinea — Republic of<br>
Palau —Agreement relating to Air Services<br>
I ask leave of the Parliament to make a statement in connection with the paper.<br>
20<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 21:<br>
Leave granted.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the document relates to the agreement between the Independent<br>
State of Papua New Guinea and Government of the Republic of Palau relating to air services.<br>
<br>
I would like to make this ministerial statement on behalf of the PNG Transport Sector to<br>
demonstrate the Marape-Rosso Government’s Connect PNG Policy Agenda for the three<br>
modes of transportations; land, sea and air, in providing that link between our domestic<br>
transport connectivity with the North Pacific Aviation Regional Connectivity.<br>
<br>
Palau is a tiny Micronesian Atoll State located approximately 2,338 kilometres to the<br>
north-west of Port Moresby in the Northern Pacific Ocean and traveling there by air would take<br>
about three hours and 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
Papua New Guinea has yet to develop bilateral relations with Palau, although some initial<br>
discussions were held in 2018, when officials of our two countries met to commence<br>
discussions that progressed in 2019 and in 2020, only to be caught in the inevitable effects of<br>
Covid-19 and its devastating impacts which severed further plans of bringing the proposal to<br>
full realization.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, although the experiences of Covid-19 were devastating, its<br>
aftermath brought with it renewed hope for countries around the world including Palau, and in<br>
this case, the commencement of Air Niugini’s scheduled services connecting Palau with<br>
Brisbane through Port Moresby is a move in the right direction not only for Palau but also for<br>
PNG in terms of promoting trade, commerce and tourism.<br>
<br>
In mid last year 2022, the Australian Government through its Aid Program encompassing<br>
the Pacific Island region embarked on programs targeted at addressing development gaps<br>
within this geographical sites and flagged reliable air connectivity as a plight of the people of<br>
Palau, which ultimately required priority towards address.<br>
<br>
Thus, through the Australian Aid Program, a procurement process through public tender<br>
was facilitated calling for bids from airlines domiciled within the Pacific region.<br>
<br>
15/06<br>
<br>
The tender was seeking airlines with capacity and good safety record to provide the<br>
required air connectivity for the people of Palau. Air Niugini as PNG’s designated international<br>
airline placed its bid and emerged as a successful winner of this tender process.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, specifically, the flight routes that Air Niugini was awarded the<br>
contract to service are from Port Moresby to Kororo, Palau; Port Moresby to Brisbane, and<br>
<br>
21<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 22:<br>
vice versa. And these routes shall be subsidized by the Australian Government’s Aid Program.<br>
These routes shall provide more air connectivity for the people of Palau to Brisbane via Port<br>
Moresby and with connections to further destinations within the region and beyond.<br>
<br>
In October 2022, the Department of Transport was informed by Air Niugini about its<br>
success under the connectivity tender facilitated by the Australian Government’s Department<br>
of Foreign Affairs and Trade and for scheduled flights to be performed connecting this specific<br>
route.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, therefore, to ensure compliance with mandatory bilateral air<br>
services requirements, officials of PNG and Palau convened in Manila on the 2nd of February<br>
2023, and negotiated the PNG-Palau proposed bilateral air service agreement text, ultimately<br>
reaching mutual agreement. The agreement text was then initiated by respective heads of our<br>
two countries after the conclusion of the negotiations.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the initial text signifies its acceptance as the agreed framework<br>
connecting the two countries towards the provision of scheduled air services and is fit to<br>
proceed through respective national constitutional requirements for enactment as a bilateral<br>
treaty instrument.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, to comply with PNG’s constitutional requirements, an NEC<br>
submission was finalized and presented by me as a sponsor seeking;<br>
<br>
(a) acceptance of the initial text of the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service Agreement,<br>
<br>
(b) approval for me to sign the instrument as the duly mandated minister,<br>
<br>
(c) approval for me to present the signed instrument in Parliament for ratification in<br>
accordance with Section 117(3) of the Constitution and<br>
<br>
(d) for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to exchange PNG’s instruments of ratification<br>
after all constitutional requirements have been met.<br>
<br>
Once Cabinet approval is sought, I will have the honour to counter sign the PNG-Palau<br>
Bilateral Air Service Agreement alongside my counterpart minister in Palau.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, pending the completion of the national and statutory requirements<br>
necessary to formalize this agreement, it was agreed that the initial bilateral air service<br>
agreement shall have provisional effect from the date of its initialling, that’s 2nd February 2023<br>
until it comes into force subject to Article 21 of the agreement.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, Article 21 of the Agreement specifies that the agreement shall<br>
enter into force when the parties have notified each other in writing that their respective<br>
requirements for the entry into force of this agreement have been satisfied. Therefore, once<br>
<br>
22<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 23:<br>
PNG and Palau notify each other in writing that the respective requirements for entry into force<br>
of this agreement have been met, the agreement shall enter into force.<br>
16/06<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, thank you for giving me the Floor to deliver this ministerial<br>
statement as the Minister responsible for Transport and Civil Aviation. I now commend this<br>
ministerial statement relating to the establishment of the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service<br>
Agreement to this honourable House.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE (Tari-Pori — Prime Minister) — I move that Parliament take note<br>
of this statement by the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation, and I would also like to<br>
make few comments in support of it.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I would like to appreciate the leadership of the Minister when he<br>
assumed the role as the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation. The sector was in disarray<br>
but he managed to bring to the table a strong view to reorganize it.<br>
<br>
We are not here to please people or to do favours for them. The work we do must be for<br>
the greater good of all. The Minister was trying to raise the civil aviation sector that was in<br>
disarray. He brought into picture a strong arm, mind and will to resolve and make this sector<br>
work. He is slowly and surely cleaning up the place and I rise to commend his leadership in<br>
this sector.<br>
<br>
And speaking on the PNG-Palau Bilateral Air Service Agreement that was signed and<br>
presented by the Minister in Parliament for the benefit of our understanding and appreciation,<br>
Palau may seem like a small country, but let me impress on all of us that it is an important<br>
country.<br>
<br>
Palau is located between the Philippines, Japan, PNG, Australia, Micronesia and other<br>
Pacific island countries. There is a connectivity that needs to be made with Palau. Air Niugini<br>
on its own, wouldn’t be able to make that connectivity. I just want to place on record the<br>
appreciation for the Australian Government support. They need that connectivity to be made.<br>
airlines in the region bided for this service but our national airline, Air Niugini was successful.<br>
<br>
It may seem like a small connection into a small nation in the Pacific, but there is huge<br>
potential for PNG in this route to benefit from tourism and travellers’ spin-offs. For instance,<br>
as the route of uplifting travellers into Palau.<br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 24:<br>
Palau and the Micronesia is an alternate tourism spot in our part of the world. The<br>
connections from Australia and PNG into Palau, and hopefully down the line, will look at<br>
connecting a little bit north-west from Palau into Philippines, as a request I received from the<br>
President of Palau, who happens to be a good friend of mine. There is a possibility and<br>
connectivity into Philippines because there is a lot of travel from Palau and the north-west<br>
Pacific into Philippines, onward to China and Japan.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I just want to give comfort to this House, that this is not a wasted<br>
endeavour. To maintain connectivity to Micronesia and Pacific family of nations is important.<br>
They all look upon PNG as a big brother nation. Micronesia is an important part of our region.<br>
We are connected by land, air and as well by the resources in the sea. The combined<br>
Micronesian nations territory and the western Pacific Melanesian territory has close to 60 per<br>
cent of the world’s tuna supply.<br>
<br>
Making connectivity and maintaining support with the Micronesians enables our nation<br>
and this small nation partnership at all levels. This may seem like a small gesture but it is very<br>
important serving these Micronesia nations by linking and bringing them closer<br>
17/06<br>
<br>
I just want to also inform under the Minister’s watch that New-sky Pacific is an important<br>
subsidiary company under the watch of the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation that is<br>
now earning revenue as a result of us controlling Air traffic. The flight that passes over us,<br>
Western Pacific and the Northwest Pacific especially the Micronesian countries. Through New-<br>
sky, we are able to manage the skies of Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and of the Micronesian<br>
nations. We want to extend our foot prints so that we can assist these small island nations in<br>
their air space.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I was privileged to be part of the people at the flight control at<br>
Jackson’s when we were dispatching travelers who were inbound or going out after APEC in<br>
2018. And how well our young Papua New Guineans serves. It was about 20 of them,<br>
professional young Papua New Guineans all under 30. They were able to shepherd in the flights<br>
of the World leaders. You know all world leaders attended but they were able to dispatch them<br>
professionally and there were moments up in the sky when they were finally exiting PNG<br>
boundaries’ airspace and the flights were able to connect back to our flight control and bid<br>
Papua New Guinea farewell, that we had handled them very well. I got goose bumps to see that<br>
our own flight controllers were competent in shepherding in not ordinary flights but leaders of<br>
world’s powerful economies.<br>
<br>

How they were able to dispatch Russia, USA, and China flights, and we are not that bad<br>
in our country. Yes, we have our challenges but as a bigger nation in the Pacific, placed<br>
strategically in the middle of Pacific and Asia, you go east, west, north and south but you can’t<br>
ignore the big face of Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
This sort of work done by the Minister and his team to bid for us to be the flight carrier<br>
into Palau but more importantly interface with Palau people, in my view has many potentials<br>
that connectivity to smaller Pacific Island nations means well for us.<br>
<br>
PNG will also stand to benefit from the flight flow that we are connecting from Australia,<br>
PNG and Palau.<br>
<br>
Let me also inform this House that we are looking at direct flights, from PNG to China<br>
and also taking in the massive inbound tourists of China who want to fly into PNG to make<br>
transition into deep Pacific. Pacific in Melanesia, Pacific in Polynesia and Micronesia. These<br>
are part of the connectivity that we are putting in place and the Minister unbeknownst to all of<br>
us is really hard at work taking charge of this important sector to ensure that our transport and<br>
especially our airline sector in this instance is being served well.<br>
<br>
I want to commend the Minister, small as it may be in Palau but a big step in ensuring<br>
that PNG service providers or whether its airline service or associate airline support services<br>
are being able to serve the regions closest to us as we mobilize support in the family of nations<br>
in the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr ASSISTANT SPEAKER- Honourable Deputy Opposition leader.<br>
<br>
Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA (Kiriwina-Goodenough) — Thank you, Mr Assistant<br>
Speaker. I would like to also support this paper and the Minister, and the Prime Minister for<br>
their contribution to the paper that has now been presented on behalf of the Opposition.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, first of all 1 want to commend the Minister. Yesterday, he<br>
presented a very important paper and a very encouraging paper to this House and that is the<br>
CASA paper. It shows that Papua New Guinea has developed itself in the airline industry and<br>
the safety standards of Air Niugini. The bureaucrats who are in there are being very watchful<br>
and it shows the great contribution this management of CASA has done in the service of our<br>
industry. Therefore, the CASA must be given thumbs up.<br>
<br>
The report that you have presented yesterday has brought joy and comfort to us, the<br>
leaders and the travelling public.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
This document today is a testament of what you have presented yesteray. Without CASA<br>
doing the right thing in your report yesterday, I don’t think the Australian Government would<br>
have given us the contract. Now because CASA has done the right thing today which you have<br>
presented another positive report of Australia recognising Papua New Guinea, we are their<br>
children because at one stage, Australia cared for us.<br>
<br>
But the bigger picture here is that Australia must consider recognising the whole of the<br>
Pacific. And now we have seen their true wisdom through AusAID in awarding the contract to<br>
service Palau. I was fortunate enough to be on the flight from Brisbane to Port Moresby on<br>
Tuesday and they announced that flight to Jacksons Airport, Port Moresby and onto Palau. And<br>
I was amazed with the announcement that it was a connection flight from Port Moresby to<br>
Palau. And today you have confirmed by presenting this report and its very encouraging news.<br>
<br>
The Prime Minister mentioned also that it opens up new ventures into Palau and we know<br>
that Palau is a small Atoll Island with some thousand people living on that Island.<br>
<br>
The President of Palau is also a very strong vocal citizen of the Pacific when it comes to<br>
climate change issues. I have attended certain meetings with him when I was in my capacity as<br>
the minister in the past. I heard him debate strongly about the Pacific and we as the bigger<br>
brother of the Pacific must also recognise our small brothers in the Pacific Regions.<br>
<br>
Our planes fly to Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Fiji and in Palau it’s a population of 18<br>
000 people, therefore we must take care of them as well. Why I say this is because PNG has<br>
surplus food especially vegetables in the highlands and now we open up a route that can take<br>
our products there.<br>
<br>
In Palau, tourism industry is really big compared to PNG and the flights into Palau is<br>
mainly tourists flying in and out. Therefore, its an opportunity for us to venture into the food<br>
markets. Some of the things that we can also learn as Papua New Guineans is, what are some<br>
of the things small nations are performing correctly in terms of tourism that we can also adapt<br>
into our country.<br>
<br>
With that I want to thank the Government of Australia for this successful bid that we<br>
have won where the planes are now servicing the route. I also want to thank the presence of<br>
Australia not only in PNG, Solomon Islands and Fiji but have reached out further to Palau.<br>
<br>
I also want to thank our government for opening this route from Australia to Palau. Which<br>
gives us the courage and comfort that the next bid that comes on, PNG can put its hands up for<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 27:<br>
it because CASA has done a good job with the report yesterday and we have won this bid today,<br>
therefore any future bid we can be successful.<br>
<br>
Thank you and congratulations Minister.<br>
<br>
Mr LUTHER WENGE (Morobe) — Mr Assistant Speaker, I rise to thank the Minister<br>
for Transport and Civil Aviation and to respect him and give him honor as to his leadership.<br>
Yesterday, I congratulated him and commended him for a job well done as a leader in making<br>
sure that people working in the administration of CASA comply with the rules nationally and<br>
internationally.<br>
<br>
And the benefits that we gained as long as we comply with the rules and one of the<br>
benefits is to create confidence not only in PNG but in the international community. That in<br>
the operation of the aircraft in and outside of the country we are more capable of doing it<br>
because we have a record of safety.<br>
<br>
19/06<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I said yesterday that the international community will trust us<br>
when we are strictly complying with the rules, trust us in the operations of the aircraft, trust us<br>
in the operation of airdrome and people who work in the airdrome, trust us in relation to the<br>
pilots who fly people to their respective destination in this world. That by virtues of that trust<br>
many more places of destination in the world will be opened up.<br>
<br>
And today, I didn’t know that you are going to present a Bilateral Treaty Agreement with<br>
the country of Palau and Papua New Guinea. In relation to the transportation between Palau by<br>
air to Brisbane and from Brisbane back to Papua New Guinea. That Treaty is signed between<br>
the nations of Papua New Guinea and Palau. And that is one of the confidences that we have<br>
gained from the people and the leadership of Palau.<br>
<br>
And not just the two countries but the third country comes in, which is Australia. Which<br>
sets the confidence of our management of the rules as per mentioned and complying with the<br>
the CASA safety rules internally and externally. I commend you Minister.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, we are constituted of people from Polynesia, Micronesia,<br>
Melanesia and we are the indigenous people of Pacific. We lived here since time immemorial<br>
before the others have come to our region like Australia and New Zealand or even to some<br>
other parts in these three regional countries.<br>
<br>
We are the indigenous people, we have lived here for too long. Our relationship extends<br>
far and we need to encourage the promotion of our relationship; promotion that we are<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 28:<br>
Melanesian, Polynesian, Micronesian. We belong to one region and one people. It should be<br>
promoted and what are the other better ways to do it, I think this is the way forward.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I commend the Honourable Prime Minister, James Marape and<br>
few of his predecessors, Honourable Mr Peter O’ Neill, Sir Michael Thomas Somare and all<br>
other Prime Ministers, they have made sure that we the Pacific are united in our common cause.<br>
The common cause that we know better, our relationship and the things that hold us together<br>
as a region; Micronesia, Polynesia or Melanesia.<br>
<br>
Those who have come to join us the Caucasoid Australians and New Zealanders, other<br>
genetical race that have come to join us, the Mongoloids, but we are the original ones in the<br>
Pacific and we must tell them that we belong here and they must become part of us. One way<br>
to do is to bring ourselves to each other by boat and by plane.<br>
<br>
I want to commend the Government, the Honourable Prime Minister, Minister and the<br>
others. This a very good bilateral treaty that has been entered into. I agree with the Opposition<br>
spokesman. That we are Pacific. I went to get an admission in a New Zealand Bar, I saw the<br>
market full of taro, the breadfruit leaves and fruits, aibika and tapioca, all brought in from the<br>
Pacific to New Zealand. I saw it and I said, oh that’s lovely.<br>
<br>
20/06<br>
<br>
As the Opposition representative said, by virtue of the operation of the plane we can<br>
transport our goods and feed all of the Pacific and those who have come from faraway to live<br>
in the Pacific. We have taught them to eat our food and be accustomed to it. They will help us<br>
to eat the food. We must promote our food that is produced in Micronesia, Polynesia and<br>
Melanesia.<br>
<br>
I agree with the spokesperson from the Opposition that plenty of food have been<br>
produced in the Highlands; different types of vegetables that have been produced and we need<br>
to transport them by air because it’s going to take a long time via sea transport. Because of the<br>
continued flights during the week, we can be able to transport our food over there. Not just the<br>
food, Mr Assistant Speaker, we can transport many other things.<br>
<br>
The Palauans don’t know much about Papua New Guinea and what we produce here and<br>
by virtue of the operations of that flight, they can come here and see what we produce here.<br>
For instance, the Indonesians didn’t know about our cheesepop or that we produce the SNAX<br>
biscuits. Of course when they were introduced to our SNAX biscuits it has become a very<br>
delicious and favorites biscuit for them in Indonesia.<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 29:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, things like this can happen if we produce something that is good<br>
for their consumption, they will come here. And also we are Pacific, we are Polynesians, we<br>
are Melanesians, we are Micronesian. Papua New Guinea has a lot of land here, plenty of land<br>
in Morobe Province and Nadzab is going to become an international airport. I said yesterday<br>
and I would like to thank the Government for making sure that it eventuates in the future very<br>
shortly.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, we must give them land and make this Papua New Guinea colorful,<br>
not just full of Melanesian people, but Micronesian and Polynesian mix them all up so that they<br>
look different and nice. So we should give them land here so they can come and make business<br>
here.<br>
<br>
Secondly, it makes it easier for the tourists, when we have tourists coming from the<br>
international community into Papua New Guinea. When they come to realize that there is such<br>
as route between these two countries they will want to travel. They can come transit here and<br>
spend some of their money here and then fly direct to Palau from here or to Australia.<br>
<br>
Mr Prime Minister, with the greatest respect, we don’t stop there, we can fly direct to<br>
Vanuatu, Kiribati and then to Tahiti. They have been influenced by the French people, but the<br>
Polynesians, Melanesians we are part of the Pacific Islands so flights must not only stop in<br>
Palau but must be extended to other Pacific nations so the world will know that we are Pacific<br>
and we are united and solid. And when you come to Papua New Guinea, you can explore other<br>
countries where Papua New Guinean planes can take you. This is a very important bilateral<br>
treaty that we’re going to sign and now I feel excited for myself because I know that I can take<br>
a Morobean delegation to Palau and maybe leave them there and come back or maybe take<br>
some from Palau and come and leave them here.<br>
<br>
But this flight will make us united, as the Prime Minister said and I quite agree we have<br>
to help our brothers. This flight will enable us to visit Palau and other parts of the Pacific and<br>
also come to know them very well. Mr Prime Minister I will support this treaty without a doubt.<br>
Mr Minister, I will support this treaty to be ratified by the Parliament Thank you.<br>
