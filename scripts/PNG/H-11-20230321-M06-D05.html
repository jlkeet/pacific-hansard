QUESTIONS<br>
100 Per cent of Inland tax<br>
Mr LUTHER WENGE - Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity<br>
to ask my question. My question will be directed to the Minister for Treasury. Is he present in<br>
the Chamber? Thank you<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker and the Minister for Treasury, Morobe Province is a very difficult<br>
country, tough mountains to cross and tough mountains to build roads, and heavy seas to cross.<br>
We are finding difficulties to bring road to Kabwum and Finschhafen, Sirisiri to<br>
Menyamya, Werewere to Garaina, and along the coast of Salamaua to the border of Morobe<br>
and Oro province. It has been very difficult to build roads in these places. Morobe is a big<br>
country, a country within the country of Papua New Guinea. That’s why I am asking, I will be<br>
1<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 4:<br>
short but the question is very important. We’re delivering almost K3 billion in DST to this<br>
country. Our people in the Morobe Province are suffering everywhere.<br>
<br>
I fought the war against the Government and I won it and we’re sitting on 60 and 40. But<br>
that is not sufficient because it has not been fully implemented.<br>
<br>
Now today I ask that you give us 100 per cent on the inland tax. You can keep the<br>
important levy tax, company tax, income tax, those taxes you can keep them because we’re a<br>
nation that is why I have to be considerate. But give us 100 per cent inland tax which is almost<br>
about K1 billion, I can take care of everything.<br>
<br>
02/05<br>
<br>
All the substantial problems of Morobe Province accumulate because the Government is<br>
withholding that tax grant meant for the province. If this happens, you can kiss Morobe<br>
goodbye because we will have substantial funding enough to sustain the province.<br>
<br>
(1) Can the Minister work with the IRC and ensure that we get the 100 per cent of<br>
inland tax?<br>
<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY -— Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank the good Governor for his<br>
very simple and short question in regards to the goods and service taxes and in particular, the<br>
inland tax where he is requesting whether the National Government may consider giving<br>
Morobe Province 100 percent of that amount.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, GST including inland tax make up a very important part of our<br>
Government revenue plan for this year.<br>
<br>
Just by way of back ground purpose, for this year we are projecting into receiving around<br>
K14.9 billion of which GST will be around K3.2 billion.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, inland tax, GST including all the other seven streams of tax are all<br>
part of the Governments revenue plan and whist the National Government. The Government<br>
would like to give more GST back the provinces and will get to review the 60-40 percent break-<br>
up<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, unfortunately, the revenue we collect from all provinces are put into<br>
a general basket and from there the Government allocates to important areas of the core services<br>
expenditure like health, education and the law and justice sector and of course our capital<br>
Budget. It is all about getting the right balance.<br>
<br>
As much as I would like to be a populist-Minister and say to you now that we would be<br>
happy to consider that, it places me under great pressure in terms of raising revenue.<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 5:<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, what I can do, is to have you and your team to sit down with us at<br>
the Treasury Department and explore other ways in which you can raise internal revenue in<br>
which you can benefit greatly. If you did attend one of our provincial government Budget<br>
Sessions you would have heard me encourage you and everyone to embark on the labour<br>
mobility program, that program is advanced now very quickly and that is one area where<br>
emphasis on governors to participate. I will look forward to our meeting to help you raise more<br>
funds for Morobe Province.<br>
<br>
03/05<br>
Safety for the Air Transport<br>
<br>
Mr PATRICK BASA — Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. My questions are directed to<br>
the Minister for Civil Aviation and Transport, I would also like the Ministers for State<br>
Enterprise and the Treasurer to take note.<br>
<br>
I have noticed a growing number of incidents and accidents involving third airlines in<br>
recent months, especially in our rural areas. Also, Air Niugini disrupted flights in and out of<br>
Port Moresby when the Government could not resolve the Forex issue.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker and leaders, I wish to remind you all that our capital city is connected<br>
to other towns and cities in our country. The air plane crashes in Western Highlands and<br>
Western Province highlight the fact that air transport connection is the only link to many remote<br>
communities in our country like my electorate in Kabwum.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, a few years ago Air Niugini announced plans to link up more<br>
airstrips or airfields and introduce a smaller twin propeller fleet under Link PNG level. The<br>
planes started to land in smaller airstrips like Wapenamanda, Kundiawa, Tufi, and Losuia to<br>
the delight of our people but sadly these air transport services beyond provincial towns and<br>
into strategic airstrips were seized.<br>
<br>
So, in the meantime, all we hear about under this Government is Connect PNG by roads<br>
which gives little detail about other modes of transportation which are air and sea.<br>
<br>
My series of questions are as follows:<br>
<br>
(1) In relation to the safety of the flying public using the rural airstrips system, can the<br>
Minister explain what he is doing about the frequent incidents involving light air crafts?<br>
<br>
(2) How much money has been allocated by the Government in 2023 Appropriation to<br>
support the system to assure the safety of our people who are using airstrips and light air crafts?<br>
<br>
3<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
(3) Mr Minister, for the Department of Works the Prime Minister talked about the<br>
Connect PNG Program, can the Minister explain how the aviation transport sector features in<br>
the current Government’s Connect PNG Program?<br>
<br>
(4) Can the Minister provide real figures detailing costings for the program from<br>
relevant policy documents and how it is captured in the 2023 Appropriation?<br>
<br>
(5) When is the Minister planning to present a ministerial statement detailing how<br>
exactly are you planning to connect PNG through the air transport services?<br>
<br>
(6) Is the Minister aware of the status of the Air Niugini Link PNG Program? Do you<br>
have any plans to revive, improve or expand that service targeting our rural communities?<br>
<br>
(7) In relation to Rural Airstrips Agencies, can the Minister tell us his plans for RAA to<br>
ensure that the authority or agency works for the benefit of our rural communities that depend<br>
on airstrips and light air crafts?<br>
<br>
(8) How much money has been allocated to this sector agency including RAA, CASA,<br>
and AIC because there are officers in these agencies who are operating without no money at<br>
all?<br>
<br>
(9) What is happening with the Cadet Funding Program earmarked for identified<br>
airstrips in our country?<br>
<br>
(10) Can the Minister, assure my people of Kabwum and other districts in remote areas<br>
in Morobe, that we are not forgotten in the Cadet Funding and other funding programs as well?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.<br>
<br>
04/05<br>
<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT -— You can put that in writing and forward it to me<br>
because there are series of questions and I need to answer them with specific answers as you<br>
want. I am happy to respond and I will do my best to answer most of them.<br>
<br>
In relation to providing answers, some preliminary background information on some of<br>
the questions you’ve asked specifically in relation to the safety of aircraft, most of the<br>
companies operating the aircrafts are responsible to meet those requirements under the permit<br>
or license to operate.<br>
<br>
The role of CASA is to try to manage and to make sure that they meet compliance and<br>
that is what it is doing, but if the companies find that they have some financial problems, some<br>
companies could be short cutting in trying to continuing the scheduled flights in the remote<br>
areas. I am not saying that this particular company is doing that, but how I see the incident that<br>
occurred in recent time, they explained in case the company has come through some struggles<br>
<br>
4<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
because we have some FX issues, maybe not bringing parts on time to maintain the aircrafts<br>
and other stuffs like that. So, maybe through making shortcuts like that has caused the incident<br>
that we&#x27;ve seen in the media.<br>
<br>
In relation to these incidents, I would like to also state that there&#x27;s a current investigation<br>
on foot. I am happy to give you an update on actually what the cause is, whether it is a company<br>
pilot or a mechanical error so that we can be aware and understand.<br>
<br>
In relation to the airstrips, yes I support you. We need to open our airstrips, especially<br>
the rural airstrips throughout country. We need to focus on the airstrips and try to look at it<br>
whether to let it remain close or open it again and put to operation. Most of these airstrips have<br>
been neglected over time and this is why we are going back. Maybe, about 10 years ago, the<br>
National Government has signed an agreement with one of the third level airline companies to<br>
operate Rural Airstrip Agency (RAA) to take charge and responsible of all the rural airstrips<br>
because rural airstrips fall under RAA and they do not fall under the National Airport<br>
Corporation (NAC). The NAC is responsible for the national airports and it’s terminals as<br>
categorised under the CASA where big planes can land. The CASA certifies those aircrafts that<br>
carries more than 20 passengers and they are eligible to land on the airport. Those aircrafts that<br>
carry less than 20 passengers will land at airstrips provided that the airstrips meet the<br>
requirements for the sizes of the aircrafts. So the aircrafts that carries more than 20 passengers<br>
is referred to as Small Tail Dash-8 that can actually operate on the rural airstrips but provided<br>
that it is certified and signed off by the CASA.<br>
<br>
For the airline company that wishes to operate in the rural airstrips, the decision is up<br>
to them and the management provided that the CASA gives them certification to land on those<br>
airstrips. So, the process is like that.<br>
<br>
In relation to Connect PNG program, as the Minister responsible for Transport and Civil<br>
Aviation, it is this Marape-Rosso Government’s focus. The Connect PNG is not only by road.<br>
We are looking into transport sector on the land as well as the sea. However, towards the end<br>
of last term, there has been some special decisions have made for the sea; we have helped 2<br>
districts, namely North Bougainville and Talasea to counterpart to purchase some ships to bring<br>
services into their districts. About K5 million each as counter funding has been released already<br>
and is awaiting for the district and the provincial government to put their counterpart in to those<br>
vessels that they feel will serve their needs, in terms of passenger and cargo.<br>
<br>
5<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
05/05<br>
<br>
So, this is the Marape/Rosso Government’s intention to go down and try to support the<br>
Connect PNG by sea. I am also in discussion to review four ferries with the capacity of 140<br>
passengers with little space for cargo as well. The configuration which we will have to make<br>
is maybe reduce the 140 passengers’ space to only 70 so we can utilize the remaining space for<br>
cargo so that the vessel can at least carry some cargo as well in case it has to. The space would<br>
cater for our farmers’ produce to the markets in a safe environment.<br>
<br>
We are still trying to identify the location of these ferries but I stress in these processes<br>
that we need to give the operations of these ferries to existing operators who are already<br>
operating some shipping companies. There is no point for the government to take charge of<br>
these responsibilities and run the ferries by itself.<br>
<br>
The government is the Legislator, not the manager of the operations of the ferries. So this<br>
is something I need to clarify here; that are looking at existing shipping companies to try and<br>
support us when the ferries arrives. We will consult and get everyone’s input in terms of where<br>
we will put those ferries as a pilot project.<br>
<br>
So, this compliments now the Connect PNG Program where you have the roads, the<br>
ferries for the sea and rural airports or airstrips for air transport.<br>
<br>
May I also make it clear that, I am the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister therefore |<br>
do not have any jurisdiction over Air Niugini. The delays and aircraft issues, etc., are their<br>
problems to deal with. These issues fall under my colleague minister for SOE; that is his<br>
department and I will not comment on those areas.<br>
<br>
In relation to my Ministerial Statement as you asked; it’s actually here with me. Only<br>
waiting for the date when I will be given the floor to present it and update the House on the<br>
financial audit that took place. It is a requirement by the Minister responsible to come here and<br>
present to the House the financial position of 2020 and 2021 in relation to CASA and operations<br>
under Transport and Civil Aviation. The statement has been approved by the appropriate<br>
authority and is already here with me, ready to be presented.<br>
<br>
In relation to Link PNG, once again, it’s a question to be directed to the Minister for SOE<br>
who can enlighten you a little bit more on what is the Business Plan for this Link PNG Concept<br>
that Air Niugini undertook some time back where they also bought aircrafts to serve these<br>
airstrips under that program.<br>
<br>
In relation to Rural Airstrip Agencies, what is it doing? We have close to 200 airstrips that we<br>
<br>
have identified within the country. Some are operating while others are not. So, we are going<br>
<br>
through the process now to identify these airstrip and airports. We’ve put in the necessary<br>
6<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 9:<br>
budget component to support but there is an arrangement that’s in place right now that if district<br>
members or governors wish to have their rural airstrips up and running, then you will have to<br>
sign a MOA with the Rural Airstrip Agency and provide counterpart funding to support you in<br>
order to maintain, resurrect or open up your airstrips.<br>
<br>
06/05<br>
<br>
This arrangement is in place and I encourage you all to explore and contact RRA and<br>
enquire on the process on how you can get support to open up your airstrips.<br>
<br>
In terms of RRA funding, there has been some constraints in getting the necessary<br>
funding to support rural airstrips and this is something that we are trying to manage at this<br>
point. If we had 20 Members approach us and wanted assistance to re-open or maintain their<br>
airstrips as soon as possible, it will be difficult as we need to sort out funding issues to get the<br>
support mechanism happening. From our end the RRA has engineers and competent staff<br>
available to assist you but obviously funding plays an important part.<br>
<br>
For the Civil Aviation Development Investment Program, some of the projects are still<br>
on foot and nearing completion. Once those projects, especially terminals or airports are<br>
completed, I will inform the House and we will be made aware of which ones I am referring to<br>
today. On the issue of how many airstrips, airport terminals constructed so far under the<br>
CADIP1 that have been open. majority of these have been opened and we only have two left<br>
and I am pretty sure one is Nadzab and the other I need to find out and let you all know.<br>
<br>
In relation to CADIP2, we are making progress and I thank ADB and the Marape-Rosso<br>
Government for their continued support in this project. I also thank the former Minister<br>
Honourable Don Polye, who began this initiative and we have followed through under this<br>
government. This is a good example of a government that inherited a policy on CADIP projects<br>
and continued to support it. We have seen the importance of these in our rural areas and<br>
therefore are continuing to support it without criticizing the issue.<br>
<br>
CADIP 2 has been signed and it must be understood that the funding for this is greater<br>
than CADIP1 and some airstrips have already been earmarked including Kiunga, Central<br>
Bougainville, Arawa and Wewak. In relation to Rural airstrips, we requested for funding for<br>
four rural airstrips also under the ADB arrangements. For those four airstrips, we are yet to<br>
identify them but the agreement for funding has already been signed and we are just following<br>
the process through and will make the announcement on which airstrips have been identified.<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 10:<br>
The initial project will begin for the four airstrips will be pilot project funded by support<br>
ADB. If this project works well. As we already have 200 rural airstrips sitting out there, some<br>
are in operation and some are not. Most of these airstrips need funding to get them going again.<br>
<br>
This is probably in reference to his last question, but I wish to ask through the Chair if<br>
the Member could have his questions in writing to me then I will be happy to give a detailed<br>
response to the Member.<br>
<br>
07/05<br>
Supplementary Question<br>
Certification of Rural Airstrips in Morobe Province<br>
<br>
Mr LUTHER WENGE - My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Civil<br>
Aviation, and it is in regards to the airstrips in Morobe Province. Morobe has 30 airstrips<br>
compared to any other province in PNG; of that 30 airstrips, 20 are abandoned.<br>
<br>
When I was in Government, I made sure that planes travel to those airstrips. I am looking<br>
for inspectors to inspect the airstrips that are now abandoned. J have told the people living close<br>
to these airstrips to clean and get them ready.<br>
<br>
My question is:<br>
<br>
(1) Can the Minister provide me an inspector immediately?<br>
<br>
] do not need money or planes, I need an inspector to inspect the airstrips and certify that<br>
it can be operational. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT -— Thank you, Honourable Governor for his question.<br>
He is one of the proactive and determined Governors to bring development into Morobe<br>
Province. I recognize you, your enthusiasm and your knowledge to bring in these kinds of<br>
development.<br>
<br>
Honourable Governor, in response to your question, I have already replied to some parts<br>
of your question in the first part of my series of answers to the Honourable Member. I can<br>
provide more guidance if you require of me.<br>
<br>
You said you do not need funding but technical support. I will encourage you to go and<br>
consult Rural Airstrip Association (RAA). I am happy to provide their contact details for you<br>
after this session and am also willing to bring you to their office.<br>
<br>
Honourable Governor, all you will need is an understanding and an agreement signed<br>
with RAA. They will then facilitate through you, a schedule for engineers to come down to<br>
<br>
your respective airstrips, according to your selection and nomination.<br>
8<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 11:<br>
I am happy to provide approval and facilitate for them to assist your rural airstrips in<br>
Morobe Province to be up and running. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Establishment and Operations of ICAC<br>
<br>
Mr JOHN KAUPA - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for the interest of this nation,<br>
my questions are directed to the Honourable Prime Minister. We are currently in the 11th<br>
Parliament session and yet people are still talking about corruption. Corruption is at all levels<br>
in our society.<br>
<br>
08/05<br>
<br>
What is the meaning of corruption? Corruption is dishonesty, fraudulent dealing and<br>
typical involvement in bribery. There are many more definitions for corruption in this country<br>
at all levels. With the former Prime Minister, they said he was corrupt and with the current<br>
Prime Minister in this 11th Parliament, they say the same.<br>
<br>
Therefore, there is corruption in all levels in our society, from the institutions,<br>
government departments, and corporate bodies and even in our houses.<br>
<br>
I would like to ask the Prime Minister for the good of the nation and for everyone to<br>
know what this government is doing.<br>
<br>
(1) With so much question of corruption in our country, what is the government doing<br>
on the Independent Commission Against Corruption and when is ICAC going to be<br>
established?<br>
<br>
(2) Can the Prime Minister explain to the nation, whether the role and power of<br>
Ombudsman Commission will be diluted once ICAC is in function?<br>
<br>
Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. I am pleased to see you<br>
sitting on that seat. I want to respond to the question from the Honourable Member for Port<br>
Moresby North-East through you. He asked about the establishment and operations of the<br>
Independent Commission Against Corruption. His second question was about the role and<br>
power of the Ombudsman Commission, whether it will be diluted or maintained? I think these<br>
are two very important questions for the benefit of our people.<br>
<br>
As the Government, we stand to fight the issues of corruption in this country. Corruption<br>
in its simplest definition is the act of us breaching the country’s law, whether the law is to do<br>
with money or the appointment process, or any existing law in the country. I want to assure<br>
<br>
9<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 12:<br>
this Parliament and the country that since we took the office in 2019, that was one of our<br>
resolution. In fact, in my maiden address to the Parliament on 30&quot; May 2019, not only myself,<br>
but all the leaders who were with me during that time talked about ensuring that the<br>
Independent Commission Against Corruption Act be passed and the Whistle-blowers Act be<br>
passed, and making sure that the institution is established to combat corruption.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I would like to report to you and to the country through Parliament<br>
that the Independent Commission Against Corruption has been established by this Parliament.<br>
<br>
I want to also appreciate all Members of the Parliament on both sides. The vision for<br>
setting up ICAC is not a new idea, it was there since the third or the second Parliament. In the<br>
1980s the late Sir Anthony Siaguru amongst others talked about setting up this institution to<br>
fight corruption. But since the 80s up till 2019, there were no major moves made to establish<br>
such an organization. I would like to also recognize the previous O’Neill Government, they<br>
started some work but the matter did not reach the Parliament, it stopped short. Despite giving<br>
notices, the version that they carried out in 2014 and 2015 fell short of reaching the Parliament<br>
and for Parliament to setup the laws.<br>
<br>
09/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to inform the country that the Organic Law on the<br>
Independent Commission Against Corruption has been passed by this Parliament in the 10&quot;<br>
Parliament and today we are working on this law to be operationalised.<br>
<br>
I also want to report further that on the fight against corruption which we brought ICAC<br>
Law to be passed and also a sister law for a smooth flow of work has also been passed, which<br>
is the Whistle Blowers Act. This law will protect whoever reports the corruption in the country<br>
and their immediate boss must not terminate them from work or punish them if they happen to<br>
report corrupt practices.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform the country that all Members of Parliament<br>
on both sides were not scared to pass this law which we amended on Proceeds of Crime Act in<br>
the last Parliament. That law was amended and there was an incision made for the undisclosed<br>
wealth provision to be included in the main law of the Proceeds of Crime Act to be recognised;<br>
whether you are a member of Parliament, minister of State, prime minister or public servant,<br>
we all live within the space of our income.<br>
<br>
For instances, if you have ten cars that don’t match your salary than ICAC, IRC or even<br>
police have all the right to come and investigate and must know the sources of having all these<br>
assets. These laws have been passed by the Members of Parliament.<br>
<br>
10<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 13:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform this Parliament and the country that, don’t<br>
think that all Members of Parliament on both sides are not sensitive to the issue of corruption<br>
in the country. If the leaders at this point in time were not sensitive on the issue of corruption,<br>
then the Government of Marape-Basil and later Marape-Rosso won’t get that support to pass<br>
all these critical laws to stabilise the work to protect our country against this sickness of<br>
corruption. And so, leaders from last and this term are continuing in this work for it to bear<br>
fruit.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I also want to inform Parliament and the country that the process<br>
of selecting the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners has been completed. We<br>
followed the concerns raised by the leaders and many commentators in our country that we<br>
must not select Papua New Guineans to take lead in this area of Independent Commission<br>
Against Corruption.<br>
<br>
But an independent process has been taken to select the Commissioner and the two<br>
Deputy Commissioners. Which the Executive Government under my leadership doesn’t have<br>
any input in this process. We appointed Transparency International to supervise this process so<br>
that the work of ICAC must start at a clean path right from day one. And so, Transparency<br>
International under the Chairmanship of Mr Peter Aitsi, supervises the process in appointing<br>
the Commissioner and the two Deputy Commissioners.<br>
<br>
The only input that I recommended was with respect to the other Papua new Guineans<br>
that applied who must be given a fair go, but where possible, if foreigners go through the<br>
selection process and ranked first, then select them because they won’t have any inter-<br>
connections within the country to run this very important office to fight corruption. So that<br>
from day one, they can commence their work as far as fighting corruption is concern.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to inform Parliament that two Australians and a New<br>
Zealander, all are very experienced persons; I think a former police prosecutors and a judge<br>
were appointed. I can’t recall exactly their background but very competent applicants.<br>
<br>
10/05<br>
<br>
They have come through the due process that Transparency International has supervised.<br>
And the final appointment recommendations were made by the committee which includes the<br>
Chief Justice, the Opposition Leader and the Prime Minister. So, there was a qualified<br>
committee to appoint the ICAC Commissioners.<br>
<br>
And we’ve already appointed the Commissioner and the two Assistant Commissioners;<br>
their letters of offer were sent to them and they all have accepted it. We are in the process to<br>
<br>
11<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 14:<br>
ensure that the ICAC will be fully operational with funding set aside we are fully committed<br>
to the ICAC operations.<br>
<br>
On the issue regarding Ombudsman Commission, I want to make it clear that the ICAC<br>
will not assume the role of Ombudsman Commission. The Ombudsman Commission’s role is<br>
to look after people who are under the leadership code.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I want to say that as we setup ICAC and it becomes fully<br>
functional, we will also look holistically into reviewing and clarifying the role of Ombudsman<br>
Commission so that it can work publicly, especially for people who report to Ombudsman in<br>
response to the leadership roles.<br>
<br>
There’s an issue of double jeopardy. So, we will look into fixing that and leaders can<br>
have a clear path without bringing them into double jeopardy situation, where they exposed to<br>
two or three different offices that are running prosecution. So, there will be one clear part where<br>
leaders go through to respond to any issues pertaining to corruption that may arise in the future.<br>
<br>
So, Ombudsman’s role will not be diluted but clarified, augmented and amended for<br>
those areas where sometimes both organizations are handling the same task, and instead of<br>
progressing a matter they become stalled and held back. So, I want to inform the country that<br>
we have setup the ICAC and it’s running. We’ve amended the relevant laws to assist ICAC’s<br>
operation.<br>
<br>
As soon as the Commissioner’s take office, the organization will be functioning and<br>
moving forward. I hope before 16 September this year, the institution will be fully established.<br>
Let me encourage our society out there that not all leaders in here are corrupt, do not accuse<br>
them on Facebook.<br>
<br>
If you have evidence file it before ICAC, Ombudsman and police. Put your evidence<br>
through Police, Ombudsman and later to ICAC. Facebook is not a police station nor is it the<br>
Ombudsman’s Commission Office or ICAC. These body of leaders here in the tenth Parliament<br>
and this Parliament are conscious to the duty of the nation and both sides have responded, we<br>
passed ICAC already.<br>
<br>
This Government stands ready to fund ICAC to go into operation and it is all our<br>
collective responsibility to report on corruption and the due process will be setup. And if<br>
someone is found to have acted improperly and engaged in corruption, the laws that we are<br>
setting up will catchup with him or her and hopefully they receive the penalties.<br>
<br>
So, I am assuring the country that ICAC is being setup by these generations of leaders,<br>
and it’s not James Marape only but all the leaders supporting it. We have established ICAC<br>
and we are ready for its operation this year. The commissioners have been appointed through<br>
<br>
12<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 15:<br>
the independent oversight of Transparency International and we are ready to support this<br>
organization to prosecute and arrest corruption in our country.<br>
<br>
Thank you, very much.<br>

SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS -<br>
EXTENSION OF QUESTION TIME<br>
Motion (by Sir Puka Temu) agreed to —<br>
That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the time for questions this<br>
day being extended by 20 minutes.<br>

Housing - Review Eviction Process<br>
<br>
Sir PUKA TEMU ~— Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. My questions goes to the<br>
Honourable Minister for Housing, if he is present in the House.<br>
<br>
Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker, this morning as I was driving to Parliament, I bought<br>
one of the dailies, the Post-Courier. And on page five of the Post-Courier I saw a family with<br>
little children and their luggage outside the home they have been living in for 46 years. The<br>
reason reported in today’s Post-Courier was that the new tenants went out to seek a Court<br>
Order to give another citizen who has been living there for 46 years a 24-hour notice with<br>
police support to evict this family and nowhere to go, and I believe they are still there.<br>
<br>
Assistant Speaker, the reason why I am asking this question is because I have personally<br>
experienced this with two of my Abau citizens who have gone through the same process.<br>
Therefore, I have three questions to ask the honourable Minister for Housing.<br>
<br>
(1) Can the honourable Minister for Housing review the process of eviction of our<br>
citizens in such situations? This family was living in this property for 46 years. He claims that<br>
he has no outstanding rental arrears and that he received the 24-hour notice from the Court and<br>
so he was moved illegally and another citizen moved in.<br>
<br>
I believe the Housing Minister will have to bring some humanity into the eviction<br>
processes in this regard. And I strongly recommend to the Honourable House this process be<br>
never repeated to another citizen in this country. I ask the Minister to review the eviction<br>
processes and if it would have been proper for example, if the NHC would have informed the<br>
residing tenant that we have a new tenant and we are informing you that the house has changed<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 16:<br>
hands. Wouldn’t it have been proper to do that rather than the new tenant goes to Court, brings<br>
the police and the 24-hour notice to evict another citizen of the country. I understand Mr<br>
Assistant Speaker, that they are still outside the House waiting for what to do.<br>
<br>
This tenant went to Court because he doesn’t have a title, the Court never listened to him.<br>
I personally feel Mr Assistant Speaker, that this is not fair, that is why I am asking the question.<br>
<br>
(2) Given my experience from my citizens from Abau who went through the same<br>
process, can the Minister undertake an investigation on whether this new tenant went through<br>
the proper legal process.<br>
<br>
12/05<br>
<br>
Can the Minister guarantee and make a commitment that the investigation take place?<br>
From experience, this has been going on for too long. Ordinary citizens who have been living<br>
there have been unnecessarily removed because someone with money goes and bulldozes<br>
simple living laws. One of my experiences was that one ordinary citizen was removed and the<br>
Minister for Housing moved into that property. Those are the experiences. I am not saying that<br>
the current Minister for Housing has done that, but I am expressing an experience and we must<br>
all avoid these circumstances. We cannot use our privileged power to suppress another citizen<br>
who has no power at all. So, again, can the Minister make an undertaking to investigate whether<br>
this new tenant gained the title through proper legal means?<br>
<br>
(3) Can the Minister also intervene to address this issue and give some certainty to that<br>
tenant that has been living there for 46 years?<br>
<br>
It will require going to the court to put a stay order and allow the process by undertaking<br>
an investigation and get the families to go back to the residential home. These are the types of<br>
things that give assurance that the Government works. That our people need comfort and can<br>
trust the government of the day, and we are the government of the day. And so Minister, please,<br>
if you can do that, I am sure the family that has been shut out by a Court of law will have some<br>
relief, and hopefully, a more humane process can be can be undertaken and give relief to both<br>
parties and everyone is on a win-win situation.<br>
<br>
Mr KOBBY BOMAREO - Mr Assistant Speaker, I thank the Member for Abau for his<br>
very important questions today. It is an honour today for me too as a new Minister to receive<br>
my first question from a very senior Member of Parliament.<br>
<br>
I also take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the Marape/Rosso Government for<br>
the appointment to this ministry. I also take this time to thank the Prime Minister where my<br>
<br>
14<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 17:<br>
people and electorate gathered and forged their undivided support to contribute to pay the<br>
Prime Minister’s nomination fee to win the elections and become the Prime Minister.<br>
<br>
Let me go back to the questions. Yes, it is public knowledge that the Housing Ministry<br>
or department is riddled with a lot of problems. Most of these problems have accumulated over<br>
many years, and I have inherited all these problems and it is not easy to correct these issues.<br>
<br>
As soon as I was appointed, I had my first meeting with the administration and instructed<br>
them to table all records relating to the status of NHC Houses throughout the country. Some of<br>
the people currently occupying those houses are fourth and fifth generation families.<br>
<br>
Many properties are now before the Courts and others have been put up for sale<br>
erroneously.<br>
<br>
My department is in the process of establishing this report so that we can all appreciate<br>
fully and understand the nature of this circumstances. Solving of these problems cannot happen<br>
overnight and it will take time and patience as we go along.<br>
<br>
But I agree with the senior member, Member for Abau, that it is the duty of this<br>
Government to protect and serve its people and also provide affordable accommodation. It is<br>
the duty of the department to protect those tenants who have been residents of NHC properties.<br>
13/05<br>
<br>
Yesterday, there was also an eviction up in Jiwaka and I received a text message so |<br>
called up the police there and advised them to stop the eviction.<br>
<br>
So, Member, before you asked your question, I have already instructed my lawyers to<br>
stop the eviction and then later J will go myself and see them.<br>
<br>
To answer your question on the review of the process of eviction, the National Housing<br>
Commission has a process on who to evict identify if a tenant is not complying after being<br>
issued several notices and whether they are in breach of the notice. In this instant, I will have<br>
to find out and report back to you and this House. I believe that I gave an instruction in my<br>
maiden speech to stop evictions until we know the situations of the property.<br>
<br>
You also asked about investigation, this is part of the Eviction Process of the National<br>
Housing Commission, as I mentioned earlier.<br>
<br>
On the question of how to assist the families, I think I am assisting by advising aganst<br>
any eviction to stop and I will look into this matter to resolve it.<br>
<br>
Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to use this opportunity to say that the Marape-Rosso<br>
Government, has been looking into how well it can support and cater for citizens at all classes<br>
from the cleaner to the manager to provide affordable accommodation.<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 18:<br>
I believe that this Government has supported my ministry and soon I will present a<br>
statement on how best we can accommodate the employed and unemployed who can be able<br>
to pay rentals because at the end of the day we want to see that everyone owns a house. We<br>
move around during the day but at night everyone goes back to their homes and it is also a right<br>
under the Human Rights to have a house, water and food.<br>
<br>
So the Government has not forgotten they will still go ahead and ensure that our citizens<br>
have reasonable and affordable houses.<br>
<br>
I thank the Member for Abau for his questions and I will get back to him in detail as soon<br>
as I find answers on the incidents that occurred and the one in Jiwaka.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, there are some National Housing Commission officers who don’t<br>
comply with Department’s procedures and processes. I would also want to tell this House that<br>
in January, I removed five general managers for insubordination of instructions from the<br>
ministry office. We must adhere to the laws.<br>
<br>
The National Housing Commission is corrupted, the ministers and managing directors of<br>
the past have corrupted the department so now we are trying to transform it. The officers of the<br>
Department know that under my leadership, that if you do not comply with the laws I will get<br>
rid of you. In the department I have mixed representation from all the regions of PNG not just<br>
one region of employees dominating the department.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>
<br>
Air Niugini — Spike in Airfares<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES DONALD - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for recognising the people<br>
of North-Fly. It doesn’t mean that the Assistant Speaker is from Western province and he has<br>
giving me the opportunity to speak.<br>
<br>
My question is directed to the Minister for State Enterprise regarding some issues that<br>
we are facing daily with Air Niugini.<br>
<br>
There is a five per cent fee that Air Niugini charges for cash payments on airfares but if<br>
paying through EFTPOS you won’t be charged extra. I want to know why they are doing this<br>
because not everyone has a bank card.<br>
<br>
14/05<br>
<br>
Think of those simple village people who carry cash in their hands. So, how could we be<br>
genuine in our service to the general public in that sense?<br>
<br>
However, my two questions to the Minister are as follows:<br>
<br>
16<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
(1) Can there be some undertaking by the Minister assuring that this style of practice<br>
would not happen again?<br>
<br>
I am struggling to pay for the airfares. The ticket fare for Air Niugini from Port Moresby<br>
to Kiunga is K1, 800 for one way. It has increased by 40 to 50 per cent over the last one year.<br>
Normally, the airfares that we used to pay is around K700 to K800, and I am wondering what<br>
is really happening. I have tried to compare Air Niugini with other airline companies, for<br>
instance PNG Air charged around K800 to K900 and that is reasonable but for Air Niugini, it<br>
has gone that high so why is that? Is there anything wrong?<br>
<br>
(2) Can an assessments be done and report to the House and tell us why Air Niugini has<br>
increased the airfares? Not only Kiunga sector but all sectors across the country. Please, I an<br>
undertaking to resolve this because if Air Niugini is our pride, where is their fairness to the<br>
citizens of this country?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. I would like to thank the<br>
Member for North Fly for these very important questions.<br>
<br>
Firstly, in relation to the cash handling fee, if our society were a law abiding society<br>
and our people respected the rule of law, it would be easy for all of us.<br>
<br>
Air Niugini is forced to transfer, whatever it costs and whatever it takes, the<br>
passengers’ cash payments. It is forced to engage security companies to move that cash. There<br>
is a cost of operating in a country like ours where the chances of Air Niugini sales office, just<br>
like any other businesses, being robbed is very high. So, unfortunately, these are costs that all<br>
of us need to pay and that reflects a society that we live in now.<br>
<br>
So there is an extra cost that Air Niugini charges by collecting cash handling fees from<br>
our travelling public so people are now being encouraged not to carry cash but to try and use<br>
bank cards.<br>
<br>
That also means getting things like our NID and everything else sorted out in this<br>
country.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, we have to bear the cost of doing business in this country. It is happening<br>
everywhere and Air Niugini is not the only one. Even the banks and others are charging cash<br>
handling fees.<br>
<br>
In relation to the increase of airfares that are being charged by Air Niugini, yes, I agree.<br>
There&#x27;s a problem there and I must admit before the Parliament that those inclusions were never<br>
approved by the Board of Air Niugini, never came before me as the Minister responsible and<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 20:<br>
for that reason together with other reasons, those people who were behind these acts were<br>
terminated. It is not for me to tell this Parliament or the public all the reasons why people have<br>
to go as they also have rights to defend themselves. So these are the least I can tell you. This is<br>
the only reason why Cabinet has to make a decision to let go of the CEO and we are looking at<br>
that aspect.<br>
<br>
The Air Niugini’s intention is to provide fares that are affordable for our people. It is<br>
not a company that is led by people who are blind. So, I must tell the Parliament that this is one<br>
of the reason why change has to be made to the senior executives of Air Niugini. There were<br>
two gentlemen who had to be asked to leave. So Air Niugini Board is now being asked to<br>
review the level of rates that are being imposed on our traveling public and we expect to be<br>
able to introduce a rate that is affordable for people.<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>

<br>
Highlands Highway Rehabilitation Program<br>
<br>
Mr WILLIAM HAGAHUNO - Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. My questions are<br>
directed to the Minister for Works and Highways.<br>
<br>
Actually, this is a lead up from an earlier question that I posed to the minister early this<br>
year.<br>
<br>
The question I asked was about the delay in completion of the rehabilitation of the<br>
Highlands Highway, the ADB funded project and the quality of the workmanship that was<br>
carried out. In the course of his answers, he informed the House, that the ADB, the financier<br>
selects the contractor and they also do the project management. That leads me to conclude that<br>
our Works Department is a spectator or a bystander in the whole process.<br>
<br>
Now my questions stem from there. The concerns are that the roads are the property of<br>
the sovereign nation of Papua New Guinea and the state through the Department of Works<br>
performs our oversight functions or project managing and making sure there is quality and<br>
standard in the way the contractors carry out the work.<br>
<br>
My concern and is also concern in this House, given the fact that the Government is<br>
spending a large chunk of the national budget on road works — is whether the work that is being<br>
carried out by the contractors is worth the money that we are spending. I have personal<br>
knowledge of the fact that the sealing of the Highlands Highway was carried out by a company<br>
called Dillingham Corporation. It started in the late 70s and was completed around the early<br>
<br>
18<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 21:<br>
80s. For the next 40 years the workmanship that was put there withstood the test of times and<br>
now we are getting in new contractors to now do the rehabilitation.<br>
<br>
But seeing the way the work has been carried out, every week they seal part of the road.<br>
They have to take them out again and seal them. That is the kind of workmanship we are getting<br>
under the current arrangements.<br>
<br>
My questions are:<br>
<br>
(1) Is it by design that the conditions of the loan arrangement state that we should leave<br>
the selection of contractors as well as the project supervision and management of those<br>
contracts to ADB, or is it by default on our part that we have been ignorant of the important<br>
fact of project management ensuring quality of the work that is done? So, we have ended up in<br>
this situation where works managers and engineers are pushed to the side and are bystanders<br>
now in the whole arrangement.<br>
<br>
So that’s the first question whether it’s a condition of the loan, it’s a design or whether<br>
it is by default or by our own ignorance and the loan negotiating team.<br>
<br>
(2) If it is a condition of the loan, can the state negotiating team in future on projects<br>
such as this negotiate properly so that the state, who is the owner of the project that is for the<br>
benefit of our people, properly supervise, manage and oversee there is quality in the way work<br>
is delivered so that it lasts like what Dillingham Corporation did way back which lasted for 30-<br>
40 years without maintenance.<br>
<br>
(3) Considering that it is costing our nation, our country and the people more than<br>
K3billion, the people have to dig deeper into their pockets to repay this loan, can your<br>
department carry out an audit of the whole Highway Rehabilitation Project as soon as it is<br>
completed?<br>
<br>
This is so that this nation and the people are informed that we have got value for money<br>
for the kind of work the contractor has produced, and so that we have a guarantee that it’s going<br>
to last the next 30 or 40 years, even if we do not come up with enough money to continue to<br>
maintain it. I do not want to see another road rehabilitation project as soon as a contractor packs<br>
up and leaves where the road falls into shambles and this government and the people go<br>
scrambling around for more money to repair the road again.<br>
<br>
(4) When will the weighing station that was constructed at 10 Mile in Lae be used?<br>
<br>
(5) Does the Works Department have any plans to put up weighing stations in all of the<br>
highways in the provinces to determine whether the allowable weight is being carried by<br>
vehicles so that there are no further damages done to roads; considering that we always have<br>
to scrape around to find money to maintain and rehabilitate roads?<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 22:<br>
16/05<br>
<br>
When is it ever going to come into use? And does the Works Department have any plans<br>
to put up weighing stations in all of the highways in the provinces and that will determine<br>
whether the allowable weight is being carried by vehicles so that there are no further damages<br>
done to roads considering that we always have to scrape around to find money to maintain and<br>
rehabilitate roads.<br>
<br>
Mr SOLAN MIRISIM - Thank you Mr Assistant Speaker. And I would like to thank<br>
the Member for Kainantu for his question. I believe this is his second time to raise this question<br>
and in response I would say that three weeks ago I was able to visit the Highlands highway,<br>
the journey began in Mendi and was completed in Lae Morobe province and I witnessed first<br>
hand the road conditions of the highland’s highway. ADB has given us a loan to maintain this<br>
highway and work has begun in Lae in Bugandi. The four-lane work has begun and will be<br>
completed at Nadzab, from the Nadzab road turn over will continue and end at Kagamuga in<br>
Mt Hagen.<br>
<br>
There are three contracts currently on this part of the road; there is one from Nadzab turn<br>
over to where it ends in Henganofi, the other from where the Member for Kainantu raised the<br>
question on. Before I continue, I want to assure the Member for Kainantu and the people of<br>
Eastern highlands province and also about 5-6 provinces on the western side of the highland’s<br>
highway. That in two years the road conditions along the Highland’s Highway will come to<br>
high standard. The travelling hours will be reduced.<br>
<br>
The ADB has its loan conditions as well as conditions on awarding of contracts. They<br>
award the contracts to the contractor and the Department of Works only places managers to<br>
work with alongside the contractors because under the connect PNG Law we have a set up and<br>
the head office is based in Goroka. This is where we have the structure where all the contracted<br>
are working with our ADB awarded contractors who report back to the government, ensuring<br>
there is quality work and contractors are not sitting idle and meeting the standards set out by<br>
ADB so, this is a brief to your first question.<br>
<br>
I would like to assure the House and the people of this country that Works department does not<br>
<br>
compromise, we put managers to work with the ADB contracts to ensure work monitoring and<br>
<br>
report back to the government. You will note that the work is in progress and the road<br>
<br>
conditions will gradually be better. From the Nadzab road turn over which will finish in<br>
<br>
Henganofi bridge is about 207km and so it has been cut into three sections. That is from Nadzab<br>
20<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 23:<br>
to Waterise and starting from Watarise up to Kassam Pass and all the way to Kainantu, the road<br>
will be completed soon. The third phase is from Kainantu to Henganofi Bridge. I have talked<br>
to the contractor to get more machines and men so that the work must be completed.<br>
<br>
17/05<br>
<br>
I want to assure the Member for Kainantu and the people of Eastern Highlands, that the<br>
road will be delivered after October. This section of the road will be completed so that people<br>
can travel.<br>
<br>
In response to your second question about audits, we are currently working on it. We will<br>
have professionals to go and conduct audits on every road in the Connect-PNG Program when<br>
the contractors have completed them. We want value for money. This government is serious<br>
about making sure that work must be done according to the money given. Audit teams are<br>
already in place and will be starting to conduct audits on the roads from the monies given by<br>
donors and the Connect-PNG Program.<br>
<br>
The Department of Works have a plan in place to have weighing stations. Fees collected<br>
from the weighing stations will be used to maintain the roads and bridges. The weighing<br>
stations are in progress now to review for implementation.<br>
<br>
While waiting for the government to give us money, we will also have money coming in.<br>
These monies will be used to do emergency works; for instance, landslips do occur in some<br>
bridges and roads anytime. We can be able to repair them because we do have money from<br>
these projects. These are plans in place and we are working on it.<br>
<br>
Let me assure the Member, his people in Eastern Highlands and the people of Papua New<br>
Guinea that the Connect-PNG Program is real and it will be delivered. I want to let the Member<br>
know that his road will be completed and soon he will not need to ask questions anymore. This<br>
is also to inform other leaders and members from the Highlands Region and PNG as well.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

<br>
Mr WALTER SCHNAUBELT (Namatanai—Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation)<br>
—I present the following papers pursuant to statute:<br>
<br>
Civil Aviation Safety Authority — Annual Reports for the years, 2020 and 2021.<br>
<br>
I ask leave of the Parliament to make a statement in connection with the Report.<br>
<br>
Leave granted.<br>
18/05<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for giving me this opportunity to present in this<br>
Honourable House, my statement on the performance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority<br>
of Papua New Guinea in 2021 and 2020.<br>
<br>
22<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 25:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I am pleased to present to Parliament, the 2021 CASA Annual<br>
Report which is the 12&quot; Annual Report of the Authority since its establishment in 2010 and the<br>
Report includes the statement of the activities of the Authority during the year and the annual<br>
financial statements of the Authority prepared under the Civil Aviation Act 2000 (as amended).<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG was unable to present its 2020 Annual Report to<br>
Parliament in 2021, therefore, I am presenting it to Parliament along with the 2021 CASA<br>
Annual Report. The 2020 Annual Report is the 11&quot; Report of CASA since its establishment.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the operation of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Papua New<br>
Guinea has again met the expectations of the Government, the aviation industry and the public,<br>
in ensuring that safety and security is maintained and enhanced within an increasingly complex<br>
and challenging environment.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG did not have a Board in 2021, due to circumstances<br>
beyond the control of its management. The appointment and swearing in of the new Board of<br>
Directors were recently completed. In 2020, a six-member Board, provided governance<br>
oversight over CASA PNG. The then Board of Directors’ involvement in CASA PNG in 2020,<br>
shaped and influenced the strategic direction for CASA PNG, as set out in the Corporate Plan<br>
2020 2022.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, it is important that we have an effective and efficient aviation<br>
safety and security regulator, because a safe aviation environment contributes towards social<br>
and economic development of Papua New Guinea and raises PNG&#x27;s profile at the international<br>
level.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, building organization capability to meet the expectation of the<br>
<br>
- aviation industry and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), continued to be<br>
CASA PNG&#x27;s challenges and I commend the CASA staff for continuing to perform<br>
exceptionally well. The various programmes, objectives and targets being pursued under the<br>
ICAO ‘No Country Left Behind’ initiative to assist States in capacity building also assisted<br>
CASA PNG in 2021 and 2020.<br>
<br>
19/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the ICAO Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP) and Global Air<br>
Navigation Plan (GANP), set out regional expectation priorities and targets for States to meet<br>
the Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme (USOAP) Effective Implementation (El)<br>
range of scores, in which the smaller Island States of the Pacific saw a compelling need for<br>
<br>
23<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 26:<br>
improvement and CASA PNG is actively engaged in forging stronger regional cooperation,<br>
partnerships and engagement in this area.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the direction and objectives for aviation safety and security in<br>
PNG, follows the regional expectation and supports CASA&#x27;s vision to be respected as an<br>
industry regulator and as a partner in regional and international civil aviation and its mission<br>
to promote compliance and achieve safety and security outcomes in PNG through positive and<br>
productive engagement with its stakeholders.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA is a growing organisation facing a number of challenges in<br>
the aviation environment which is evolutionary. Its strategic direction sets a clear pathway in<br>
addressing the challenges and to facilitate change in a gradual, staged approach, allowing<br>
CASA to absorb and benefit from these changes, assessing the risk before making the decision<br>
to proceed with others.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, aviation safety regulation is a global operation, across borders, not<br>
isolated to one country. The aviation challenges faced by PNG differ to those in other countries<br>
and it is particularly beneficial for PNG to maintain its presence at the ICAO forums to<br>
collaborate with other States on common aviation related issues.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, recent estimates suggest that demand for air transport will increase<br>
by an average of 4.3 per cent per annum over the next 20 years. This growth is likely to pose<br>
<br>
|       many challenges for PNG.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the rapid growth of the remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS)<br>
and drones industry, has resulted in significant and multiple challenges for PNG, to deliver our<br>
mandate and meet the needs and expectations of the industry. CASA has identified key areas<br>
of concern and has reviewed and developed its operating rules that are being implemented.<br>
CASA is continuing with its efforts to address the remotely piloted aircraft system (R-PAS)<br>
oversight and surveillance, including capacity building of its inspectors and is improving<br>
PNG&#x27;s R-PAS regulations to ensure alignment with ICAO standards and recommended<br>
practices (SARPs).<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, today, cyber threats are of growing concern to civil aviation and<br>
CASA PNG is required to refocus its efforts for a proactive and aligned collective response.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, from CASA&#x27;s perspective, new technologies and changes to the<br>
aviation environment, have a significant impact on resources required to support technical<br>
training for inspectors, development of new CASA policies and procedures, stakeholder<br>
consultation and communications, and legislation development and implementation.<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 27:<br>
20/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, when safety and security incidents and serious incidents are<br>
reported, the most serious incidents in aircraft accidents are investigated by the PNG Accident<br>
Investigation Commission, to determine the root-cause factors that have contributed to the<br>
incident, with the aim of preventing future occurrences.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG also uses these reports, to conduct trend analysis to<br>
build a picture of how prevalent certain types of incidents are in different type of aviation<br>
operations. This helps CASA to design policies, propose new safety standards and oversight<br>
strategies to improve aviation safety and security.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, from a safety perspective, significant changes increase the risks<br>
and CASA was able to mitigate these risks through regulatory interventions, increase<br>
surveillance and imposition of conditions and implementation of a risk-based approach in<br>
auditing.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA&#x27;s Corporate Plan Key Objectives, sets the strategic<br>
direction and either relies on or would benefit from regional and international engagement with<br>
neighboring aviation regulators, to collaborate and adopt best practices that would assist PNG<br>
in addressing the challenges and risks.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG&#x27;s long-term objective is the implementation of a<br>
robust civil aviation safety and security system, that will become integral to the civil aviation<br>
systems of the future. CASA continues to assess the growth in the civil aviation sector,<br>
domestically and globally, to identify emerging challenges and risks. The strategies on<br>
addressing the challenges and mitigating the emerging risks, are set in its Corporate Plan to<br>
ensure that it achieves its long-term objective.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, for benchmarking purposes and as an ongoing performance<br>
indicator for investment, in 2021 PNG had an ICAO Effective Implementation score of 60.7<br>
per cent for safety oversight, against a global average of 67.5 per cent. The scores are based on<br>
an assessment of our responses to the eight critical elements of aviation safety, that addresses<br>
the standards that set out in the Annexes to the Chicago Convention on International Civil<br>
Aviation.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, Papua New Guinea maintained its aviation safety International<br>
Civil Aviation Organization Effective Implementation target, above the Global Aviation Safety<br>
Plan and the Asia Pacific Regional target of 60.1 per cent, and work is continuing on the<br>
deficient areas to improve further, as PNG focus on the Beijing Declaration — a commitment<br>
made by the Asia Pacific Civil Aviation Ministers in Beijing, to progressively enhance safety<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 28:<br>
oversight capability to achieve a Universal Safety Oversight Audit Programme El score, higher<br>
or equal to the global average by 2022.<br>
21/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG continues to focus efforts towards improving the<br>
ICAO El scores for both aviation safety and security. This includes achievements of full<br>
implementation of the State Safety Programme and Safety Management System, to facilitate<br>
the pro-active management of safety risks.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, Significant Safety Concerns (SSCs) indicates that a State Is not<br>
providing sufficient safety oversight, to ensure the effective implementation of applicable<br>
ICAO Standards. SSCs may be issued in the area of operations, air navigation services,<br>
aerodromes, airworthiness or licensing. I am pleased to report that PNG has no significant<br>
safety concerns.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, In the area of certification of International Aerodromes, ICAO<br>
has considered that PNG has satisfactorily promulgated regulations detailing the<br>
requirements for the certification of aerodromes, including establishing a process for the<br>
certification of aerodromes.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG has not been assessed by the Federate Aviation<br>
<br>
”       Administration (FAA), through their International Aviation Safety Audit (IASA)<br>
programme. This is a long-term strategy that CASA will now be embarking on with the<br>
airlines.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG has no operational restrictions with regard to European<br>
airspace and PNG has only one airline (Air Niugini) certified through the International Air<br>
Transport Association Operational Safety Audit (OSA) programme.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, In the area of State Safety (SSP) Implementation, PNG is at<br>
level three at 95.2 per cent above the target and moving towards level four. Our overall SSP<br>
foundation is currently at 91.19 per cent. The full implementation of SSP is now part of<br>
CASA&#x27;s strategy, following the attainment of over 60% Effective Implementation score.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the implementation of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN)<br>
is presently the global aviation community&#x27;s highest air navigation priority, The PBN<br>
concept offers significant benefits including improved safety through more straight-in<br>
instrument approaches with vertical guidance, increased airspace capacity, increased airport<br>
accessibility, more efficient operations, reduced infrastructure costs and reduced<br>
environmental impact. PNG&#x27;s international airports have two (2) instrument runways which<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 29:<br>
have two (2) PBN approaches that result in our PBN implementation ICAO rating at 100<br>
per cent.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA continued in 2021 with its data-driven, risk-based<br>
approach, to proactively monitor emerging safety trends within each certificated<br>
organization in PNG. The monitoring of trends, enabled CASA to allocate its limited human<br>
resources to focus on high-risk areas and measure the effectiveness of its safety certification<br>
audit and surveillance program.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the results of CASA&#x27;s trend analysis of aviation safety and security<br>
data, enables CASA to engage with the industry by communicating &quot;issues of concern&quot; directly<br>
to each air operator and/or take the appropriate enforcement action, to prevent incidents or<br>
accidents from happening.<br>
<br>
22/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, through trend analysis and risk-based approach auditing; CASA<br>
was able to monitor any ‘build up’ of latent unsafe conditions within each organization in a<br>
timely manner.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, statistics for the last seven years indicated a slight fluctuation in<br>
the number of serious incidents and bird-strikes, however, the trend analysis shows a steady<br>
<br>
,         trend during that period,<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the number of serious incidents reported to CASA by the industry,<br>
decreased from 108 in 2020 to 98 in 2021.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, significant achievements have also been achieved by the<br>
Authority, demonstrated by the completion of the audit of the Financial Statements of CASA<br>
for year ended 31st December 2021 and year ended 31st December 2020, and the results of the<br>
audits from the Auditor-General forwarded to my Office, advising me of the results of his<br>
inspection.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA regulates aviation participants within PNG, with a very<br>
modern set of legislative framework that meets international best practices in aviation safety.<br>
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has rated Papua New Guinea as having<br>
one of the best piece of Primary Aviation Safety legislation (the Act) in place.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, reviews of subordinate aviation safety rules set, that are linked to<br>
support the primary legislation, were also conducted and completed in 2021 and 2020<br>
respectively, following consultation with the aviation industry and stakeholders.<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 30:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG is a strong advocate for the Pacific region on aviation safety<br>
and security matters. We continue to play a significant leading role among the smaller Pacific<br>
island states, through the Regional Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO); a regional body<br>
established by the Pacific Islands Forum leaders, to ensure aviation safety and security<br>
oversight is effective in order to meet the international obligations required of us, under the<br>
ICAO Convention on International Civil Aviation.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, as a member of PASO, it is particularly beneficial for PNG to<br>
maintain its presence at PASO meetings, to collaborate with other smaller Pacific island states<br>
on common aviation-related issues and challenges.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, PNG&#x27;s leadership supports our platform to be a partner in regional<br>
and international civil aviation and further demonstrates our credibility in this very highly<br>
technical and specialized field, commensurate with the extensive aviation infrastructures we<br>
have in PNG.<br>
<br>
23/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA has safety-related functions aimed at encouraging the<br>
aviation industry to maintain and enhance high standards of safety, through compliance with<br>
the appropriate rules and the development and evolution of a safety culture. CASA undertakes<br>
these functions. Through accurate and timely aviation safety advice; comprehensive safety<br>
education and training programs; and fostering awareness within the industry and the<br>
community, on the fundamental importance of aviation safety.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, as CASA&#x27;s stakeholders and clients are individuals or groups<br>
who are affected by a CASA activity, CASA has a large and diverse number of stakeholders,<br>
clients, and safety partners. Its approach to stakeholder engagement sits within a key objective<br>
of its Corporate Plan and is guided by its vision, mission, and values.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, as part of itss strategies to engage with stakeholders CASA<br>
successfully hosted the 2021 Annual High-Level Aviation Safety and Security Conference<br>
virtually, with action items tracked. The theme of the Conference: &quot;Adapting &amp; Digital<br>
Sustaining PNG Aviation amidst the Pandemic&quot;, enabled the participants to discuss<br>
fundamentals that were a pillar for adaptation and sustainability in the aviation sector during<br>
any given pandemic. It was important that policymakers, regulators, and the aviation industry<br>
collaborate together, to ensure appropriate policies and legislative framework is established for<br>
the industry in PNG. A total of 125 participants took part in the Conference with a good<br>
representation from international organizations, including the PNG Department of PM &amp; NEC,<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 31:<br>
the Department of Transport, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Civil Aviation<br>
Minister&#x27;s Office.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, in the area of aviation security oversight, CASA has increased<br>
the allocation of resources to its Aviation Security Branch, to ensure effort is put into<br>
addressing the protocol questions and the three Significant Security Concerns (SSeCs), in the<br>
areas of Airport Operations, Passenger and Baggage, Security and Cargo, which were identified<br>
by a Combined Assistance Technical Mission in 2019. Monthly progress reports are being sent<br>
to ICAO, providing updates on the implementation of PNG&#x27;s Corrective Action Plan.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the 2021 Recurrent Budget appropriation of K15.2 million was<br>
a decrease of 3.5 per cent from the 2020 appropriation of K15.8 million, CASA PNG continued<br>
to face inconsistencies in the grant disbursement in 2021 and 2020.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA implemented measures to counteract this reduction, as<br>
well as, the inconsistencies of the grant disbursement, to ensure that funding did not erode<br>
further to a point where, it would seriously impact aviation safety and security oversight<br>
responsibilities and has vigorously pursued its outstanding debts.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, in terms of staff liabilities, there were no outstanding staff<br>
liabilities, apart from the payments made to staff exiting the organization through resignation,<br>
medical condition, or contract expiration, in 2021 and 2020. Provisions are maintained for<br>
accrued gratuities, annual leave, and long service leave.<br>
<br>
24/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG&#x27;s organisation structure and approved positions<br>
remained at 104 positions. This has remained for the last three years and while CASA is<br>
continually seeking from the government for more positions, it has been very difficult to obtain<br>
approval.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, CASA PNG&#x27;s management is committed to ensuring that the<br>
organisation is appropriately staffed with qualified and experienced personnel, capable of<br>
successfully undertaking the wide variety of required regulatory task, but they are being<br>
hampered by the limited number of positions which are not allowing the organisation to grow<br>
together with growth in the industry.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, it is important that the functions of CASA are recognised and<br>
supported to ensure growth commensurate with industry growth and that it can attract and<br>
retain qualified, experienced and skilled staff to ensure that the organization is credible and<br>
respected when it interacts with the industry.<br>
<br>
29<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 32:<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the increase in organisation’s position to permit increase in staff<br>
number, is therefore critical in light of a significant increase in the volume and scope of aviation<br>
activities including improvements in technology in PNG.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, the functions of CASA PNG and its strategic direction are<br>
consistent with the Government&#x27;s development agenda and is aligned with and support the<br>
achievement of the government goals for aviation safety and security. It includes consistency<br>
with PNG&#x27;s Vision 2050 and the Transport Sector goal for &quot;a well-integrated, competitive, safe,<br>
affordable, financially and environmentally sustainable transport system that efficiently serves<br>
the economy and society of Papua New Guinea&quot;.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, finally, for this Government, the safety and security of the<br>
travelling public is the most important priority. The public expects us, the Government to be<br>
responsible in ensuring that aeroplanes are safe to fly, the airports are safe to operate into and<br>
the associated aeronautical infrastructure are modernized and meets international standards.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I commend the 2021 and 2020 Annual Reports provided by the<br>
Civil Aviation Safety Authority of Papua New Guinea and ask the Government to lend its<br>
support to this very important safety agency.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
<br>
Mr LUTHER WENGE (Morobe) — I move —<br>
<br>
That Parliament take note of the paper.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker. I thank you for giving me this opportunity to make<br>
few debates in relation to the Report of Civil Aviation and Safety Authority in our country,<br>
Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
25/05<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Civil Aviation Safety<br>
Authority report presented by the Minister for Civil Aviation, which extends to the world its<br>
operations because Papua New Guinea is not alone; we are a member of the international<br>
community.<br>
<br>
Mr Minister and Mr Assistant Speaker, I’d like to thank the Minister for providing<br>
succinctly the situation in relation to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and secondly,<br>
comprehensively providing the report that this parliament should know and should disseminate<br>
to the rest of the country.<br>
<br>
30<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 33:<br>
As I said, Mr Assistant Speaker, we are not alone, Papua New Guinea is not alone,<br>
Papua New Guinea is a member of the international community, especially in the manner in<br>
which we operate, particularly in relation to aerodrome safety or safety of aerodrome operators,<br>
safety of pilots flying from PNG and to the international community, and the safety of the<br>
travelling public flying to and from PNG and to the international community, as well as<br>
monitoring criminal acts which we call cyber-crime from coming into this country and into the<br>
operations or mechanical operations of aircraft and other apparatus and machines that we have<br>
and how it affects them.<br>
<br>
I thank the Minister for providing this to parliament, especially in relation to the<br>
Government’s commitment to provide money to train people who are working in specialised<br>
areas that | have mentioned, to make sure that they are competent and experienced in making<br>
sure that the operations they’re required to perform are provided in the best possible way so<br>
that safety is guaranteed to the users of the aircraft and anything that is relevant.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I’m also happy with the Office of Auditor-General, the<br>
constitutional established office that audit books of government operations in this country.<br>
They have done the audits to make sure that there is compliance by CASA. And I’m happy to<br>
know that CASA has complied with the utility of the money that is provided and also any other<br>
apparatus that is relevant to the operation of the aircraft, et cetera have been audited.<br>
<br>
And I’m’ happy to know from the Minister that there is no misuse of money in the<br>
operations. And, Mr Minister, Mr Assistant Speaker, that is what this country needs to know.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, there is no question, our record is good and I fully concur with<br>
the Minister’s presentation that we are in order. We are in order as to all those machineries,<br>
apparatus, aerodrome and the pilots and all those people who are trying to make sure that<br>
operation of all those things are in order. I’m happy to know that there’s not much problem in<br>
this country.<br>
<br>
26/05<br>
<br>
Not many accidents occurred in relation to Air Niugini. There is probably only one in<br>
Madang but it was from a technical fault, there were no casualties. The plane was damaged but<br>
all the passengers were safe. Furthermore, one of the aircrafts sank into the water in one of the<br>
Micronesian countries and again there were no serious casualties and everyone including the<br>
pilot were safe.<br>
<br>
Mr Minister, you are reporting on the competency of the people who are working there<br>
and their compliance. The compliance of the rules by those people working there is excellent.<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 34:<br>
They ensure that the aircraft is running well and that it reaches its destination safely. The<br>
passengers are well taken care for, including international passengers and lands at international<br>
destinations without difficulties, this very good news.<br>
<br>
I am happy to note that none of our pilots have made any mistakes while flying<br>
internationally, as they are well trained and are able to manage the aircraft and they are able to<br>
manage the topography of the countries they are travelling to and from. They manage to<br>
maneuver the plain against the wind and other airborne conditions that aircrafts face. I want to<br>
say our pilots have a good record and there is no question about that as we already gained the<br>
respect of the international community. We heard about the Malaysian plane that crashed,<br>
probably it was interfered by cyber-attack that caused it to crash where no body survived. We<br>
here of air crashes in Turkey, Russia and even in well advanced countries. And they have a<br>
record of their planes crashing.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, with this record of only two minor crashes and no casualties we<br>
have a very good record. In line with Nadzab that is gearing up to be an international terminal,<br>
I take this time to thank this government and the others who were instrumental I making this<br>
project possible, as well as grants from the Japanese Government to assist in upgrading Nadzab<br>
to international status.<br>
<br>
With this confidence when we sanctioned the Nadzab International Airport we should fly<br>
direct to some of the countries that will allow our national aircraft carrier Air Niugini and that<br>
will help us build the economy of our country. We will need direct flights to China, Japan,<br>
Philippines and to Australia and the rest of the Pacific nations.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I am sure when the Nadzab International Airport is inaugurated<br>
the I am sure you will endorse those flights and surely, I will be requesting those international<br>
connections to and from Nadzab. Therefore, on that basis we should fly direct from Nadzab to<br>
other international destinations and we do not have to enroute to Jacksons International Airport.<br>
27/05<br>
<br>
When people ask you where you are travelling from, you will say directly from Kandep.<br>
The people from Sepik, Bougainville and the Highlands regions too can travel directly from<br>
where they are instead of transiting through Port Moresby.<br>
<br>
The Minister has assured us through his report that our planes are safe, as well as the<br>
people operating the aircrafts. People are complying with the Civil Aviation laws in PNG as<br>
well as the international laws.<br>
<br>
32<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 35:<br>
We have the respect and trust from our country and also from the international<br>
community that our planes are safe. The stewards and stewardess will make sure that we fly<br>
safely. We have a track record since independence. Since Air Niugini started operations in the<br>
country, they have experienced only two crash.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Minister, for assuring the country that our safety is guaranteed when we<br>
fly with our airlines. We have to set standards on our safety when travelling by road, sea and<br>
in the air. Investors coming in will be guaranteed and will be confident to do business with us.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker, for allowing me to speak. I want to commend the<br>
Minister and his staff for the report, and also to offer my support to him.<br>
<br>
Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA (Kiriwina-Goodenough) — Thank you, Mr Assistant<br>
Speaker. I also want to commend the Minister for Transport and Civil Aviation for a well-<br>
presented report. I am sure that the people of Papua New Guinea are happy, as well as the<br>
travelling public.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I will try to make my debate short. On page five of the report, it<br>
shows very high ratings from the travelling public. We are slowly moving from three up to<br>
four. This report gives comfort to the travelling public, as well as the leaders present here too.<br>
<br>
Many a times, we express negativity towards the operators of our airlines. At this<br>
juncture, I want to commend CASA for doing a great job with its continuous endeavours to<br>
make certain that as an organization involved with the airline industry, performs at the highest<br>

I wish to commend CASA, with its limited funding it continues to perform at the<br>
International Level Standard set by the airline industry and continues to perform at that level.<br>
<br>
As a traveller of this airline, today’s report gives me assurance that I have an eye watching<br>
the industry and that is CASA. CASA continues to perform its duties and for this House to<br>
report for the rest of Papua New Guinea to hear, is very encouraging. It gives the traveling<br>
public comfort and confidence that one of the safest mode of travel would be the airline<br>
industry.<br>
<br>
There are many times we hear about boats sinking and cars crashing which becomes<br>
like a monthly occurrence but in the airline industry there are very minimal accidents. CASA<br>
is performing their mandated responsibility as a regulator in the airline industry. And now it<br>

presents us with a challenge of the performance of Air Niugini, Airlines PNG and other third-<br>
level airline operators.<br>
<br>
I would like to commend CASA, that with the very limited funding as we know from<br>
the budgets but it continues to perform and today gives us that confidence and endeavour as a<br>
House to support this industry.<br>
<br>
I would like to also take this opportunity to commend the management of CASA with<br>
this report that was presented today. We heard the Prime Minister talk about corruption where<br>
ICAC and the Police were involved but here we have an organization that does not owe<br>
anybody any money. This is the type of reports we want to hear from organizations because<br>
now it gives other organizations the challenge to be like CASA. How many organizations can<br>
come out with positive reports like this?<br>
<br>
Today’s report gives us a time that we can ponder upon and discuss that a government<br>
organization is performing well. There is nothing negative that I can say here but I would like<br>
to contribute in saying that now CASA gives the challenge to Air Niugini, Airlines PNG and<br>
other third-level airlines to rise to the occasion to meet the challenges that CASA has outlined<br>
in the report.<br>
<br>
Finally, before I sit, let me once again congratulate CASA for this report and I would<br>
also want to thank the Minister, and the previous ministers for a job well done.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr SAM BASIL JNR (Bulolo) — Thank you, Mr Assistant Speaker for allowing me<br>
to speak on my first debate as the new Member for Bulolo.<br>
<br>
Mr Assistant Speaker, I am a commercial holder and I feel that I have to speak on this<br>
report. I would like to thank the Minister for Civil Aviation and CASA PNG.<br>
<br>

<br>
I commend the report and I will make a few remarks which I know will add value to the<br>
report presented by the Minister in relation to CASA PNG.<br>
<br>
The reason being that CASA must have teeth when in operation and the general public<br>
must follow its rules and guidelines by taking lead in safety of the aviation industry. It’s no<br>
good hearing about service providers ignoring the rules and guidelines of CASA.<br>
<br>
In relation to that I will elaborate on the aviation documents which doesn’t concerns the<br>
pilots only but includes the security firms engaged inside and outside of the precincts of the<br>
airport. And that brings back to fit and proper persons which covers everyone from operators,<br>
<br>

pilots and the security guards manning the gates. They all must be protected under the fit and<br>
proper guidelines to carry out their duties. If they are not properly guided by the rules then<br>
disruptions of operations can happen such as security firms disrupting the flights.<br>
<br>
I am glad that the Minister has presented a good report regarding CASA which we all<br>
agreed on. But at the same time CASA must be a leader in aviation industry, especially in<br>
security and safety which means sticking to that name by enforcing it.<br>
<br>
The other point is on third-level airline operators; I] personally think that most of them<br>
are not properly operated therefore I recommend CASA to monitor them closely because most<br>
of them operate on visual flight rules (VFR) so they must have all the necessary documents in<br>
place.<br>
<br>
The other thing I have noticed missing is we don’t have aeronautical information<br>
publication (AIP). It must be current because the aerodrome normally guides the pilots to stick<br>
within the spot to land, park and where to refill. All these important information is provided by<br>
this aerodrome and it’s called the ‘bible’ of the pilots.<br>
<br>
Not all pilots train in one particular school to become pilots, they get their training in<br>
different countries to get their licenses. Therefore, CASA must take lead in standardizing all<br>
the aviation laws under the guidance of IKO so everybody will follow this standard instead of<br>
operating individually.<br>
<br>
That’s all I want to contribute and I commend the report. I also thank the hardworking<br>
officers of CASA for bringing safety to PNG and the international fights.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
