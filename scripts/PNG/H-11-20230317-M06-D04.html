FOURTH DAY<br>
Friday, 17 March 2023<br>
<br>
The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 10.a.m.<br>
<br>
There being no quorum present, the Acting Speaker stated that he would resume the Chair<br>
after the ringing of the Bells.<br>
<br>
Sitting suspended.<br>
<br>
The Acting Speaker again took the Chair at 10.43 a.m., and invited the Member for Central<br>
Bougainville, Honourable Simon Dumarinu, to say Prayers.<br>
<br>
“God the Father, we thank you for bringing us together again in this session. We ask for<br>
your Spirit and strength as you are our Creator and our Maker. You were our Creator in the<br>
beginning. In the scripture, in the Old Testament, you placed men to continue your creation in life<br>
and that has gone on until it became a failure. But you sent your Son, Jesus to continue to redeem<br>
and save us and that work of his has continued on until today, especially in the churches and in the<br>
leadership and in the government.<br>
<br>
Today we pray, in this session, for our leadership in the country especially the Prime<br>
Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, ministers, members, and we also pray for the leadership in the<br>
Opposition on the other side for us together, for our intention of being here before you today.<br>
Whatever it is we share today in this Parliament, continue under your guidance and strength for us<br>
whatever business we have before us.<br>
<br>
God the Father, we pray for the work that we are going to do and we also pray for the<br>
country and pray for those challenges before us, those areas that we need to continue to put in order,<br>
the leadership that we are in, that tasked to do especially through this important House as members<br>
through the law and the decisions and the policy laws that we make through this Parliament. So we<br>
ask for your guidance and protection through this session and may you continue to guide us. Amen’<br>

PACIFIC INSTITUTE OF LEADERSHIP &amp; GOVERNANCE<br>
(AMENDMENT) BILL 2023<br>

through the microphones and its disturbing to hear.<br>

Mr JOE SUNGI (Nuku—Minister for Public Service) — I move —<br>
That the Bill be now read a second time.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, today is an important moment for me to present on behalf of the Prime<br>
Minister and the Marape-Rosso Government, the amendment to the Pacific Institute of Leadership<br>
and Governance Act.<br>
<br>
The institution was first established in 1963 as the first Papua New Guinea Administrative<br>
College before it became Papua New Guinea Institute of Public Administration under the PNGIPA<br>
Act 1993. Then in 2017, the Parliament had repealed the entire PNGIPA Act 1993 and replaced it<br>
with the Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance Act of 2017, which came into full effect<br>
and operation in April 2018.<br>
<br>
In the process of implementing this legislation, the PILAG interim board and the<br>
management have encountered certain legal oversight challenges and gaps in specific provisions<br>
of the Act which required it to be amended or repealed.<br>
<br>
03/04<br>
<br>
The first impediment area of concern was to do with the transitional provisions of the Act<br>
that regulated the transition period from PNGIPA to PILAG, which were all achieved and not<br>
applicable at present.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the other important legal and policy issue to be addressed by this<br>
amendment is the status and appointment process of the PILAG Board Chairperson and Deputy<br>
Chairperson, which was not clearly defined in the principal Act.<br>
<br>
The amendment provides that the Chairperson of the Board shall be the Departmental Head<br>
responsible for Personnel Management whilst the Deputy Chairperson shall be a representative<br>
from either the National Training Council (NTC) or the Department of Higher Education,<br>
Research, Science and Technology (DHERST). This is to ensure that there is continuity and<br>
coordination of the government’s public service training policies and the implementation and<br>
monitoring of the public service training program which is one of the national government&#x27;s KRAs.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the significant amendment is the change of name of the institution<br>
from the Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance to the Somare Institute of Leadership and<br>
Governance (PILAG to SILAG). It is the Executive Government&#x27;s intent and wisdom to rename<br>
this premier government training institution to portray and give prominence in commemoration of<br>
the founding father and first Prime Minister of this country.<br>
<br>
3<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, may I add that Papua New Guinea commemorated the late Sir Michael<br>
Somare’s second death Anniversary on 26 February. The late Grand Chief entered the<br>
Administrative College as it used to be known in 1965, as one of its first students, and soon after<br>
that, they established the civil service. Rightfully the name makes all sense to honour the Father<br>
of this country.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the only new part of this legislative amendment is to do with the<br>
establishment of the PILAG Academic Committee, its composition, and functions. The committee<br>
consists of professional academics and members representing core arms of training within the<br>
institution<br>
<br>
NEC Decision No: NG86/2022<br>
<br>
The decision for the amendment and the repeal of certain provisions of the PILAG Act 2017<br>
is to improve the efficiency of the institute to achieve its objectives and functions, as originally<br>
envisioned.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the institute will have a permanent board in place after the amendment<br>
of this Act. The board shall exercise the power to direct the affairs of the institution with the<br>
Executive Management of the Institute.<br>
<br>
Currently, there are some legal and policy constraints at times that affect the Interim Board<br>
from fully exercising its authority in making policy decisions to ensure that PILAG becomes a<br>
fully-fledged regulatory body for training public servants, partners, and other stakeholders.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the PILAG Act 2017 does not also define and establish a body that<br>
oversees and coordinates the academic aspects of the Institution; therefore, it has caused a vacuum.<br>
04/04<br>
<br>
The insertion of this new part in the bill shall establish the economic committee which shall<br>
exercise governance over the economic programs and regulations responsible for the maintenance<br>
of the standard of admission, training, research and conferment of academic awards.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I am confident that this amendment will improve the institution in its<br>
functions with efficient management and leadership from the Board and its Management.<br>
Therefore, on behalf of the Marape-Rosso Government, I endorse the passing of this bill.<br>
<br>
Mr ELIAS KAPAVORE (Pomio) - Mr Acting Speaker, on behalf of the Opposition we<br>
would like to firstly, accept the amendment made to the 2023 PILAG Act and then would like to<br>
contribute with a debate on this particular bill.<br>
<br>
4<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
The amendment bill of PILAG Act of 2023 is fully commendable and it is appropriate that<br>
this amendment is made in place to have a permanent board to direct the affairs of the institute and<br>
an academic committee responsible for the maintenance of the standards, training, research and<br>
conferment of academic awards. While we appreciate the amendments, I must place on records<br>
our acknowledgements and appreciation of the initial fundamentals that were set by Honorable<br>
Pila Niningi, who was then the Minister for Higher Education, Science Research and Technology<br>
in partnership with Honorable Julie Bishop, then was the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia.<br>
<br>
The PILAG precinct is a partnership between the Government of PNG and Australia to<br>
support the development of ethical and capable public and private sector leaders in PNG public<br>
service. It is aimed at improving governance and service delivery at the national, provincial and<br>
the district level encouraging value-based decision making especially in PNG public service. |<br>
support the change of name from PILAG to Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance on<br>
behalf of the Opposition.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the Grand Chief and the Father of this nation’s legacy must live on<br>
through our generations, especially in the implementation of the Vision 2050, with the targets<br>
under the seven pillars. At self-Government in 1973, then as the Chief Minister, the late Grand<br>
Chief commissioned what commissioned the development of what became the eight aims and later<br>
renamed as the Eight-Point Plan.<br>
<br>
The Eight-Point Plan was a statement of intent by the founding fathers of our nation who<br>
wanted to build a peaceful harmonious society as well as to empower our people. The objectives<br>
of the Eight-Point Plan was first to increase indigenous participation in the economy, secondly,<br>
equality among the ethnic groups and gender and thirdly greater attention to rural and village<br>
development and self-reliance. All of these formed the preamble of our National Constitution,<br>
especially the National Goals and Directive Principles. They are relevant even today, nearly 48<br>
years after our country gained independence.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I commend the Marape-Rosso Government through the Minister for<br>
Public Service for the change of name from PILAG to SILAG. In this we are implementing the<br>
Vision 2050 pillar No.1, the Human Development, Gender, Youth and People Empowerment. The<br>
Public Sector requirements also calls for all senior public servants that must hold a Master’s<br>
Degree or equivalent. To convert PNG IPA to Somare School of Government as according to page<br>
24 of the Vision, it is imperative that we maintain the institute of leadership and governance to<br>
give prominence to the agreed precinct, partnership with the Australia Public Service Commission,<br>
the DHERST, UPNG School of Business, Public Policy and DPM.<br>
<br>
5<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, this brings me to my next point on section 26 (b) on the composition<br>
of the academic committee. It says that the CEO shall be the chairperson, the director of workforce<br>
training and development, heads of academic departments of the institute, librarian and professors<br>
of the institute and the course coordinators of the institute will make up the committee.<br>
<br>
05/04<br>
<br>
Firstly, this is an important training institution so whoever that becomes the CEO, must<br>
hold a doctorate or PHD to leave a credibility and the standard of this institute. My view is to take<br>
on board and include the appropriate represent Master’s from the DHERST and UPNG School of<br>
Business and Public Policy to the academic committee as well. We must also include the PNG<br>
Public Service Commission. They are required under section 191 of the National Constitution to<br>
maintain an ongoing review of state services and to make recommendations to NEC.<br>
<br>
Our Public Service Commission must review its operations and contribute to the<br>
curriculum development and workforce standards in our country. The Pacific Leadership of<br>
Governance precinct emphasised on leadership ethics and values, and is supported by the<br>
Australian Public Service Commission.<br>
<br>
The PNG counterparts at the moment, spend most of their time dealing with review of<br>
personal matters, which they must improve on. There is a significant need to review the operations<br>
so they align themselves to the government’s priorities on the human resource development of our<br>
country.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion, we thank the Government of Australia through DFAT<br>
for their on-going support. We also acknowledge the Department of Personnel Management and<br>
CEO of PILAG, and this government that met today for this particular Bill.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>

<br>
Motion (by Mr Joe Sungi) proposed —<br>
<br>
That the Bill be now read a third time.<br>
<br>
Mr DON POLYE (Kandep — Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and<br>
Technology and Sports) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I support the Minister for Public Service<br>
in the amendment of the PILAG that is brought forthwith in observing some of the functions of<br>
that institution, and also for changing the name from PILAG to CILAG.<br>
<br>
I welcome the articulated comments made by the Member for Pomio on this issue, and I<br>
would like to also talk about some of them. The Public Service Minister has established very<br>
clearly and competently the governance and leadership of the institution.<br>
<br>
The governance and leadership of an institution, not only for the PILAG, but also in the<br>
other institution, in my observation, has become a very challenging and demanding issue for Papua<br>
New Guinea. I have observed in other higher learning institutions like; universities and technical<br>
colleges, institutes, teacher’s colleges, nursing colleges, et cetera.<br>
<br>
The same can be observed in SOE’s and departments and so forth in standard organisations,<br>
that the governance and leadership has been one area of wanting in the country that must be<br>
addressed properly, because the overall operations of the entity or this institution relies on the<br>
leadership provided by the board or the governing council of any entity.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I have observed that when the people on the board become<br>
compromised, it affects the performance and the structure of implementation of the body.<br>
<br>
06/04<br>
<br>
It is very important because many times we complain and we find grievances raised by the<br>
public about lack of performance, people not meeting their key targets and the objectives of the<br>
organization. You will find the quality declining and I found that it is quite common to the Higher<br>
Education sector that I am entrusted with by the good Prime Minister to look after. I find leadership<br>
and governance as a very important issue.<br>
<br>
The two areas that I see that affects or compromises the leadership and governance are;<br>
firstly, politicization. Let me take myself as a case to illustrate the point. If I want a friend or<br>
wantok of mine to become the Chancellor or Vice Chancellor of the University of Papua New<br>
<br>
7<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 10:<br>
Guinea and to other positions down the line, Mr Acting Speaker, if I am wrong or if I am short<br>
sighted what I would do is use the powers given under the Higher Education Provisions Act to<br>
push the appointment of my friends. That has really affected all of the public service machinery,<br>
especially the very important institutions like PILAG or SILAG that we are now referring to.<br>
<br>
I would like to urge all of us that we must understand the appointments of those key people<br>
at the governance and leadership level. The board level is very key because they are the people<br>
who will determine the operations and quality output and implementation of government policy. I<br>
am very happy that the Public Service Minister has very confidently articulated on this amendment<br>
that is brought before this House that we will address and entrust confident people up there. I also<br>
know that it is the policy of the Marape-Rosso government to making sure people appointed are<br>
people with credibility and not only with political experience, but ones that will be making sure<br>
that the institutions and or state bodies are properly governed under the rule of law and manage<br>
money, operational matters and achieve quality.<br>
<br>
The second area is quality of the academic programs. This is about the quality of the<br>
programs and academic programs offered by the institutions. In this case like, PILAG or SILAG,<br>
I heard the Member for Pomio talk about quality academic programs which Minister for Public<br>
Service also mentioned.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, what we are doing at the Higher Education space is, we will not register<br>
any institution, colleges or universities that do not meet the standard of registration. I am driving<br>
that quite vehemently. This standard must be the standard that meet benchmarks against some of<br>
the best business practices and academic practices in the world. When Papua New Guinea’s<br>
standard is high at that level, and programs at that level being disseminated or imparted to those<br>
tutors coming in or trainees in the leadership sector or governance sector, you will find that they<br>
are at par with the international level. That means they can now manage their area of<br>
responsibilities, not with Papua New Guinean standards or cultural way, but with best businesses,<br>
companies and institutions practice of the world. They will have to meet the standard registration<br>
requirement under the Marape-Rosso government.<br>
<br>
The other area we also looked at is the programs that the Minister for Public Service<br>
referred to that are being taught in the institutions. They must be properly accredited. Accreditation<br>
standard of international standards must be met. Mr Acting Speaker, the standard is very important<br>
because when you have somebody passing out of the colleges or the institute like the SILAG<br>
institute for instance, you will be confident that they can administer as a secretary of a department<br>
or as a MD of an SOE or a Vice Chancellor or Chancellor of an Institution in Papua New Guinea,<br>
and deliver quality output.<br>
<br>
8<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 11:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, one of the things I observed is —and let me give a medical calamity as<br>
an example without putting anybody off.<br>
07/04<br>
<br>
If somebody is a good doctor in hospital, the mindset and the impression is he would be<br>
the best manager of that hospital. The best specialist in one particular area cannot be the best<br>
manager of a broader scale of management or governance.<br>
<br>
The Pacific Institute of Leadership and Governance (PILAG) is available for those who<br>
want to become CEOs of hospitals and Vice Chancellors of universities to go through this institute<br>
to qualify for that accredited and well registered courses taught at PILAG or SILAG. And not just<br>
appointing anybody because he or she has a PHD in Chemistry and we blindly offer him or her the<br>
position thinking that they will be a good Vice Chancellor.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, my observation is that it cannot work because he or she is not<br>
specialized in that area. I am not discrediting them but so proud of Papua New Guineans who are<br>
experts in those areas. But management, administration, governance, rule of law and following<br>
process and procedures of governance in public service in PNG is different.<br>
<br>
Therefore, the now called, Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance (SILA), will be<br>
the right place to go to. Those who want to become managers, CEOs, MDs, Secretaries or Vice<br>
Chancellors must go to SILAG to qualify in leadership training process. And they can deploy some<br>
of this leadership techniques in all these institutes, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Finally, the change from PILAG to SILAG named after the Grand Chief, Sir Michael<br>
Thomas Somare, I think is a good idea. The Governor of East Sepik proposed and the Prime<br>
Minister also alluded that we should have a university called the Somare University in East Sepik<br>
to be established. But firstly, to honour the Grand Chief as the first Prime Minister, this institution<br>
was established in 1963, around the same time when the Grand Chief became a politician and<br>
eventually became the Prime Minister.<br>
<br>
Therefore, it’s fitting that we call it SILAG to honor Somare. And even other leaders like<br>
Sir Julius Chan, one of the pioneers who is still here with us and other good leaders who have gone<br>
before us to honor them is to give governance and quality leadership. We must ensure such<br>
programs are properly accredited to international standards and leadership provided in those areas<br>
are wanting to our country. In doing so will improve quality and at the same time honor somebody<br>
like him.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>

QUESTIONS<br>
Teachers Pay Increment<br>
Mr JOHN KAUPA - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My question is directed to the<br>
Minister for Public Service and for the Minister for Education to take note.<br>
10<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 13:<br>
We have almost about 70, 000 teachers in the country; some are teaching in the rural areas<br>
and some are in the most remote areas. They are representing the face of this government in those<br>
various places.<br>
<br>
A three per cent increment was paid to all public servants. Iam asking this question because<br>
my uncle made a follow-up regarding this three per cent from Karimui bush all the way to<br>
Kundiawa town. So, if one teacher is asking about the three per cent increment then it also affects<br>
the other teachers throughout the country.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I want to ask the Minister for Public Service whether he is aware that the three<br>
per cent increment was not awarded to teachers from 2022 to 2024.<br>
<br>
My three questions are;<br>
<br>
(1) Can the teachers be paid the three per cent increment like any other public servants?<br>
<br>
(2) If yes, then what per cent are they going to be paid on?<br>
<br>
(3) When are they going to be paid their salary increment?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr JOE SUNGI - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, and I thank the honorable Member for<br>
Moresby North-East for asking a very important question regarding teachers three per cent<br>
increment; CPI based on the public servants salary increase as well.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, Ill like to inform the House that teachers are part of the Public<br>
Servants in the country that we have about 130,000 clocks on the payroll every fortnight. But out<br>
of the 130,000 public servants, we have 65,000 teachers and therefore they are also entitled for the<br>
three per cent increment.<br>
<br>
However, the direct answers to the three questions are; firstly, yes, they are entitled for the<br>
three per cent increment. Secondly, the Department of Personnel Management is waiting for the<br>
Teachers Union or PNGTA to get themselves organized so they will sort out that matter with the<br>
Teacher Service Commission.<br>
<br>
09/04<br>
<br>
Then from there the process comes to my Department and Treasury or Finance will be able<br>
to release the funding to pay the 3 per cent to them. It’s just the timing that there’s a bit of issue<br>
with the union or PNGTA to get themselves organized and come forward with TSC and my<br>
department and the Department of Personnel Management. We do the paper work to assist them<br>
and make sure that the 3 per cent is also awarded and paid in CPI increase to teachers across Papua<br>
New Guinea<br>

Chimbu — Build Polytechnic School<br>
<br>
Mr LUCAS DAWA DEKENA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, thank you for giving me<br>
this opportunity to ask my question for the first time during this term of Parliament. Before I ask<br>
my question to the Higher Education Minister and for the Education Minister to take note, I would<br>
like to thank the people of Gumine for giving me the mandate on four consecutive elections. I<br>
served the first time I stood for the elections then after that I was taken to Court. in 2017. I was<br>
taken to Court and then in the last elections I was voted in again by the Gumine people therefore I<br>
am thankful to them for giving me the mandate to speak on their behalf here in Parliament.<br>
<br>
In 2014 there was an NEC Decision relating to the setting up of Polytechs around the<br>
country. The NEC Decision 105 of 2014 stated that there would be three Polytechs around the<br>
country, and one of them would be set up in Chimbu province. Since then nothing has been nothing<br>
has been built in my electorate. The Deputy Prime Minister whilst he was Acting Prime Minister<br>
visited a site for another project. During his visit he asked me where the Simbu Polytech was and<br>
I pointed to a grassland with nothing but fencing<br>
<br>
Therefore, my question is to the Higher Education Minister but I would like the Education<br>
Minister to take note because the responsibility was switched between these two ministries. Now<br>
I believe Polytech comes under the Higher Education Minister. I’m not sure what has happened to<br>
the Polytechs in other provinces if they have been constructed and students have started school but<br>
as for Gumine nothing has been done yet, apart from the wire fencing. We believe that there was<br>
a substantial amount of money that was released for this project and there is a certain NPC Limited<br>
joint venture with TP Solutions where TP Solutions may have given the contract to NPC to start<br>
of the constructions.<br>
<br>
(1) Cam the Minister confirm whether NPC has awarded contracts to?<br>
<br>
(2) Can the Minister confirm or deny whether K41 millions of Simbu Polytech funds has<br>
been expended?<br>
<br>
(3) If yes, where has the K41 million gone? (4) If no, when will Polytech construction<br>
start in my electorate and what is the reason for the delay?<br>
<br>
Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr DON POLYE - Mr Acting Speaker, these are very sensitive questions with regards to<br>
Polytech in Simbu province and in Gumine district. Yes, I agree with the NEC decision that is in<br>
place and it is NEC Decision 105. I have seen that and I’ve also got some report. But because he<br>
<br>
12<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 15:<br>
is asking very specific questions as to the contractor and how much money has been paid, if there<br>
has been any work done, I don’t want to give an answer off the top of my head<br>
10/04<br>
<br>
I will give detailed answers because it is very important but that Polytech School will be<br>
built and will be built properly in due process with quality. I will articulate more on that so I will<br>
ask him to be patient until next week when I will answer the questions in detail. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Rural Service Development Program<br>
<br>
Mr FRANCIS SIUNE — Thank you Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to speak<br>
in this House. Mr. Speaker, my question without notice is directed to Minister for Provincial and<br>
Local Level Government Affairs. I think I have asked this question in our previous session but I<br>
want to repeat because I haven’t seen feedback.<br>
<br>
There was a program called Rural Service Development Project or RSDP implemented by<br>
the Government of Papua New Guinea through the Local Government and Provincial Affairs. The<br>
program was financed by World Bank and the Australian Government in excess of K23 million.<br>
It’s supposed to be piloted in 20 LLGs in 19 districts, namely; East New Britain, Central, Chimbu,<br>
Western Province and Western Highlands.<br>
<br>
The program commenced in 2013. This program was vital because it complemented our<br>
DSIP and PSI programs in service delivery and could give rise to bottom-up concept. Mobilisation<br>
component was done in Simbu. The coordination office was established and launched. Beneficial<br>
LLGs have put in their mobilisation funding.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, since today, nothing has been implemented. My question is, can our<br>
good Minister explain what happened to this very important program for the good of everybody?<br>
And if there’s a stop somewhere, Mr. Speaker can we have this very important program activated<br>
and implemented?<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr SOROI EOE — Thank you Mr. Acting Speaker and I thank the Honourable Member<br>
for Kerowagi for the very important question.<br>
<br>
Yesterday, I raised an issue with the Clerk’s office if I could seek leave of the Parliament<br>
to respond to that question but that has not been granted but thank you for asking the question<br>
again so I can fully respond to the issues that you have raised on the 11&quot; of January, the first sitting<br>
of the Parliament.<br>
<br>
13<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 16:<br>
So let me thank you. I would’ve responded immediately had I not fell ill that whole week.<br>
I was not in the Parliament and, therefore, I couldn’t respond to you and answer those important<br>
issues that you have raised. Nonetheless with the concurrence of the Chair, if I could now respond<br>
in detail to the questions that have been raised.<br>
<br>
Mr. ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Minister, the Chair recognizes that we have many<br>
members of the House willing to ask questions within the time frame we have and whether question<br>
time will give you enough time to explain. I will ask you to seek leave of the Chair after the<br>
question time and we can allow you to respond.<br>
<br>
Mr. SOROI EOE - If that is okay with the Member for Kerowagi, I thank you Chair.<br>
11/04<br>
<br>
Disposal of Nuclear Waste<br>
<br>
Mr MUGUWA DILU - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for recognising me. My question<br>
is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.<br>
<br>
On the 13&quot; of January this year, BBC news reported that the nuclear power plant in Japan<br>
was going to dispose one million tonnes of nuclear waste into the Pacific Ocean. Now, I must<br>
congratulate the Fisheries Minister, he wrote to the Pacific Islands Forum to garner regional<br>
support so that they can take a regional position on this issue.<br>
<br>
Now that’s a violation of the International Convention of 1972 — the London Convention<br>
for international actors not to dispose nuclear waste into the Ocean. The Pacific Ocean especially<br>
the Western Pacific Ocean is host to about one-third of the world’s tuna stock and we are host to<br>
also marine biodiversity that has a lot of value when it comes to blue ocean and blue carbon trade.<br>
We also know that the fisheries industry in this country contributes more than K1 billion into the<br>
government coffers so that we can implement our national budget.<br>
<br>
Is the Foreign Affairs Minister progressing any bilateral talks with authorities in Japan so<br>
that they can stop the irresponsible behaviour that they propose to undertake?<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
<br>
Mr JUSTIN TKATCHENKO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker and I thank the Member<br>
for this very important question. Last year in APEC, I had a personal meeting with the Foreign<br>
Affairs Minister of Japan and I raised this question to him on behalf of the Pacific Island leaders<br>
as well as our country as well to find out what the situation is with the nuclear or radioactive water<br>
<br>
14<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 17:<br>
that they plan to release into the Pacific Ocean. He guaranteed that the radioactive water was<br>
perfectly treated and could be drunk as normal drinking water and said that he will ensure that<br>
there is no radioactivity in this water at all. Now that was from that meeting then, Our Prime<br>
Minister also had a meeting with the Prime Minister of Japan and also received a letter from the<br>
Japanese Prime Minister stating the same but has delayed the releasing of this radioactive water<br>
into the Pacific until further notice. So the situation is that if they do release this so-called ‘free-<br>
of-radioactive water’ into the Pacific, firstly it will affect the people of Japan then it will spread<br>
throughout the Pacific.<br>
<br>
Now the Prime Minister of Japan guarantees the last thing he wants to do is contaminate<br>
his own people. So after that, I represented the Prime Minister and Papua New Guinea and<br>
presented the letter to the Pacific Islands Forum Retreat which was chaired by the outgoing<br>
Chairman — the new Fijian Prime Minister, Honourable Rambuka. We brought up this subject<br>
matter and it was agreed that more consultation had to be done. The Pacific Islands Forum leaders<br>
have of course had experience in this nuclear radio activity, radioactivity especially in Micronesia<br>
and those other countries.<br>
<br>
As of to date, from the agreement from the Pacific Island Forum leaders, we will continue<br>
to fight to not allow this nuclear or radioactivity contaminated water to be released and look at<br>
other alternatives that would be better off for the benefit of everyone for the long term.<br>
<br>
12/04<br>
<br>
Yes, Member, we have been in consultation at the highest level with the Japanese<br>
authorities, our Pacific leaders but also with world leaders when we had the ministerial forum as<br>
well with Australia on this issue of radioactivity water being released.<br>
<br>
At this point of time it is on hold for until further negotiations and we hope for common<br>
sense to prevail that an alternative is found out for the benefit of not releasing this radioactive<br>
water into the Pacific so it contaminates our fisheries and affects out people greatly. Thank you,<br>
Mr Speaker.<br>
<br>
Don Matheson and PNG Ports Corruption Scandal<br>
<br>
Mr JOESPH LELANG -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to<br>
the Prime Minister. Mr Acting Speaker, recently the Australian Broadcasting Commission or ABC<br>
has reported an alleged corruption ring that involves influencing the awarding of contracts in PNG<br>
major ports.<br>
<br>
15<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 18:<br>
The financing of this major ports is funded from the Australian Infrastructure of Financing<br>
Facility to the tune of US$434 million or an equivalent of AUS$621 million. It has been alleged<br>
in that report that this ring involves a Philippine-based company called International Container<br>
Terminal Services that paid an alleged AUS$4.35 million into an Australian citizen’s account<br>
earlier in Singapore. This money was used by this Australian citizen, a Mr Don Matheson, to bribe<br>
PNG Ports Officials so they can award lucrative contracts to this Filipino company to operate<br>
PNG’s biggest ports to be funded out of this Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility.<br>
<br>
Mr Speaker, we are facing another negative backlash on our country’s image and it is very<br>
disturbing when it is an Australian citizen who is the ring leader and mastermind in this allegedly<br>
corrupting the Australian taxpayers own money.<br>
<br>
It is also disturbing that this gentleman has even boasted alleging that he has close ties to<br>
our Prime Minister and plays golf with him including assisting with medical bills of a family<br>
member in Philippines.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, these are serious allegations and it is important that these questions are<br>
asked so that the Prime Minister can clear the air on this matter.<br>
<br>
(1) Is the Prime Minister aware of this ABC report and the central role of Don Matheson<br>
in this scandal?<br>
<br>
(2) Can the Prime Minister confirm or deny that he has asked Don Matheson to pay<br>
medical bills of a close relative in the Philippines?<br>
<br>
(3) Can the Prime Minister inform Parliament on the steps his Government has taken to<br>
address this massive corruption that plagued PNG Ports in influencing the awarding of contracts<br>
to this Filipino company?<br>
<br>
Mr William Duma — Point of Order! I want to point out to the good leader of the<br>
Opposition that the financing package from the Australians has not reached our shores yet and<br>
money has not even been utilised for the project. So there is no basis for anyone to say that<br>
Australian taxpayers’ money has been misused or used in a corrupt way.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Minister, your Point of Order is in order. I will<br>
ask the Opposition Leader to finish asking his question and Prime Minister can respond.<br>
<br>
Mr JOSEPH LELANG - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, this happened in 2017 so I think<br>
the Prime Minister is capable of clearing the air on all of these.<br>
<br>
16<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
(4) And the last question, what steps are taken to deal with this Australian citizen who is<br>
the ring leader and mastermind behind this massive corruption scandal and the Filipino company<br>
who has bribed our PNG officials to get these particular contracts?<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE -— Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. I am happy to answer these<br>
questions raised by the Opposition Leader.<br>
<br>
These are important questions raised for public interest. The Australian ABC has done their<br>
investigation and publication on this matter so it is important that the question is asked and<br>
response is given so I appreciate the Opposition Leader for the questions and the opportunity to<br>
respond,<br>
<br>
13/04<br>
<br>
I think he prefaced his questions by giving some background so it is only fair that from<br>
what information I have I make some responses before I answer the questions that he asked.<br>
<br>
Just for the record, the alleged transactions and involvement of the Australian that is named<br>
on the Floor of the Parliament; the transactions took place before the arrangements with the<br>
Australian Infrastructure Fund Facility that we have been running with PNG Ports.<br>
<br>
This is a good program, with substantial port interventions with six major ports in our<br>
country running through this facility. So the allegations that ABC News has picked up were matters<br>
that took place before these port intervention arrangements took place or were agreed upon.<br>
<br>
The current port facility with the Australian assistant has taken place under my<br>
government’s watch but the allegations that are now spun, took place before that, I think the<br>
Opposition Leader did make a mention of 2017-2018 and thereabout.<br>
<br>
Just to give assurance to Parliament and to the country, I have asked the Minister for State-<br>
owned Enterprise and Kumul Consolidated Holdings to give a total investigation and check on this<br>
matter so that on a subsequent parliamentary sitting or through a public press release we could<br>
inform the country of the total background of what happened during the 2017-2018 period. As a<br>
reference to a major company that operated, that company’s engagement was secured through due<br>
process in 2017-2018. That company operates Port Moresby and Lae Ports, as we speak, and to be<br>
fair, that company is a Philippines company that operates Melbourne Port and some other big ports<br>
in the world. It is the second biggest private port operator as we speak. © Now, whatever that<br>
company did with the person named I am not privy to the full information but to be fair on PNG<br>
Ports and its current Management and Board we have asked for a total look into this transaction.<br>
<br>
17<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 20:<br>
PNG Ports, in one of my statements I have released, is one of our success stories in the<br>
Kumul Group of Companies as far as Kumul Group of Companies is concerned. We are very much<br>
concerned that this report has cast a black spot into PNG Ports. It has a proven success story, and<br>
it sits on the entrance of trade and commerce into our country so we are very mindful of the<br>
implications of this report.<br>
<br>
We are doing internal investigations to ascertain if there are any acts of impropriety<br>
whether by the operator or the person named in this report. Whether he plays golf with me or not<br>
is secondary, I do not tolerate corruption and illegal activities.<br>
<br>
I am the Patron of the Port Moresby Royal Golf Club, and I stay there to play so anyone<br>
that walks into that club whether a visitor or a new person I invite them for a game or walk at the<br>
Golf Course as part of my health regimes anyway.<br>
<br>
So, Mr Maddison plays one or two rounds with me, the person that is named, but outside<br>
of playing golf this report has cast a negative implication on PNG Ports so I have tasked the<br>
Minister for State-Owned Enterprise to review what has happened and he has given his preliminary<br>
observations on the transactions but the fullest review will be undertaken and reported back to the<br>
Parliament.<br>
<br>
I take this time also to relay to the country and all who come here to do business that you<br>
are not here to break laws to do business in our country.<br>
<br>
14/04<br>
<br>
Today before I took this question there was a circulation in our government Whatsapp on<br>
illegal shops at the ports in Lae and I have sent word to relevant authorities and if it is found to be<br>
illegal they just have to de-register the company and conduct investigations. Those who are<br>
entrusted with responsibilities to do this sort of things must run with it. You do not have to wait<br>
for instructions from the top and it should apply to everyone who comes into this country. Whether<br>
you play golf with me or associate with anyone but follow the laws and do things correctly and<br>
you will enjoy your stay here. We are getting a full investigation done into this matter to check<br>
what is happening. We will report back to the Parliament if I could reserve the right to report back<br>
as soon as the full report of this transaction is made available to us.<br>
<br>
Lole Mining Environmental Pollution Concerns<br>
<br>
Mr PETER ISOAIMO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed to<br>
<br>
the Minister for Mining and I would appreciate if the Minister for CEPA can take note.<br>
18<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 21:<br>
Three weeks ago, I attended to an invitation to a forum organized by the Tolokuma Mine’s<br>
new owners, the Lole Mining Company, at Bluff Inn resort in Hiri-Koiari Electorate. I learnt then<br>
that the company is now licensed to commence operations of the mine.<br>
<br>
Whilst I do appreciate and welcome the news for the project to kick start for revenue to<br>
come into the country through our annual budget process; my people of Kairuku have an issue<br>
with the re-opening of the mine, especially with the dumping of the mine waste that had actually<br>
happened in the last 25-30 years of mine operations to the people of Kuni, Mekeo and Kairuku<br>
LLGs respectively.<br>
<br>
These are people who live along the St Joseph - Angabanga River that runs from the<br>
Tolokuma area in Goilala District and ends up at the Abiara/Oreke village at the Kairuku area<br>
running through Kuni and Mekeo LLGs.<br>
<br>
My questions to the Minister are;<br>
<br>
(1) Can he deny or confirm that he did issue a mining lease to Lole Mining to re-<br>
commence mining?<br>
<br>
(2) Is he also going to look into the pollution issue that my people have been affected with<br>
for the last 25-30 years of the mine being in operation?<br>
<br>
Obviously, the current Member for Goilala will agree with me because he visited the<br>
<br>
St Gerald’s School of Nursing in Veifa’a on February 10 2023 and he would agree with<br>
me that the Angabanga River has sedimentation build up on the river bed that causes havoc as soon<br>
as the rain falls in the mountains of Goilala and the flood runs through in a matter of minutes.<br>
<br>
Having to run through a dry road in west Mekeo area and only in a matter of hours he had<br>
to go through 2-3-metre-deep water flood, so there is a real issue here. We’ve also had deformed<br>
babies and mysterious deaths.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member, make a short statement and get straight<br>
to your question.<br>
<br>
Mr PETER ISOAIMO ~— All of these have been caused by the mine for almost 20-30<br>
years of the mine being in operation.<br>
<br>
15/04<br>
<br>
With the re-opening of the mine, I would like to draw the Minister’s attention to the<br>
livelihoods of these people. Otherwise, we would be causing genocide like other places in the<br>
world.<br>
<br>
19<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 22:<br>
My question to the Minister is;<br>
<br>
(3) Has the Minister renewed or issued a licence to Lole Mining to commence<br>
operation in the absence of all the environmental issues that are yet to be resolved?<br>
<br>
I would invite the Minister to look at some world class safety-cautious mines in the world.<br>
For example; with an invitation, the late Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare and I visited —<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Member, you have already asked your question<br>
and now you are making statements. We have limited time for questions.<br>
<br>
Mr PETER ISOAIMO -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. These are matters of importance<br>
and we need to get the Minister to answer correctly because it involves lives of people. The people<br>
of Kairiku are people of Papua New Guinea that deserve human rights like everybody else.<br>
<br>
My question is; can the Minister confirm if he has re-issued the mining licence without<br>
consideration for all the environmental impacts it will cause again to my people?<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Honourable Minister, you are aware that I have been<br>
interrupting the Member on his statement but his concern is on the issues in his electorate. I hope<br>
you will respond well to the Member.<br>
<br>
Sir ANO PALA -— Mr Acting Speaker, I am aware of the importance of this question. The<br>
Member for Kairiku has been a real champion of this environmental issue and he has the right to<br>
be concerned and should be allowed to raise his concerns on the Floor of Parliament, especially to<br>
me as the Minister for Mining.<br>
<br>
This is an issue that must be addressed at all times on this Floor of Parliament.<br>
Environmental issues are important because if affects the lives of people along the rivers. As the<br>
Minister responsible, I was not involved in some of these arrangements, especially the mining<br>
license.<br>
<br>
The license for this mine was issued, but the company went into liquidation. Liquidation<br>
is a commercial transaction issue, meaning when you don’t have any money, you go into<br>
liquidation. You are then governed by the laws of liquidation to handle those issues. But this will<br>
not affect your mining right license. That license is still there, and now that the company has found<br>
a way out of the liquidation, it is now going into business. The mining licence was issued and is<br>
in existence, but as a result of the problems, they couldn’t continue. I want to stress that since the<br>
company was bought from the liquidators, it can now go into business.<br>
<br>
20<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 23:<br>
I am concerned about the environmental issues that you have raised. We have to be mindful<br>
of the fact that you have been raising this issue since you have been on the Floor of Parliament.<br>
You have a right to do so and it is important that we address these issues.<br>
<br>
I will leave that area of the aspect of mining to the responsible Minister to answer you. I<br>
want to also assure you that I am very concerned about it too, since the mine is likely to be re-<br>
open.<br>
<br>
16/04<br>
<br>
We will look at everywhere possible to minimize the impact of the waste dumping in the<br>
rivers. It is something that we should not do. But because companies have been given mining<br>
licenses, environmental damages are bound by those commitments. All of us are bound by it but<br>
we should not stop looking at its detrimental effects. We must find a way because it not only affects<br>
the environment but it also affects our marketability. It affects our value in the industry and in the<br>
market place. If we are dumping out there the impact will make it difficult for us to do business.<br>
This is because the rest of the world is moving forward and we have to move on as well.<br>
<br>
With that, I want to assure you that we will continue to look at a better way. Regarding the<br>
mining license, it was done before and I am committed to those commitments that have been made<br>
by the previous ministers. It was made for companies which had now gone into commercial<br>
commitments too. And as a government we have a duty to honor those commitments, but the<br>
Member for Kairiku, I am with you. I am with your people and I am with your concerns and I want<br>
to assure you that we are looking at every possible way of minimizing or even stopping disposal<br>
of wastes in the rivers. Thank you very much.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Members, I will recognize the Member for North<br>
Fly. I think he has been standing throughout the week and I haven’t recognized him. So I now<br>
recognize the Member for North Fly to ask questions.<br>
<br>
Development of Border Facilities<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES DONALD - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, it is very generous of you,<br>
because I was sitting and did not stand up. My questions are directed to the Prime Minister. This<br>
is regarding the borders of PNG and Indonesia. I realized we do not have a minister for border<br>
development but it is more appropriate I ask the Prime Minister. This is in relation to the border<br>
post that we are doing in Western Province. On record I think there are two border posts in Western<br>
<br>
21<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 24:<br>
Province in Sota and Weam and one in North Fly and a proposed one in Middle Fly. Previously<br>
we had the one in Wutung and I think the other two in Tumolbil and the rest in West Sepik.<br>
<br>
My questions are:<br>
<br>
(1) What is the National Government focus and plan towards the border facilities?<br>
<br>
(2) How are we going to progress on the development specifically in terms of<br>
infrastructure and the funding arrangement and all of it?<br>
<br>
Now take the case of Wutung; we have realized that these posts were previously developed<br>
by successive governments under a funding arrangement from NDB, I think more than K200 or<br>
K300 million plus. You will see that the infrastructures are substandard. When I say this, I mean<br>
there is no power and no water running, and no customer service and even no office space for staff.<br>
On top of all these, there are no trading facilities. It looks like we are going nowhere, and what<br>
concerns me is how do we, Western Province, make sure we don’t repeat that same mistake and<br>
progress on?<br>
<br>
(3) So what are the funding or resource arrangements for the next lot of infrastructure for<br>
other proposed border post?<br>
<br>
(4) Do we have the same option of NDB or are there other arrangements?<br>
<br>
17/04<br>
<br>
(5) Which department do we work with, is it through the Minister for Foreign Affairs or<br>
Trade and Investment to fast track this border post development?<br>
<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the Member for North<br>
Fly for his important questions as his electorate is located right at the border with Indonesia and<br>
West Papua. There is need for us to step up our border interventions.<br>
<br>
Last December, I was privileged to spend a night at Bench back but before | arrived there,<br>
I visited Weihom, its 15 kilometers from the national border and it was rather sad to see that this<br>
military border post was completely deteriorated and not functioning.<br>
<br>
When I came back from that visit, | committed to step up our interventions and support at<br>
the border areas.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I also want to thank all the members of Parliament for their support in<br>
signing this ratification in our border treaty with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This gives us<br>
the basis for us to go into new treaty arrangements. We will be consulting our landowners along<br>
the borders especially on our side, the LLGs, council wards, the districts and border provinces in<br>
making sure whatever we need to do in the border areas must step up and must have an agency<br>
<br>

responsible for border going forward and with that I want to assure the House and all the border<br>
districts and provinces.<br>
<br>
The function at the moment has been called back and it’s under the Department of Foreign<br>
Affairs in terms of the border. Mr Acting Speaker, we are looking at the border areas from a trade<br>
and commerce perspective. It should be classified as a special economic zone along the border<br>
areas.<br>
<br>
On the other side of the border we have 270 million Indonesians. It is a robust place in terms<br>
of market for our producers and we are looking in that context so the Department of Commerce<br>
and Industry as well as the Ministries of International Trade and Foreign Affairs will work in<br>
partnership with Defense to look into how best we could structure our border area that is geared<br>
towards caring our country’s need going forward into the future because Indonesia has been our<br>
trading partner for so long. We have downplayed those aspects of our relationship and just seeing<br>
them from a political perspective for a long time.<br>
<br>
I want to assure the Member and Vice Minister, his district and province as well as Sandaun<br>
Province and districts have been engaging in our own government in the last two to three years.<br>
We have started a program with the border outpost, Defence Force and the Ministry have taken<br>
care of this matter in a holistic approach by integrating Foreign Affairs, Defense, International<br>
Trade and Commerce and Industry to have a multi-sectoral approach in the border post.<br>
<br>
We can have trade functions at Vanimo/Wutung facing Jayapura and Daru/Weihom facing<br>
Meraque on the other side as well as the middle areas. There is deep conversation going on with<br>
Indonesian authorities and during my visit to Indonesia we have engaged for trade and commerce<br>
to be activated for us to have a border use and sharing arrangements.<br>
<br>
18/04<br>
<br>
Not just at the traditional crossing level but more or less at the commercial and government<br>
to government crossing in the border areas.<br>
<br>
We will call the leaders from the provinces concern to sit together as we worked on new<br>
Treaty with Indonesia for the borders. In that occasion we will pull together our focus on trade and<br>
commerce and get that place open up instead of allowing it to remain a blackspot in our country.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honorable members, Question Time has lapsed, I just like to<br>
put every members of the House on notice. ] understand that many members want to ask questions<br>
23<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 26:<br>
but we have only 45 minutes for questions. So, when you want to ask a question be well prepared<br>
and make the question short.<br>
<br>
I am requesting the ministers who are responding to the questions, please make your reply<br>

<br>
ANSWER TO PREVIOUS QUESTIONS<br>
<br>
Mr SOROI EOE (Kikori-Minister for Provincial and Local-Level Government Affairs) —<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I seek leave of Parliament to respond to questions asked by<br>
honorable Member for Kerowagi on the 11&quot; of January this year, which were repeated today.<br>
<br>
Leave granted.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Member<br>
for Kerowagi on this question without notice that was asked on the 11&quot; of January 2023 regarding<br>
the status of Rural Service Development Project or RSDP in Kerowagi electorate of Chimbu<br>
Province and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea.<br>
<br>
I] then assured the Honorable Member and the House that I will seek advice from the<br>
department and respond to the Member in that sitting of the Parliament or later sitting. However,<br>
this didn’t transpire because I felt ill in that session hence, I will now respond.<br>
<br>
By way of background, I wish to inform the Member and this Honorable House that RSDP<br>
is a World Bank funded rural service delivery program that complements DSIP and PSIP projects.<br>
The National Government secured a concessional loan of $23 million in 2017 from the World<br>
Bank for this important project.<br>
<br>
The Department of Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs is the implementing<br>
and oversight agency of this project which aims to implement tangible projects identified by local<br>
communities themselves at ward level based on priorities and the needs of those communities. The<br>
desired outcome of RSDP is empowering and transforming rural communities to improve qualities<br>
of life there.<br>
<br>
For the last four years, we have had drawn down nearly 30 per cent of the World Bank<br>
funding for total of 256 project proposals throughout the nation particularly those provinces that<br>
are involved. There have been delays in projects implementation due to external causes such as<br>
<br>
24<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 27:<br>
Covid-19 and the National Election that recently concluded, impacting on the overall delivery of<br>
the project along with internal challenges.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the program is currently being implemented in five provinces Central,<br>
East New Britain, Chimbu, Western and West Sepik. A total of 19 districts and 20 LLGs in these<br>
provinces are participating in these important projects. Some of 256 project proposals have been<br>
identified out of which 29 are targeted at women’s grouping.<br>
<br>
19/04<br>
<br>
Examples of these community projects are construction of aid post, construction of<br>
classrooms and teachers houses, water catchments projects, bridges, community halls, and solar<br>
power and livelihood projects for women and mothers.<br>
<br>
East New Britain Province is the only province that is into the implementation phase,<br>
starting with Raluana LLG, followed by Simbu Province and Central and Western who are<br>
however not far away from this full implementation of this project.<br>
<br>
There is LLG counterpart contribution an amount of K70 000 that is required. These funds<br>
are equally shared with selected wards and when total project funding for each project proposals<br>
at ward level is finally vetted by the communities. My department is working with all levels of<br>
government to try and make systems of Government work in the provinces, districts, LLGs and<br>
including wards. And this project is one of the most important intervention to make sure projects<br>
at ward levels are delivered.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, Chimbu Province alone has the highest number of project proposals<br>
numbering up to 53 in total that are awaiting draw down of funds from the World Bank. A total of<br>
four LLG’s in the province are participating in four districts namely Kumai Bomai LLG in<br>
Gumine, Suai LLG in Sinasina-Yonggomugl, Siana LLG in Chuave and Gena Wagula LLG in<br>
Kerowagi. The selection of districts and LLG projects were done by the provincial administration.<br>
Whilst all the wards had the opportunity to submit their expression of interests, Kerowagi had only<br>
14 project proposals including two women groups that were identified and selected by<br>
communities and approved. During the first quarter of this year, my department will carry out<br>
outstanding activities that will need to be completed in Kerowagi district and the Chimbu province<br>
as a whole. My department to complete development committee followed by LLG development<br>
committee endorsement. Once this project is completed we will move into ward development grant<br>
agreement signing to open ward accounts to transfer funds to start implementing the actual<br>
projects. I want to assure the Honourable Member that process of Kerowagi will be undertaken in<br>
<br>
25<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 28:<br>
the first quarter of this year. A total cost of 14 project proposal for his district is estimated at around<br>
K1.2 million.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I must also inform the Honorable Member that part of the delay is also<br>
due to following stringent financial management guidelines put in place by World Bank and as the<br>
implementing agency we are in compliance thus my department only receives funds if and when<br>
we acquit projects related expenses to the World Bank. Likewise, these experiences are also passed<br>
down through our communities throughout the country. I hope that clarifies the status of this<br>
project for Member for Kerowagi.<br>
<br>
I thank the House for listening<br>
<br>
GRIEVANCE DEBATE<br>
<br>
Question proposed —<br>
<br>
That grievances be noted.<br>
20/04<br>
Gender-Based Violence<br>
<br>
Sir JULIUS CHAN (New Ireland) — Thank you Mr Acting Speaker and thank you<br>
Governor of East Sepik. I actually beat you to standing up, really. You may be fit but I actually<br>
beat you. Thank you. I’m not going to be very long with the Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Few weeks ago, we had a big demonstration here on gender violence and I’m going to try<br>
to say a few words just to remind us that there is a problem. The recent initiative in combatting<br>
gender-based violence, GBV, as it is, how each province, particularly my own province should<br>
respond and should have a strategy for it, it’s no good to just simply demonstrate, see and do<br>
nothing. The fact of the matter is it is very, very important, gender-based violence is a very serious<br>
problem in Papua New Guinea. Our women have suffered and you don’t know but they’re some<br>
of the most patient creature on this earth.<br>
<br>
The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals say the magnitude of gender-based<br>
violence, GBV, incidence in Papua New Guinea is considered by some of the epidemic<br>
proportions. Over 41 per cent of men in Papua New Guinea admit to having raped someone and<br>
over two-thirds of women are estimated to have suffered some form of physical or sexual violence.<br>
<br>
It’s very, very serious. We are among the top of the world for this kind of activities. Looks<br>
like we’re very much on the side of animals and the report goes on to note that GBV is considered<br>
<br>
26<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 29:<br>
by many Papua New Guineans to be an acceptable normal part of life, which means that the levels<br>
reported are probably low. The actual level of GBV is much higher than reported.<br>
<br>
GBV and gender equality in general are major issues that need to be addressed in Papua<br>
New Guinea by all of us leaders who are elected to this Parliament and beginning with the<br>
provincial governments using its sub national government to introduce some form of control.<br>
<br>
I think over the past years Honourable Governor of National Capital District, Powes<br>
Parkop, has pushed dealing with gender-based violence in Papua New Guinea. He has established<br>
the NCDC gold standard strategy of addressing GBV, which is a first comprehensive strategy<br>
developed in Papua New Guinea at the provincial level to address the issue of GBV.<br>
<br>
The strategy takes its lead from the Goal 1 of the National Goals and Directive Principles<br>
which establish the goal for every person to be dynamically involved in the process of freeing<br>
himself or herself of every form of domination or oppression that each man or woman will have<br>
the opportunity to develop as a whole person. I think Governor Parkop called a high level meeting<br>
some two years ago which brought together members of parliament, governors, development<br>
partners and others to devise a way forward.<br>
<br>
21/04<br>
<br>
The strategic way to introduce information on gender-based violence into education, the<br>
work place, government, the Police, courts, the market place transportation and home environment.<br>
Overall, the approach I think of Governor Pakop seems like a well-intentioned and well thought-<br>
out out strategy for dealing with gender-based violence. It, Mr Acting Speaker, deserves support<br>
of all the provinces. During the Governors’ week we were talking about how we can empower<br>
provinces, so let us begin there.<br>
<br>
Now standing here before you I want to give you a bird’s eye view that I have taken this<br>
matter very seriously and a possible contribution approach of New Ireland. I also recommend that<br>
New Ireland take its own initiative to prepare its strategy for combating gender based violence.<br>
They should be tailored at specific social and cultural characteristics of New Ireland. It should<br>
serve as New Ireland’s contribution to the proposed governors’ conference which is coming on<br>
GBV. Our Chairman, the Governor of East Sepik and those matters suggested by Governor Powes<br>
Parkop.<br>
<br>
The drafting of such a strategy should be the responsibility of community development<br>
which we all have and law and order sectors which we should have but we are not getting it and<br>
the administration which is very disintegrated today. The overall approach of the strategy should<br>
<br>
27<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 30:<br>
be based on the eight steps recommended by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities<br>
which I am not going to talk about it which is a pretty long piece.<br>
<br>
Why I spend time on this is because women are important. Mr Acting Speaker No matter<br>
how you look at it, no one here today would be here if it was not for a woman, our mothers. I lost<br>
mine about 48 years ago. I am old but I still miss her.<br>
<br>
Women are quite simply the source of life. Women are the creators of humanity. Without<br>
women there would be no people. Now I think that makes women pretty important to all of us.<br>
<br>
I want to link that with youth somewhat because we are the sons of women. Well if women<br>
are creators of life, then youths are the creators of the future. All of us, know, I think me more than<br>
you all, are old (lapuns), we&#x27;ll be gone. You will stay for a very long time. I will be going very<br>
soon, oh there are some people out there who are praying for me to go earlier.<br>
<br>
(Members laughter)<br>
<br>
Sir JULIUS CHAN — Now I hope you won’t get too far. You will beat me to the end of<br>
the line. Don’t get too eager to get rid of us. Still the truth is, the old folks you and me, you are not<br>
as old as me, but I am just generalizing it, we will not be around for that much longer. Unless you<br>
have the special road that we do not have. We are all going the same way.<br>
<br>
22/04<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, who will be left. That’s why I linked the women and the youth. Those<br>
who will be left will be the youth. And who will depend on the youth to make the world a better<br>
place than it is today.<br>
<br>
The youth, our young people. If the youth of the world today do not make the world a better<br>
place tomorrow, then I say there is no hope for humanity. So, I have faith in the youth and I know<br>
they can do it. So it is really a pleasure for me to say a few words on women and youth today. And<br>
to emphasise that I am addressing the youth of New Ireland in Port Moresby and everywhere else<br>
in this country. They must not get involved in this game. They must discipline themselves. New<br>
Irelanders, you have to be very ashamed if you are part of this organisation that constantly denotes<br>
the value of women. Women are the creators of life.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER — Honourable Governor, I am sorry to interrupt you, just<br>
reminding you that your ten minutes of debate has lapsed. Ill allow you to sum up your debate.<br>
<br>
28<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 31:<br>
Sir JULIUS CHAN -— Thank you very much, Mr Acting Speaker, you are the only one<br>
that can do that.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER -— Governor, with respect for you, I gave you the extra three<br>
minutes.<br>
<br>
Sir JULIUS CHAN — I want to repeat myself and I can see some of you are bored. I said<br>
women are the creators of life and that is true but even when women create life but for some reason<br>
we do not seem to appreciate that women do. Why is it that men of the world and men of New<br>
Ireland abuse women? Why is it that United Nations say that Papua New Guinea has one of the<br>
highest rates of gender-based violence of any country in the world?<br>
<br>
Let us not lie to ourselves using sugar coated verbiage, if we cannot look after ourselves,<br>
our human beings, our women who brought us into this world, then all we have said is just rubbish.<br>
<br>
Violence in any country in the world as I have said, why is it that high percentage of women<br>
in Papua New Guinea report that they have been raped then in almost any other country and the<br>
world? This is just the truth. We should be ashamed. We should not camouflage it. We should not<br>
hide it or pretend to say all these good things about the resource-rich country floating on a sea of<br>
oil. These are all just lies if you cannot look after your mother, the women of this country!<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we are among the worst offenders in the world and that to me and I<br>
am sure you share my feeling, is something we really cannot be proud of.<br>
<br>
I am not speaking as though New Ireland is not part of this, in fact that is why I began by<br>
focusing on Now Ireland.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is, it is disgusting, and it must stop. Every time someone gets mad at<br>
someone else, they decide that person is a witch and they start tormenting and even torturing them.<br>
23/04<br>
<br>
Well I can tell all the women and honourable members here today that we must stop this.<br>
You and I don’t stop this then they can do a lot of demonstration but they cannot.<br>
<br>
But, I want to promise you, Mr Acting Speaker, I take this matter very seriously. My<br>
government is going to work on a policy on Violence Against Women. We are going to set up<br>
hotlines for women to call if they are abused, and we are going to set up safe houses for women to<br>
live in so that they can get away from those who are abusing them and we are going to punish the<br>
abusers. I say to all men of New Ireland today, wherever you are, if you abuse a woman you are<br>
going to jail, full stop. Why? Because you show your wives, daughters, and mothers no pity so if<br>
<br>
29<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 32:<br>
you show your woman no pity then we will also show you no pity. The right house for you is in<br>
jail.<br>
<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Governor, I am sorry I will have to interrupt you<br>
again, your other three minutes has lapsed.<br>
<br>
Sir JULIAS CHAN -— Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
Impact of Global Economy<br>
<br>
Mr ALLAN BIRD (East Sepik) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. And may I say to the<br>
House that it is always a privilege for Sir Julius to speak and I will always be happy to give up my<br>
space for him, in recognition of the fact that he is the last man standing. He spoke on an issue that<br>
is very close to my heart and I would like to endorse those comments.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, my grievance is in relation to the economy today, particularly in what<br>
is happening in the US, in some of their medium size banks. We noted last week the closing of<br>
Silicon Valley Bay, which funds organizations like Facebook and a lot of these Tech Companies<br>
and it has gone bust lately, Credit Swiss in Europe, which is one of their biggest banks is also in<br>
trouble and there are many other banks that are indicating that they could be in trouble in the<br>
coming months.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the world could be facing another financial meltdown compared to<br>
1997 and this is being brought about by the prolonged pandemic that the entire world faced in<br>
Covid-19 which forced a lot of governments to borrow, including our government. The Central<br>
Banks around the world began to tighten interest rates in order to control inflation. I have noticed<br>
in Papua New Guinea in the last few months that there has been a lot of concern by the country on<br>
the issue of inflation. Many Papua New Guineans don’t understand why we are facing this and we<br>
somehow feel that what is happening in the other parts of the world should not affect us.<br>
<br>
But, I want to say here in the House that whilst we are concerned with DSIP, fixing things<br>
in our district and provinces we should have a mechanism that recognizes what is happening in<br>
other parts of the world that affect us. Many of us still deny that Covid-19 was real and we forgot<br>
that China is only now reducing its tight control on Covid-19, it has only done so in the last couple<br>
of months. China is the largest country on earth and it continues to take Covid-19 very seriously.<br>
<br>
Also in Papua New Guinea, I noticed that the Central Bank has not tightened interest rates<br>
compared to other Central Banks and so the impact of our banks by the Central Bank perhaps is<br>
not as significant as we see in other parts of the world.<br>
<br>
30<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 33:<br>
Now, just to give everyone the size of the problem, Credit Swiss will be requiring more<br>
than $50 billion in cash injection from the Central Bank in its country to keep operating and that<br>
is how significant it is. So if other banks follow suit then a lot of our banks could be in trouble<br>
because we are borrowing from the world.<br>
<br>
24/04<br>
<br>
That is how significant it is and if other banks follow suit a lot of our programs could also<br>
be in trouble because we are borrowing from the world and we have significant debt. I am worried<br>
about the knock-on effects. And just to give the House a further understanding of what is<br>
happening as a result of Covid-19 and as a result of the Ukraine/Russian war, fertilizer prices have<br>
increased 110 per cent across the world,<br>
<br>
The two crops that rely heavily on fertilizer are rice and wheat. You will notice that this<br>
year the price of rice and wheat globally has increased by 20 per cent. Last year some wheat<br>
producers increased prices by up to 160 per cent. I don’t believe that we should continue to bury<br>
our head in the sand and pretend that what is happening in the globally economy will not affect us.<br>
My view is that we should be doing more locally and increasing local production so that we can<br>
off-set some of these things that are happening globally.<br>
<br>
Our people in the towns and cities will feel this impact and that is why I have been asking<br>
a lot of questions about power as the cost of power feeds into the general cost that everybody needs<br>
to pay. And as we wait for interventions to happen, this is where I personally do not want to<br>
continue to blame the former PNC government. I think that is an old story and we should not<br>
continue to do that. Whatever has happened has happened, let us put it behind us. We should be<br>
really taking ownership of the issues now.<br>
<br>
On the issue on jobs and again it is important for the economy, we just do not have the jobs<br>
and we know that and I recall when I was sitting in the Opposition in this House; the then<br>
Opposition Leader Patrick Pruaitch made a presentation here where the numbers that he got from<br>
the Central Bank showed a decline of 100 thousand jobs. This happened during the time of PNC<br>
in government. Fast forward to today, we still don’t know what we are doing in terms of jobs. We<br>
have all these really nice programs and every district has district programs happening but we do<br>
not know how it is feeding into the economy.<br>
<br>
We have no idea because our statistics is not working and all the time we are making<br>
guesses and throwing mud at each other but the underlying problem still remains. We have more<br>
than 70 thousand young people finishing school every year, are we creating 70 thousand jobs every<br>
<br>
31<br>
<br>
<br>
Page 34:<br>
year? The answer is no and if you look at the presentation by the Treasurer out of the K24 billion<br>
Budget, only K900 million is being targeted at the economy.<br>
<br>
I do not want to complain about that because that is how we have always treated the<br>
economy and if you look at every single Budget, the economy gets a very small proportion of the<br>
National Budget in terms of everything we want to pay for. Education and health get over 40 per<br>
cent of the Budget. And if you look at all of our administration costs for salaries it leaves very little<br>
for the economy. And without the economy we are going to sit back and worry how we are going<br>
to keep the rice and wheat prices low and if people have not already figured it out, palm oil prices<br>
are going up so the cooking oil prices in the shops are going to go up as well. In essence the entire<br>
basket of basic goods that our people want to use, particularly those in towns and cities will<br>
increase in price.<br>
<br>
And we need some kind of intervention, perhaps from Parliament. I am not sure if we have<br>
an economic committee, it’s perhaps time to activate it. We need to be talking to our industries<br>
and those that are supplying power and bring in the entire core structure of doing business down.<br>
We have got to make our economy more competitive so it grows. Whilst we are intervening in the<br>
SME space with concessional funding, it is actually like a drop in the ocean; it is not making a<br>
difference.<br>
<br>
25/04<br>
<br>
It might make a difference to one or two families, but not to the wider community.<br>
<br>
My grievance debate is that; I would like to see someone take ownership of it. I know the<br>
Treasurer ‘cops a lot of flak’ for it, but what people do not realise is that the Treasurer only brings<br>
in the money, he does not spend the money. The spending occurs in other agencies.<br>
<br>
As a member of this Government, I would like to see some of the portfolio ministers, in<br>
terms of the money you are getting from Treasury and are using in your departments, how are you<br>
contributing to alleviating some of this problems. We need to know and be debating those issues.<br>
It is rather unfair that we target the Treasurer all the time, when his job is only to bring money into<br>
the country, whilst other people spend it.<br>
<br>
My biggest fear is the knock-on effects from the banks. If banks in Europe, America and<br>
Asia starts to collapse, we will be in trouble. We will sit here and pretend to be busy with our DSIP<br>
and PSIP to build roads and classrooms, and we will be affected.<br>
<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, this is my grievance debate for this afternoon. Thank you.<br>
<br>

State of the Economy<br>
<br>
Mr KEITH IDUHU (Hiri-Koiari) — Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for this opportunity<br>
to address the House also on similar sentiments as shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province.<br>
<br>
The issues I would like to address is on the culmination of facts on the state of affairs<br>
affecting the globe and our municipal economy, which culminated into an exchange the other day<br>
between the Treasurer and the former Prime Minister, the Member for Ialibu-Pangia.<br>
<br>
I address this issue as a first-time member on the Floor of Parliament. There are 41 of us<br>
in this House, most of who have been prompted by the events of yesteryears and complaints of<br>
yesteryears to come into this House and make a particular difference.<br>
<br>
As a Papua New Guinean, I feel as if we have a very short memory. In the PNC-led regime,<br>
everybody wanted to throw stones, even some of us are in this House today. Again in this regime,<br>
the same very people are so quick to throw stones at the current regime and its affairs and how we<br>
are running this country.<br>
<br>
Our good Treasurer is only one man, so as our Honourable Prime Minister James Marape<br>
and also our former Prime Minister, the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O’ Neill. We seem to<br>
be very quick to judge but not very quick to offer solutions.<br>
<br>
The writings are on the wall. The government cannot fix everything for the population at<br>
any one time, at the drop of a hat. But the efforts that every successive government makes, are<br>
worth taking note of and worth taking the heart to work for this country. It is now 48 years and we<br>
seem to be continuously doing the same thing, yet expecting a very different result.<br>
<br>
As a former late President of the United States once said; “let’s not ask what of the country,<br>
but what you can do for your country”. Ask not of what the country can do for you, but what you<br>
and I can do for our country. They also said; “Rome was not built in one day.”<br>
<br>
26/04<br>
<br>
The economy of course needs our help. I think we can all agree to that. But I think where<br>
we are missing the point when we discuss our economic hardships is that 47 years has transpired,<br>
we made constitutional changes, legislative reforms, bureaucratic changes at the Cabinet levels of<br>
successive governments and yet no matter how many changes we make, how many resources deals<br>
we sign off, how many big projects we can sign off, we still find ourselves in a very strong<br>
disadvantaged position.<br>
<br>
When I say we, I am talking about the eight million people of this country, 80 per cent of<br>
whom are all in the rural sector. We can’t continue to do this blame game because the point is,<br>
people are moving from the rural villages into the fringes of every city. Port Moresby is a classic<br>

example. Lae is a clear classic example. Mt Hagen is another example. Every urban centre has its<br>
fringes of communities building and brewing up.<br>
<br>
We are all running for the same pie and yet every time we talk about building the rural<br>
economy, well how are we going to build the rural economy if we are not availing credit to the<br>
rural economy? And how can we avail credit to the rural economy if we are not availing securities<br>
to our rural economy? And how can we avail security to our rural economy if we cannot formalise<br>
their assets in the rural economy? This is why people are shifting to six-mile, shifting to Hiri-<br>
Koiari, shifting to the fringes of Lae because everybody wants the same thing, poor or rich.<br>
<br>
We all want a shelter over our heads, we also want clothing, we all want a meal on the table<br>
and all of these things require access to financing. Without financing, we cannot feed our families,<br>
our people are going to continue to struggle and the complaints are going to continue to culminate<br>
and every 18 months, you will want to change the government and yet we complain about the lack<br>
of stability.<br>
<br>
We have an opportunity. We have just passed the K24 billion Budget. A budget that will<br>
probably increase the next financial year and will keep increasing against the very little security<br>
that is only available to this country. Our faults, and I resound and I adopt entirely the sentiments<br>
shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province. We need a very close look at the structure of<br>
Government and I say this with great care. I say we need to look at the legal framework. We keep<br>
trying to play rugby league on a golf course. We keep trying to put a square pole though a round<br>
hole. This is why we keep finding ourselves at the drawing board.<br>
<br>
We keep trying to do reforms at the high level but for you to understand, every economy<br>
on this planet earth and the globe, works off security. The security is land. We have 80 per cent of<br>
land in the rural sector, when are we going to include our rural populace if we do not legislate or<br>
formalise that legal economy? If we do not have proper identification for our legal populace so<br>
that they are not creating extra-legal activities so that they can survive. But imagine if we are to<br>
formalise their local economy, their access to credit, then we will be doing a great justice to our<br>
people and for our people.<br>
<br>
I also adopt and endorse the sentiments shared by the Governor of East Sepik Province that<br>
really requires a need for the playing field on which our budget will be run. When we are running<br>
the economy, we must avail the necessary security for every Papua New Guinean to access credit.<br>
There is no point in putting K1 billion into NDB so as to avail it to the rural sector if the rural<br>
sector is not going to be able to avail the security fundamental banking principles, to access that<br>
credit. There is no point!<br>

On the statement made by the Prime Minister on our country standing on milky land<br>
because it has oil, gas and our country is considered as Black Christian Nation.<br>
<br>
When PNG first gained Independence in 1975, there was one thing that stood firm and<br>
gave courage and strength to our country to gain independence and it’s the foundation for this<br>
country. I want to thank the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia, for realizing<br>
the importance during that time. I also thank the former Speaker, for realizing the importance. It’s<br>
very important and it’s to save our country in giving us strength to stand firm.<br>
<br>
Everything stands firmly on stone and it’s the foundation of a country. All of us in here<br>
one way or another are considered as Christians. When we first got elected the pastors prayed for<br>
us and dedicated us all to the Lord for his wisdom, knowledge and understanding upon our daily<br>
lives to lead the country.<br>
<br>
But one thing that I want to touch on is about the Bible in front us in this House. This Bible<br>
doesn’t have protection or guidance over it.<br>
<br>

<br>
Unless we take some structural adjustment on the legal framework of credit in the context<br>
of formalizing customary land tenure in this country, we will be wasting our time in repeating<br>
ourselves like a turning time clock. And sooner or later if the global economy crashes we are going<br>
to be dragged with it because we failed to understand our own prudence and social unit of clans.<br>
<br>
For thousands of years Papua New Guineans always hunted and gathered together as clans.<br>
Why do we keep kidding ourselves? There is absolutely necessary need that this kind of reform<br>
and thinking must be adopted. I encourage and urge all critics because the same critics will be<br>
continuing the same narrative even twenty months down the line.<br>
<br>
I thank the Government, we all must work together and I thank our Prime Minister for his<br>
tireless efforts and sleepless night in the kind of work he does for the country and the former Prime<br>
Minister and the former Ministers for the contributions in their respective duties in serving the<br>
country.<br>
<br>
With these few remarks the Lord will bless you all, thank you so much.<br>

Mr KANSOL HARWAI KAMDARU (Middle Ramu) — Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
<br>
My grievance debate will be brief. But firstly, I thank the Lord for allowing us this time to live.<br>

<br>
<br>
Page 38:<br>
Secondly, I thank our Honorable Prime Minister of this country, the Deputy Prime<br>
Minister, the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia, I thank and congratulate him<br>
for his contribution.<br>
<br>
I also thank the Lord for his mercy and love upon Sir Julius Chan, Governor of New<br>
Ireland, which some of the senior leaders have left us but he is still around and with us today.<br>
<br>
My debate is brief but very important concerning the lives of our people of Papua New<br>
Guinea. I want to elaborate further on the statement made by the Prime Minister on our country<br>
standing on milky land because it has oil, gas and our country is considered as Black Christian<br>
Nation.<br>
<br>

doesn’t have protection or guidance over it.<br>
<br>
28/04<br>
<br>
We have to make it a law in this country because this Bible is here to stay. The law must<br>
guide and protect it in this House. We do not know who the next Government will be; a different<br>
man with different ideas and new thoughts will come. They can be able to move the Bible out. My<br>
concern is that we must include the Bible in our Constitution. The Prime Minister once stated that<br>
Papua New Guinea is a black Christian nation. Those words must go down in the Constitution for<br>
the country, it must act as a stepping stone for us leaders and it will be supporting us and helping<br>
to develop this country and bring it forward. This is very important for this country. The majority<br>
of people in this country are Christians. Sometimes we encounter situations that are beyond our<br>
control and we entrust our prayers to maintain this country. When we have the Bible in the House<br>
we as leaders can be able to steer the people and the country in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
