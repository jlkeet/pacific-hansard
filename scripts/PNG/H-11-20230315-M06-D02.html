Our people have prepared and have been waiting for this project to materialised for the last 19 years.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">This is a big project, and apart from the Ramu 1 Project<span style=" color: #4F494B;">, </span>which my people have not been receiving much benefit from, this project proposes to give free equity to the Morobe Provincial Government and the landowners<span style=" color: #4F494B;">, </span>as well as the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the landowners.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">4</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">This has come as a relief to the landowners, who have been silently providing and generating power to develop Papua New Guinea. That is for the two Momase provinces and the five highlands provinces.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">04/02</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker, we have been waiting and this is one of five highlands</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">provinces and it is one of the single biggest projects. And as long as the Ramu river keeps flowing and as long as we continue to exist, this project will continue to bring benefits to this nation. My questions are;</p><ol id="l2"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">When will PNG power sign the agreements with the Provincial Governments and the landowners for this very important project?</p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: left;">When will this important resource project Ramu2 Hydro-power project commence?</p></li><li data-list-text="(3)"><p style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -18pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Why is this project taking too long?</p></li></ol><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I ask these questions because m people and the affected areas of Morobe Province especially those in Markham and those in Obura/Wonenara electorate have been anticipating and expecting this project. The government has not come clear as to when <span style=" color: #1D1518;">this </span>project will commence. It is not fair to keep the people waiting when nothing is coming forth. Please I want answers for these questions.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr WILLIAM DUMA <span class="s25">- </span><span class="p">Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. Thank you, Member for Kainantu for asking these important questions. The Ramu2 Hydro-electric project is about</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">$940 million Dollars so that would be about K3.2 billion and was initiated back in 2016. To date KCH which owns PNG Power has spent close to K60 million to conduct the normal hydrological engineering cost management analysis and all other studies associated with it, in getting a huge hydroelectric scheme off the ground.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">It has taken a long time for the project components including PNG Power to develop this project. Thanks to the Government of Prime Minister Marape, who in late 2009 a Power Purchase Agreement was signed between the project proponents and PNG Power. In 2021 the Project Implementation Agreement was signed between the Governor­ General representing the state and the developer. This project has progressed to such a stage where on the 28 November 2022 this government authorized Treasury to issue a normal state guarantee. Not those guarantees that you find in other projects but the normal state guarantee that will protect the interest of the state to support this project.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">5</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">And discussions are being held between KCH<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>PNG Power and the department of Treasury for the issue of the state guarantee. Once the state guarantee is issued it will pave the way for the project proponents to reach a financial closure. Once that is done then they will negotiate with the Wafi<span style=" color: #494246;">/</span>Golpu Mine to sign an off-take agreement that will underpin the economics of this project.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: right;">Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is owned by this country and it is important that we on both sides of this House support this project. It is a project where the long-suffering landowners of Eastern highlands and their provincial government are the people who have been supplying power from the Yonki-Hydro Dam. They have not received many benefits from the government for over many years since the operating this project in the early 1960s.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">This time around<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>this government under the leadership of Prime Minister Marape has recognized the contribution made by the people of eastern highlands and it has decided to allow in addition free equity to be given to the eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the shareholders for 20 per cent of that project. Another 20 per cent equity to the people of Morobe who then will host the Wafi<span style=" color: #494246;">/</span>Golpu.</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">This is the first time any government has recognized the people contributing to power through the hydro-electric project.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s28" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">05/02</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And in addition the government has about K10 million in development grants for</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">the affected landowners. So<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>very soon once the guarantee has been signed, I can assure you the good Member that representatives from KCH and PNG Power will then approach the Morobe Provincial Government and the affected landowners<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the Eastern Highlands Provincial Government and the landowners to sign their project benefit agreements<span style=" color: #494246;">.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: justify;">So Mr Acting Speaker, it is a build<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>owned and operated transfer agreement that will enable the developer who will be spending about K3.2 billion to recover his investment and then transfer ownership to PNG which will own only 60 per cent and then the Morobe and Eastern Highlands Provincial governments and landowners will own the balance<span style=" color: #595257;">.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 154%;text-align: justify;">It<span style=" color: #494246;">&#39;</span>s a first project where provincial governments and the affected landowners and the state will own joint-ownership. Hopefully it will pave way for future projects to follow that precedence where our people are active participants in ver<span style=" color: #494246;">y </span>important resource projects like this<span style=" color: #494246;">.</span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure the good Member that we are nearly there<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>it<span style=" color: #494246;">&#39;</span>s not too late<span style=" color: #494246;">. </span>As soon as we have signed the guarantee and project laws has been reached<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>then</p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">6</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">construction  hopefully  will commence.  And the landowners  and the provincial governments will be invited to participate in those spin-off activities while waiting for the construction to take place. And then once ownership has then been transferred, they will then be equity owners, free-carry the equity after 25 years.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">So I can assure the good member that we are doing everything we can to progress this very important resource project.

To preface my question<span style=" color: #4F4649;">, </span>over the last couple of months<span style=" color: #4F4649;">, </span>we have been experiencing series blackouts all across the country. And whilst we have been experiencing blackouts for the last 15 years or so, it&#39;s actually become worse in recent times.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I think Papua New Guineans everywhere including in my province of East Sepik have been complaining quite loudly and it&#39;s only fair that these questions be put to the Minister on the Floor so that he can explain to the people of Papua New Guinea, what the issues are and how quickly they can be fixed.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">06/02</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now my understanding from East Sepik is that our current generators have been</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">hired from someone, perhaps 15 years ago. So PPL is paying for the hire of these machines to supply power to East Sepik. I understand also that in other parts of the country there are private power suppliers and these private power suppliers sell power to PNG Power at a</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">7</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: right;">rate of about 33 toea per kilowatt. PNG Power then on sells the power for domestic uses at around 60 to 70 toea per kilowatt and to commercial users at 90 toea per kilowatt. So it enjoys a healthy growth margin<span style=" color: #4B4246;">, </span>from what&#39;s it&#39;s supposed to pay and from what it on sells. From my own recent investigations, I could be wrong and stand corrected in the</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">House, is that PNG Power currently owes all its suppliers approximately K600 - K800 million in debts which it is unable to pay? One of those suppliers is currently in Court seeking restitution from PNG Power.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I want to also go on the record and appreciate the work of the Minister for State Enterprises in the last few weeks where he directed Kumul Holdings which is the owner of PPL to pay for the fuel to keep our provinces running even though they are still rationing power.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 39pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Now the Minister stated just recently in answer to another question that this company is owned by the people of Papua New Guinea.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 139pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Provide Financial Report of PPL</p><ol id="l3"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Being that as it is<span style=" color: #4B4246;">, </span>can the Minister furnish a financial report to this House so that all members and the people of Papua New Guinea can appreciate the financial position of PPL?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">I understand that Kumul Holdings is trying to build up the balance sheet of PPL so that it can sell it some point at a profit. Now I want to know how long that process is going to take<span style=" color: #4B4246;">.</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 112pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts</p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If PPL currently owes K800 million or so to its suppliers<span style=" color: #4B4246;">, </span>how long will it take for it to trade out of that difficulty and how long will it take for it to build up the value<span style=" color: #4B4246;">, </span>and therefore we should be able to sell it a profit.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I would like a commitment on this Floor this morning from the good Minister to tell the people of Papua New Guinea how long it will take.

Of course, everyone has been complaining about PNG Power. I can say that we have no quick answers and no quick solutions to this important national asset of ours. I&#39;ll try to answer some of those questions, starting with the last question.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">07/02</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In relation to the kind of contracts that PNG Power has, usually under the law every</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">year it submits through Cabinet what is known as annual operating plan and that usually contains schedule of contracts that entered into by PNG Power and of course the financial situation. And of course, I will now seek Cabinet&#39;s approval following process then in due course to present a statement to this Parliament about this very important national-owned company<span style=" color: #52464B;">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is definitely not on sale now<span style=" color: #52464B;">, </span>we are not going to sell this important company through a fire-sale which will result in us in getting no value for an important national asset. We have the power, mechanism, and controls to work together to tum this company around, which have been allowed over many years not the last five years or this government took office since 2019 for this country to be in the stage where it is now. Over the many years, we&#39;ve allowed this company to go down this pathway, we are not really proud of a company like that.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #52464B;">, </span>yes, PNG Power owes various creditors substantial amounts of money; two of them have actually taken PNG power to court. And I can announce to this Parliament that we&#39;ve reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by our people. They recognized that their own national<span style=" color: #160F11;">-</span>owned company is in trouble and they have agreed to allow PNG Power time to trade its way out these difficulties.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">It is not a company that can be easily sold at fire-sales just to get out of a mess like the one it is in now<span style=" color: #5D5959;">. </span>So, they have allowed PNG Power to trade its way and has been making payments.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">9</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, so my short answer is, in the immediate term and even in the near future PNG Power will not be sold at that fire-sales prices where our people will not get a decent return on this company and its assets.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Going back to the case of East Sepik and particularly Wewak town, it is known as a sea center where PNG Power does not make any profit. That is not the only town there are many others who are regarded as sea center, which PNG Power continues to try its best to ensure that at least some power eventhough there&#39;s no return on PNG Power investments.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">And for those of us who maybe thinking that the way out for PNG Power is to transfer ownership of those centers to them, I can tell this Parliament that the provincial governments will come running back to this government for funding because most of them are not making money. And PNG Power has been providing services because of community service obligations.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">And we have had difficult with reliability of power mainly from Puma who continues to bully us using its dominant position in this country. It is something that we all working together to make sure that we have secure and reliable power supplies. It&#39;s an ongoing work in progress. I admitted there are problems, I will never deny it but this sort of things take time actually to resolve and manage.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In relation to the issue of about 30 per cent of the power being stolen, yes, there have been some instances where our own employees of PNG Power have colluded with the outsiders to steal power. And on many occasions when they are having been discovered and found they have been terminated on the spot.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">It is a heavily unionist company compared to the others. The presence of union comprised of about 700 members employees of PNG Power, you wouldn&#39;t believe it. So, you may have read recently that PNG Power had to go to court to obtain that restraining order to prevent the union from calling a strike and the National Court has granted that Order. We are using that as an opportunity to stabitize the operation of the company.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">As I said earlier in this Parliament by December this year, we should have some results which we all can be proud of. It is not a company where we&#39;ve ignored, we&#39;ve invested a lot of time, we have worked on the many issues, there&#39;s a lot of literature on this company telling us what to do.</p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Very <span style=" color: #2D262B;">soon </span>with <span style=" color: #2D262B;">the </span>approval of the <span style=" color: #2D262B;">Prime Minister, there is </span>a <span style=" color: #2D262B;">rescue package that </span>has <span style=" color: #2D262B;">been proposed to Cabinet. Cabinet should be able to approve it. Thank the good Governor for asking those questions.</span></p><h3 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">08/02</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I am not sure if I am answering all the questions but in general<span style=" color: #4D4649;">, </span>my answer to his</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">question is yes, it is a problem Company but we are not sitting back and allowing it to go down further, instead we are doing everything we can to rescue it and turn it around. In areas where there are key centers that are having issues, we have asked Australians to help us by paying for the cost of solar power. Recently, in Dam, PNGSDP and PNG Power came to an arrangement where our people in Dam can be able to enjoy reliable power through solar power. We are also looking at supplying power to Wewak through the installation of a solar power system but the challenge for us now is to identify suitable State-owned land which we can then use to restore the much-needed solar power.

We have recognized that they were overcharging, there was collusion between employees and that company and we have slowly phased them away<span style=" color: #4D4649;">, </span>so as soon as we have our own money we will then be able to buy our own generators.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I have assured the good Governor and the people of Papua New Guinea that this government is doing everything to make sure this company comes back to life.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Promote Police Officers</h3><p class="s21" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;"><span class="h3">Mr GABRIEL KAPRIS </span><span class="s42">- </span>Thank you<span style=" color: #4D4649;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.

I also thank the member for Maprik for his valid questions. I think I will again re-emphasize on our Police Force that we are manpower stretched. At the same time I heard your question in particularly to the instance where you have witnessed an officer who is not performing his/her duties in terms of command and control. That is something at the operational level. <span style=" color: #443D41;">The </span>COP and our good Deputy Commissioner for operations including our ACPs in the provinces are strongly looking at and are reviewing. It is not just in Maprik, <span style=" color: #443D41;">I </span>think it is all across our country.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In our recent discussions with our good governors there were some discussion about how we can empower the provinces a lot more which will empower the districts too. We are looking at some reforms that I would like to implement this year 2023 to address those gaps. Coming back to your situation in Maprik, my good Member, I will ask the Cop <span style=" color: #443D41;">Commissioner </span>to <span style=" color: #443D41;">look </span>into it.

Again, I will re-emphasize, the PPCs were specifically asked to have a dialogue or consultation with each district to develop plans. Those are some of the areas that you will have to highlight within your plans on the challenges that you are facing so it is reflected in your plan. I will emphasize again, that your plan is very important and in your plan you will highlight those challenges. The Member for Maprik I take heed of your question so I can talk directly with you to find solution for the situation that you are facing.

And the Government had honourable intentions and allocated K80 million strategically for SMEs including our people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville. There was a special allocation for those operating SMEs in that part of our country and as long as our people are able to follow the guidelines, they can be able to access those funds.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I&#39;m advised by the CEO ofNDB that the K80million was allocated right throughout the country and that they&#39;ve run out of those funds and now it is up to us in this government and this parliament to ensure that we then in the next budget allocate more money for our people<span style=" color: #4F4B4F;">. </span>It is not only the function of myself as minister, or the prime minister to allocate money. This is something we all have to work together and ensure that we allocate enough money for our people.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining<span style=" color: #4F4B4F;">, </span>the idea of existing SMEs is to ensure that money is allocated to all our Papua New Guineans who involve in all sectors of business including alluvial mining and there is nothing stopping our landowners from trying to have access to be used for alluvial mining. So, when there are funds that are available, we can all encourage them to apply for and ensure that our people get help in terms of loans. So, there is no specific provision for alluvial mining business people to be allocated money but the money is meant for our people who are involved in the general SMEs.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So, I understand also Mr Acting Speaker, that the NDB has some internal funds from its savings which is now allocated to continue to help fund our people so I am sure there is money there<span style=" color: #4F4B4F;">. </span>It is a matter of our people making sure that they approach the bank representatives. Unfortunately, NDB will not be present in every centre of this country. It is present in more specific areas. Our people must make the effort to travel there themselves and apply for the <span style=" color: #4F4B4F;">l</span>oan and of they qualify for the loan, there should be nothing stopping them from benefitting from those funds.

He has projected that the economy will grow by 3.5 per cent this year when rest of the world is expected to grow by 1.<span style=" color: #110E0F;">7 </span>per cent.</p><p style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I just want to ask the treasurer these questions:</p><p class="s52" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">(1) <span class="s53">Where is this growth coming from? Because the rest of the country and the economy is struggling to perform, businesses are shutting down, and most of our exports</span></p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">- <span style=" color: #2F282D;">coffee, cocoa, fisheries, forestry are all on the decline. So, what is driving the growth that you are saying that we are experiencing in this country?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">11/02</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker, I feel that, this is in my view, the growth is driven by LNG</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">exports. When LNG exports are enjoying a very high global prices as a result it is seen as PNG economy is doing well, but I can assure that the economy is certainly not doing well. A lot of people are unemployed and of course that leads me to the second question.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, in recent times the Treasurer had announced that they have created over 10 thousand jobs over the last three years. Now, can the Treasurer inform this House and the country which sectors have delivered those 10 thousand jobs, whether they are in Fisheries or Forestry or Agriculture; please inform this Honourable House so that we can know where the growth is because suddenly on the ground, a lot of people are finding it hard to find new jobs.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure you that people, especially our school leavers who are not properly skilled are facing a lifetime of unemployment and that means that in their life time they might never get a job. So, Mr Treasurer, can you please inform this Honourable House about where this job growth that we are going to experience.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, the third question is about expenditure and the Treasurer has proudly stated over many locations that this government <span style=" color: #463F42;">is </span>making record spendings. Record spending in this year is projected to be about K24.5 billion, of course you are saying that the <span style=" color: #463F42;">record </span>spending <span style=" color: #463F42;">will </span>deliver the growth but, Mr <span style=" color: #463F42;">Acting </span>Speaker, those records spending is not helping struggling families. The household assistance package of Kl .1 billion that the Treasurer had announced is not helping families to put food on the table. It</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">15</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">is only assisting fuel prices to be subsidized for people who own cars and those who are able to afford to have those luxury items. It is certainly not putting food on the table for young Papua New Guinean families and many of them who are struggling to even have a job. So<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker, can the Treasurer tell us how this assistance program will assist our families throughout the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the other question that I want to ask is about inflation<span style=" color: #494246;">. </span>The Treasurer proudly announces on many occasions that the inflation in our country is at 6.3 per cent which is much lower than average long-term inflation of about 7 per cent. That&#39;s what he&#39;s announcing.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, but the real prises in the store goods is a very different story Mr Treasurer. In 2019<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the price of bully beef was at Kl 1.90 and today it is about K20<span style=" color: #494246;">. </span>So<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>I don&#39;t know where the calculation of inflation is coming from and I know I&#39;ve got confidence in our public servants at our National Statistical Office but the reality on the ground is different.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">How is the Treasurer developing this tragedy to address inflationary issues in the country? Why I ask this question is because<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>Mr Treasurer<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>for many Central Banks around the world to curb the raising of inflation around the world<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the interest rates have been increased around many global economies which is trying to curb the inflation increases<span style=" color: #494246;">. </span>Whereas in PNG<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the strategy adopted by the Central Bank and Treasury is to have a steady and unchanged interest rate regime. Now<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>if you maintain an interest rates at that level<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>how are you going to curb inflation from continuing to grow? So, Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>that is my question on inflation and interest rates.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, my sixth question that I want to ask is<span style=" color: #494246;">; </span>now the Treasurer has announced publicly that he has allowed International Monetary Fund to come in and introduce a program in PNG after 20 years. Now<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>reading through<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>we are going to borrow an additional K3.25 billion over the next 3 years.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">12/02</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now, before I ask questions in relation to the International Monetary Fund<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>the</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Treasurer in his statement has confirmed that last year in December<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>he borrowed Kl.8 b<span style=" color: #494246;">i</span>llion from the Australian Government. This year he will borrow another Kl .5 billion in addition to the <span style=" color: #494246;">K</span>3.25 billion that will be borrowed from IMF.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">With all these borrowing<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #494246;">, </span>what will be our debt to GDP ratio? I think your estimates of 53 per cent for the year end will be surpassed thinking that it will</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">16</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">go up close to 60 per cent. Mr Treasurer, if you can inform this honourable House the debt to GDP ratio that you are going to achieve as per your budget estimates of 2023.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, with the Treasurer borrowing from IMF; can he confirm that we are probably the third or fourth country in the world to ask IMF for help after Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Now K3.2 billion over the next three years comes with conditions and this is not an assistance to support a budget Mr Acting Speaker.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Can he confirm that this is a bail out because our economy is struggling to meet revenue targets you have set Mr Treasurer? Mr Treasurer can you confirm also that the conditions that IMF has put which is on the schedule that you have presented to this House Mr Acting Speaker. These conditions include; (1) is that they will make changes to the <span class="s55">Central Bank Act</span><span class="s56">.</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Can you confirm or deny that these changes will include what they call flexible foreign exchange policy?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Does that mean that they will review the valuation of kina and are going to devalue our kina?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The second <span style=" color: #443F42;">issue </span>is that; they are saying that new tax measures from IMF and its on your attachment, Mr Acting Speaker. This House needs clarity and detail as to why you have an obligation to this honourable House and the country.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">What are the new tax measures that we are talking about? Are we going to put more burden on our people and are you going to increase salaries and wages tax? Are you going to increase company tax and what are the new measures?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, why I asked all these questions is because they are also proposing that we need to restructure our public service machinery. And that&#39;s the third condition that they are putting. How many more people are you going to terminate in the public service machinery so that you can have savings to fund your budget?</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, that is what they are trying to achieve. When you read what they have put to you then you will understand. They touched on staffing and remuneration guidelines, which they are referring to people who are struggling on the street to feed their families.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, these borrowings come with very serious conditions</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s58">Mr </span><b>ACTING </b><span class="s58">SPEAKER</span><span class="s60">- </span>Honourable <span style=" color: #443F42;">Member, I </span>will interrupt <span style=" color: #443F42;">your </span>questions.

These are misleading news items; false reports and I wish to make some clarifications in relation to these. Whilst we all appreciate the media and the very important work that they do. The hard work that many of our good journalists perform, they have a responsibility to report the truth because they are in a very serious position of power whereby they manage information and thus influence perception.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s68" style="padding-left: 83pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">20</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">This is not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and worldwide because we are now part of the global community and all the information and news items are reported are carried far and wide throughout this world. On March 10, 2023, <i>The National </i>newspaper ran a front-page news item that read <span class="s72">&#39;Schoo</span><span class="s73">l </span><i>Girls abducted&#39; </i>in a very highly sensational manner and it reported that four girls attending the Popondetta Secondary School were abducted at the St Franciscan Anglican Brothers&#39; retreat at the CTC ward in Northern, Police say. That what it stated. The fact of the matter is and after investigations by my office, the administration and the police, we found that no such incident had occurred. No girls were abducted, there however was a very minor incident where students who were at the retreat were accosted by one man and he was chased away by the staff at the church.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 39pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Yet, <i>The National, </i>a foreign-owned newspaper just like the other daily decided to run this report without carrying out its work with due diligence. For us in the province it is quite disturbing and something that we would like the newspaper to correct appropriately. The other item also a false report which they reported is the item in relation to my election petition.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In that particular item the headline read; <span class="s72">&#39;Governor </span><i>to stand trial&#39; </i>and then it reported that the Northern Governor Garry Juffa will stand trial on three counts of bribery allegations against him and the election petition filed by his contender Jean Parkop.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s59" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">15/02</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fact of the matter is; this is a petition that is going to trial. I am not going on</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">trial. I am not accused of bribery and in fact three persons have been named in this petition or alleged to have committed bribery, I&#39;m not one of those three persons. This newspaper decided to report this fake news. It is now reported not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and in the world. And all of this is also reported online using the internet in breach of our cybercrime laws.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">The third fake report or false report is a letter to the editor. This is something that I would like us to seriously consider, letters to the editor contain opinions of people, sometimes making serious allegations that are not facts but are printed by the newspapers as if they are factual. And I thought it&#39;s important that I make this clarification here, especially for the print media because they have done this on a number of <span style=" color: #443F42;">occasions.</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">In fact, just yesterday, they ran a front page story in relation to a statement that the Treasurer made and he answered the question at a high level and from his perspective as</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">21</p><p class="s74" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">the Treasurer.

I just felt that Parliament must maintain decorum. Question time must be short, sharp precise and to the point. Matters that relate to debate be refrained from to the best of our ability and be discussed in debate and the matters that the Member for Ialibu-Pangia raised are very important and are in response to our economy and in response to a statement that our Treasurer made yesterday on the status of our economy on job creation and everything that relates to the health of our country&#39;s economy. Therefore, it is prudent that we bring this matter up for debate in the next few minutes so that the country fully appreciates.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Sometimes in a world of misinformation, especially fuelled by politics<span style=" color: #544D50;">, </span>the ugly head of politics does appear in our society, in social media, in commentaries in the media proper but correct information is important to assist our people, our country, our economy to be encouraged that we are moving at a right place.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">16/01</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Treasurer must be commended. Anybody can run an economy in good times.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Our Treasurer must be commended because he steered our country&#39;s economy in four hard years - period; on record. I mentioned four hard years, Mr Acting Speaker because when we took Government in 2019, the economic fundamentals were so weak, it was eroded.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The former Prime Minister knows very well the economic conditions passed over to my Government. I was his Finance Minister. The reason why I resigned was because of his appetite for unhealthy and unsustainable debt. He is least qualified to talk about managing the economy and I just give you one pointer, I reminded him already on this Floor of Parliament. What was the rational of going to a Credit Suisse commercial bank and borrowing with a two-year repayment rate at 8.8 per cent in 2018? When you talk about the economy&#39;s liquidity drying up. In 2018, there was a clearest evidence that we were at the precipice, we were falling into an economic abyss that we could not step out from<span style=" color: #544D50;">.</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So Mr Acting Speaker, when we talk, we talk with context to allow the economy to regrow and the Treasurer is in the jump seat at the moment. Let&#39;s give him full support to ensure that he runs the economy to bring our country to a balanced budget at the very earliest. We anticipate by 2027 and a 13-year road map to bring our country out of the bondage of debt that we have carried for so long. These debts precede O<span style=" color: #544D50;">&#39;</span>Neill&#39;s Government&#39;, and precedes Somare&#39;s Government. These are part of our national debt profile that we&#39;ve been carrying since 1975 when we started off<span style=" color: #544D50;">, </span>when our economy was a Kl billion economy.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">23</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">And I just want to encourage this House, our National Parliament and our country. We are trying our absolute best in these tough times. You only have to look at the statistics of our budget delivery. Our budget delivery is not all debt-driven budget. Our budget delivery; a substantial majority of it is funded by our internal revenue. On record IRC is collecting much better today than they have ever collected in the past. In fact, at a much higher level&#39;</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Last year, IRC collected around K13 billion and that&#39;s a record. On average, before IRC was collecting below KIO billion. Customs likewise is collecting above K3 billion. On record, Customs has never collected above K3 billion. These are collected in tough times. Increasing efficiency by appointing good people, we are starting to see better performance in our internal revenue sector and IRC is doing very well, Customs is doing very well. We are not only assisted by the high oil price<span style=" color: #180C15;">. </span>We are assisted by the increased efficiency within and our budget support that is carrying the economy.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker there are some good news, we&#39;ve seen an increase in export from agriculture, starting 2021.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Speaker, I returned from East New Britain over the weekend<span style=" color: #180C15;">. </span>In East New Britain, away from oil and gas dependency, away from mining dependency is an economy that has been running on agriculture and forestry - especially sustainable forestry.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Look at the 500 people now employed in a new veneer plant that we commissioned in 2021. Two years, on we have 500 new people employed in remote Lassul LLG in the Baining part of the Gazelle Electorate. So these are evidential work happening in tough times going forward.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">17<span style=" color: #180C15;">/</span>02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The last four years, Mr Acting Speaker, when our Government we arrived in 2019,</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">we inherited weak economic fundamentals, then in 2020, Covid-19 arrived in PNG and induced a global economic shutdown. The effect carried on into 2021 and yet we had the General Election coming up in 2022<span style=" color: #524D52;">. </span>We had to be expansionary but within responsible budget approach<span style=" color: #524D52;">.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The Treasurer has a clear road map before us. The <span style=" color: #423D3F;">result </span>of the road map assisted with very cheap concessional US dollar denominated borrowing where <span style=" color: #423D3F;">we </span>were able to retire 2019 at the K18<span style=" color: #524D52;">.</span>956 billion expenditures We retired 2020 at the <span style=" color: #423D3F;">K19.398 </span>financial expenditures. We retired 2021 at the K20.131 billion financial expenditures. We retired 2022 at the K23.374 money expenditure<span style=" color: #524D52;">.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">24</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, the sum of all these is over K81 billion being spent in our economy in the last three going four years. You ask me what is the result of these spending, well our public servants are paid on time like never before. I speak as former Finance Minister there were days when public servants were paid behind because Waigani public accounts had no liquidity. And the former Prime Minister knows that how he runs through his friends at Central Bank asking for treasury bill and inscribe stock to be printed.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">We deliberately choose to move a way from treasury bill and inscribe stock going to cheaper US dollar denominated borrowings that had zero per cent at long-term five-year grace period. This is the Treasurer&#39;s track record in the last five years. Collecting debt financing as well as internal revenue raise financing on time delivering an K81 billion in the last three or four years of expenditures in our country.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, the net result is this, our economy grew from K79.6 billion when we took over from 2018 to a Kl 13 billion as listed by World Bank and IMF.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, you ask me how does the macro statistic deal with everyday person? Our disbursement through our districts and provinces over the last four years, we have given K4.4 billion to our districts and provinces. If nothing is happening on the ground, members of Parliament, those who came in today<span style=" color: #574F56;">, </span>you ask the former members of Parliament. Our people out there, if nothing is happening on the ground, go to Ombudsman, <span style=" color: #443D42;">Finance </span>Department, Reporting Department in DIRD.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">But as far as National Government is concern and for instance, speaking from Tari perspective, my district received K15 million each for the last three years. <span style=" color: #443D42;">I </span>have five contractors running work in my district. These contractors employ 200 up to 500 persons each at any time depending on the scope of work.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So Mr Acting Speaker, when someone asks me, <span style=" color: #443D42;">&#39;how </span>many jobs have you created? The DSIP, PSIP program directly or indirectly has put over 10,000 people in employment, not just in Port Moresby where foreign workers were pushing wheelbarrow like it was in the last eight years, but in all parts of our country including the Oppositions&#39; district. We were fair enough to give money to them.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">You ask all members of Parliament, they have employed through their district and provinces. Employment programs that are running through the contractors, especially local contractors who are beneficiaries to government disbursements. Their worked has been out there through the DSIP, PSIP program nation wide with the <span style=" color: #443D42;">100 </span>per cent foot print, we have created over <span style=" color: #443D42;">10,000 </span>jobs directly or indirectly.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s33" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">25</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I come to bills at the Works Department, we have today over 274 road contractors running through consistent funding including retiring over K2 billion worth of contract the O&#39;Neill Government gave never funded on record. Ask the Works Secretary, he will confirm this. In fact, he came out to media already. We&#39;ve delivered and retired outstanding contracts valued over K2 billion, and including today, over K4 billion worth of contract that is running.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">18/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All these 274 Contractors are employing Papua New Guineans because our</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">government chooses to engage more local contractors - SME type of contractors, than the previous government which was very friendly to contractors from outside coming in to work in our country.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Contracts at the Department of Works and other State issued contracts have created over 10,000 jobs as a medium-term or immediate-term stop-gap approach to keeping our people engaged and employed so our economy is lubricated with kinas going to their pay packets and our people engaged in our economy.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, not only this, but for the first time, our generation of leaders on this side have invested money into SME Programs. On record, since 2020<span style=" color: #545254;">, </span>this is the first leadership team that has invested money into SME Programs. You can go to BSP or NDB and they will give you indications that these SMEs are borrowing cheap concession funds at six per cent to ensure that they have start-ups and their business is supported. So, the SME funds, we are providing and these businesses will be directly or indirectly creating employment out there in the market to advance the cause of SME, especially our focus on agriculture and downstream processing in our country<span style=" color: #545254;">. </span>We put money to support freight subsidy, we have put money for price support and to add to this area of focus. we have put money this year for state equity and additional land acquisition to support businesses in our country.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, our government knowing very well where we are led by the Treasurer, has made clear investment choices to diversify away from total reliance and mining and move into other aspects of our economy which we feel can have a greater catchment of our people and bring the majority of our people into economic involvement not just for <span style=" color: #443F42;">today </span>but more <span style=" color: #443F42;">importantly </span>for our future.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Our focus on downstream processing remains our number one area. You may not know it yet, Members of Parliament and the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, but things are</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">26</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">turning around. I point to you all to my trip to Lasull, who would have given them a fair chance, aren&#39;t they not Papua New Guineans? The Bainings<span style=" color: #364F36;">, </span>are locked out there in the bush forever.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">The Honorable Jelta Wong and I arrived in 2021, and today 500 Bainings are employed for the first time and this is the story that I would like to tell.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I would like to commend all the Governors and Members of Parliament who are working with us to advocate and move quickly into downstream forestry, downstream agriculture, and downstream fisheries.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">We have invested in a program for the resuscitation of PMIZ to ensure that the fisheries sector also is lifted up and processing fish catchments in our country. This has been our focus and we will not deviate from it because this focus will create tens and thousands of jobs directly and the spin-off beneficiaries indirectly going forward.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, the Treasurer is at work. I would just want to conclude by pointing to a few commentaries lately. <span class="s94">Business Advantage </span>is a book that&#39;s published not by the Marape Government but by our business community. In their recent publication, <span style=" color: #423D3F;">they </span>made a few interesting observations and I would like every leader here to get a copy of these observations. They did indicate the challenges of operating businesses in our country and <span style=" color: #423D3F;">I </span>do admit to the challenges. We will work with the manufacturing council, and the business council to ensure these challenges are addressed. The hardest challenge was the Forex access. Forex access was still a problem in 2018 going back to 2016.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">19/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When the economy should have been traveling to good times when LNG returns</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">was to have hit the economy and made big impact yet we choose to be hostile to our people by very unworthy investments in years 2014 to 2015, that we were in government.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Today the business community places Forex as the number one challenge and we have worked to retire this challenge.

All he has to do is to look at his own annual budget outcomes that he tabled on this</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">30</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Parliament, to see the figures I am calling<span style=" color: #463F44;">. </span>That is the only document that we can depend on<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>and that is the government&#39;s official position.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>today we have K53 billion worth of debt but the only construction of things happening<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>is the so called Connect-PNG. We will see the outcome of it very soon in regards to who is getting the contract, who is doing the work and who is not doing the work, and who is getting paid.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">21/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Those things are now being asked by the same people that you have brought into</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">the country, the IMF. They are asking about the procurement processes and the names of people who have got contracts, so it will be very interesting and we look forward to seeing them working with you over the next 12 months to give you all the conditions that they have listed and you have tabled on this Floor of Parliament to complied with.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">We are encouraged by some of the things that they are saying but you know that getting K3.25 billion bail from IMF is not easy. It is going to be a challenge<span style=" color: #463F44;">. </span>They are going to tighten the noose and we are going to struggle to survive this is what we are missing in this point. In may 2020 despite what the Prime Minister is saying<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>there is a club in Paris called Paris Club made out of the World&#39;s most developed economies.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">There are no Africans<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>Chinese or many Asians but the world&#39;s most developed economies. And they suspended all the repayments of loans for PNG in May 2020. The Treasurer needs to give some of the details on that to the House. Why did they suspend the repayments? It is only because when we are not able to repay the loan, they suspend it so they give us breathing space. When we have serious physical issues and these are all on the websites that you can google and find out for yourself<span style=" color: #463F44;">.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">These are serious concerns and we can say that we have record spending and record revenue here but that is not reflecting on the state of the economy<span style=" color: #463F44;">. </span>This is what we are arguing about and this is what we are trying to get; the real picture of what is happening on the ground<span style=" color: #463F44;">. </span>People are struggling to go and find a job or even holding onto a job that they have. These are real situations when you have 10,000 go<span style=" color: #463F44;">i</span>ng into some hotel here to look for a job<span style=" color: #463F44;">.</span></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">This is the reality that we are faced with and it is not about political point scoring exerc<span style=" color: #463F44;">i</span>se as we are not going to the polls so w<span style=" color: #463F44;">e </span>have to please an<span style=" color: #463F44;">y</span>on<span style=" color: #463F44;">e. </span>Be the government that is for the people, take on advice<span style=" color: #463F44;">, </span>criticisms and comments and assess why people are complaining. I think when you look say we are pay 6- 8 per cent interest rates that is only</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">31</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">one loan that we got and that was the sovereign loan. and I admit that and we were advised by treasury that it was the path to follow.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">It is only US$600 equivalent to K1.8 billion out of a K53 billion loan book that we have. And you can refer to one point and of course, we could have made better decisions but right now you are not getting free money. Do not come and talk about zero per cent interest rate here and mislead the Parliament. <span style=" color: #463F42;">Look </span>at IMF, they are lending at 2.4 per cent for 5-year grace period and 10-year loan repayment period. I do not know loan agreements about the Australian loans because you have not tabled the documents on them but we have checked them through the internet. And these are realities that you are not telling the nation and that we are in a serious crisis. And if you do not match the revenues that you have projected for this year, you will have a spending crisis, because your ability is just to continue spending because you have a K24 billion budget. It is time to rein in the spending and cut the non-priority areas. If we all have to make sacrifices, let us make them. The country needs us to stand up for our people.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 39pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If we have to cut back on the things that we are doing and the excesses that we are having we must cut back. <span style=" color: #463F42;">IMF </span>is a very good example, their team coming here is an indication that not all is right and that is why we need to take heed of the advice that they are trying to bring in. when you are going to affect the public service machinery and the central bank operations, treasuries operations and introduce new tax and tax administration of this country; these are serious reforms.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If they are asking you to do it, there are timeline to achieve before end of December 2023. So, this is not something that we are going to sit here and play politics about. It is about the reality facing our country we are the only country apart from Pakistan and Sri Lanka in this program now. That&#39;s not something we should be proud of, Mr Acting Speaker.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s97" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">22/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, we&#39;ve had tough times, we&#39;ve had Governments come and go but we all must</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">put our heads together and try and rescue ourselves from the position we are in because all is not well. So I know that we are trying to bring services to our rural communities and look after our own electorates but if the country is not stable and the economy is not performing <span style=" color: #463F42;">well we </span>will not deliver and that is a fact.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">So I urge the Members of Parliament, yes Prime Minister and I can carry on and talk about these things, but you know it has to be factual. The reality on the ground, what</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">32</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">is happening to our people. this is not about politics, elections are finished. Accept what&#39;s going wrong and put our country back on track, that&#39;s all we are asking. Thank you Mr Acting Speaker</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;"><b>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY </b>(Kavieng <span style=" color: #1C1116;">- </span>Minister for Treasury) <span style=" color: #1C1116;">- </span><span style=" color: #443F42;">Thank </span>you Mr Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to continue to debate this morning. Thank you to the honorable member for some of his very convoluted and confusing questions this morning. So a lot has been said this morning and a lot of it has been assumptions, very wrongful ones Mr Acting Speaker and I will try my best to correct some of those and put into context what our Government is trying to do</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, when I try to go through some of the questions that was asked this morning, I would say the honorable member himself doesn&#39;t know how many questions were asked because as he went on about asking the first three questions he started making some more comments, and he sort of got out of control and he got confused as to which ones of those were questions and which ones of those were lies. So let me try and correct some of those today ifl may.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I am disappointed that some of us in this House continue to talk down the economy and create doubt in the public&#39;s mind in relation to the direction of our economy and the growth of our economy. We continue to hear statements like people are suffering, families are suffering, but you know no one provides any facts and the data that we have used in Government and have been for nearly half a century don&#39;t support those. And I&#39;ll give examples this morning</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In relation to the question, where is growth coming from? Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday&#39;s statement, I have answered all of these through the three, four or five questions that the honorable member has asked. If he spent some time reading my statement, spent more time going through some of my media releases. He&#39;d realize that I have answered all of them and I would encourage him to spend more time reading my statements going through the Treasury website because not only will you be a better informed member of Parliament, I think you would be a better person as a result of it.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So in relation to growth, Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday&#39;s statement. I mentioned that the growth forecast for this year was 3.5 per cent. It&#39;s very clear, that&#39;s from the World Bank, in fact the <span style=" color: #443F42;">IMF I </span>didn&#39;t mention forecast growth <span style=" color: #443F42;">at </span>3.7 per cent. <span style=" color: #443F42;">Where </span>does this come from? Because he keeps saying and insinuates that there is no growth and that could not be further from the truth.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">33</p><p class="s59" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">23/02</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker, growth is calculated through monitoring nominal GDP. PNG</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">economy is broken up into 19 sectors it starts at agriculture, forestry and fisheries number one oil and gas extraction, wholesale and retail trade, and I hope I can remember to respond to some of the comments that were made this morning in relation to a big biscuit company in Lae claiming that they were suffering. And it goes all the way down to the 19<span class="s107">th </span>sector called water supply and waste management.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">So if you have a look at that, Mr Acting Speaker, the way it&#39;s monitored is they start off with the breakup of our GDP forecast. Last year was around about Kl 07 billion and this year, as Prime Minister has mentioned so often, is forecast to be Kl 13 billion. These are just facts on how growth is estimated. So that&#39;s where it&#39;s coming from<span style=" color: #4B464D;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Going through some of the very unsubstantiated questions he asked, he talked about our record K24.5 billion Budget, well he got that right. We both agreed on that. And he&#39;s asking how does this help families.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #4B464D;">, </span>ifhe bothered to listen yesterday he would have noticed in page 6 of our statement and I would like to repeat this for his purpose and also respond to his comments to his former best buddy in governments gone passed, the Minister for Higher Education, to give more detail. Well, yesterday, I gave you 12 pages of detailed numbers and so on our record Budget and how does this help families, I did say yesterday that for the first time in PNG&#39;s history our Government, the Marape Government developed a package to help address some of these cost of living pressures<span style=" color: #5D5457;">.</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 39pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">If we all recall K587 million we pumped in and K590 million this year; a total of Kl .17 million that we&#39;ve given to families. No other government including your own, honourable leader<span style=" color: #4B464D;">, </span>has ever delivered such a household assistance package.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So let&#39;s stop saying that we&#39;re not trying to help our families, the facts are clear. I also mentioned yesterday that the IRC had written to all employers early this year with new tax schedules that will apply from the 1<span class="s109">st </span>of January. The other assistance that we offer are that we are providing tax cuts, or the IRC are providing tax cuts of up to K63 per fortnight for all of those earning K20 000 or more.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">To further demonstrate that many more families are benefitting it was mentioned in both dailies earlier this year by Nasfund, who estimated that the household package will benefit over 98 000 of its members. So tens of thousands of our families are benefitting,</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">34</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker. Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands so let&#39;s stop making unfounded allegations like so many families are suffering<span style=" color: #0E280F;">. </span>Be a little more positive, be a bit more accurate, be truthful and talk about the families that are benefiting. And if that was not enough and you say it&#39;s only benefiting those that earn K20 000 or more, it benefits those who live in our rural areas. From the beginning of this year 1<span class="s112">st </span>of January</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I also mentioned yesterday and gave a detailed report that we&#39;re also covering the cost of school project fees for this year. So for example, a family no longer has to pay a project fee of K220 for each of their children attending secondary school.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s113" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">24/02</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, this program helps ensure that our household assistance package gets out to</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">those in the rural areas and those that need the help the most. So, that&#39;s an example of the help that we are getting from this Budget and I would ask the honourable members to stop downplaying some of the positive things that we are doing and be more balanced with your response.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">He then asked another question this morning to members of Parliament that this year we are proposing to receive Kl .5 billion as part of our financing plan to deal without deficit. Well that figure is pretty right so, we agree on that figure. And then, he also mentioned the K3.25 million funding that we hope to get from the IMF in the next three years. He then asked a question, what is the debt to GDP ratio when we affect these particular loans.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So, Mr Acting Speaker, I&#39;m very happy to assure the honourable leader, members of this House and the people of our country that these financing plans that include the two loans that he mentioned comply without debt control laws. So, for example, to answer specifically his question on the debt to GDP which would apply over the next three years so that&#39;s 2024, 2025 and 2026. Our debt to GDP focus for next year sits at 52.2 per cent, 2025projected51. 3 per cent and 2026 dropping down to 49.2 per cent.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So clearly, Mr Acting Speaker, the way in which we undertake our financing plan including every single loan that we take complies with our <span class="s114">Fiscal Responsibility Act, </span>unlike during their time in government.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, when we took office in 2019, <span style=" color: #443D41;">you </span>will all recall, we had a raging debate on whether the Budgets by the then government <span style=" color: #443D41;">were </span>accurate or <span style=" color: #443D41;">whether </span>they were fake. The argument was resolved when finally, we asked and agreed to an independent umpire and who was that? There was the IMF and their ruling were conclusive</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">35</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">and I suggest that might be the reason why a bit of bad blood started coming out with some of the attitudes that we had with the IMF.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, for example, to demonstrate how a government should not manage its Budget and to demonstrate how a government breaches its own law, let me just give you very quickly some facts.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">In the 2019 Budget, the previous government Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook numbers on revenue, they had forecast and announced so gloriously on this Floor, if I can remember sitting on the other side, that their revenue figures would be and were on target to be K14 billion. We totally disagreed, if you all recall and we suggested and claimed and stated it was K12.9 billion. So, then we asked IMF to intervene, they were in Papua New Guinea on a country visit and they assessed the revenue was actually K13 billion. What does that mean? It means that the forecast by the government in relation to revenue was down to K987 million. There figures were out by about a billion kina.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s115" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">25/02</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker on expenditure, the MYEAFO figures said that it was on target</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">to reach Kl 6.3 billion. I stated clearly in that year that the figures should have been around Kl 7.5 billion. The IMF stepped in as the agreed umpire and said it was Kl 7.6 billion. What was this mean? The Government than expenditure figure was overspent by a record Kl .2 billion.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, we have an extraordinary situation where the government&#39;s revenue was down by down by a billion kina and the expenditure was up by a billion kina, was that a mistake, or was it deliberate? How could you possibly make a mistake of Kl billion when you are putting together the National Budget?</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, it gets worse, the deficit they said would be K2.3 billion and I said as Shadow Treasurer it would be closer to K4.5 billion. Well, guess what? The IMF came <span style=" color: #423D41;">in </span>and said that the deficit was actually K4.6 billion, and the government then was out by K2.2 billion in their deficit.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, why I am sharing these significant figures with you is because, <span style=" color: #423D41;">I </span>will now get to the point because my friend likes to talk about debt to GDP so let&#39;s just compare our records, the Marape-Rosso Government with the O&#39;Neill Government.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">The O&#39;Neill Government MYEAFO than from debt <span style=" color: #423D41;">to </span>GDP, they <span style=" color: #423D41;">estimated it was </span>sitting at 31.8 per cent, and if you recall our ceiling was 40 per cent so on paper as this Parliament was being told they were within our debt control ceiling. We said from the</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">36</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Opposition that it was actually in a serious breach at 41. 2 per cent and guess what? The IMF umpire said it was 41.3 per cent. So, the government then was in clear breach of our debt control laws.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, what do we do? The Marape-Rosso Government had to clean up that mess. We came in, restructured the budget, and were faced for the first time undertaking a budget cut which we elected to be Kl.132 billion which we were forced to make so that we could comply with the Debt Control Laws. Then we were criticized for making these Budget cuts and as a result, we had to make some loans and were criticized for it but we were paying off their loans<span style=" color: #4D484B;">. </span>It is a difficult world, isn&#39;t it?</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">So<span style=" color: #4D484B;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker, just to demonstrate to you the difference between the Marape-Rosso and the other government on how we managed not just the economy but specific items like debt to GDP. I also noticed that there was a question asked whether embarking on a three-year IMF Program is a bailout.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I want to categorically deny that the Marape-Rosso Government is undertaking a three-year IMF-funded program because it&#39;s a bailout. The former Prime Minister gave some examples of countries how not to copy when we are managing our economy and I agree with him but can I repeat again<span style=" color: #4D484B;">, </span>I am starting to repeat a little bit more than I like.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, as has suggested the main reasons why countries embark on an IMF Program is because they are experiencing economic stress and economic duress, specifically they normally had a balance of payment problem but both circumstances do not apply to Papua New Guinea.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">26/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker, I say that because if you look at our balance of payments I</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">shared with the Australian Government during our ministerial forum, our balance of payments at the end of 2021, the last available figure was set around K4 billion<span style=" color: #4D484B;">. </span>Our current account balance of payment was around a record of K19 billion.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: left;">So, Mr Acting Speaker, I&#39;m quoting his favourite institution, the Central Bank that he always likes quoting I&#39;m using the same figures so we both agree there.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: left;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #4D484B;">, </span>we do not engage with the IMF because this is a bailout. We engage with the IMF for two specific reasons and they are as follows<span style=" color: #4D484B;">:</span></p><ol id="l6"><li data-list-text="(1)"><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 60pt;text-indent: -17pt;text-align: left;">We want to use a credible international partner to endorse our reform package</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and,</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">37</p></li><li data-list-text="(2)"><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">As we continue with our expansionary policies for driving up our PNG economy, we need to borrow funds and he is the point of difference between the Marape­ Rosso Government and the previous governments<span style=" color: #565052;">. </span>We focus all of our financing on cheap good concessional loans.</p></li></ol><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, we have not and I hope we don&#39;t go down the track of engaging with expensive commercial loans and to be able to access concessional loans<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>two things happen; not only do you pay lower interest like we have done this year, and I mentioned yesterday in my speech where we&#39;ve reduced the cost of interest and this year we&#39;re making a saving of Kl.3 billion. Why don&#39;t some of us talk about some of the positive things that his government is doing? Why do we continually talk down on our economy? Mr Acting Speaker, Kl .3 billion savings this year and where does that go? Probably to most of the DSIP and infrastructure development funds that Ialibu-Pangia will also benefit from<span style=" color: #463F42;">.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;"><b>Mr ACTING SPEAKER </b>-The honourable Minister, I remind you that your 20 minutes<span style=" color: #463F42;">&#39; </span>debate time has lapsed but for the importance of this debate I&#39;ll give you another two minutes to sum up your debate<span style=" color: #463F42;">. </span>However<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>I<span style=" color: #463F42;">&#39;</span>d like to inform you that when you are debating, you have to look at the Chair and debate, do not look at your colleague Members and debate.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Thank you.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;"><b>Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY </b>- Certainly<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>your wish is my command. So, to finish off with the IMF, the second reason why we use and why we need to engage with the IMF is because all of the financing that we will require to continue increasing our development budget until we reach that very important target date of 2027 to achieve a budget surplus and until we reach that very important date of 2034<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>where we will give the government of the day the option for zero sovereign debt.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">It is that all financing is contingent upon the IMF endorsing all of our programs going forward. So<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>when we talk about getting assistance from the Australian and Japanese Government<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>getting programs and assistance from the World Bank<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>the Asian Development Bank and other multilateral partners. There is a condition which they place and the IMF must endorse our 5-year fiscal framework.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">M<span style=" color: #463F42;">r </span>Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>to concl<span style=" color: #463F42;">u</span>d<span style=" color: #463F42;">e, w</span>e don&#39;t go down <span style=" color: #463F42;">t</span>his parth<span style=" color: #463F42;">, </span>then we are for<span style=" color: #463F42;">c</span>ed to go down the alternative that he took and that is<span style=" color: #565052;">, </span>going for commercial loans not only would you pay more but you will be able to find less and you will not be able to grow the budget</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">38</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">that Marape-Rosso Government has done in the three years that we&#39;ve been in government. If you study carefully the 13-year plan<span style=" color: #3D563D;">, </span>I&#39;ll invite you for a free lunch at the Treasury and explain to you in detail the benefits of our 13-year plane.</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Thank you.</p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">finish.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">27/02</p><p class="s17" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr ACTING SPEAKER <span class="p">- I was about to interrupt you on your time but you</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mr JOSEPH LELANG <span class="p">(Kandrian-Glouchester - Opposition Leader) - Thank</span></p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">you<span style=" color: #524D4F;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #524D4F;">. </span>I was hoping that this important matter will be debated at a later time, but I am also happy that it has been brought forward.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">I want to add to this debate by discussing a few things that we have heard from the Treasurer about the downturn on the global economy with World Bank revising the growth downwards. Obviously, with the COVID-19 effects still being felt around the world, some economies have recovered while some are still yet too.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">As a nation, we are affected in so many ways. Now we are talking about a possible IMF standby arrangement and a structural adjustment program also from the world bank. I am thankful that during the Minister&#39;s presentation<span style=" color: #524D4F;">, </span>the paper has attached schedule outlining the quantitative and the qualitative performance criteria&#39;s, including the structural benchmarks. My comments will be focused on that in this debate.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, from what has been presented, this is a loan that will be repaid in about five and half years and the maturity is ten years, meaning that the responsibility ofrepaying that loan will be left to the next government after the elections in 2027. I want to outline some of the measures that will be imposed on us.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">As I have said, this is like a carrot. If they give us the money<span style=" color: #524D4F;">, </span>we will give them the carrot. It comes with a lot of conditionality&#39;s, that have just been outlined. I want to also add that there are a lot of risks associated with this particular program.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Firstly, the K3.25 billion loan will be disbursed over 38 months, a six-monthly dispersal. It addresses the fiscal, monetary and the external sector of our economy. The issue ofrisks arises when you look at the timing. We have a global economy that has been revised downward<span style=" color: #524D4F;">. </span><span style=" color: #443D41;">We </span>are still in the COVID-19 pandemic situation.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">I am hearing, seeing and reading from our domestic economy, that many of our sectors are struggling. For business houses, the issues of inflationary pressures are still out</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">39</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">there. And so, when we look at the timing issue, is there a risk? The reason why I am saying this<span style=" color: #524F50;">, </span>and one of the things that is not shown in the quantitative performance criteria, is the growth.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Usually, under IMF standby arrangements and programs, they list everything,</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">including growth GDP. That is missing. I will rely on empirical evidences of other countries, that do undergo structural adjustment programs from the IMF. And, usually it starts with a contraction in the economy.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">As you will note from the quantitative schedule as well, the size of the budget deficit</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">has been fixed. In fact, it has been reduced from this year&#39;s estimated budget deficit of around 5.9 per cent.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">28<span style=" color: #150C13;">/</span>02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So, the size of the budget is going to be tightened up. Within that context obviously</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">in other parts of the globe and when we study these things and initially when you start a project the size of the economy will contract. And I was just hoping that they would put that kind of quantitative indicators there so <span style=" color: #423D3F;">that </span>we can see how the economy will be performing under an IMF program.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">That is something that is missing and I am pretty sure the officials have discussed that here and that is one of the risks. Another thing that is missing here is that you know there are various portions of our population within our society that are disadvantaged. When you have this kind of programs the government must build into a social intervention program. Whilst we are implementing this we must also target and protect our budget that flows towards assisting the portion of our population that are disadvantaged.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If the Treasurer is talking about the household assistance program build that inside the measure. We must not build it outside as it might be cut off through deficit and this is the reason why I am trying to add in my debate is that those two elements are missing. And if we can have them on will be a good idea. The other issue is the one on exchange rates and I just want to caution, while I know that the fund has been very adamant that we need to remove our exchange rate and let the market clear the exchange rate value and obviously we all know that it will go down.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">My concern is that we have a huge debt in external loans and when we do that and <span style=" color: #423D3F;">I </span>mean the Treasurer<span style=" color: #524F50;">, </span>the government and its officials need to study this <span style=" color: #423D3F;">very </span>well. Is he going to lead us into default because we have almost US$6-7 billion in external debt alone? I am raising this concern because by looking at the quantitative performance criteria of the</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">40</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">fund, you will notice that when the fund hits and by the end of this year the foreign reserves level will drop from the current US$3.26 billion to US$ 1.76 billion. That is one of the effects and it <span style=" color: #443F42;">is </span>part of the criteria. I am just thinking around it and that is risk.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">If we use the ratio of a kina to US <span class="s123">O</span>.28 cents that is going to be around K5-6 billion in foreign reserves by the end of this year under the program and I am pretty sure that they will try to show up our connections through all those loans. I just want to add that as a risk, given that we are already affected. Many of the business houses are already affected by the foreign exchange issues that we are having.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">These are the risks that I want to highlight and some of the missing links that we need to look at. The last thing I want to say is that, I came across a gentleman which most of you may know; he was a former professor at UPNG back in the 60s. Professor Clunnis Ross; <span style=" color: #443F42;">I </span>think he was there with Professor Ross Gamer during those times. <span style=" color: #443F42;">I </span>met him during my studies during one of the IMF and World Bank negotiations and we were doing this mock negotiation and so he introduced himself and I had a chat with him and this is what he said, <span style=" color: #443F42;">&#39;PNG </span>you shouldn&#39;t be running to the IMF and the World Bank&#39;.</p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s87" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">29/02</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There are only two countries in the world that is PNG and Botswana. You have so</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">much minerals, gas, diamonds and resources and you are able to stabilize your economy with the Minerals Stabilization Fund in those days. And so he said this is a good thing, you can sort out your issues and show to the other countries that you can do it. So I thought that I can leave that as a parting message on my debate.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.</p><p style="padding-top: 13pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s87">Mr DON POLYE </span>(Kandep - Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology and Sports) <span style=" color: #0E0308;">- </span>Mr Acting Speaker I would like to join in the debate, I&#39;m not one very keen to gag on other leaders talking, I will have to listen to them. But always have this view that under three conditions we should stop any mislead is the <span style=" color: #443F42;">varsity </span>of facts presented to the Parliament and to the people when the facts are not correct and misconstrued. I think it&#39;s a duty of all of us to say if the facts are not true; to establish the facts in black and white like the honourable Treasurer has done. So, the misinformation must be corrected and I think the <span style=" color: #443F42;">Treasurer </span>has adequately done that.</p><p class="s39" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">If the Opposition, or any member on the Floor of Parliament and anybody who would like to rebut what the Government is doing. There must be an alternative policy, or</p><p class="s39" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">41</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">in this case, if one was in Government before and for instance, we have two former Prime Ministers here. The Rt Honourable Sir Julius Chan<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>the former Prime Minister<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>one of the best we had and the Honourable member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O&#39;Neill. For such people of that category to speak<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>they must also tell what they did and what the present Government is doing against what they did. Therefore, what they did, did bring such positive results and return on investments they did and they can compare that with the current Government.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: right;">In those circumstances the former Prime Minister fell very short to explain and justify his points and therefore if one was listening to the argument presented, you would be inclined with the 100 per cent surety to believe what the Treasurer had presented in support of what the Prime Minister had said rather than to listen to the opposing argument.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The third category of argument should be the one who comes before to discuss the issue must come with clean hands and in law<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>it is the maximum principle of equity, I have clean hands. But I think in this case I find it very difficult to forget very fresh memories recently<span style=" color: #464444;">. </span>What they had done; they had hurt this country so much and then speak as if they have clean hands</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Therefore<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>I had to intervene and raise a point of order because I have vivid memories of the very issue that was raised<span style=" color: #464444;">. </span>Let me mention just one or two before I support the Treasurer in his statement yesterday. On the statement presented, I would like to advise and guide all the members of Parliament that the facts here are perfect. In other words, the figures and status here are very true. You can search it, you can google it, you can ask the World Bank<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>IMF and other Sovereign nations of the facts about Papua New Guinea; you will find that it is true. For instance, PNG<span style=" color: #464444;">&#39;</span>s GDP growth is 3.5 per cent. The world will shrink down 1.7 per cent from the 3.5 per cent growth. That is a fact. I will support.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">When we talk about employment<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>that was the advice that was given to some of us when we were the Prime Minister at that time; that is when we get the money we put elsewhere and not create employment. Buying shares in other countries could not provide employment. That would destroy employment.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>you look at Hansard in the Parliament<span style=" color: #464444;">, </span>I was on the other side as leader of the Oppositions and I usually give that advise too.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s113" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">30/02</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">42</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Ifwe get such money, K3.1 billion which is almost 90 per cent of the development Budget of Papua New Guinea at that time. In other words, you are getting the Development Budget of Papua New Guinea and putting it into a speculative market. If you did that, then you will be able to see in the next 10 to 20 years, unemployment, inflation, foreign reserves with challenges, cash flow situations. We will see all of this because Papua New Guinea is a growing economy<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>we need to strengthen it to a mature economy and people will never listened and now I hear the same people crying over spilt milk. They are saying, there<span style=" color: #443F42;">&#39;</span>s 10 000 people who are looking for jobs<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>and there are none created? You were in that position; you had a decision making power to do that.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The other thing that we raised was, do not give jobs to foreigners. We give our people jobs in the construction industry. That was the call that was made genuinely and sincerely. Not just by a leader of the opposition or somebody who opposed policies of the former Prime Minister of his Government. But we said, don<span style=" color: #443F42;">&#39;</span>t give jobs to overseas people<span style=" color: #443F42;">. </span>Now what has happened? Now overseas people are coming in. They have their own companies with their own interests and they kill our local interest.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>we must speak strategically and see what we have done<span style=" color: #443F42;">; </span>learn from the past and correct the future. Some of us we just talk without thinking about what we have done. Another thing is the debt level. Our debt levels were really high<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>and <span style=" color: #443F42;">I </span>always reminded him that our debt levels must never go up because we will destroy our economy</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">I would like to hear a new member of parliament talk about this issue not the same members of parliament who has been here in Parliament for many years.</p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: right;">Now the Marape<span style=" color: #443F42;">/</span>Rosso government has come in and is trying its best to clean up an issue that was created by people who never listened in the past. And now those who want to complain must have clean hands. I know that these a fair comment that I&#39;m mak<span style=" color: #443F42;">i</span>ng so we understand for the future and we must speak the truth and the truth will set us free<span style=" color: #564F54;">.</span></p><p class="s110" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">On the issue of quantitative and qualitative performance criteria that <span style=" color: #443F42;">I </span>heard the good leader of <span style=" color: #443F42;">t</span>he Opposition mentioned that we will implement such programs and therefore see this growth. You look at the performance of the Government<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>we already have a growth of 3.5 per cent as per hour and we are going on the right track. The IMF did not come and tell us how to grow it, <span style=" color: #443F42;">w</span>e are already growing. But if there is an argument <span style=" color: #443F42;">t</span>hat <span style=" color: #443F42;">w</span>e are not seeing it<span style=" color: #564F54;">, </span>then the responsibi<span style=" color: #443F42;">l</span>it<span style=" color: #443F42;">y </span>lies on <span style=" color: #443F42;">y</span>our <span style=" color: #443F42;">M</span>P<span style=" color: #443F42;">&#39;</span>s<span style=" color: #443F42;">, </span>the pu<span style=" color: #443F42;">b</span>lic ser<span style=" color: #443F42;">v</span>ice and those that have the responsibility mandated to amend the programs of Government. The implementing issue is not the same as the policy issue. <span style=" color: #443F42;">T</span>he Marape<span style=" color: #443F42;">/</span>Rosso government is</p><p class="s110" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">43</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">giving the right policy perspective, statistics are correct and the leadership is in the right direction<span style=" color: #4B703F;">. </span>Now the challenge has come to what the Treasurer was saying yesterday. He said that the Budget must be effectively implemented so this lies solely on the members of parliament, district administration, the provincial administration, the Governors, the District Secretaries and so forth. It&#39;s now up to this House as to how implement the programs to the public service.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Let me specifically talk about the areas I&#39;m entrusted to look after in the area of Education. I am happy that the Budget provides Kl .65 billion for the Education sector. It&#39;s good that we spend money in that area. Not to invest in some stock exchange or business.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">31/02</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It is good to put Kl .65 billion. That is, about 51 per cent increase to skilling our</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Papua New Guineans and that&#39;s a very good thing. If you look at what the Prime Minister has said. In the next five years, we would like to see 30,000 non-school leavers have spaces in all the universities and technical institutions and that is where the money is. As a responsible minister, what I&#39;m doing is, I am looking at ways to improve the skills of Papua New Guineans with employment, but the employability of Papua New Guineans is very important. If they have no skills, it is very difficult for them to get a job. <span style=" color: #464144;">Even </span>though we have the population, we will still cry. We want employment but if we don&#39;t train our Papua New Guineans to be employed in the gas industry; the mining sector; the agriculture sector; the construction industry and in all the other areas, then you&#39;ll find that employment will be a problem because we have not produced skilled people.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">What are you doing with this policy? Are we creating and developing skills that are most relevant for Papua New Guineans so that they could have an employment?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The infrastructure development that the Treasurer mentioned is a key area. If you look at all our institutions, universities and colleges, we are doing infrastructure rehabilitation for science labs, classrooms and dormitories. We have K200 million in partnership with ADB to implement the program and I am happily implementing it because we would like to see the quality of our institutions when quality graduates come out from these institutions. So, we are implementing the government&#39;s policy. If we had the Kl .56 billion in that sector, we should have implemented it already.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 150%;text-align: justify;">Now, in support of <span style=" color: #464144;">what </span>the Treasurer said <span style=" color: #464144;">yesterday </span>on effective implementation of the budget, it is the public service. All of us have a duty to our districts, the DSIP we</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">44</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 148%;text-align: justify;">get is a lot of money. It is Kl <span class="s128">O </span>million as for the budget but it will be K20 million for this year and in the coming years.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">When we talk about employment or any economic growth, it actually lies with the individual MPs, the district administrators<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>finance managers and everybody on the ground. Like in Kandep District, I hold meetings with them to discuss how to convert that money into employability and economic growth and then link it to the Enga Provincial Development Plan Vision 2050 and Medium-Term Development strategies of the National Government. So we already have the solutions to the job we are doing.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">We have the strategies and means of ways to solve those issues and yet you are complaining. We should not be complaining<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>we should be happy and be cheerful. You have a government that is putting a lot of money but it&#39;s up to individual MPs and their public service administration to implement to achieve the intended returns<span style=" color: #464144;">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">I was complaining on the other side when the Member for Ialibu-Pangia was the Prime Minister. I have your debt level has gone up to K35 billion. I heard the Prime Minister James Marape said K29 billion because on the balance sheet of Treasury it was K29 billion but if you look at the money that was used through the SOEs<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>it goes up to K35 billion. You will find some of these SOE<span style=" color: #464144;">&#39;</span>s don<span style=" color: #464144;">&#39;</span>t have the money to invest to make more money for themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Like the PNG Power and other SOEs<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>money must be there as a capital? But when you get a loan and start to build up debts like I alluded to earlier<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>actually the money that were there in the SOEs under the leadership of former Prime Minister to my knowledge is K35 billion. On the Treasury balance sheet is K29 billion so it is a challenge for this side of the House to see how we can manage it. We can scale it down but at the same time<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>we grow the economy<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>create employment for our people and implement programs as well as looking at the rural sector through the DSIP funds<span style=" color: #464144;">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 151%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>the public service is a very important area. I think that the implementation part is an issue and a challenge there<span style=" color: #464144;">.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">On the leadership side<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>I think we are doing well as a government<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>but the only challenges we have are in individual public service in every sector. The public service needs to wake up to the reality. The leadership in the public service needs to be addressed and according to the Treasurer we have heard the statement<span style=" color: #464144;">, </span>that is being addressed adequatel<span style=" color: #464144;">y </span>through the partnership <span style=" color: #464144;">t</span>hat the State has <span style=" color: #464144;">wi</span>th IMF. We are addressing b<span style=" color: #464144;">y </span>way of upgrading the skill, capacity and the capability of public service to implement these programs.</p><p style="padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">45</p><h3 style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">32/02</h3><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 44pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So we should stay focused on implementation and fixing the problems and</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">challenges in the areas that we are entrusted.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, I believed that what a government can do under certain circumstances has been done adequately. When you look at it, there are many alternatives to take but with the current situation and circumstances that are presented, created in the past and some challenges like Covid-19 and the inflation present, the Marape-Rosso Government is implementing programs that are right. I think we should change our mindset both the Government and the Opposition to look at what we must do to make areas we are lacking better than always barking at the government.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">The Government at the moment under all circumstances is doing well and should be supported. I ask the Opposition to support the government by doing what they can do rather than giving misconstrued facts or forgetting the past. I think the direction we should take, is to learn from the past and build on from the present into the future. We must look into the future as a nation of competency and affluence and that is where we are going.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: justify;">Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion as far as the Marape<span style=" color: #130C11;">-</span>Rosso Government is concerned, we are doing well. We support the Treasurer and his economic management regardless of the challenges, dynamics, and conditions we see today learn from the past and let&#39;s move forward. I encourage us to discuss and debate very fruitfully like this but with facts and if you are clean and you give suggestions, I think it is worth listening to, but if you have contributed to the problems it&#39;s all right too, you can learn from your mistakes. This Government is moving in the right direction and the country needs to support it.</p><p style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Thank you, Mr Acting
