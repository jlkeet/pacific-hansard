SECOND DAY<br>
Wednesday 15 March 2023<br>
The Acting Speaker (Mr Koni Iguan) took the Chair at 1O .a.m.<br>
There being no quorum present, he stated that he would resume the Chair after the<br>
ringing of the Bells.<br>
Sitting suspended.<br>
The Acting Speaker again took the Chair at 10.55 a.m., and invited the Member<br>
for Nawae, Honourable Theo Pelgen to say Prayers.<br>
&#x27;We entered this world as equals, we are small, we are naked, we are pure of sin and hate.<br>
We cannot be judged as our souls have not been spoiled. As we grow, we are spoiled with the<br>
goodness and with the temptation of biting that forbidden fruit. Who knows for what reasons are<br>
these temptations, good or evil, right or wrong, but only ourselves. We are in this House to worship,<br>
praise, teach and learn.<br>
We have been appointed by our people to become the servants to deliver to them what is<br>
required. There is only one true spiritual judge that is always looking down upon us and the same<br>
judge to greet us at the mighty gates as we walk hand in hand as equals.<br>
Once again, we enter this new world and we can only wish that these gates are open for us<br>
to travel into the next phase of our journey in spirit, accepted or forgiven of any wrong doing so<br>
help us God. Amen.&#x27;<br>
QUESTIONS<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Members, yesterday I reserved a question<br>
to be asked by the Honourable Member for Kabwum I will give him this time to ask his<br>
question.<br>
1<br>
<br>
Page 5:<br>
Contracting SME&#x27;s to Deliver School Supplies<br>
Mr PATRICK BASA - Good morning, Mr Acting Speaker, and the Prime<br>
Minister, Governors and the colleague Members of Parliament. My question is in regards<br>
to the contracts for the supply of school materials and I therefore direct it to the Education<br>
Minister.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, Waigani Department of Education chooses to use SMEs to<br>
distribute important materials when schools have already started and well into the first<br>
term.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, schools everywhere are struggling mostly those in the rural<br>
communities and remote locations like my district in Kabwum.<br>
02/02<br>
Many cannot coup with increased number of students enrolled, problems with late<br>
transfer of teachers and even the remote schools there is no teachers at this stage and very<br>
poor infrastructures and so on.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, hearing about another million-kina worth of contract for the<br>
supply of materials. I want to ask the Minister the following questions.<br>
(1) Why can&#x27;t the supply of school materials be done by the respective provincial<br>
education boards in collaboration with the district education authorities and the district<br>
leaders like us?<br>
(2) Minister are you aware that this arrangement of using selected SMEs have<br>
failed in the past?<br>
(3) What is the criteria for selecting the SMEs and do they have capacity to cover<br>
the remotest schools like in Kabwum?<br>
(4) Minister can you give an undertaking to provide an audit report on the<br>
procurement of these contracts and present a report to the Parliament for our comments?<br>
Mr JIMMY UGURO - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, I thank the Member for<br>
Kabum for his good questions, regarding the school supplies and the commodity<br>
component of the school supply throughout the country.<br>
This has been an ongoing program which was initiated by the previous governments<br>
and we are continuing on it.<br>
As I mentioned previously, this contract was awarded to a company in 2017, which<br>
was a two-phase contract which commenced work in 2017 and ended in 2022. But starting<br>
2<br>
<br>
Page 6:<br>
this year, the Government has decided to allow the 22 provincial government with the<br>
engagement of SMEs in each province to consider taking the contract. We will do an<br>
advertisement shortly for all SMEs in all provinces to apply for the contracts.<br>
As I stated in the annual report in 2021, that for the first time our government<br>
recognizes about 32 SMEs to take part in a contract totaling K27 million to the local<br>
distributors. A K74 million contract has been signed by the supplier and we have sub<br>
contracted 32 SMEs throughout the country to distribute the school materials throughout<br>
the provinces. And it&#x27;s on going and few other provinces have yet to receive these supplies.<br>
But we are closely monitoring our local SME contractors which some have already<br>
delivered on the distribution and some not yet.<br>
But, I have instructed the department to carry out an audit on it and I will make sure<br>
it&#x27;s properly done. I have also instructed the department for an audit report on how these<br>
contracts have been awarded to these local distributors.<br>
03/02<br>
Supplementary Question<br>
Closure of companies in PNG<br>
Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA - Mr Acting Speaker, recently, we have seen in<br>
the media the closure of many companies operating in PNG. Today, we have heard some<br>
good news from the Minister of Education. My concern is in regards to what he mentioned.<br>
He said, every three years they will look at those companies. My questions are as follows;<br>
(1) Why can&#x27;t they do the books every year, so that we make certain that we deal<br>
with the pertaining issues already with the current suppliers?<br>
We have not addressed the issues that have been affecting us and we have gone<br>
ahead to deal with the new 32 SME groups.<br>
(2) What assurance do we have, that these 32 will perform better than the previous<br>
group?<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we have existing companies who are capable of doing the job<br>
better. They have the capacity and yet we want to get the new 32 groups. We have reputable<br>
companies like Theodist, Moore Printing and Stationary, and Seeto Kui Stationary. They<br>
have been operating in Papua New Guinea for a very long time. They have been here since<br>
Adam was a boy.<br>
Now we want to give it away to people who have got no experience at all.<br>
3<br>
<br>
Page 7:<br>
Mr GARRY JUFF A - Point of Order! That is misleading. They were not here<br>
since Adam was a boy. I just want to clarify that.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Governor, your point of order is out of<br>
order. Honourable Deputy Opposition Leader, do not make a statement to debate on what<br>
you are trying to ask. Get straight to your point.<br>
Mr DOUGLAS TOMURIESA - My question is; are these companies fit and<br>
proper to operate? Papua New Guinea needs to have consistent suppliers with reputation<br>
to operate. The millions that we are spending belongs to our people. Thank you, Mr Acting<br>
Speaker.<br>
Mr JIMMY UGURO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. In the past, there were<br>
only four contractors contracted to our four regions. Our government has now increased<br>
the contractors to 32 to operate in the country.<br>
We are monitoring and assessing them for their performance. As I have said, this<br>
is the last contract. From this year onwards, we are going to give opportunities to provinces.<br>
We encouraged those suppliers and the reputable contractors that you have mentioned, to<br>
also apply when the positions are advertised.<br>
The Minister does not give out contracts. There is a process that we follow, and<br>
NEC always has the last say on a contract being given. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Power project in Eastern Highlands Province<br>
Mr WILLIAM HAGAHUNO - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions<br>
are directed to the Minister for State Enterprises.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the much talked about $890 million Ramu 2 Hydro-power<br>
Project is located in the Eastern Highlands Province. It is between my electorate, the Obura<br>
- Wonenara electorate and your electorate. Our people have prepared and have been<br>
waiting for this project to materialised for the last 19 years.<br>
This is a big project, and apart from the Ramu 1 Project, which my people have not<br>
been receiving much benefit from, this project proposes to give free equity to the Morobe<br>
Provincial Government and the landowners, as well as the Eastern Highlands Provincial<br>
Government and the landowners.<br>
4<br>
<br>
Page 8:<br>
This has come as a relief to the landowners, who have been silently providing and<br>
generating power to develop Papua New Guinea. That is for the two Momase provinces<br>
and the five highlands provinces.<br>
04/02<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we have been waiting and this is one of five highlands<br>
provinces and it is one of the single biggest projects. And as long as the Ramu river keeps<br>
flowing and as long as we continue to exist, this project will continue to bring benefits to<br>
this nation. My questions are;<br>
(1) When will PNG power sign the agreements with the Provincial<br>
Governments and the landowners for this very important project?<br>
(2) When will this important resource project Ramu2 Hydro-power project<br>
commence?<br>
(3) Why is this project taking too long?<br>
I ask these questions because m people and the affected areas of Moro be Province<br>
especially those in Markham and those in Obura/Wonenara electorate have been<br>
anticipating and expecting this project. The government has not come clear as to when this<br>
project will commence. It is not fair to keep the people waiting when nothing is coming<br>
forth. Please I want answers for these questions.<br>
Mr WILLIAM DUMA -Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. Thank you, Member for<br>
Kainantu for asking these important questions. The Ramu2 Hydro-electric project is about<br>
$940 million Dollars so that would be about K3.2 billion and was initiated back in 2016.<br>
To date KCH which owns PNG Power has spent close to K60 million to conduct the normal<br>
hydrological engineering cost management analysis and all other studies associated with<br>
it, in getting a huge hydroelectric scheme off the ground.<br>
It has taken a long time for the project components including PNG Power to<br>
develop this project. Thanks to the Government of Prime Minister Marape, who in late<br>
2009 a Power Purchase Agreement was signed between the project proponents and PNG<br>
Power. In 2021 the Project Implementation Agreement was signed between the Governor<br>
General representing the state and the developer. This project has progressed to such a<br>
stage where on the 28 November 2022 this government authorized Treasury to issue a<br>
normal state guarantee. Not those guarantees that you find in other projects but the normal<br>
state guarantee that will protect the interest of the state to support this project.<br>
5<br>
<br>
Page 9:<br>
And discussions are being held between KCH, PNG Power and the department of<br>
Treasury for the issue of the state guarantee. Once the state guarantee is issued it will pave<br>
the way for the project proponents to reach a financial closure. Once that is done then they<br>
will negotiate with the Wafi/Golpu Mine to sign an off-take agreement that will underpin<br>
the economics of this project.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is owned by this country and it is important that<br>
we on both sides of this House support this project. It is a project where the long-suffering<br>
landowners of Eastern highlands and their provincial government are the people who have<br>
been supplying power from the Yonki-Hydro Dam. They have not received many benefits<br>
from the government for over many years since the operating this project in the early 1960s.<br>
This time around, this government under the leadership of Prime Minister Marape<br>
has recognized the contribution made by the people of eastern highlands and it has decided<br>
to allow in addition free equity to be given to the eastern Highlands Provincial Government<br>
and the shareholders for 20 per cent of that project. Another 20 per cent equity to the people<br>
of Moro be who then will host the Wafi/Golpu.<br>
This is the first time any government has recognized the people contributing to<br>
power through the hydro-electric project.<br>
05/02<br>
And in addition the government has about K 10 million in development grants for<br>
the affected landowners. So, very soon once the guarantee has been signed, I can assure<br>
you the good Member that representatives from KCH and PNG Power will then approach<br>
the Morobe Provincial Government and the affected landowners, the Eastern Highlands<br>
Provincial Government and the landowners to sign their project benefit agreements.<br>
So Mr Acting Speaker, it is a build, owned and operated transfer agreement that<br>
will enable the developer who will be spending about K3.2 billion to recover his investment<br>
and then transfer ownership to PNG which will own only 60 per cent and then the Morobe<br>
and Eastern Highlands Provincial governments and landowners will own the balance.<br>
It&#x27;s a first project where provincial governments and the affected landowners and<br>
the state will own joint-ownership. Hopefully it will pave way for future projects to follow<br>
that precedence where our people are active participants in very important resource projects<br>
like this.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure the good Member that we are nearly there, it&#x27;s not<br>
too late. As soon as we have signed the guarantee and project laws has been reached, then<br>
6<br>
<br>
Page 10:<br>
construction hopefully will commence. And the landowners and the provincial<br>
governments will be invited to participate in those spin-off activities while waiting for the<br>
construction to take place. And then once ownership has then been transferred, they will<br>
then be equity owners, free-carry the equity after 25 years.<br>
So I can assure the good member that we are doing everything we can to progress<br>
this very important resource project. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr GARRY JUFFA - Mr Acting Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal<br>
explanation perhaps after question time as I am mindful that members may want to ask<br>
questions. I stood yesterday but I was not recognised so today I am asking if I can be given<br>
the opportunity to do that. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER-Honourable Governor of East Sepik, I will ask you to<br>
raise your question but before that let me respond to the Honourable Governor of Northern.<br>
I will direct the Clerk to report to you and you can inform him on your matter and we will<br>
fit you into the schedule of the session.<br>
Mr ALLAN BIRD - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, my question is directed to the<br>
hardworking Minister for State Enterprises.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, this is in relation to the constant blackouts and the issues<br>
affecting PNG Power Limited. To preface my question, over the last couple of months, we<br>
have been experiencing series blackouts all across the country. And whilst we have been<br>
experiencing blackouts for the last 15 years or so, it&#x27;s actually become worse in recent<br>
times.<br>
I think Papua New Guineans everywhere including in my province of East Sepik<br>
have been complaining quite loudly and it&#x27;s only fair that these questions be put to the<br>
Minister on the Floor so that he can explain to the people of Papua New Guinea, what the<br>
issues are and how quickly they can be fixed.<br>
06/02<br>
Now my understanding from East Sepik is that our current generators have been<br>
hired from someone, perhaps 15 years ago. So PPL is paying for the hire of these machines<br>
to supply power to East Sepik. I understand also that in other parts of the country there are<br>
private power suppliers and these private power suppliers sell power to PNG Power at a<br>
7<br>
<br>
Page 11:<br>
rate of about 33 toea per kilowatt. PNG Power then on sells the power for domestic uses at<br>
around 60 to 70 toea per kilowatt and to commercial users at 90 toea per kilowatt. So it<br>
enjoys a healthy growth margin, from what&#x27;s it&#x27;s supposed to pay and from what it on sells.<br>
From my own recent investigations, I could be wrong and stand corrected in the<br>
House, is that PNG Power currently owes all its suppliers approximately K600 - K800<br>
million in debts which it is unable to pay? One of those suppliers is currently in Court<br>
seeking restitution from PNG Power.<br>
I want to also go on the record and appreciate the work of the Minister for State<br>
Enterprises in the last few weeks where he directed Kumul Holdings which is the owner of<br>
PPL to pay for the fuel to keep our provinces running even though they are still rationing<br>
power.<br>
Now the Minister stated just recently in answer to another question that this<br>
company is owned by the people of Papua New Guinea.<br>
Provide Financial Report of PPL<br>
(1) Being that as it is, can the Minister furnish a financial report to this House so<br>
that all members and the people of Papua New Guinea can appreciate the financial position<br>
ofPPL?<br>
I understand that Kumul Holdings is trying to build up the balance sheet of PPL so<br>
that it can sell it some point at a profit. Now I want to know how long that process is going<br>
to take.<br>
Length of Repayment Term For PPL Debts<br>
(2) If PPL currently owes K800 million or so to its suppliers, how long will it take<br>
for it to trade out of that difficulty and how long will it take for it to build up the value, and<br>
therefore we should be able to sell it a profit.<br>
I would like a commitment on this Floor this morning from the good Minister to<br>
tell the people of Papua New Guinea how long it will take. Give us a time frame; is it going<br>
to be six months, one year or five years? How long will it take before the people of Papua<br>
New Guinea can expect the reliable power supplies that they pay for? I also understand<br>
that 30 per cent of power produced by PPL is stolen by certain individuals.<br>
(3) What is PPL doing to recover this power that is being stolen? What kind of<br>
contracts is PPL doing with whoever it is that is currently draining the life out of this<br>
country?<br>
(4 ) Could the Minister provide to this House a list of all the contracts in the interests<br>
of transparency and accountability so that we and the people of Papua New Guinea can<br>
8<br>
<br>
Page 12:<br>
know? We all want to understand what is affecting PNG Power, what can be done to fix it<br>
and how soon can they be fixed.<br>
Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker I would like to thank the<br>
good Governor of East Sepik Province for raising these very important questions. Of<br>
course, everyone has been complaining about PNG Power. I can say that we have no quick<br>
answers and no quick solutions to this important national asset of ours. I&#x27;ll try to answer<br>
some of those questions, starting with the last question.<br>
07/02<br>
In relation to the kind of contracts that PNG Power has, usually under the law every<br>
year it submits through Cabinet what is known as annual operating plan and that usually<br>
contains schedule of contracts that entered into by PNG Power and of course the financial<br>
situation. And of course, I will now seek Cabinet&#x27;s approval following process then in due<br>
course to present a statement to this Parliament about this very important national-owned<br>
company.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, PNG Power is definitely not on sale now, we are not going to<br>
sell this important company through a fire-sale which will result in us in getting no value<br>
for an important national asset. We have the power, mechanism, and controls to work<br>
together to tum this company around, which have been allowed over many years not the<br>
last five years or this government took office since 2019 for this country to be in the stage<br>
where it is now. Over the many years, we&#x27;ve allowed this company to go down this<br>
pathway, we are not really proud of a company like that.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power owes various creditors substantial amounts of<br>
money; two of them have actually taken PNG power to court. And I can announce to this<br>
Parliament that we&#x27;ve reached agreement with those companies who are actually own by<br>
our people. They recognized that their own national-owned company is in trouble and they<br>
have agreed to allow PNG Power time to trade its way out these difficulties.<br>
It is not a company that can be easily sold at fire-sales just to get out of a mess like<br>
the one it is in now. So, they have allowed PNG Power to trade its way and has been making<br>
payments.<br>
9<br>
<br>
Page 13:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, so my short answer is, in the immediate term and even in the<br>
near future PNG Power will not be sold at that fire-sales prices where our people will not<br>
get a decent return on this company and its assets.<br>
Going back to the case of East Sepik and particularly Wewak town, it is known as<br>
a sea center where PNG Power does not make any profit. That is not the only town there<br>
are many others who are regarded as sea center, which PNG Power continues to try its best<br>
to ensure that at least some power eventhough there&#x27;s no return on PNG Power<br>
investments.<br>
And for those of us who maybe thinking that the way out for PNG Power is to<br>
transfer ownership of those centers to them, I can tell this Parliament that the provincial<br>
governments will come running back to this government for funding because most of them<br>
are not making money. And PNG Power has been providing services because of<br>
community service obligations.<br>
And we have had difficult with reliability of power mainly from Puma who<br>
continues to bully us using its dominant position in this country. It is something that we all<br>
working together to make sure that we have secure and reliable power supplies. It&#x27;s an<br>
ongoing work in progress. I admitted there are problems, I will never deny it but this sort<br>
of things take time actually to resolve and manage.<br>
In relation to the issue of about 30 per cent of the power being stolen, yes, there<br>
have been some instances where our own employees of PNG Power have colluded with<br>
the outsiders to steal power. And on many occasions when they are having been discovered<br>
and found they have been terminated on the spot.<br>
It is a heavily unionist company compared to the others. The presence of union<br>
comprised of about 700 members employees of PNG Power, you wouldn&#x27;t believe it. So,<br>
you may have read recently that PNG Power had to go to court to obtain that restraining<br>
order to prevent the union from calling a strike and the National Court has granted that<br>
Order. We are using that as an opportunity to stabilize the operation of the company.<br>
As I said earlier in this Parliament by December this year, we should have some<br>
results which we all can be proud of. It is not a company where we&#x27;ve ignored, we&#x27;ve<br>
invested a lot of time, we have worked on the many issues, there&#x27;s a lot of literature on this<br>
company telling us what to do.<br>
Very soon with the approval of the Prime Minister, there is a rescue package that<br>
has been proposed to Cabinet. Cabinet should be able to approve it. Thank the good<br>
Governor for asking those questions.<br>
<br>
Page 14:<br>
08/02<br>
I am not sure if I am answering all the questions but in general, my answer to his<br>
question is yes, it is a problem Company but we are not sitting back and allowing it to go<br>
down further, instead we are doing everything we can to rescue it and turn it around. In<br>
areas where there are key centers that are having issues, we have asked Australians to help<br>
us by paying for the cost of solar power. Recently, in Dam, PNGSDP and PNG Power<br>
came to an arrangement where our people in Dam can be able to enjoy reliable power<br>
through solar power. We are also looking at supplying power to Wewak through the<br>
installation of a solar power system but the challenge for us now is to identify suitable<br>
State-owned land which we can then use to restore the much-needed solar power. The solar<br>
power system will then be able to complement the energy that is provided by the diesel<br>
generators.<br>
Lastly, Mr Acting Speaker, yes, PNG Power had an arrangement with a company,<br>
I should not mention its name because it&#x27;s a company which had a dominant position in<br>
providing diesel-powered gensets to PNG Power. We have recognized that they were<br>
overcharging, there was collusion between employees and that company and we have<br>
slowly phased them away, so as soon as we have our own money we will then be able to<br>
buy our own generators.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I have assured the good Governor and the people of Papua New<br>
Guinea that this government is doing everything to make sure this company comes back to<br>

Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Promote Police Officers<br>
Mr GABRIEL KAPRIS - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are<br>
directed to the Minister for Internal Security and I would like the Prime Minister to take<br>
note.<br>
As we all know Law and Order is a priority one to address and my short questions<br>
are in regard to the Police command and control structure that is being implemented by .the<br>
Department of Police throughout the country.<br>
In East Sepik, we have a problem with the command structure. The Police<br>
personnel that run the district have to be qualified officers at the Inspector or Senior<br>
Inspector ranks to be able to conduct police work in the respective districts. Maprik District<br>
11<br>
<br>
Page 15:<br>
has been without a senior police inspector for some good years and it is now affecting the<br>
law and order situation.<br>
We have regular hold-ups along the Sepik Highway right through to Nuku/Lumi<br>
and we have had a number of deaths but the Police personnel are not able to address the<br>
situation because they have an issue with the command control. A junior officer cannot<br>
give commands to the other officers because they are in the same rank and this has been<br>
affecting the performance of the Police personnel in my province.<br>
(1) Can the Minister look at promoting the officers who are qualified and are able<br>
to be promoted to Senior Inspector?<br>
I want you to give special attention to Maprik as it has been without a Senior<br>
inspector for a long time.<br>
(2) Can the Minister look at other Police Personnel who have logged their<br>
applications to the Head Office, Human Resource Department, to be considered and<br>
appointments be made?<br>
09/02<br>
That is my question, Mr Acting Speaker, if the Minister can respond accordingly. I<br>
will need answers and get a senior inspector to Maprik as soon as possible. Thank you.<br>
Mr PETER TSIAMALILI - Thank you Mr Acting Speaker. I also thank the<br>
member for Maprik for his valid questions. I think I will again re-emphasize on our Police<br>
Force that we are manpower stretched. At the same time I heard your question in<br>
particularly to the instance where you have witnessed an officer who is not performing<br>
his/her duties in terms of command and control. That is something at the operational level.<br>
The COP and our good Deputy Commissioner for operations including our ACPs in the<br>
provinces are strongly looking at and are reviewing. It is not just in Maprik, I think it is all<br>
across our country.<br>
In our recent discussions with our good governors there were some discussion about<br>
how we can empower the provinces a lot more which will empower the districts too. We<br>
are looking at some reforms that I would like to implement this year 2023 to address those<br>
gaps. Coming back to your situation in Maprik, my good Member, I will ask the Cop<br>
Commissioner to look into it. As it is, it is an operational matter where I can go directly to<br>
you and see how we can help you to better manage your law and order space.<br>
12<br>
<br>
Page 16:<br>
I guess that is across all of us. Again, I will re-emphasize, the PPCs were<br>
specifically asked to have a dialogue or consultation with each district to develop plans.<br>
Those are some of the areas that you will have to highlight within your plans on the<br>
challenges that you are facing so it is reflected in your plan. I will emphasize again, that<br>
your plan is very important and in your plan you will highlight those challenges. The<br>
Member for Maprik I take heed of your question so I can talk directly with you to find<br>
solution for the situation that you are facing. Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
National Development Bank<br>
Mr SAM BASIL JNR- Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. My questions are directed<br>
to the Minister for State-owned Enterprises. We have the SME credit scheme of K200<br>
million that stated in 2019 till today. My people of Bulolo district are more dependent on<br>
alluvial gold operations, agriculture and PMV s.<br>
(1) Can the good Minister advise us whether the National Development Bank<br>
(NDB) has allocated funds for lending to each district or province?<br>
(2) My district has no NDB office, therefore, can they open a branch that can serve<br>
Menyamya, Wauwaria and Kaintiba also Marawaka and part of the Huon Gulf?<br>
(3) Are the people ofBulolo and others throughout the country eligible for the NDB<br>
SME loans as we are not seeing it on the ground?<br>
(4) Could NDB have specific loan tailored to alluvial mine under the SME Credit<br>
Scheme?<br>
Mr WILLIAM DUMA - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I would like to thank<br>
the very good Member for Bulolo for this very important questions.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the Marape Government had recognized the importance of<br>
SMEs in the economic development of our country and it quite rightly and correctly<br>
allocated K200 million in its budget two years ago.<br>
10/02<br>
Of that K200 million, Kl 00 million was allocated to Bank of South Pacific to<br>
provide as a guarantee to encourage that bank to go down the path of helping us and to<br>
provide loans to SMEs as well as other Papua New Guinea-owned businesses. And from<br>
that balance of K 100 million, K20 million was allocated to the Department of Commerce<br>
13<br>
<br>
Page 17:<br>
where on a number of occasions during those times at least Kl million was given to most<br>
of the electorates, who requested for to help them with their SME programs.<br>
The balance ofK80 million was allocated to the NDB and then NDB came out and<br>
quite clearly in the media shared out the guidelines for our people to follow when applying<br>
for loans.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we must all understand that when the bank says it will lend<br>
money to the people, the people on their part also have to meet the requirements, nothing<br>
is free in life. And the Government had honourable intentions and allocated K80 million<br>
strategically for SMEs including our people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.<br>
There was a special allocation for those operating SMEs in that part of our country and as<br>
long as our people are able to follow the guidelines, they can be able to access those funds.<br>
I&#x27;m advised by the CEO ofNDB that the K80million was allocated right throughout<br>
the country and that they&#x27;ve run out of those funds and now it is up to us in this government<br>
and this parliament to ensure that we then in the next budget allocate more money for our<br>
people. It is not only the function of myself as minister, or the prime minister to allocate<br>
money. This is something we all have to work together and ensure that we allocate enough<br>
money for our people.<br>
In response to the question of whether money can be allocated for alluvial mining,<br>
the idea of existing SMEs is to ensure that money is allocated to all our Papua New<br>
Guineans who involve in all sectors of business including alluvial mining and there is<br>
nothing stopping our landowners from trying to have access to be used for alluvial mining.<br>
So, when there are funds that are available, we can all encourage them to apply for and<br>
ensure that our people get help in terms of loans. So, there is no specific provision for<br>
alluvial mining business people to be allocated money but the money is meant for our<br>
people who are involved in the general SMEs.<br>
So, I understand also Mr Acting Speaker, that the NDB has some internal funds<br>
from its savings which is now allocated to continue to help fund our people so I am sure<br>
there is money there. It is a matter of our people making sure that they approach the bank<br>
representatives. Unfortunately, NDB will not be present in every centre of this country. It<br>
is present in more specific areas. Our people must make the effort to travel there themselves<br>
and apply for the loan and of they qualify for the loan, there should be nothing stopping<br>
them from benefitting from those funds. Mr Acting Speaker, thank you.<br>

Status of the Economy<br>
Mr PETER O&#x27;NEILL-Thank you Mr Acting Speaker, and thank you for giving<br>
me this opportunity to ask a few questions to our good treasurer, the Honourable Ian Ling<br>
Stuckey, on a few things about the economy.<br>
In recent times, Mr Acting Speaker, the treasurer has announced that our economy<br>
is doing very well. He has projected that the economy will grow by 3.5 per cent this year<br>
when rest of the world is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I just want to ask the treasurer these questions:<br>
(1) Where is this growth coming from? Because the rest of the country and the<br>
economy is struggling to perform, businesses are shutting down, and most of our exports<br>
- coffee, cocoa, fisheries, forestry are all on the decline. So, what is driving the growth that<br>
you are saying that we are experiencing in this country?<br>
11/02<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I feel that, this is in my view, the growth is driven by LNG<br>
exports. When LNG exports are enjoying a very high global prices as a result it is seen as<br>
PNG economy is doing well, but I can assure that the economy is certainly not doing well.<br>
A lot of people are unemployed and of course that leads me to the second question.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, in recent times the Treasurer had announced that they have<br>
created over 10 thousand jobs over the last three years. Now, can the Treasurer inform this<br>
House and the country which sectors have delivered those 10 thousand jobs, whether they<br>
are in Fisheries or Forestry or Agriculture; please inform this Honourable House so that we<br>
can know where the growth is because suddenly on the ground, a lot of people are finding<br>
it hard to find new jobs.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I can assure you that people, especially our school leavers who<br>
are not properly skilled are facing a lifetime of unemployment and that means that in their<br>
life time they might never get a job. So, Mr Treasurer, can you please inform this<br>
Honourable House about where this job growth that we are going to experience.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the third question is about expenditure and the Treasurer has<br>
proudly stated over many locations that this government is making record spendings.<br>
Record spending in this year is projected to be about K24.5 billion, of course you are saying<br>
that the record spending will deliver the growth but, Mr Acting Speaker, those records<br>
spending is not helping struggling families. The household assistance package of Kl .1<br>
billion that the Treasurer had announced is not helping families to put food on the table. It<br>
15<br>
<br>
Page 19:<br>
is only assisting fuel prices to be subsidized for people who own cars and those who are<br>
able to afford to have those luxury items. It is certainly not putting food on the table for<br>
young Papua New Guinean families and many of them who are struggling to even have a<br>
job. So, Mr Acting Speaker, can the Treasurer tell us how this assistance program will<br>
assist our families throughout the country.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the other question that I want to ask is about inflation. The<br>
Treasurer proudly announces on many occasions that the inflation in our country is at 6.3<br>
per cent which is much lower than average long-term inflation of about 7 per cent. That&#x27;s<br>
what he&#x27;s announcing.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, but the real prises in the store goods is a very different story<br>
Mr Treasurer. In 2019, the price of bully beef was at Kl 1.90 and today it is about K20. So,<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I don&#x27;t know where the calculation of inflation is coming from and I<br>
know I&#x27;ve got confidence in our public servants at our National Statistical Office but the<br>
reality on the ground is different.<br>
How is the Treasurer developing this tragedy to address inflationary issues in the<br>
country? Why I ask this question is because, Mr Treasurer, for many Central Banks around<br>
the world to curb the raising of inflation around the world, the interest rates have been<br>
increased around many global economies which is trying to curb the inflation increases.<br>
Whereas in PNG, the strategy adopted by the Central Bank and Treasury is to have a steady<br>
and unchanged interest rate regime. Now, if you maintain an interest rates at that level,<br>
how are you going to curb inflation from continuing to grow? So, Mr Acting Speaker, that<br>
is my question on inflation and interest rates.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, my sixth question that I want to ask is; now the Treasurer has<br>
announced publicly that he has allowed International Monetary Fund to come in and<br>
introduce a program in PNG after 20 years. Now, reading through, we are going to borrow<br>
an additional K3 .25 billion over the next 3 years.<br>
12/02<br>
Now, before I ask questions in relation to the International Monetary Fund, the<br>
Treasurer in his statement has confirmed that last year in December, he borrowed Kl.8<br>
billion from the Australian Government. This year he will borrow another Kl .5 billion in<br>
addition to the K3 .25 billion that will be borrowed from IMF.<br>
With all these borrowing, Mr Acting Speaker, what will be our debt to GDP ratio?<br>
I think your estimates of 53 per cent for the year end will be surpassed thinking that it will<br>
16<br>
<br>
Page 20:<br>
go up close to 60 per cent. Mr Treasurer, if you can inform this honourable House the debt<br>
to GDP ratio that you are going to achieve as per your budget estimates of 2023.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, with the Treasurer borrowing from IMF; can he confirm that<br>
we are probably the third or fourth country in the world to ask IMF for help after Sri Lanka<br>
and Pakistan. Now K3.2 billion over the next three years comes with conditions and this is<br>
not an assistance to support a budget Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Can he confirm that this is a bail out because our economy is struggling to meet<br>
revenue targets you have set Mr Treasurer? Mr Treasurer can you confirm also that the<br>
conditions that IMF has put which is on the schedule that you have presented to this House<br>
Mr Acting Speaker. These conditions include; (1) is that they will make changes to the<br>
Central Bank Act.<br>
Can you confirm or deny that these changes will include what they call flexible<br>
foreign exchange policy?<br>
Does that mean that they will review the valuation ofkina and are going to devalue<br>
our kina?<br>
The second issue is that; they are saying that new tax measures from IMF and its<br>
on your attachment, Mr Acting Speaker. This House needs clarity and detail as to why you<br>
have an obligation to this honourable House and the country.<br>
What are the new tax measures that we are talking about? Are we going to put more<br>
burden on our people and are you going to increase salaries and wages tax? Are you going<br>
to increase company tax and what are the new measures?<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, why I asked all these questions is because they are also<br>
proposing that we need to restructure our public service machinery. And that&#x27;s the third<br>
condition that they are putting. How many more people are you going to terminate in the<br>
public service machinery so that you can have savings to fund your budget?<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, that is what they are trying to achieve. When you read what<br>
they have put to you then you will understand. They touched on staffing and remuneration<br>
guidelines, which they are referring to people who are struggling on the street to feed their<br>
families.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, these borrowings come with very serious conditions<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Member, I will interrupt your questions.<br>
Our question time has lapsed and you have raised many important questions already. Can<br>
you get straight to the question and let the Minister respond?<br>
17<br>
<br>
Page 21:<br>
Thank you.<br>
Mr PETER O&#x27;NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, I will finish shortly but all these<br>
questions are touching the economy and everybody&#x27;s life in this country. We are talking<br>
about eight to ten million people and how they are going to survive when all these economic<br>
conditions come.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, IMF is renowned around the world.<br>
Mr Don Po lye - Point of Order! I think for ordinary members of Parliament, to ask<br>
such detailed questions like this is another issue. But for someone who was the former<br>
Prime Minister of a Government before that created some of these problems, he should tell<br>
what programs did he put in place to address the same issues because we are trying to solve<br>
the problem that he created, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member your Point of Order is out of<br>
order. I have asked the member to ask his questions. I will allow him to summaries his<br>
questions.<br>
13/02<br>
Mr PETER O&#x27;NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, I know the good Member for Kandep<br>
loves to intervene and talk, but he should realize that the last time IMF was in this country,<br>
both of us were still in government. That was over 20 years ago and our people suffered<br>
from that. When the Somare Government was in power, we have never dealt with IMF<br>
because of these kind of conditions.<br>
We survived without IMF so learn to live within your means. What we are trying<br>
to tell you, is to provide us with proper details so that we can have a good debate about<br>
issues that are confronting our nation. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Point of Order! Mr Acting Speaker, I appreciate you<br>
managing questions on the Floor of Parliament. Members of Parliament, and especially<br>
senior members, must not use question time to make statements.<br>
18<br>
<br>
Page 22:<br>
The former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia wants to debate on the<br>
Treasurer&#x27;s statement from yesterday. I will be re-opening_t hi-sw ith a statement in-reply.<br>
That will be the opportunity for him to make his statement.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, please control members of Parliament who discuss and use<br>
question without notices as opportunity to make statements. I ask members that if you are<br>
men enough to ask questions, or point to a matter that is of national importance, be men<br>
enough to sit through and listen to all responses. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia, resume your<br>
seat and I will make a ruling on your question.<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable members, upon advice, the questions that<br>
the Honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia have asked, is before Parliament. And whatever<br>
statements that relates to a bill that is before Parliament, ministerial statements, would not<br>
be raised on question.<br>
Therefore, I made the ruling that the Minister will not respond to the questions<br>
asked by the Member for Ialibu-Pangia. The honourable Member&#x27;s questions can be<br>
reserved for when the debate on this Bill comes.<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Point of Order! Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I<br>
understand that the honourable Member had asked his questions within question time. I<br>
should be allowed to respond to it, even though, they are very convoluted.<br>
I would want to address this matter because it is of national importance and because<br>
he has misled this Parliament and the people of this country.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I need to correct him.<br>
(Members interjecting)<br>
19<br>
<br>
Page 23:<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Minister, upon advice on your point of order. I have<br>
already made a statement that the matter is before Parliament; No:27 and it will come on<br>
during this session.<br>
14/02<br>
Therefore, I can allow for you to explain on that, when the bill notice is called, I<br>
can give you time to respond to the question asked by the Member.<br>
Right now, I cannot allow you to answer because according to the Standing Orders,<br>
we cannot debate on that or respond to a question on that. So, when the bill is called, I will<br>
allow for you to make your statement in response to the question.<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - So to clarify, you would like me to correct his very<br>
wrongful assertions that he raised this morning during the response to my statement.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honorable Minister, please resume your seat as I have<br>
already made my ruling and I will give you time when this matter is called before<br>
Parliament.<br>
PERSONAL EXPLANATION<br>
Mr GARRY JUFFA (Northern) - I seek leave of Parliament to make a personal<br>
explanation.<br>
Leave granted.<br>
Mr GARRY JUFF A - The issues that I wish to make an explanation about are in<br>
relation to news items that were run in The National newspaper on Friday 10th March 2023.<br>
These are misleading news items; false reports and I wish to make some clarifications in<br>
relation to these. Whilst we all appreciate the media and the very important work that they<br>
do. The hard work that many of our good journalists perform, they have a responsibility to<br>
report the truth because they are in a very serious position of power whereby they manage<br>
information and thus influence perception.<br>
20<br>
<br>
Page 24:<br>
This is not only in Papua New Guinea but in the region and worldwide because we<br>
are now part of the global community and all the information and news items are reported<br>
are carried far and wide throughout this world. On March 10, 2023, The National<br>
newspaper ran a front-page news item that read &#x27;School Girls abducted&#x27; in a very highly<br>
sensational manner and it reported that four girls attending the Popondetta Secondary<br>
School were abducted at the St Franciscan Anglican Brothers&#x27; retreat at the CTC ward in<br>
Northern, Police say. That what it stated. The fact of the matter is and after investigations<br>
by my office, the administration and the police, we found that no such incident had<br>
occurred. No girls were abducted, there however was a very minor incident where students<br>
who were at the retreat were accosted by one man and he was chased away by the staff at<br>
the church.<br>
Yet, The National, a foreign-owned newspaper just like the other daily decided to<br>
run this report without carrying out its work with due diligence. For us in the province it is<br>
quite disturbing and something that we would like the newspaper to correct appropriately.<br>
The other item also a false report which they reported is the item in relation to my election<br>
petition.<br>
In that particular item the headline read; &#x27;Governor to stand trial&#x27; and then it<br>
reported that the Northern Governor Garry Juffa will stand trial on three counts of bribery<br>
allegations against him and the election petition filed by his contender Jean Parkop.<br>
15/02<br>
The fact of the matter is; this is a petition that is going to trial. I am not going on<br>
trial. I am not accused of bribery and in fact three persons have been named in this petition<br>
or alleged to have committed bribery, I&#x27;m not one of those three persons. This newspaper<br>
decided to report this fake news. It is now reported not only in Papua New Guinea but in<br>
the region and in the world. And all of this is also reported online using the internet in<br>
breach of our cybercrime laws.<br>
The third fake report or false report is a letter to the editor. This is something that I<br>
would like us to seriously consider, letters to the editor contain opinions of people,<br>
sometimes making serious allegations that are not facts but are printed by the newspapers<br>
as if they are factual. And I thought it&#x27;s important that I make this clarification here,<br>
especially for the print media because they have done this on a number of occasions.<br>
In fact, just yesterday, they ran a front page story in relation to a statement that the<br>
Treasurer made and he answered the question at a high level and from his perspective as<br>
21<br>
<br>
Page 25:<br>
the Treasurer. He&#x27;s not mandated to table specific programs on behalf of other ministerial<br>
port folios that since taking office three and half years ago. This government has increased<br>
the capital budget from K4.6 billion to K9.7 billion doubling funds for critical and national<br>
projects that directly create jobs.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I ask our media to make a conscious and concerted effort to be<br>
factual in your reporting. Report the facts. Don&#x27;t mislead our people. Don&#x27;t create negative<br>
perceptions based on lies, innuendos, rhetoric, without facts, without evidence. Thank you,<br>
Mr Acting Speaker.<br>

MINISTRY OF TREASURY - ECONOMIC UPDATE -<br>
MINISTERIAL STATEMENT-MOTION TO TAKE NOTE OF PAPER<br>
Resumption of debate (f rom 14 March 2023) - Leader of Government Business, in<br>
continuation).<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE (Tari-Pori - Prime Minister) - Thank you, Mr Acting<br>
Speaker. I just want to apologise to the Chair for interrupting a process during Question<br>
22<br>
<br>
Page 26:<br>
time. I just felt that Parliament must maintain decorum. Question time must be short, sharp<br>
precise and to the point. Matters that relate to debate be refrained from to the best of our<br>
ability and be discussed in debate and the matters that the Member for lalibu-Pangia raised<br>
are very important and are in response to our economy and in response to a statement that<br>
our Treasurer made yesterday on the status of our economy on job creation and everything<br>
that relates to the health of our country&#x27;s economy. Therefore, it is prudent that we bring<br>
this matter up for debate in the next few minutes so that the country fully appreciates.<br>
Sometimes in a world of misinformation, especially fuelled by politics, the ugly<br>
head of politics does appear in our society, in social media, in commentaries in the media<br>
proper but correct information is important to assist our people, our country, our economy<br>
to be encouraged that we are moving at a right place.<br>
16/01<br>
The Treasurer must be commended. Anybody can run an economy in good times.<br>
Our Treasurer must be commended because he steered our country&#x27;s economy in four hard<br>
years - period; on record. I mentioned four hard years, Mr Acting Speaker because when<br>
we took Government in 2019, the economic fundamentals were so weak, it was eroded.<br>
The former Prime Minister knows very well the economic conditions passed over<br>
to my Government. I was his Finance Minister. The reason why I resigned was because of<br>
his appetite for unhealthy and unsustainable debt. He is least qualified to talk about<br>
managing the economy and I just give you one pointer, I reminded him already on this<br>
Floor of Parliament. What was the rational of going to a Credit Suisse commercial bank<br>
and borrowing with a two-year repayment rate at 8.8 per cent in 2018? When you talk about<br>
the economy&#x27;s liquidity drying up. In 2018, there was a clearest evidence that we were at<br>
the precipice, we were falling into an economic abyss that we could not step out from.<br>
So Mr Acting Speaker, when we talk, we talk with context to allow the economy to<br>
regrow and the Treasurer is in the jump seat at the moment. Let&#x27;s give him full support to<br>
ensure that he runs the economy to bring our country to a balanced budget at the very<br>
earliest. We anticipate by 2027 and a 13-year road map to bring our country out of the<br>
bondage of debt that we have carried for so long. These debts precede O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s<br>
Government&#x27;, and precedes Somare&#x27;s Government. These are part of our national debt<br>
profile that we&#x27;ve been carrying since 1975 when we started off, when our economy was a<br>
Kl billion economy.<br>
23<br>
<br>
Page 27:<br>
And I just want to encourage this House, our National Parliament and our country.<br>
We are trying our absolute best in these tough times. You only have to look at the statistics<br>
of our budget delivery. Our budget delivery is not all debt-driven budget. Our budget<br>
delivery; a substantial majority of it is funded by our internal revenue. On record IRC is<br>
collecting much better today than they have ever collected in the past. In fact, at a much<br>
higher level&#x27;<br>
Last year, IRC collected around K13 billion and that&#x27;s a record. On average, before<br>
IRC was collecting below Kl0 billion. Customs likewise is collecting above K3 billion.<br>
On record, Customs has never collected above K3 billion. These are collected in tough<br>
times. Increasing efficiency by appointing good people, we are starting to see better<br>
performance in our internal revenue sector and IRC is doing very well, Customs is doing<br>
very well. We are not only assisted by the high oil price. We are assisted by the increased<br>
efficiency within and our budget support that is carrying the economy.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker there are some good news, we&#x27;ve seen an increase in export<br>
from agriculture, starting 2021.<br>
Mr Speaker, I returned from East New Britain over the weekend. In East New<br>
Britain, away from oil and gas dependency, away from mining dependency is an economy<br>
that has been running on agriculture and forestry - especially sustainable forestry.<br>
Look at the 500 people now employed in a new veneer plant that we commissioned<br>
in 2021. Two years, on we have 500 new people employed in remote Lassul LLG in the<br>
Baining part of the Gazelle Electorate. So these are evidential work happening in tough<br>
times going forward.<br>
17/02<br>
The last four years, Mr Acting Speaker, when our Government we arrived in 2019,<br>
we inherited weak economic fundamentals, then in 2020, Covid-19 arrived in PNG and<br>
induced a global economic shutdown. The effect carried on into 2021 and yet we had the<br>
General Election coming up in 2022. We had to be expansionary but within responsible<br>
budget approach.<br>
The Treasurer has a clear road map before us. The result of the road map assisted<br>
with very cheap concessional US dollar denominated borrowing where we were able to<br>
retire 2019 at the K18.956 billion expenditures We retired 2020 at the K19.398 financial<br>
expenditures. We retired 2021 at the K20.131 billion financial expenditures. We retired<br>
2022 at the K23.374 money expenditure.<br>
24<br>
<br>
Page 28:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the sum of all these is over K81 billion being spent in our<br>
economy in the last three going four years. You ask me what is the result of these spending,<br>
well our public servants are paid on time like never before. I speak as former Finance<br>
Minister there were days when public servants were paid behind because Waigani public<br>
accounts had no liquidity. And the former Prime Minister knows that how he runs through<br>
his friends at Central Bank asking for treasury bill and inscribe stock to be printed.<br>
We deliberately choose to move a way from treasury bill and inscribe stock going<br>
to cheaper US dollar denominated borrowings that had zero per cent at long-term five-year<br>
grace period. This is the Treasurer&#x27;s track record in the last five years. Collecting debt<br>
financing as well as internal revenue raise financing on time delivering an K81 billion in<br>
the last three or four years of expenditures in our country.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the net result is this, our economy grew from K79.6 billion<br>
when we took over from 2018 to a Kl 13 billion as listed by World Bank and IMF.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, you ask me how does the macro statistic deal with everyday<br>
person? Our disbursement through our districts and provinces over the last four years, we<br>
have given K4.4 billion to our districts and provinces. If nothing is happening on the<br>
ground, members of Parliament, those who came in today, you ask the former members of<br>
Parliament. Our people out there, if nothing is happening on the ground, go to Ombudsman,<br>
Finance Department, Reporting Department in DIRD.<br>
But as far as National Government is concern and for instance, speaking from Tari<br>
perspective, my district received K15 million each for the last three years. I have five<br>
contractors running work in my district. These contractors employ 200 up to 500 persons<br>
each at any time depending on the scope of work.<br>
So Mr Acting Speaker, when someone asks me, &#x27;how many jobs have you created?<br>
The DSIP, PSIP program directly or indirectly has put over 10,000 people in employment,<br>
not just in Port Moresby where foreign workers were pushing wheelbarrow like it was in<br>
the last eight years, but in all parts of our country including the Oppositions&#x27; district. We<br>
were fair enough to give money to them.<br>
You ask all members of Parliament, they have employed through their district and<br>
provinces. Employment programs that are running through the contractors, especially local<br>
contractors who are beneficiaries to government disbursements. Their worked has been out<br>
there through the DSIP, PSIP program nation wide with the 100 per cent foot print, we<br>
have created over 10,000 jobs directly or indirectly.<br>
25<br>
<br>
Page 29:<br>
I come to bills at the Works Department, we have today over 274 road contractors<br>
running through consistent funding including retiring over K2 billion worth of contract the<br>
O&#x27;Neill Government gave never funded on record. Ask the Works Secretary, he will<br>
confirm this. In fact, he came out to media already. We&#x27;ve delivered and retired outstanding<br>
contracts valued over K2 billion, and including today, over K4 billion worth of contract<br>
that is running.<br>
18/02<br>
All these 274 Contractors are employing Papua New Guineans because our<br>
government chooses to engage more local contractors - SME type of contractors, than the<br>
previous government which was very friendly to contractors from outside coming in to<br>
work in our country.<br>
Contracts at the Department of Works and other State issued contracts have created<br>
over 10,000 jobs as a medium-term or immediate-term stop-gap approach to keeping our<br>
people engaged and employed so our economy is lubricated with kinas going to their pay<br>
packets and our people engaged in our economy.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, not only this, but for the first time, our generation of leaders<br>
on this side have invested money into SME Programs. On record, since 2020, this is the<br>
first leadership team that has invested money into SME Programs. You can go to BSP or<br>
NDB and they will give you indications that these SMEs are borrowing cheap concession<br>
funds at six per cent to ensure that they have start-ups and their business is supported. So,<br>
the SME funds, we are providing and these businesses will be directly or indirectly creating<br>
employment out there in the market to advance the cause of SME, especially our focus on<br>
agriculture and downstream processing in our country. We put money to support freight<br>
subsidy, we have put money for price support and to add to this area of focus. we have put<br>
money this year for state equity and additional land acquisition to support businesses in our<br>
country.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, our government knowing very well where we are led by the<br>
Treasurer, has made clear investment choices to diversify away from total reliance and<br>
mining and move into other aspects of our economy which we feel can have a greater<br>
catchment of our people and bring the majority of our people into economic involvement<br>
not just for today but more importantly for our future.<br>
Our focus on downstream processing remains our number one area. You may not<br>
know it yet, Members of Parliament and the Member for Ialibu-Pangia, but things are<br>
26<br>
<br>
Page 30:<br>
turning around. I point to you all to my trip to Lasull, who would have given them a fair<br>
chance, aren&#x27;t they not Papua New Guineans? The Bainings, are locked out there in the<br>
bush forever.<br>
The Honorable Jelta Wong and I arrived in 2021, and today 500 Bainings are<br>
employed for the first time and this is the story that I would like to tell.<br>
I would like to commend all the Governors and Members of Parliament who are<br>
working with us to advocate and move quickly into downstream forestry, downstream<br>
agriculture, and downstream fisheries.<br>
We have invested in a program for the resuscitation of PMIZ to ensure that the<br>
fisheries sector also is lifted up and processing fish catchments in our country. This has<br>
been our focus and we will not deviate from it because this focus will create tens and<br>
thousands of jobs directly and the spin-off beneficiaries indirectly going forward.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the Treasurer is at work. I would just want to conclude by<br>
pointing to a few commentaries lately. Business Advantage is a book that&#x27;s published not<br>
by the Marape Government but by our business community. In their recent publication,<br>
they made a few interesting observations and I would like every leader here to get a copy<br>
of these observations. They did indicate the challenges of operating businesses in our<br>
country and I do admit to the challenges. We will work with the manufacturing council,<br>
and the business council to ensure these challenges are addressed. The hardest challenge<br>
was the Forex access. Forex access was still a problem in 2018 going back to 2016.<br>
19/02<br>
When the economy should have been traveling to good times when LNG returns<br>
was to have hit the economy and made big impact yet we choose to be hostile to our people<br>
by very unworthy investments in years 2014 to 2015, that we were in government.<br>
Today the business community places Forex as the number one challenge and we<br>
have worked to retire this challenge. The Central Bank is now putting 100 million dollars<br>
to the market every month to ensure the business community have access to Forex.<br>
This was a far cry from what was a 30 million dollars threshold that Central Bank<br>
had previously. Our Treasurer has brought a reform to ensure Central Bank is liberated<br>
without compromising the independence, prudence and the fiduciary in their responsibility.<br>
The Central Bank today reports to a board not just the Central Bank Governor doing<br>
things with a Prime Minister at Paddys or Bacchus Bar.<br>
27<br>
<br>
Page 31:<br>
(Laughter in the Chamber)<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE -That was the past, I got to admit because I was on the<br>
side witnessing these conversations.<br>
(Laughter in the Chamber)<br>
Mr Peter O&#x27;Neill - Point of Order! For our Prime Minister to try and put in<br>
question the integrity of Papua New Guinean professionals, these are career bankers you<br>
know. So, you should be proud of their achievements rather than coming here mocking<br>
them because you have a privilege. There are Papua New Guinean&#x27;s struggling out there<br>
and they need a serious answer, clear policies and programs from you. Why can&#x27;t you man<br>
up and do it after four years.<br>
This is a matter that is of number one concern in this country, unemployment, Fo rex<br>
and so forth. I am just replying to him and he is the Prime Minister of our country and he<br>
has to be serious about what he is doing.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Member, you are trying to debate which<br>
I can allow you time during the Grievances Debate. But for now, please allow the Prime<br>
Minister to complete presenting his statement.<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE -Mr Acting Speaker, point spoken, taken and responded.<br>
But, let me say this in the Business Advantage, &#x27;l 00 CEOs Response&#x27;, they have made<br>
some interesting findings.<br>
Firstly, the Forex issue which the government has responded and today we have a<br>
100 million dollars on the market every month.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, it has never been a Forex issue. I stand here today to be<br>
corrected on the records of past Treasurer, past Central Bank records and past government<br>
records. The average of Forex reserve under Mr O&#x27;Neill has always been at K6 to K7<br>
billion in Forex. The average of late Grand Chief Sir Michael Thomas Somare was around<br>
K8 to K9 billion when National Alliance was in office.<br>
Today in three hard years, we have now gone past the K14 billion threshold and we<br>
have eleven months of cover. It has never been a fiscal policy issue but has always been<br>
monetary policy and the way Central Bank was operating. We have unbundled this and it<br>
28<br>
<br>
Page 32:<br>
has taken some efforts but we have unbundled this carefully so that the market has Forex<br>
that they require.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, to the business community, we are mindful of what you need<br>
to do. And I want to encourage all our business community to assist us by partnering with<br>
us, by working in the downstream processing focus. We will come to you all agriculture,<br>
forestry and fisheries companies in our country.<br>
First preference and priority, we will come to you all who operate and do business<br>
in our country before we go elsewhere. Partners in the downstream processing space area<br>
is core signature policy that differentiates between me, Mr O&#x27;Neill and others of the past.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we can no longer depend on the hype, boom and bust cycle of<br>
the oil and gas and mining project.<br>
20/02<br>
We must move seriously into down streaming of our resources, the reason why<br>
Minister Marn and the other ministers in the agriculture sector are working into that space.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, these areas will create more sustainable job for us. I want to<br>
encourage the business community that have spoken, that we are listening to you. Partner<br>
with us in this space as we work together for the long term sustenance of our country.<br>
I want to quote from a Westpac senior economist.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER- Honourable Prime Minister, I will interrupt you. Your<br>
20 minutes of debate has lapsed. I will allow you two more minutes to sum up.<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I want to quote from a<br>
senior Westpac economist in the same report. It says; &quot;profit, investment and recruitment<br>
expectations have improved with recruitment sediment at a record high.&quot; This is from<br>
Westpac, not from James Marape, high as 84.6 per cent from 56.8 per cent in 2022.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we are not imbeciles running this country. We have learnt from<br>
the past mistakes. We are diversifying our economy and are empowering all parts of our<br>
country. We are working and the Papua LNG feed was signed.<br>
Within next year, FID will be announced and 10,000 jobs will be created, but we<br>
want to bring this 10,000 jobs into our country. That is why Kumul Petroleum and the<br>
Education Department is working with Total, to train more Papua New Guineans to work<br>
in that space.<br>
29<br>
<br>
Page 33:<br>
We have sequenced P&#x27;nyang LNG back to back from Papua. Porgera have already<br>
employed 1,000 people in preparation of the reopening of the mine. When it is re-opened,<br>
3,000 workers will be employed, but in better terms for our country and not the terms that<br>
we were living with for the past 10 years.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, big projects will be running but our government remains focus<br>
in the downstream of our renewable resources. Don&#x27;t listen to negative naysayers in the<br>
media and in the Opposition, especially, the former past.<br>
I will take good advice from the Opposition Leader, who has no input to our<br>
country, thus far from government, he is a credible critic in the Opposition. But I will not<br>
take advice from a former Prime Minister, who has had the opportunity to construct this<br>
country, but ran this country for himself. Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr PETER O&#x27;NEILL (Ialibu-Pangia) - Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker, for<br>
giving me this opportunity to rebut some of the misleading statements coming from a<br>
sitting Prime Minister.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I said what I had to say about the statement from the Treasurer.<br>
There are few misleading points that the good Prime Minister has raised. When we were<br>
in government, we had debts. With those debts, I built the infrastructure in the country. We<br>
left it with K28 billion worth of debt in the country. Today it is K53 billion.<br>
Mr JAMES MARAPE - Point of Order! Please, do not keep on misleading the<br>
Parliament. It is not K28 billion, it is a K39 billion debt you left behind. IMF and Central<br>
Bank have confirmed this. All that have been borrowed publicly and all that is hidden in<br>
the state-own enterprises, and every other debt we are carrying were put to the table. We<br>
inherited and were sitting at a K39 billion debt, which was already above 35 per cent debt<br>
to GDP threshold, that Fiscal Responsibility Act allowed for.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - Honourable Prime Minister, thank you for your point<br>
of order. I will ask the honourable Member for Ialibu-Pangia to continue with his debate.<br>
Mr PETER O&#x27;NEILL - Mr Acting Speaker, when the honourable Prime Minister<br>
was speaking, we did not interrupt him, despite all the facts he was presenting was wrong.<br>
All he has to do is to look at his own annual budget outcomes that he tabled on this<br>
30<br>
<br>
Page 34:<br>
Parliament, to see the figures I am calling. That is the only document that we can depend<br>
on, and that is the government&#x27;s official position.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, today we have K53 billion worth of debt but the only<br>
construction of things happening, is the so called Connect-PNG. We will see the outcome<br>
of it very soon in regards to who is getting the contract, who is doing the work and who is<br>
not doing the work, and who is getting paid.<br>
21/02<br>
Those things are now being asked by the same people that you have brought into<br>
the country, the IMF. They are asking about the procurement processes and the names of<br>
people who have got contracts, so it will be very interesting and we look forward to seeing<br>
them working with you over the next 12 months to give you all the conditions that they<br>
have listed and you have tabled on this Floor of Parliament to complied with.<br>
We are encouraged by some of the things that they are saying but you know that<br>
getting K3.25 billion bail from IMF is not easy. It is going to be a challenge. They are<br>
going to tighten the noose and we are going to struggle to survive this is what we are<br>
missing in this point. In may 2020 despite what the Prime Minister is saying, there is a club<br>
in Paris called Paris Club made out of the World&#x27;s most developed economies.<br>
There are no Africans, Chinese or many Asians but the world&#x27;s most developed<br>
economies. And they suspended all the repayments of loans for PNG in May 2020. The<br>
Treasurer needs to give some of the details on that to the House. Why did they suspend the<br>
repayments? It is only because when we are not able to repay the loan, they suspend it so<br>
they give us breathing space. When we have serious physical issues and these are all on<br>
the websites that you can google and find out for yourself.<br>
These are serious concerns and we can say that we have record spending and record<br>
revenue here but that is not reflecting on the state of the economy. This is what we are<br>
arguing about and this is what we are trying to get; the real picture of what is happening<br>
on the ground. People are struggling to go and find a job or even holding onto a job that<br>
they have. These are real situations when you have 10,000 going into some hotel here to<br>
look for a job.<br>
This is the reality that we are faced with and it is not about political point scoring<br>
exercise as we are not going to the polls so we have to please anyone. Be the government<br>
that is for the people, take on advice, criticisms and comments and assess why people are<br>
complaining. I think when you look say we are pay 6- 8 per cent interest rates that is only<br>
31<br>
<br>
Page 35:<br>
one loan that we got and that was the sovereign loan. and I admit that and we were advised<br>
by treasury that it was the path to follow.<br>
It is only US$600 equivalent to Kl .8 billion out of a K53 billion loan book that we<br>
have. And you can refer to one point and of course, we could have made better decisions<br>
but right now you are not getting free money. Do not come and talk about zero per cent<br>
interest rate here and mislead the Parliament. Look at IMF, they are lending at 2.4 per cent<br>
for 5-year grace period and 10-year loan repayment period. I do not know loan agreements<br>
about the Australian loans because you have not tabled the documents on them but we have<br>
checked them through the internet. And these are realities that you are not telling the nation<br>
and that we are in a serious crisis. And if you do not match the revenues that you have<br>
projected for this year, you will have a spending crisis, because your ability is just to<br>
continue spending because you have a K24 billion budget. It is time to rein in the spending<br>
and cut the non-priority areas. If we all have to make sacrifices, let us make them. The<br>
country needs us to stand up for our people.<br>
If we have to cut back on the things that we are doing and the excesses that we are<br>
having we must cut back. IMF is a very good example, their team coming here is an<br>
indication that not all is right and that is why we need to take heed of the advice that they<br>
are trying to bring in. when you are going to affect the public service machinery and the<br>
central bank operations, treasuries operations and introduce new tax and tax administration<br>
of this country; these are serious reforms.<br>
If they are asking you to do it, there are timeline to achieve before end of December<br>
2023. So, this is not something that we are going to sit here and play politics about. It is<br>
about the reality facing our country we are the only country apart from Pakistan and Sri<br>
Lanka in this program now. That&#x27;s not something we should be proud of, Mr Acting<br>
Speaker.<br>
22/02<br>
Yes, we&#x27;ve had tough times, we&#x27;ve had Governments come and go but we all must<br>
put our heads together and try and rescue ourselves from the position we are in because all<br>
is not well. So I know that we are trying to bring services to our rural communities and<br>
look after our own electorates but if the country is not stable and the economy is not<br>
performing well we will not deliver and that is a fact.<br>
So I urge the Members of Parliament, yes Prime Minister and I can carry on and<br>
talk about these things, but you know it has to be factual. The reality on the ground, what<br>
32<br>
<br>
Page 36:<br>
is happening to our people. this is not about politics, elections are finished. Accept what&#x27;s<br>
going wrong and put our country back on track, that&#x27;s all we are asking. Thank you Mr<br>
Acting Speaker<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY (Kavieng - Minister for Treasury) - Thank you Mr<br>
Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to continue to debate this morning. Thank you to<br>
the honorable member for some of his very convoluted and confusing questions this<br>
morning. So a lot has been said this morning and a lot of it has been assumptions, very<br>
wrongful ones Mr Acting Speaker and I will try my best to correct some of those and put<br>
into context what our Government is trying to do<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, when I try to go through some of the questions that was asked<br>
this morning, I would say the honorable member himself doesn&#x27;t know how many<br>
questions were asked because as he went on about asking the first three questions he started<br>
making some more comments, and he sort of got out of control and he got confused as to<br>
which ones of those were questions and which ones of those were lies. So let me try and<br>
correct some of those today ifl may.<br>
I am disappointed that some ofus in this House continue to talk down the economy<br>
and create doubt in the public&#x27;s mind in relation to the direction of our economy and the<br>
growth of our economy. We continue to hear statements like people are suffering, families<br>
are suffering, but you know no one provides any facts and the data that we have used in<br>
Government and have been for nearly half a century don&#x27;t support those. And I&#x27;ll give<br>
examples this morning<br>
In relation to the question, where is growth coming from? Mr Acting Speaker, in<br>
yesterday&#x27;s statement, I have answered all of these through the three, four or five questions<br>
that the honorable member has asked. If he spent some time reading my statement, spent<br>
more time going through some of my media releases. He&#x27;d realize that I have answered all<br>
of them and I would encourage him to spend more time reading my statements going<br>
through the Treasury website because not only will you be a better informed member of<br>
Parliament, I think you would be a better person as a result of it.<br>
So in relation to growth, Mr Acting Speaker, in yesterday&#x27;s statement. I mentioned<br>
that the growth forecast for this year was 3.5 per cent. It&#x27;s very clear, that&#x27;s from the World<br>
Bank, in fact the IMF I didn&#x27;t mention forecast growth at 3.7 per cent. Where does this<br>
come from? Because he keeps saying and insinuates that there is no growth and that could<br>
not be further from the truth.<br>
33<br>
<br>
Page 37:<br>
23/02<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, growth is calculated through monitoring nominal GDP. PNG<br>
economy is broken up into 19 sectors it starts at agriculture, forestry and fisheries number<br>
one oil and gas extraction, wholesale and retail trade, and I hope I can remember to respond<br>
to some of the comments that were made this morning in relation to a big biscuit company<br>
in Lae claiming that they were suffering. And it goes all the way down to the 19th sector<br>
called water supply and waste management.<br>
So if you have a look at that, Mr Acting Speaker, the way it&#x27;s monitored is they<br>
start off with the breakup of our GDP forecast. Last year was around about K107 billion<br>
and this year, as Prime Minister has mentioned so often, is forecast to be Kl 13 billion.<br>
These are just facts on how growth is estimated. So that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s coming from, Mr<br>
Acting Speaker.<br>
Going through some of the very unsubstantiated questions he asked, he talked about<br>
our record K24.5 billion Budget, well he got that right. We both agreed on that. And he&#x27;s<br>
asking how does this help families.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, if he bothered to listen yesterday he would have noticed in page<br>
6 of our statement and I would like to repeat this for his purpose and also respond to his<br>
comments to his former best buddy in governments gone passed, the Minister for Higher<br>
Education, to give more detail. Well, yesterday, I gave you 12 pages of detailed numbers<br>
and so on our record Budget and how does this help families, I did say yesterday that for<br>
the first time in PNG&#x27;s history our Government, the Marape Government developed a<br>
package to help address some of these cost of living pressures.<br>
If we all recall K587 million we pumped in and K590 million this year; a total of<br>
Kl .17 million that we&#x27;ve given to families. No other government including your own,<br>
honourable leader, has ever delivered such a household assistance package.<br>
So let&#x27;s stop saying that we&#x27;re not trying to help our families, the facts are clear. I<br>
also mentioned yesterday that the IRC had written to all employers early this year with new<br>
tax schedules that will apply from the 1st of January. The other assistance that we offer are<br>
that we are providing tax cuts, or the IRC are providing tax cuts of up to K63 per fortnight<br>
for all of those earning K20 000 or more.<br>
To further demonstrate that many more families are benefitting it was mentioned<br>
in both dailies earlier this year by Nasfund, who estimated that the household package will<br>
benefit over 98 000 of its members. So tens of thousands of our families are benefitting,<br>
34<br>
<br>
Page 38:<br>
Mr Acting Speaker. Tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands so let&#x27;s stop making<br>
unfounded allegations like so many families are suffering. Be a little more positive, be a<br>
bit more accurate, be truthful and talk about the families that are benefiting. And if that<br>
was not enough and you say it&#x27;s only benefiting those that earn K20 000 or more, it benefits<br>
those who live in our rural areas. From the beginning of this year 1st of January<br>
I also mentioned yesterday and gave a detailed report that we&#x27;re also covering the<br>
cost of school project fees for this year. So for example, a family no longer has to pay a<br>
project fee of K220 for each of their children attending secondary school.<br>
24/02<br>
So, this program helps ensure that our household assistance package gets out to<br>
those in the rural areas and those that need the help the most. So, that&#x27;s an example of the<br>
help that we are getting from this Budget and I would ask the honourable members to stop<br>
downplaying some of the positive things that we are doing and be more balanced with your<br>
response.<br>
He then asked another question this morning to members of Parliament that this<br>
year we are proposing to receive Kl .5 billion as part of our financing plan to deal without<br>
deficit. Well that figure is pretty right so, we agree on that figure. And then, he also<br>
mentioned the K3.25 million funding that we hope to get from the IMF in the next three<br>
years. He then asked a question, what is the debt to GDP ratio when we affect these<br>
particular loans.<br>
So, Mr Acting Speaker, I&#x27;m very happy to assure the honourable leader, members<br>
of this House and the people of our country that these financing plans that include the two<br>
loans that he mentioned comply without debt control laws. So, for example, to answer<br>
specifically his question on the debt to GDP which would apply over the next three years<br>
so that&#x27;s 2024, 2025 and 2026. Our debt to GDP focus for next year sits at 52.2 per cent,<br>
2025 projected 51. 3 per cent and 2026 dropping down to 49 .2 per cent.<br>
So clearly, Mr Acting Speaker, the way in which we undertake our financing plan<br>
including every single loan that we take complies with our Fiscal Responsibility Act, unlike<br>
during their time in government.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, when we took office in 2019, you will all recall, we had a<br>
raging debate on whether the Budgets by the then government were accurate or whether<br>
they were fake. The argument was resolved when finally, we asked and agreed to an<br>
independent umpire and who was that? There was the IMF and their ruling were conclusive<br>
35<br>
<br>
Page 39:<br>
and I suggest that might be the reason why a bit of bad blood started coming out with some<br>
of the attitudes that we had with the IMF.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, for example, to demonstrate how a government should not<br>
manage its Budget and to demonstrate how a government breaches its own law, let me just<br>
give you very quickly some facts.<br>
In the 2019 Budget, the previous government Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal<br>
Outlook numbers on revenue, they had forecast and announced so gloriously on this Floor,<br>
if I can remember sitting on the other side, that their revenue figures would be and were on<br>
target to be K14 billion. We totally disagreed, if you all recall and we suggested and<br>
claimed and stated it was K12.9 billion. So, then we asked IMF to intervene, they were in<br>
Papua New Guinea on a country visit and they assessed the revenue was actually K13<br>
billion. What does that mean? It means that the forecast by the government in relation to<br>
revenue was down to K987 million. There figures were out by about a billion kina.<br>
25/02<br>
Mr Acting Speaker on expenditure, the MYEAFO figures said that it was on target<br>
to reach Kl 6.3 billion. I stated clearly in that year that the figures should have been around<br>
Kl 7.5 billion. The IMF stepped in as the agreed umpire and said it was Kl 7.6 billion. What<br>
was this mean? The Government than expenditure figure was overspent by a record Kl .2<br>
billion.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we have an extraordinary situation where the government&#x27;s<br>
revenue was down by down by a billion kina and the expenditure was up by a billion kina,<br>
was that a mistake, or was it deliberate? How could you possibly make a mistake of Kl<br>
billion when you are putting together the National Budget?<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, it gets worse, the deficit they said would be K2.3 billion and I<br>
said as Shadow Treasurer it would be closer to K4.5 billion. Well, guess what? The IMF<br>
came in and said that the deficit was actually K4.6 billion, and the government then was<br>
out by K2.2 billion in their deficit.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, why I am sharing these significant figures with you is because,<br>
I will now get to the point because my friend likes to talk about debt to GDP so let&#x27;s just<br>
compare our records, the Marape-Rosso Government with the O&#x27;Neill Government.<br>
The O&#x27;Neill Government MYEAFO than from debt to GDP, they estimated it was<br>
sitting at 31.8 per cent, and if you recall our ceiling was 40 per cent so on paper as this<br>
Parliament was being told they were within our debt control ceiling. We said from the<br>
36<br>
<br>
Page 40:<br>
Opposition that it was actually in a serious breach at 41. 2 per cent and guess what? The<br>
IMF umpire said it was 41.3 per cent. So, the government then was in clear breach of our<br>
debt control laws.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, what do we do? The Marape-Rosso Government had to clean<br>
up that mess. We came in, restructured the budget, and were faced for the first time<br>
undertaking a budget cut which we elected to be Kl.132 billion which we were forced to<br>
make so that we could comply with the Debt Control Laws. Then we were criticized for<br>
making these Budget cuts and as a result, we had to make some loans and were criticized<br>
for it but we were paying off their loans. It is a difficult world, isn&#x27;t it?<br>
So, Mr Acting Speaker, just to demonstrate to you the difference between the<br>
Marape-Rosso and the other government on how we managed not just the economy but<br>
specific items like debt to GDP. I also noticed that there was a question asked whether<br>
embarking on a three-year IMF Program is a bailout.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I want to categorically deny that the Marape-Rosso<br>
Government is undertaking a three-year IMF-funded program because it&#x27;s a bailout. The<br>
former Prime Minister gave some examples of countries how not to copy when we are<br>
managing our economy and I agree with him but can I repeat again, I am starting to repeat<br>
a little bit more than I like.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, as has suggested the main reasons why countries embark on an<br>
IMF Program is because they are experiencing economic stress and economic duress,<br>
specifically they normally had a balance of payment problem but both circumstances do<br>
not apply to Papua New Guinea.<br>
26/02<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I say that because if you look at our balance of payments I<br>
shared with the Australian Government during our ministerial forum, our balance of<br>
payments at the end of 2021, the last available figure was set around K4 billion. Our current<br>
account balance of payment was around a record ofK19 billion.<br>
So, Mr Acting Speaker, I&#x27;m quoting his favourite institution, the Central Bank that<br>
he always likes quoting I&#x27;m using the same figures so we both agree there.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we do not engage with the IMF because this is a bailout. We<br>
engage with the IMF for two specific reasons and they are as follows:<br>
(1) We want to use a credible international partner to endorse our reform package<br>
and,<br>
37<br>
<br>
Page 41:<br>
(2) As we continue with our expans10nary policies for driving up our PNG<br>
economy, we need to borrow funds and he is the point of difference between the Marape<br>
Rosso Government and the previous governments. We focus all of our financing on cheap<br>
good concessional loans.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we have not and I hope we don&#x27;t go down the track of engaging<br>
with expensive commercial loans and to be able to access concessional loans, two things<br>
happen; not only do you pay lower interest like we have done this year, and I mentioned<br>
yesterday in my speech where we&#x27;ve reduced the cost of interest and this year we&#x27;re making<br>
a saving of Kl.3 billion. Why don&#x27;t some ofus talk about some of the positive things that<br>
his government is doing? Why do we continually talk down on our economy? Mr Acting<br>
Speaker, Kl.3 billion savings this year and where does that go? Probably to most of the<br>
DSIP and infrastructure development funds that Ialibu-Pangia will also benefit from.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - The honourable Minister, I remind you that your 20<br>
minutes&#x27; debate time has lapsed but for the importance of this debate I&#x27;ll give you another<br>
two minutes to sum up your debate. However, I&#x27;d like to inform you that when you are<br>
debating, you have to look at the Chair and debate, do not look at your colleague Members<br>
and debate.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Mr IAN LING-STUCKEY - Certainly, Mr Acting Speaker, your wish is my<br>
command. So, to finish off with the IMF, the second reason why we use and why we need<br>
to engage with the IMF is because all of the financing that we will require to continue<br>
increasing our development budget until we reach that very important target date of 2027<br>
to achieve a budget surplus and until we reach that very important date of 2034, where we<br>
will give the government of the day the option for zero sovereign debt.<br>
It is that all financing is contingent upon the IMF endorsing all of our programs<br>
going forward. So, when we talk about getting assistance from the Australian and Japanese<br>
Government, getting programs and assistance from the World Bank, the Asian<br>
Development Bank and other multilateral partners. There is a condition which they place<br>
and the IMF must endorse our 5-year fiscal framework.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, to conclude, we don&#x27;t go down this parth, then we are forced to<br>
go down the alternative that he took and that is, going for commercial loans not only would<br>
you pay more but you will be able to find less and you will not be able to grow the budget<br>
38<br>
<br>
Page 42:<br>
that Marape-Rosso Government has done in the three years that we&#x27;ve been in government.<br>
If you study carefully the 13-year plan, I&#x27;ll invite you for a free lunch at the Treasury and<br>
explain to you in detail the benefits of our 13-year plane.<br>
Thank you.<br>
Mr ACTING SPEAKER - I was about to interrupt you on your time but you<br>
finish.<br>
27/02<br>
Mr JOSEPH LELANG (Kandrian-Glouchester - Opposition Leader) - Thank<br>
you, Mr Acting Speaker. I was hoping that this important matter will be debated at a later<br>
time, but I am also happy that it has been brought forward.<br>
I want to add to this debate by discussing a few things that we have heard from the<br>
Treasurer about the downturn on the global economy with World Bank revising the growth<br>
downwards. Obviously, with the COVID-19 effects still being felt around the world, some<br>
economies have recovered while some are still yet too.<br>
As a nation, we are affected in so many ways. Now we are talking about a possible<br>
IMF standby arrangement and a structural adjustment program also from the world bank.<br>
I am thankful that during the Minister&#x27;s presentation, the paper has attached schedule<br>
outlining the quantitative and the qualitative performance criteria&#x27;s, including the structural<br>
benchmarks. My comments will be focused on that in this debate.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, from what has been presented, this is a loan that will be repaid<br>
in about five and half years and the maturity is ten years, meaning that the responsibility<br>
ofrepaying that loan will be left to the next government after the elections in 2027. I want<br>
to outline some of the measures that will be imposed on us.<br>
As I have said, this is like a carrot. If they give us the money, we will give them the<br>
carrot. It comes with a lot of conditionality&#x27;s, that have just been outlined. I want to also<br>
add that there are a lot of risks associated with this particular program.<br>
Firstly, the K3.25 billion loan will be disbursed over 38 months, a six-monthly<br>
dispersal. It addresses the fiscal, monetary and the external sector of our economy. The<br>
issue ofrisks arises when you look at the timing. We have a global economy that has been<br>
revised downward. We are still in the COVID-19 pandemic situation.<br>
I am hearing, seeing and reading from our domestic economy, that many of our<br>
sectors are struggling. For business houses, the issues of inflationary pressures are still out<br>
39<br>
<br>
Page 43:<br>
there. And so, when we look at the timing issue, is there a risk? The reason why I am saying<br>
this, and one of the things that is not shown in the quantitative performance criteria, is the<br>
growth.<br>
Usually, under IMF standby arrangements and programs, they list everything,<br>
including growth GDP. That is missing. I will rely on empirical evidences of other<br>
countries, that do undergo structural adjustment programs from the IMF. And, usually it<br>
starts with a contraction in the economy.<br>
As you will note from the quantitative schedule as well, the size of the budget deficit<br>
has been fixed. In fact, it has been reduced from this year&#x27;s estimated budget deficit of<br>
around 5. 9 per cent.<br>
28/02<br>
So, the size of the budget is going to be tightened up. Within that context obviously<br>
in other parts of the globe and when we study these things and initially when you start a<br>
project the size of the economy will contract. And I was just hoping that they would put<br>
that kind of quantitative indicators there so that we can see how the economy will be<br>
performing under an IMF program.<br>
That is something that is missing and I am pretty sure the officials have discussed<br>
that here and that is one of the risks. Another thing that is missing here is that you know<br>
there are various portions of our population within our society that are disadvantaged.<br>
When you have this kind of programs the government must build into a social intervention<br>
program. Whilst we are implementing this we must also target and protect our budget that<br>
flows towards assisting the portion of our population that are disadvantaged.<br>
If the Treasurer is talking about the household assistance program build that inside<br>
the measure. We must not build it outside as it might be cut off through deficit and this is<br>
the reason why I am trying to add in my debate is that those two elements are missing. And<br>
if we can have them on will be a good idea. The other issue is the one on exchange rates<br>
and I just want to caution, while I know that the fund has been very adamant that we need<br>
to remove our exchange rate and let the market clear the exchange rate value and obviously<br>
we all know that it will go down.<br>
My concern is that we have a huge debt in external loans and when we do that and<br>
I mean the Treasurer, the government and its officials need to study this very well. Is he<br>
going to lead us into default because we have almost US$6-7 billion in external debt alone?<br>
I am raising this concern because by looking at the quantitative performance criteria of the<br>
40<br>
<br>
Page 44:<br>
fund, you will notice that when the fund hits and by the end of this year the foreign reserves<br>
level will drop from the current US$3.26 billion to US$ 1.76 billion. That is one of the<br>
effects and it is part of the criteria. I am just thinking around it and that is risk.<br>
If we use the ratio of a kina to US 0.28 cents that is going to be around K5-6 billion<br>
in foreign reserves by the end of this year under the program and I am pretty sure that they<br>
will try to show up our connections through all those loans. I just want to add that as a risk,<br>
given that we are already affected. Many of the business houses are already affected by the<br>
foreign exchange issues that we are having.<br>
These are the risks that I want to highlight and some of the missing links that we<br>
need to look at. The last thing I want to say is that, I came across a gentleman which most<br>
of you may know; he was a former professor at UPNG back in the 60s. Professor Clunnis<br>
Ross; I think he was there with Professor Ross Gamer during those times. I met him during<br>
my studies during one of the IMF and World Bank negotiations and we were doing this<br>
mock negotiation and so he introduced himself and I had a chat with him and this is what<br>
he said, &#x27;PNG you shouldn&#x27;t be running to the IMF and the World Bank&#x27;.<br>
29/02<br>
There are only two countries in the world that is PNG and Botswana. You have so<br>
much minerals, gas, diamonds and resources and you are able to stabilize your economy<br>
with the Minerals Stabilization Fund in those days. And so he said this is a good thing, you<br>
can sort out your issues and show to the other countries that you can do it. So I thought that<br>
I can leave that as a parting message on my debate.<br>
Thank you Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
Mr DON POL YE (Kandep - Minister for Higher Education, Research, Science<br>
and Technology and Sports) - Mr Acting Speaker I would like to join in the debate, I&#x27;m<br>
not one very keen to gag on other leaders talking, I will have to listen to them. But always<br>
have this view that under three conditions we should stop any mislead is the varsity of facts<br>
presented to the Parliament and to the people when the facts are not correct and<br>
misconstrued. I think it&#x27;s a duty of all of us to say if the facts are not true; to establish the<br>
facts in black and white like the honourable Treasurer has done. So, the misinformation<br>
must be corrected and I think the Treasurer has adequately done that.<br>
If the Opposition, or any member on the Floor of Parliament and anybody who<br>
would like to rebut what the Government is doing. There must be an alternative policy, or<br>
41<br>
<br>
Page 45:<br>
in this case, if one was in Government before and for instance, we have two former Prime<br>
Ministers here. The Rt Honourable Sir Julius Chan, the former Prime Minister, one of the<br>
best we had and the Honourable member for Ialibu-Pangia, Mr Peter O&#x27;Neill. For such<br>
people of that category to speak, they must also tell what they did and what the present<br>
Government is doing against what they did. Therefore, what they did, did bring such<br>
positive results and return on investments they did and they can compare that with the<br>
current Government.<br>
In those circumstances the former Prime Minister fell very short to explain and<br>
justify his points and therefore if one was listening to the argument presented, you would<br>
be inclined with the 100 per cent surety to believe what the Treasurer had presented in<br>
support of what the Prime Minister had said rather than to listen to the opposing argument.<br>
The third category of argument should be the one who comes before to discuss the<br>
issue must come with clean hands and in law, it is the maximum principle of equity, I have<br>
clean hands. But I think in this case I find it very difficult to forget very fresh memories<br>
recently. What they had done; they had hurt this country so much and then speak as if they<br>
have clean hands<br>
Therefore, Mr Acting Speaker, I had to intervene and raise a point of order because<br>
I have vivid memories of the very issue that was raised. Let me mention just one or two<br>
before I support the Treasurer in his statement yesterday. On the statement presented, I<br>
would like to advise and guide all the members of Parliament that the facts here are perfect.<br>
In other words, the figures and status here are very true. You can search it, you can google<br>
it, you can ask the World Bank, IMF and other Sovereign nations of the facts about Papua<br>
New Guinea; you will find that it is true. For instance, PNG&#x27;s GDP growth is 3.5 per cent.<br>
The world will shrink down 1.7 per cent from the 3 .5 per cent growth. That is a fact. I will<br>
support.<br>
When we talk about employment, that was the advice that was given to some of us<br>
when we were the Prime Minister at that time; that is when we get the money we put<br>
elsewhere and not create employment. Buying shares in other countries could not provide<br>
employment. That would destroy employment.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, you look at Hansard in the Parliament, I was on the other side<br>
as leader of the Oppositions and I usually give that advise too.<br>
30/02<br>
42<br>
<br>
Page 46:<br>
Ifwe get such money, K3.l billion which is almost 90 per cent of the development<br>
Budget of Papua New Guinea at that time. In other words, you are getting the Development<br>
Budget of Papua New Guinea and putting it into a speculative market. If you did that, then<br>
you will be able to see in the next 10 to 20 years, unemployment, inflation, foreign reserves<br>
with challenges, cash flow situations. We will see all of this because Papua New Guinea<br>
is a growing economy, we need to strengthen it to a mature economy and people will never<br>
listened and now I hear the same people crying over spilt milk. They are saying, there&#x27;s 10<br>
000 people who are looking for jobs, and there are none created? You were in that position;<br>
you had a decision making power to do that.<br>
The other thing that we raised was, do not give jobs to foreigners. We give our<br>
people jobs in the construction industry. That was the call that was made genuinely and<br>
sincerely. Not just by a leader of the opposition or somebody who opposed policies of the<br>
former Prime Minister of his Government. But we said, don&#x27;t give jobs to overseas people.<br>
Now what has happened? Now overseas people are coming in. They have their own<br>
companies with their own interests and they kill our local interest.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, we must speak strategically and see what we have done; learn<br>
from the past and correct the future. Some of us we just talk without thinking about what<br>
we have done. Another thing is the debt level. Our debt levels were really high, and I<br>
always reminded him that our debt levels must never go up because we will destroy our<br>
economy<br>
I would like to hear a new member of parliament talk about this issue not the same<br>
members of parliament who has been here in Parliament for many years.<br>
Now the Marape/Rosso government has come in and is trying its best to clean up<br>
an issue that was created by people who never listened in the past. And now those who<br>
want to complain must have clean hands. I know that these a fair comment that I&#x27;m making<br>
so we understand for the future and we must speak the truth and the truth will set us free.<br>
On the issue of quantitative and qualitative performance criteria that I heard the<br>
good leader of the Opposition mentioned that we will implement such programs and<br>
therefore see this growth. You look at the performance of the Government, we already<br>
have a growth of 3.5 per cent as per hour and we are going on the right track. The IMF did<br>
not come and tell us how to grow it, we are already growing. But if there is an argument<br>
that we are not seeing it, then the responsibility lies on your MP&#x27;s, the public service and<br>
those that have the responsibility mandated to amend the programs of Government. The<br>
implementing issue is not the same as the policy issue. The Marape/Rosso government is<br>
43<br>
<br>
Page 47:<br>
giving the right policy perspective, statistics are correct and the leadership is in the right<br>
direction. Now the challenge has come to what the Treasurer was saying yesterday. He<br>
said that the Budget must be effectively implemented so this lies solely on the members of<br>
parliament, district administration, the provincial administration, the Governors, the<br>
District Secretaries and so forth. It&#x27;s now up to this House as to how implement the<br>
programs to the public service.<br>
Let me specifically talk about the areas I&#x27;m entrusted to look after in the area of<br>
Education. I am happy that the Budget provides Kl .65 billion for the Education sector. It&#x27;s<br>
good that we spend money in that area. Not to invest in some stock exchange or business.<br>
31/02<br>
It is good to put Kl .65 billion. That is, about 51 per cent increase to skilling our<br>
Papua New Guineans and that&#x27;s a very good thing. If you look at what the Prime Minister<br>
has said. In the next five years, we would like to see 30,000 non-school leavers have spaces<br>
in all the universities and technical institutions and that is where the money is. As a<br>
responsible minister, what I&#x27;m doing is, I am looking at ways to improve the skills of<br>
Papua New Guineans with employment, but the employability of Papua New Guineans is<br>
very important. If they have no skills, it is very difficult for them to get a job. Even though<br>
we have the population, we will still cry. We want employment but if we don&#x27;t train our<br>
Papua New Guineans to be employed in the gas industry; the mining sector; the agriculture<br>
sector; the construction industry and in all the other areas, then you&#x27;ll find that employment<br>
will be a problem because we have not produced skilled people.<br>
What are you doing with this policy? Are we creating and developing skills that<br>
are most relevant for Papua New Guineans so that they could have an employment?<br>
The infrastructure development that the Treasurer mentioned is a key area. If you<br>
look at all our institutions, universities and colleges, we are doing infrastructure<br>
rehabilitation for science labs, classrooms and dormitories. We have K200 million in<br>
partnership with ADB to implement the program and I am happily implementing it because<br>
we would like to see the quality of our institutions when quality graduates come out from<br>
these institutions. So, we are implementing the government&#x27;s policy. If we had the Kl .56<br>
billion in that sector, we should have implemented it already.<br>
Now, in support of what the Treasurer said yesterday on effective implementation<br>
of the budget, it is the public service. All of us have a duty to our districts, the DSIP we<br>
44<br>
<br>
Page 48:<br>
get is a lot of money. It is Kl O million as for the budget but it will be K20 million for this<br>
year and in the coming years.<br>
When we talk about employment or any economic growth, it actually lies with the<br>
individual MPs, the district administrators, finance managers and everybody on the<br>
ground. Like in Kandep District, I hold meetings with them to discuss how to convert that<br>
money into employability and economic growth and then link it to the Enga Provincial<br>
Development Plan Vision 2050 and Medium-Term Development strategies of the National<br>
Government. So we already have the solutions to the job we are doing.<br>
We have the strategies and means of ways to solve those issues and yet you are<br>
complaining. We should not be complaining, we should be happy and be cheerful. You<br>
have a government that is putting a lot of money but it&#x27;s up to individual MPs and their<br>
public service administration to implement to achieve the intended returns.<br>
I was complaining on the other side when the Member for Ialibu-Pangia was the<br>
Prime Minister. I have your debt level has gone up to K35 billion. I heard the Prime<br>
Minister James Marape said K29 billion because on the balance sheet of Treasury it was<br>
K29 billion but if you look at the money that was used through the SOE s, it goes up to<br>
K35 billion. You will find some of these SOE&#x27;s don&#x27;t have the money to invest to make<br>
more money for themselves.<br>
Like the PNG Power and other SOEs, money must be there as a capital? But when<br>
you get a loan and start to build up debts like I alluded to earlier, actually the money that<br>
were there in the SOE s under the leadership of former Prime Minister to my knowledge is<br>
K35 billion. On the Treasury balance sheet is K29 billion so it is a challenge for this side<br>
of the House to see how we can manage it. We can scale it down but at the same time, we<br>
grow the economy, create employment for our people and implement programs as well as<br>
looking at the rural sector through the DSIP funds.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, the public service is a very important area. I think that the<br>
implementation part is an issue and a challenge there.<br>
On the leadership side, I think we are doing well as a government, but the only<br>
challenges we have are in individual public service in every sector. The public service<br>
needs to wake up to the reality. The leadership in the public service needs to be addressed<br>
and according to the Treasurer we have heard the statement, that is being addressed<br>
adequately through the partnership that the State has with IMF. We are addressing by way<br>
of upgrading the skill, capacity and the capability of public service to implement these<br>
programs.<br>
45<br>
<br>
Page 49:<br>
32/02<br>
So we should stay focused on implementation and fixing the problems and<br>
challenges in the areas that we are entrusted.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, I believed that what a government can do under certain<br>
circumstances has been done adequately. When you look at it, there are many alternatives<br>
to take but with the current situation and circumstances that are presented, created in the<br>
past and some challenges like Covid-19 and the inflation present, the Marape-Rosso<br>
Government is implementing programs that are right. I think we should change our<br>
mindset both the Government and the Opposition to look at what we must do to make areas<br>
we are lacking better than always barking at the government.<br>
The Government at the moment under all circumstances is doing well and should<br>
be supported. I ask the Opposition to support the government by doing what they can do<br>
rather than giving misconstrued facts or forgetting the past. I think the direction we should<br>
take, is to learn from the past and build on from the present into the future. We must look<br>
into the future as a nation of competency and affluence and that is where we are going.<br>
Mr Acting Speaker, in conclusion as far as the Marape-Rosso Government is<br>
concerned, we are doing well. We support the Treasurer and his economic management<br>
regardless of the challenges, dynamics, and conditions we see today learn from the past<br>
and let&#x27;s move forward. I encourage us to discuss and debate very fruitfully like this but<br>
with facts and if you are clean and you give suggestions, I think it is worth listening to, but<br>
if you have contributed to the problems it&#x27;s all right too, you can learn from your mistakes.<br>
This Government is moving in the right direction and the country needs to support it.<br>
Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker.<br>
