<p>Update – Status of Government Finance(Question No. 10/2021)</p>
<p>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil 

Service  and  Communications  provide  an  update  to  Parliament  on  the  status  of 

Government finance (revenue) to date?</p>
<p>Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had spoken with the Honourable Attorney-General 

on  this  issue  because  he  made  a  very  detailed  Ministerial  Statement  this  morning,  so  I  am  just 

throwing this in and I am focusing on the revenue.  That is all.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Serviceand Communications).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to thank the Honourable Leaderof the Opposition for acknowledging the discussion that we did have.  Unfortunately, the response</p>
<p>Page 66</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>425</p>
<p>by  his  representative  who  spoke  on  the  Ministerial  Statement,  was  not  as  comprehensive  as  we 

thought it would be.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take this opportunity to just reiterate what I had said earlier 

on  and  that  is  to,  again,  highlight  because  there  was  quite  a  lot  of  statistics  thrown  around  this 

morning.  The Government’s total  revenue  collection for the six months stood at  $964.8 million, 

while total expenditure amounted to $1.5 billion.  What is really important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that 

the total revenue for the past six months was above the forecast of $107.3 million or 12.5 percent, so 

we are above what we had actually forecasted.</p>
<p>This is attributed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to two sources - revenue that comes from tax sources and 

what we call non-tax sources.  So, the tax revenue was above forecast by $26.7 million or 3.6 percent 

-  above  but,  of  course,  not  by  a  huge  margin.    However,  non-tax  revenue  exceeded  estimated 

collections by $80.6 million.</p>
<p>These, of course, Mr. Speaker, have come by way of grants that we have received.  Some, of 

course, are fees, et cetera, but in this kind of climate, you do not expect that much increase in fees.  

The number of sources from non-tax revenues, as I had mentioned earlier on this morning, have beenfrom organisations like ADB, Australia, Indonesia and the European Union.  A lot of this has to dowith the COVID-19 emergency response,TC Yasa, the Resilience Budget Support Programme by 

Australia, Welfare Support Programme by Australia, Indonesia contributed US$1.48 million for QVS 

and, of course, the EDF funding from the European Union.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  really  have  much  to  say  to  Honourable  Nawaikula’s  response 

because he did not really say much, apart from personalising things.  But I just wanted to just take 

this  opportunity  to  respond  to  what  Honourable  Professor  Prasad  said,  who,  unfortunately,  is  not 

here. .</p>
<p>One of the issues he did raise was about increasing consumption and that is precisely what 

the budget was all about. When we reduce tariffs, the idea is to also increase consumption - giving 

people access to goods and services to some extent, depending on what it is, the ability to access 

those services.  I remember just a few years ago, we were condemned by NFP for having what they 

call  a  ‘consumption-led  growth’  and  they  said  we  should  only  have  investment-led  growth.    Of 

course, we have said it should be both and in this point in time, of course, consumption can also be 

held back because of the psychology of where we are at.</p>
<p>People  tend  to  invest  when  they  feel  a  lot  more  comfortable,  when  they  feel  a  lot  moreconfident with the system or what is happening within the system.   So if tomorrow, for example, 

Australia decides that they will allow Australians to come and holiday in Fiji in the Bula Bubble and 

can  go  back  to  Australia  without  doing  quarantine  upon  their  return  because  we  are  a  COVID-

contained country, you can imagine that good news will lead to enormous confidence.  People will 

want to then perhaps, fast-tracking their investments. The shopkeepers will perhaps, start importing 

more goods. People, you know, selling white goods will start importing that, so it has a spiralling and 

positive effect and that is precisely what we are doing.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member used the example (and I wish he was here) of a person who can now 

buy a bigger car, who cannot afford it in the first place.  Well, the reason is because if you make that 

a bit more affordable, that person will be willing to depart with that money.  When they depart with 

that money and buy that car that perhaps, they would not have bought otherwise, they pay VAT on 

it. We collect the VAT. When they sell more cars, the car dealer then has more sales people, theyneed more mechanics, so consumption from that perspective creates a lot more robustness within theeconomy and that is precisely the reason why we have done that.  Therefore, to just say, “Well, then</p>
<p>Page 67</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>the rich guy can buy the car in any case,” is a very simplified way of viewing things. Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank you. Honourable Nawaikula, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.-  The revenue that we are currently  collecting, is  that enough to</p>
<p>finance Government business and its budget or do we need injection from somewhere else?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Again, if I can reiterate the 

very  fundamentals  of  the  budget,  all  Budgets  in  Fiji  have  always  been  funded  through  a  deficit 

budget,  except  for  two  in  our  history.    So  essentially  what  it  means  if  you  look  at  the  overall 

expenditure  of  Government,  there  is  a  particular  amount,  and  then  we  have  revenue.    There  has 

always been a shortfall because we are running a Government.  So, the first question is, how much 

of a shortfall?   The second question is, what are you actually going to fund through debt financing?</p>
<p>Now, the preference, of  course, is  that  you never fund  your operational  cost  through debtfinancing.  You  fund  your  operational  cost  through  your  revenue  generation.  If  HonourableNawaikula would have listened earnestly to the previous Budgets, prior to 2019 before COVID-19, 

we have always had what we called an operational surplus. In other words, we have collected more 

money  than  what  we  actually  could  spend  for  operational  purposes,  for  example,  running  of 

Government, paying the salaries, and all that type of stuff.  But in order to fund capital projects, we 

then had to go out and borrow money. Of course, if you have a larger surplus from operating surplus, 

we then borrow less.</p>
<p>To  answer  his  question  for  this  particular  year,  whatever  we  had  budgeted  for  2021,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, as I had highlighted, we are on track.  We are currently on track, so we have collected 

more than what we said we will collect and we are, in fact, at the moment spending less than what 

we said we will spend.  So as far as the budget is concerned for the first six months, we are essentially 

on par.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the  Honourable Minister indicate to the House 

what other measures the Government can take or RBF, to increase the appetite for the banks to lend?</p>
<p>In the latest update from the RBF, they said that there is liquidity in the system but the banks 

have low appetite to lend.  I know in the business community, there are people who are saying that 

they have projects that are ready for take-off but it is the reluctance of the bank to lend that is holding 

things back.  We cannot wait for the Bula Bubble to kick in, we need to work on what we have today.  

If the appetite for investment is there, it must be matched with the appetite of the bank to lend.  So, 

what can we do to get the banks to lend, Mr. Speaker?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about this issue previously.  

I think the fundamental issue here is that, how banks assess risk.  In Fiji’s case, unfortunately, we 

used to have our own national bank that had a very large share of the banking market.  But after the 

collapse of the National Bank of Fiji, for a number of years until only recently, all the banks in Fijiwere  foreign-owned.    Now,  we  have  only  one  bank  which  is  completely  Fijian  which  is  HomeFinance Company (HFC) but they have got a very small proportion of the market.  So their ability to</p>
<p>Page 68</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>427</p>
<p>influence  the  determinants  in  the  financial  sector,  in  particular  the  banking  sector  takes  in  Fiji  in 

assessing risk is very, very limited.</p>
<p>I  have  said  in  Parliament  previously,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ANZ  is  Australian/New  Zealand</p>
<p>owned, the decisions are made in Auckland, in Melbourne and in Sydney.</p>
<p>The  next  largest  bank  is  Westpac,  the  decisions  are  made  in  Sydney.    As  you  know  with 

Westpac, it is now open knowledge that they are now selling and they have a deal now with Kina 

Bank in Papua New Guinea, which we understand is the second largest bank in Papua New Guinea. 

We expect the transaction to be completed with all the regulatory requirements being met, probably 

in about nine months’ time or so.  Of course, their decision will be made in Port Moresby.</p>
<p>The next bank is the Bank of the South Pacific (BSP).  Their Head Office is in Port Moresby. 

The next bank is Bank of Baroda and their Head Office is in New Delhi/Mumbai. The next bank is 

Bred Bank, their decisions are being made in Paris. So their assessment of risk will be very different 

to what HFC would have as an assessment risk, so the ability to influence is a lot more limited.  What 

do we do, apart from telling the banks you have to lend now?  The RBF cannot force that, it is the 

market  forces  that  will  determine  it.    At  the  moment,  there  is  a  lot  of  liquidity,  given  what  theeconomy is at - $880 million or so.  The banks only make money from giving money.</p>
<p>However, one thing we have to understand, as I  had highlighted in my address earlier this 

morning, a lot of the banks have done provisioning and the reports are in access of a $100 million.  

In other words, a person who used to work, for example, at the Warwick Hotel and may have taken 

out a $2,000 loan with ANZ Bank or Westpac Bank or whoever, is no longer going to pay that loan. 

They cannot pay that loan.  They may have gone back to Tailevu because he may be originally from 

there,  and  do  some  farming  now.    Their  source  of  income,  of  course,  has  dried  from  their 

employment.  So, banks have probably written off their loan and that is what you call “provisioning.”  

So, they would be a bit conservative from that perspective. I am not justifying “no lending”. But that 

is one of the books and Honourable Gavoka has been a banker himself, he knows that, that they will 

have that provision.</p>
<p>Now, the other issue, of course, is that if the money just sits there idly, there will come a time 

when interest rates will need to come down.  Some of it has actually come down, but the issue he is 

raising and he is correct is that, some of the banks are now asking a larger equity contribution. If 

someone wants to go and put up, for example, a warehouse or a block of apartments, normally the 

banks may have asked them for 20 percent contribution towards the total cost of the project and lendthem 80 percent.  Now, some of the banks are asking for 30 percent or 35 percent contribution.</p>
<p>Obviously, we get a lot of market information. One of the foreign banks has decided to go 

very, very  aggressively  now and  we  are seeing that.   In fact, we are seeing  that  some of the key 

managers of some banks are now being poached by this one particular bank.  So, they are going to 

go very aggressively, they are bringing in new money into the market so we will see in the next few 

months a lot of shift and changes within the market itself.  I think the moment, one or two of them 

decide to go full throttle, the others will have to follow, otherwise, they will lose out on their share 

of the market.  In the meantime as a regulator, RBF has to provide the right prudential requirements 

and ensure that the financial system has stability.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- On the second Oral Question for today, I call on the Honourable Selai</p>
<p>Adimaitoga to ask her question. You have the floor, Madam.</p>
