<p>Dismantled Informal Markets(Question No. 14/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development  inform  Parliament  what  process  was  followed  in  the  decision  to  dismantle 

informal markets before and afterTC Yasa?</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  CommunityDevelopment).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I also thank the Honourable Member for her question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent Category 5TC Yasasaw the nation preparing for the worse.  The 

Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  all  Municipal  Councils  were  guided  in  their  decision  by  the 

NDMO on the severity of the Cyclone and the impact it would have on the nation.</p>
<p>When Category 5TC Yasawas forecasted to pass over Suva, bringing with it heavy rain and 

very high winds, the Council in the interest of public safety decided to remove informal markets.  

The decision to dismantle and remove the informal markets were taken for two reasons; to prevent 

flooding and to prevent flying debris.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that informal markets were situated on an existing 

storm water drain.  The forecasted rainfall would have seen flooding in that area, which would haveposed a threat to neighbouring properties and the road infrastructure.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior verbal and written notices were issued to the vendors to relocate before 

the informal markets were dismantled.  The Councils have been engaging with the market vendors 

for quite some time to willingly relocate.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,TC Yasabeing Category 5, made the  removal of informal markets  very 

urgent. Councils gave the informal vendors 24 hours to 48 hours’ notice to dismantle and remove 

their structures. They were, again, reminded 12 hours later that they must remove their structures.  At 

the expiration of the notice period, the Council gave the informal vendors a grace period of three 

hours to remove the informal structure.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council’s Enforcement Team, together with Police issued the notices to 

the vendors. Some vendors refused to accept the notices.  When the roadside vendors failed to adhere 

to the instructions issued by the Councils, the Municipal Council took the initiative of removing the 

illegal structures which is under section 115(1)(g) of the Local Government Act 1972.</p>
<p>When  the  roadside  vendors  failed  and  they  were  not  actually  listening  to  the  Municipal 

Councils or the workers, then the Police Team were actually brought in during the removal of the 

illegal structures because we wanted to be sure that we did everything in a proper way.  After thecyclone  the  Council’s  market  team  visited  all  the  vendors  to  register  and  relocate  these  vendors.Some roadside vendors agreed to relocate to permanent markets while some vendors choose not to 

and continue to operate from the same site.  That is all I have to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.</p>
<p>Honourable  Radrodro,  for</p>
<p>supplementary question, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and I thank the Honourable Minister for 

that  response,  bearing  in  mind  that  this  is  the  livelihood  for  these  very  vulnerable  people.    The 

question  is,  what  kind  of  assistance  will  the  Ministry  or  will  the  Municipal  Council  give  to  the 

vendors who have had their crops or supplies destroyed during that dismantling process based on 

very humanitarian grounds on the condition that we are faced with right now and if they could be 

compensated for all those produce that they have lost?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the Municipal Council is concerned, none 

of the produce were damaged. They were all taken in, kept in the market and later on the vendorscame to collect those produce.   Even the stall structures were kept in the office in their depot wherethe vendors came as well as the stallholders, and they took those material.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tabuya, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. This issue about the roadside vendors is not 

new or limited to tropical cyclone.  In fact, last year, when the vendors once again were asked to be 

removed from Nakasi, especially when they approached the Honourable Minister, she promised last 

year  in  February  2020  that  a  market  will  be  built  in  Nakasi.    When  the  vendors  approached  the 

Honourable  Prime  Minister,  he  told  them  to  go  to  Laqere  and  Nausori.    So,  I  want  to  ask  the 

Honourable Minister, why have they broken their promise to these market vendors that they would 

build a market in Nakasi?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>

<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the situation has changed from then to now.  Each 

and every market has registered Market Vendors Association.  I would say there are more than 8,000 

registered market vendors around the country, even more than 8,000.</p>
<p>Now,  these  market  vendors  have  been  writing  to  me.    They  have  expressed  their 

disappointment that the Municipal Council is not adhering to the laws and they are asking as to why 

a handful of market vendors are operating from the roadside.  They are questioning us, when the law 

says they cannot.  So, they have also threatened Municipal Councils that if Municipal Councils are 

not going to stop the roadside vendors, they are going to also go out on the road and they will start 

selling their vegetables.</p>
<p>Now, in such a situation, what do we expect the Government to do?  Obviously, we will apply 

the law but that does not mean that we did not look after the roadside vendors.  We, in fact, have 

given them a better place to do their business.  We have provided them with stalls in a secure safe 

environment where they can do their business, so what is the problem here?  I just fail to understand. 

What we have done is, we have given them a better place.</p>
<p>What we have done is, we have provided them with better facilities that includes the toiletfacility, good water supply, lights, cleaning services and security, so we have provided everything.Is the market not supposed to be doing that?</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Alright, that is what I am saying, so what are you trying to tell me?</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is Honourable Tabuya trying to tell me?  That she is going to protect 

a handful of roadside vendors against thousands of registered market vendors around the country?  I 

hope they are listening because they are also…</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You promised!</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  They  are also  relying on the  market  for their livelihood.  They are</p>
<p>competing amongst themselves …</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- ... for their livelihoods.  Again, Honourable Tabuya went ahead and 

made some irrelevant statements on social media and saying, “oh what will happen to the people in 

Nakasi, Makoi, and Narere?  They would not get their vegetables.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  least does she know that there is Veidogo Market, which is right in Makoi 

which means people from Nakasi, Narere and there is even a market in Narere where they can buy 

their produce from.  I must say that Veidogo Market has been there for a while but the vendors opted 

to operate right on the roadside.</p>
<p>Now, what we have done is that, because we know it is going to take time for us to buildNakasi Market and it cannot happen overnight, we are extending the Veidogo Market and we haveactually added 40 car parks.  So, with the car parking facility extended, the market will be able to</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>accommodate 40 more new vendors in Makoi and Makoi is not too far away from Nakasi.  Thank 

you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the sixth Oral Question for today and I call on the</p>
<p>Honourable Lal to ask his question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
