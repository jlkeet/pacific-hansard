<p>Restoration of Road Accessibility  

(Question No.  11/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Mineral Resources update Parliament on the status of restoring road accessibility that was 

affected duringTC YasaandTC Ana?</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and 

Mineral Resources).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable Member for her question.</p>
<p>Fiji, as  we all know,  has been besieged with  a lot of natural  disasters recently - cyclones, 

flooding and even earthquakes.  In the aftermath ofTC YasaandTC Ana, there has been a lot of 

damage and I need to reinstate a lot of our roading infrastructure in Fiji.</p>
<p>Roading is obviously a critical infrastructure for our country, so the Ministry has had to work 

through the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) which has been trying to give its best within the resourcesthat it has. It has committed itself to restoring the roads and in so doing, accessibility to the peopleof Fiji.</p>
<p>Currently, the restoration works for the Central Division, according to the estimates by FRA, 

in  the  aftermath  of  these  two  cyclones  was  around  98  percent;  for  the  Western  and  Northern 

Divisions,  approximately  75  percent;  and  for  the  Eastern  Division,  approximately  85  percent 

completed of what we wanted to do in the aftermath ofTC YasaandTC Ana.   Even when we do not 

have cyclones, the rain has been continuing to pour and even today, we are seeing flash flooding in 

Labasa as a result of the rain that is taking place there.  Because of the continuous rain, the FRA has 

yet to complete about 20 percent of its survey works in the interior of Vanua Levu and also in Viti 

Levu.</p>
<p>We also have the constant problem of when you try to reinstate crossings in particular, there 

is another flood and it washes it away.  I have seen this myself in Vanua Levu soon afterTC Yasaand again last week when I was in Vanua Levu.  So, at the moment FRA has put together the people, 

about  110  delivery  personnel  and  800  contracted  personnel  trying  to  make  sure  that  they  can  re-

establish those roads.  Some of these people are working from 10 hours to 12 hours a day, some of 

them are working seven days a week.  So reconstruction teams are still on sites and last weekendwhen I was in Vanua Levu, I saw a lot of these reconstruction teams on site in the various roads.</p>
<p>There  are  also  25  non-problematic  low  level  crossings  which  have  been  included  in  FRA 

Forward Works Plan for replacement with a new resilient crossing similar to the ones that we have 

seen in Nausori and Savusavu Crossings in Ra. So, that Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just a very broad update 

on the progress on the recovery of the roading infrastructure that we have in the country.  Thank you, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  We will move on.  Honourable Salote</p>
<p>Radrodro you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you Honourable Minister for that statement.  Someone just 

sent me a picture of the Naduri Crossing and it is looking very dangerous.  I also conversed with 

someone travelling from Labasa to Natovi, and he also shared his concern on the condition of theroad in Naduri.  What kind of safety initiatives or programmes that are in there to ensure the safeguardof the general travelling public from Labasa to Nabouwalu and vice versa because right now that is</p>

<p>the only route or only link that is linking up Labasa and Nabouwalu and vice versa?  Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member.  The Honourable Minister your have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  the  old  road  that  is  going  from  Korovou  to 

Naduri and then to Tabia is the road that is open now.  There are some limitations on that road.  There 

is one crossing there that has a limit of around 10 tonnes. So, that is obviously going to limit the 

volume of cargo that we can move along that road.</p>
<p>I had travelled on that road in the last weekend and I see there are some challenges to that 

road in terms of the condition of the surface of the road.  At the moment as  I speak, FRA is still 

working on making sure that, that is serviceable as possible.  So, I think for smaller vehicles, they 

should be able to use that road but subject to all these rain that is happening.  But if the rain does 

come in, FRA will still try to rehabilitate the road as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Now,  in  between  Korosomo  and  that  other  slip  in  front  of  it,  the  FRA  has  talked  to  thelandowners in that area and the initial stage of discussion with the landowners, they had given anagreement for a realignment.  The slip is here, they allowed a new cutting of a realignment to avoid 

the areas where the slips are.  Unfortunately, once the landowners had agreed, another set then came 

and also claimed that land. So, now FRA has to try to resolve with them and talk to iTLTB and TLC 

or whoever it is that we need to talk to, for them to get that understanding that the land is agreed 

upon,  that  we  can  do  the  realignment  and  if  that  happens,  then  we  should  be  able  to  have  the 

realignment on the main road within two to three weeks.</p>
<p>The other option, of course, is coming around the transinsular road, you will still have to go 

past that road.  So, I think those are the two alternatives at the moment.  I think you can use the road, 

you  use  them  safely  within  the  limitations,  and  as  quickly  as  possible,  we  will  try  to  put  the 

realignment around the slips that are there in Korosomo.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Nawaikula you have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Where  will  the  Government  get  the  money  to  pay  for  this</p>
<p>reconstruction which I know will be a lot?  That is a fair question.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, I will let you answer that.</p>
<p>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Honourable Nawaikula, unfortunately, we do not have magic wands, 

we are not magicians but what we do have in Government, is we have a sense of responsibility and 

reasonableness.  We look at the problems, the programmes and the projects that we already have and 

we tell ourselves, “Alright, we had set aside $5,000 for streetlights but  right now, maybe we can 

reduce  the  amount  of  money  we  put  on  streetlights  and  put  it  on  this  crossing.”    A  sensible 

Government does that, and that is what this Government does because this is a sensible Government 

and thank God, we are in control of this country at this point in time.</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Do you wish to ask a question?</p>
<p>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, Honourable Tuisawau.</p>
<p>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just extending from Honourable 

Nawaikula’s question on the finance part on the road rehabilitation, et cetera, relating to what the 

Honourable Minister for Economy had mentioned in terms of the revenue and part of it which will 

be funded by development partners, what are the other measures in place in terms of the revenue to 

fund  the  extensive  road  repairs,  et  cetera,  in  the  next  two  to  three  years,  given  that  the  revenue 

projections  you  have  mentioned,  most  of  it  is  from  development  partners  and  the  local  revenue 

collection is declining?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, the question is pretty clear - update Parliament on 

the status of restoring road accessibility that was affected byTC YasaandTC Ana, not what he is 

going to do after that, and he has answered that sufficiently.</p>
<p>We will move on to the next question.  On the third Oral Question for today, I give the floor</p>
<p>to Honourable Saukuru.</p>
