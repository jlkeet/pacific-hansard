(Question No.  17/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Page 78</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>437</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management explain the mechanisms in place to deal 

with complaints and issues raised by those communities affected byTC YasaandTC Anaregarding the distribution of food and non-food items?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management).-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I wish to 

acknowledge the Honourable Member for the question.  Let me begin by saying that meeting the 

expectations of those, particularly in the affected areas, is quite a challenge, but at the same time I 

wish to give assurance that the Government and all the stakeholders involved in the relief operations 

are doing their best to attend to the issues that may be raised every now and then.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the assistance provided by the Government is guided by the provisions in 

section  28  as  well  as  section  33  of  the  Natural  Disaster  Management  Act  1998,  concerning  the 

involvement of NGOs.  Perhaps, if I may say here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also something that we 

have also  addressed very  recently, the  tightening up  of  co-ordination, particularly in  terms  of the 

involvement of NGOs.</p>
<p>We  appreciate,  particularly  from  NDMO,  all  the  relevant  stakeholders  that  do  come  in  toassist because Government will not be able to reach out to the people as per the principles laid out in 

the National Disaster Management Plan 1995, setting the principles, particularly on the distribution 

of relief supplies which should take place in an orderly and in an equitable manner.</p>
<p>One of the key issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly in the coordination of NGO activities is 

the allocation of areas and the variation in the packages that we assist.  We have had instances where 

people do raise that they have milk in their package but some are saying that there is no milk in the 

items that they are given.  This is exactly, Mr. Speaker, the reason why we need to coordinate better 

because all the different stakeholders come with different packages.  But Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms 

of  addressing  the  complaints,  Government  or  the  Ministry  has  also  put  in  place  a  Complaints 

Management Policy that is overseen by the national controller, who is the Permanent Secretary and 

the national coordinator as well.</p>
<p>How does the system work, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  For every complaint that is registered, either 

through the Divisional Commissioners or at the DO level and even from social media and through 

Government officials, including Ministers, it is channelled to the Ministry.  The duty of those who 

amend  the  Complaints  Management  Policy  is  to  register  all  the  complaints  and  then  direct  thecomplaints to the respective Divisions, even to the districts for verification and, of course, attendingto it as well if need be, and then revert to headquarters to ensure that it is being noted and ticked off 

in terms of what has been done to it.</p>
<p>May I say, Mr Speaker, Sir, there are challenges in attending particularly where accessibility 

is not in the best of state, but Government is doing its very best to reach out to all those communities 

in the affected areas.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Defence  and  National  Security.</p>
<p>Honourable Lalabalavu, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the 

Honourable  Minister.    With  regards  to  the  initial  assessment,  I  think  that  is  where  most  of  the 

complaints come in.  How is the Ministry addressing it, moving forward with regards to the nextnatural disaster?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>9th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  wish  to  thank  the 

Honourable  Member  for  the  question.    This  is,  in  fac,t  an  area  that  is  very,  very  critical  to  us, 

particularly in addressing some of the shortfalls in the work.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initial  damage assessments, according to the plan and the Act, are to be 

covered within the first 48 hours and then what follows is the detailed damage assessments.  Why 

the initial damage assessment and the short time period?  It is just to identify the critical areas or the 

areas badly affected and the sort of immediate relief supplies that need to be pushed to these particular 

areas before the detailed damage assessment comes in.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been working very closely with the UNDP Office and Cabinet and 

they had endorsed a programme on governance for resilience in which UNDP is sponsoring a few 

project officers to be with the Ministry for the next two years and, of course, subject to review, to 

look at how we can improve on the governance for resilience, particularly in terms of humanitarian 

assistance and how that is linked up to development as well.</p>
<p>However, in terms of damage assessments, one of the new key initiatives later on during theweek, I will give a Ministerial Statement to cover the overall operations both forTC YasaandTC 

Ana. to improve these damage assessments is the use of tablets, particularly new technology.  The 

beauty about this tablet is that it will quicken the processes it takes to get the information back to the 

initiating station, whether it be at the district or the divisional level.  At the same time, it also gives 

us the opportunity to take images of the areas and this will alleviate some of the problems when it 

comes to complaints as well.</p>
<p>The Honourable Attorney-General would also agree to this Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in some of 

the complaints, because we do not have the images, they have been visited by so many agencies, 

perhaps  three  times,  with  food,  tarpaulins  but  they  hide  these  on  the  back  without  any  image  or 

without their photos being taken.  There is no evidence.  But the beauty about this is that, we deployed 

tablets to the Eastern Division and most recently, we deployed it to the West.  Just last week, the 

Ministry purchased another 50 sets of these tablets, again, funded by the UNDP so that we can take 

it to Vanua Levu.  I think this is the long-term solution to all this - the use of technology.  Of course, 

it will bring a lot of efficiency in addressing the issues.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Tabuya, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Firstly, I want to thank the Government 

of Australia for their assistance through theHMS Adelaide, in terms of distribution of food and non-

food items.  The question to the Honourable Minister is, there are overseas donors, family members, 

friends that wish to also donate food and non-food items to their families and loved ones here. Could 

the Government reconsider the 70 percent duty that they are charging now on these containers being 

shipped in? They are only giving 30 percent discount, Mr. Speaker. Would they consider to give a 

100 percent discount, duty exempt to help our people during this time of disaster?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  I  will  try  to  answer  the 

question, although it is totally different.  For the benefit of the general public as well, Mr. Speaker, 

when it comes to duties, that is under the Honourable Minister for Economy.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>439</p>
<p>However, there is a system or an arrangement in place. Those who want to bring in items for 

assistance from abroad, they have to write an application through the national controller which is the 

Permanent Secretary responsible for Disaster Management and what we would request is the list of 

items that are coming in the container.  That will be submitted to the Ministry of Economy for tax 

exemption but everyone pays VAT. VAT is always applicable regardless, but that decision is taken 

by the Honourable Minister for Economy.</p>
<p>What I wish to say here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the reason why I wanted to answer the question 

and we also appreciate the assistance but they have to accept the fact that, firstly,  when the container 

is opened, the Ministry will be there together with FRCS to ensure that what comes in the container 

is consistent with the manifest that we are given because we have had so many issues in the past 

where the contents of what is in the container is different from the original list that we were given.   

As we speak, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sitting in our top yard is a Nissan Patrol which came in one of the 

containers; a vehicle and the rest were computers, outboard motors - things that were not meant for, 

but for other purposes.</p>
<p>Secondly, when it comes to distribution, we will also accompany them for the distribution 

until everything that was in container is used.  In the past as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once the containeris cleared, they do their own distribution, half is distributed and half is sold. So, that has been thepractice from the past but we now have very good systems in place to ensure that this is not abused, 

but the facility is there.</p>
