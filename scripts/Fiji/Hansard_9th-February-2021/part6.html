<h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3>
<p><span>Cybercrime Bill 2020 – Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as time changes so does most, if not all, aspects of 

</span><span>today’s society.  Today’s society is at the cusp of a technology-driven way of life.  This has seen 

</span><span>numerous benefits for both, the public and private sector, however, it has also seen the growth in the

<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>numbers of actors who use technology for malicious and destructive intentions, or for their selfish 

gains.    Therefore,  numerous  jurisdictions  have  endeavoured  to  put  in  place  mechanisms  for 

addressing the problematic issues that attach to the proliferated impact of technology, especially those 

through cyber technology. 

</span></p>
<p><span>There are existing legislation in Fiji that address certain aspects of crimes committed through 

or on computers.  However, change in time came with it, changes in technologies that provided new 

ways  of  committing  cyber-related  crimes.    Thus,  it  was  identified  that  the  existing  legal  and 

regulatory frameworks do not adequately address crimes committed via or have arisen from ever-

evolving cyber technology. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, the Fijian Government has seen fit to introduce a mechanism for addressing those 

already  existent  issues  and  those  novel  issues  arising  from  cyber-related  and  computer-related 

offences. The Cybercrime Bill 2020 is a vital mechanism introduced by the Fijian Government. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Cybercrime  Bill  was  introduced  into  Parliament  and  was  referred  to  the  Standing 

Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for review.  For review, the Committee conducted 

public consultation by inviting the public to provide written submissions, and also allowing for verbal 

</span><span>consultations with key stakeholders and interested individuals.   

</span></p>
<p><span>At the initial stage of the review, the Committee noted a few key points which are as follows, 

</span></p>
<p><span>that: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(a) 

</span></p>
<p><span>(b) 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Bill aims to prescribe offences and penalties for acts conducted via cyber space 

and computers, which negatively impacts an individual, corporate body, society and 

a nation as a whole; 

</span></p>
<p><span>certain provisions of the Bill is likely to provide excessive authority and power to the 

authorities (who, in the case of the Bill, are the police and a person authorised by the 

Commissioner of FICAC) to search and seize computer data and other information 

for the purpose of an investigation; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>(c) 

</span></p>
<p><span>certain  provisions  of  the  Bill  are  likely  to  have  implications  on  potential  risks  to 

privacy and court-related procedures for adducing evidence.  

</span></p>
<p><span>During the later stages of the review, the Committee identified the following salient issues, 

</span></p>
<p><span>that: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(a) 

</span></p>
<p><span>(b) 

</span></p>
<p><span>(c) 

</span></p>
<p><span>certain  words  and  phrases  found  in  the  Bill  should  be  given  proper  interpretation 

provisions; 

</span></p>
<p><span>certain provisions of the Bill may have unintended consequences on those actors that 

merely try to expose criminal activities; 

</span></p>
<p><span>the complex nature of cybercrime and its related matters, that is, that it is a rapidly 

evolving part of today’s society and that it has extraterritorial implications, should be 

a key basis for the drafting of the provisions of the Bill; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(d) 

</span></p>
<p><span>there are unrealistic expectations on the practicability of implementing the provisions 

of the Bill;

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>(e) 

</span></p>
<p><span>certain provisions could potentially pose risks to certain rights of Fijians, which are 

provided in the Constitution; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>(f) 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Bill lacks coverage on certain acts, which can be considered as cybercrime. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee compared pieces of legislation of other jurisdictions with the proposed law, 

to  gauge  the  approaches  taken  by  such  jurisdictions  in  addressing  cybercrime  and  noted  that 

internationally,  there  are  varying  approaches  in  addressing  the  impacts  of  advancements  in 

information and communication technologies. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consideration was also given to the impact of the Bill on the Sustainable Development Goals 

and the National Development Plan. It was encouraging to note that the provisions of the Bill were 

drafted  with  the  aim  of  enabling  development,  whilst  also  promoting  a  safe  and  secure  cyber 

environment.  Additionally, the objective of the Bill is as such that it applies equally to all persons, 

irrespective of gender. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee had extensive internal deliberation on the salient issues noted from the review 

and legal clarifications were sought on those issues.  This ensured that the primary objective of the 

</span><span>Bill is preserved.  

</span></p>
<p><span>At  the  conclusion  of  the  review,  the  Committee  acknowledges  that  there  were  numerous 

issues as identified above. The Committee also realises that the Bill will bring about a new law in 

Fiji.  However, at this stage, given the novelty of the implications that the Bill would have on the 

legal and justice system in Fiji and also on the lives of Fijians, enactment of this law would pose an 

opportunity for great learning. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, the Bill is designed to enable the implementation of the Budapest Convention 

on  Cybercrime  and  sets  out  the  minimum  requirements,  which  would  ensure  Fiji’s  cybercrime 

regulatory framework is on par with international standards.  It should also be noted that the Bill 

utilises technology-neutral drafting, thus ensuring that this proposed law is flexible enough to keep 

up with the ever-evolving nature of cyber-technology and its consequences. Therefore, to ensure the 

fruition  of  these  aims,  the  Committee  believes  that  the  Bill  is  sufficient  as  it  is  and  that  no 

amendments are needed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At this juncture, I would like to thank the Honourable Members of the Standing Committee 

on Justice,  Law and Human Rights  for their deliberations and input;  Honourable  Alvick Maharaj 

</span><span>(Chairperson), Honourable Dr. Salik Govind, Honourable Ratu Suliano Matanitobua and Honourable 

</span><span>Mosese Bulitavu.  I would also like to acknowledge the staff of the Research Unit and Committee 

Secretariat, the entities who accepted the invitation of the Committee and made themselves available 

to make submissions and the members of the public for taking an interest in the proceedings of the 

Committee and Parliament.  On behalf of the Committee, I hereby commend the Cybercrime Bill 

2020 to Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Please, hand the Report to the Secretary-General.  

</span></p>
<p><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 26th May, 2020, the Bill must 

be debated and voted upon by Parliament in the course of this sitting week, but that one hour be given 

to debate the Bill.

<p><span>I now call upon the Deputy Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts to 

</span></p>
<p><span>table his Report.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - 2017 Audit Report for the Infrastructure Sector – 

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Public Accounts Committee 

Review Report on the 2017 Audit Report for the Infrastructure Sector.  The audit specifically looks 

into the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport which has consolidated the Water Authority of Fiji 

(WAF) and Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) receipts and expenditure with the Ministry.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport was issued with a modified audit opinion on its 

financial performance for the 2016-2017 financial year.  It is important to note that the Ministry that 

was scrutinised by the Committee was not invited for interview because of the COVID-19 restrictions 

that were in place at that time but were requested instead to provide written response on the audit 

issues that were raised in the audit report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>According  to  the  Budget  Estimates,  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Transport  was 

</span><span>responsible for the policy and legislative formulation, as well as the administrative and regulatory 

</span><span>functions of WAF and FRA.  The Ministry provided the capital and operating grants under Heads 41 

and 43 to WAF and FRA respectively. 

</span></p>
<p><span>For information purposes, the detail audit on WAF and FRA’s financial performances were 

done separately  and included under the Auditor-General’s Report on Statutory  Authorities.    The 

Auditor-General  had  highlighted  a  number  of  significant  audit  findings  and  the  Public  Accounts 

Committee  wishes  to  stress  the  importance  of  taking  serious  consideration  on  all  proposed 

recommendations, given as it will address audit issues from being repeated. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  the  Honourable  Members  of  the 

Committee who were part of the compilation of the bipartisan report, namely; Honourable Alvick 

Maharaj  (Chairperson);  the  former  Member,  Honourable  Vijendra  Prakash;  Honourable  Aseri 

Radrodro; and Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa.  I also extend my gratitude to Honourable Mikaele 

Leawere, who stood in as an Alternate Member. 

</span></p>
<p><span>With those few words, I now commend this Report to Parliament. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 

</span></p>
<p><span>Justice, Law and Human Rights to table his report.  You have the floor, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report on the National Payment System Bill 2020 –  

Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  has  put  in  place  an 

ambitious  five-year  development  plan  which  includes  placing  emphasis  on  improving  financial 

literacy, financial inclusion, improving access to finance, integrated digital payment systems and an 

overall improvement of the financial sector.  The National Payment System Bill 2020 aims to bring 

into fruition the Fijian Government’s development plan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The National Payment System Bill 2020 was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, 

Law and Human Rights for review.  For review, the Committee conducted public consultations by 

inviting the public to provide written submissions and also allowing for verbal consultations with 

key stakeholders and interested individuals in various key locations around Viti Levu.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In the initial stage of the review, the Committee noted a few key points which are follows, 

</span></p>
<p><span>that: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>according to the Explanatory Note to the Bill, the Bill is part of the reforms by the Reserve 

Bank of Fiji (RBF) towards ensuring a sound financial structure for Fiji; 

</span></p>
<p><span>the Bill serves as a blanket legal framework for all payment systems operating in Fiji; 

</span></p>
<p><span>the RBF will have adequate regulatory powers and oversight functions over the payment 

industry in Fiji; 

</span></p>
<p><span>payment and securities systems will have a sound legal basis; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>the  Bill  will  enable  the  regulation  of  electronic  transfers  and  also  provide  rules  for 

payments systems, which are aimed at protecting customers. 

</span></p>
<p><span>During the later stages of the review, the Committee identified the following salient issues: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>majority of the public advised that there was little to no awareness on the Bill; 

</span></p>
<p><span>that  certain  terms  and  phrases  used  in  the  Bill  be  given  appropriate  interpretation 

provisions; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>that certain provisions in the Bill raise concerns, in that, they provide excessive power to 

the RBF and the Governor of RBF. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Consideration was also given to the impact of the Bill on Sustainable Development Goals and 

</span></p>
<p><span>the National Development Plan.   

</span></p>
<p><span>It  was  encouraging  to  note  that  the  Bill  was  introduced  for  the  purpose  of  improving  the 

financial sector and the payment systems in Fiji, which can be directly linked to socio, economic and 

political development of the country.  Additionally, the objective of the Bill is as such that it applies 

equally to all persons, irrespective of gender.

<p><span>Ministerial Statements  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  consulted  the  initiating  Ministry  and  also  sought  legal  clarifications 

pertaining to the issues noted from the Bill.  This ensured that the primary objective of the Bill is 

preserved. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At  the  conclusion  of  the  review,  the  Committee  acknowledges  that  there  were  numerous 

issues  as  identified  above.    In  addressing  the  issues,  the  Committee  noted  that  the  Bill  aligns  to 

international  best  practices  and  that  it  has  provisions  which  are  similar  to  legislations  in  other 

jurisdictions. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  also  noted  that  the  proposed  law  would  bring  about  a  uniform  regulatory 

framework  for  payment  systems  in  Fiji.    As  we  start  implementing  this  law,  this  would  be  an 

opportune moment to gauge the implications of the Bill on Fiji’s financial system.  Therefore, the 

Committee believes that the Bill is sufficient as it is and that no amendments are needed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to thank the Honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law 

and Human Rights for their deliberations and input - Hon. Alvick Maharaj (Chairperson); Hon. Dr. 

Salik Govind;  Hon. Ratu Suliano Matanitobua; and  Hon. Mosese Bulitavu.   I would also  like to 

acknowledge  the  entities  who  accepted  the  invitation  of  the  Committee  and  made  themselves 

</span><span>available to make submissions, and members of the public for taking an interest in the proceedings 

</span><span>of the Committee and Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee would like to make special mention of the contribution of the late, Mr. Sesha 

Reddy, of Sigatoka, who contributed immensely to the public submission on the National Payment 

System  Bill  2020  during  the  public  consultation  in  Sigatoka.    It  is  with  great  sadness  that  the 

Committee had learnt of the passing of Mr. Reddy and his wife soon after the public consultation. 

The Committee takes this opportunity to give its condolences to the family and loved ones of the late 

Mr. and Mrs. Reddy. 

</span></p>
<p><span>On behalf of the Committee, I hereby commend the National Payment System Bill 2020 to 

</span></p>
<p><span>Parliament.  Thank you.
