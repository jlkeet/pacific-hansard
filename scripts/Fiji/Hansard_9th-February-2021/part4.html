Question this morning from the Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua with respect to the issue of the 

Savusavu Hospital Morgue. I have had a look at the Question and whilst the issue may be a matter 

of public importance, the Question is not of an urgent character.</p><p>I am satisfied that there has been sufficient coverage of the matter by the Honourable Minister 

for Health as well as the Permanent Secretary for Health, and we will leave the matter at that.  In that 

regard, the Urgent Oral Question submitted by the Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua is disallowed 

under Standing Order 43(1).</p><p>Honourable  Members,  I  must  reiterate  that  Urgent  Oral  Questions  must  fully  satisfy  the</p><p>requirements clearly provided under Standing Order 43(1).</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4></body>
