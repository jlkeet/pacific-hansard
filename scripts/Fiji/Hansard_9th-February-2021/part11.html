<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee commends the team of committed and motivated individuals

Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs. 

Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion. Honourable Ratu Suliano 

Matanitobua, you have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RATU  S.  MATANITOBUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  speak  very  briefly  on 

Parliamentary Paper No. 15 of 2019, the Report of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the 

Fiji National Sports Commission Annual Reports from 2016 and 2017. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At the outset, Sir, while I commend the report and the work of the Committee in reviewing 

the achievements of the Sports Commission, I must urge statutory bodies and Government Ministries 

to table their annual reports as required by the Financial Management Act and their own enabling 

legislation. It is 2021 and here we are reviewing activities from 2016 and 2017, Sir. There is a backlog 

of reports as well for debate in this august House and I commend the move for a special sitting later 

in the year to move along all the pending reports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  the  substantive  report  under  review,  the  Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  which  is 

established by law as a Commission has an important role to enrich the lives and health of all Fijians 

through  physical  activities  and  sports.    It  is  about  our  health,  job  creation,  international  talent 

</span><span>exchange and revenue earning.   

</span></p>
<p><span>For the period under review, in 2017 the Commission’s programmes reached 60,333 people 

around  Fiji,  an  increase  of  21,503  from  38,830  in  2016.  The  Commission  conducted  five  Sports 

Outreach Programmes with a total of 481 participants from five provinces, 15 t</span><span>ikina</span><span> and 52 villages 

which are: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Naqarawai Village in Namosi (five </span><span>tikina</span><span> with nine villages) 

Semo Village in Nadroga (three </span><span>tikina</span><span> with nine villages) 

</span><span>Tubou Village in Lakeba, Lau (one </span><span>tikina </span><span>withseven villages) 

</span><span>Rewasa Village in Ra (five </span><span>tikina </span><span>with</span><span> </span><span>18 villages)  

Valeni Village in Cakaudrove (one </span><span>tikina</span><span> with nine villages) 

</span></p>
<p><span>The programme exposed the participants to 10 different sports namely hockey, rugby union, rugby 

league, Australian Football League (AFL), volleyball, netball, boxing, cricket, soccer and tennis.   

</span></p>

<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – FNSC January 2016-July 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>413 

</span></p>
<p><span>For the year 2017, the Commission recorded Fiji’s success at the Rio Olympics and continued 

its success to the Pacific Mini Games held in Vanuatu where 23 gold medals were achieved.  These 

results followed Fiji’s participation in the Commonwealth Games where a gold in weightlifting won 

and with the bronze medal win upon the return of Fiji into the boxing arena.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I note the following challenges:  

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Difficulties in provision of sports grants, overseas sports tours, host international events, 

short- term expert grant,  sports scholarship grants, special one-off grants and international 

coaches grants and to all National Sports Organisation the Commission is trying to assist 

all sporting bodies with their limited funds; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>National Sports Organisations disputes; 

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(4)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Demand for programmes, sports development and community assistance requests exceed 

the budgetary allocation; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>Need  to  increase  follow-ups  on  Sports  Development  Programmes.  These  have  been 

</span><span>hindrance to the progress of their activities and programmes. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As always, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the duty of the loyal opposition is to point out where Government can 

do better and to collectively solve the challenges that face us today. 

</span></p>
<p><span>May I, therefore, offer the following recommendations: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>There is an urgent need to develop a legal code for sports, medical and insurance; and 

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We  anticipate  the  proposed  Anti-Doping  Legislation  announced  as  being  part  of  the 

legislative programme for this session of Parliament.  I urge the Honourable Minister to 

conduct consultations with stakeholders including the Sports Commission and to table 

this legislation in this august House.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, the impact of COVID-19 resultant economic meltdown has been devastating to 

the development of sports in our country.  Despite the economic crisis, sports continues to thrive, 

young people continue to train everyday preparing for future tournaments and the weekly fixtures 

and games continue on the ground. 

</span></p>
<p><span>While the emergency and relief response to aid the victims of recent severe </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC 

Ana</span><span>  is  urgent,  the  wellbeing  of  our  nation  and  its  people  includes  health  and  vitality  which  is 

promoted with sports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sports as we know is also a source of income for our talented sports people. Sports must not 

</span></p>
<p><span>be forgotten as the nation continues to move forward in these extraordinary times.   

</span></p>
<p><span>To  conclude,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  Sports  Commission  on  its  work  and 

achievements.  I  also  commend  the  Honourable  Chair  and  Honourable  Members  of  the  Standing 

Committee for their report and I endorse their recommendations.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Matanitobua for his contribution to the debate.  I 

give the floor to  the Honourable Minister for Productivity, Employment  and  Industrial  Relations, 

</span><span>Youth and Sports. You have the floor, Sir.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – FNSC January 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  previous  speaker  had  spoken  on    two  issues; 

</span></p>
<p><span>submission of the Annual Report and the funding. 

</span></p>
<p><span>May I inform this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 Annual 

Reports are with Parliament and for the last eight years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government had given 

around $54 million to the National Sports Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the four recommendations of the Committee on Annual 

Review of the Fiji National Sports Commission and I think it is only right to talk about sports now 

after having a lengthy debate on our children. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recommendation  one  talks  about  strengthening  the  national  sporting 

organisation in compliance issues.  The Fiji Sports Commission has a good working relationship with 

the  national  sporting  organisations  to  ensure  that  they  do  meet  the  qualifying  requirements  when 

applying for grants.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Sports  Commission  had  worked  closely  on  agreeing  on  a  mutually 

acceptable  framework  and  this  has  led  to  the  compliance  by  almost  all  national  sporting 

</span><span>organisations.    As  per  its  mandate  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Sports  Commission  takes  in  a  proactive 

</span><span>mediation role to ensure that sports in Fiji is the winner. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, Fiji Sports Commission has assigned grants committee board 

member and finance staff to each NSOs to review their application and ensure that they have met the 

specific requirements and provide for accountability and transparency within the boundaries of the 

grant. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation two talks about the setting up of the Commission to address the disputes.  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission is working with the Ministry of Youth and Sports on the Sports 

Integrative Commission.  Due to COVID-19, the timeline on this process has had to be adjusted and 

the Commission looks forward to fast tracking the process, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This includes the work 

already done towards the full ratification, membership to the Council of Europe.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

this  august  House  can  be  rest-assured  that  the  Commission  has  informed  all  national  sporting 

organisations of its move forward in preparation for the requirements for the integrative commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Recommendation three, Mr. Speaker, Sir, generally talks about partnership. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

the Commission has passion other income streams to assist in operational activities and projections.  

</span><span>This  has  included  the  grants  for  example  from  UN  of  $200,000  for  the  inclusion  of  sports  in 

</span><span>mainstream schools.  This grant has seen an increase in the disabled communities participating in 

sports and has had several successes in their own right. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Commission  had  also  aligned  with  and  attracted  funding  from  the  Association  of 

International  Sports  for  All,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  the  other  agencies  for  inclusive  platforms  for 

women and girls in sports.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this aligns well with the National Development Plan.  

Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission is gearing towards expanding its commercial 

sponsorship base with the targeted approach to business houses. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recommendation four, talks about monitoring and evaluation.  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, the Commission has worked hard in this respect and is mindful of the need for effective 

monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanism  to  ensure  proper  returns  for  the  sports  sector  whereby 

Government has invested.  The Commission had in place follow-up programmes and this includes 

</span><span>frameworks to monitor data on our specific sports development programmes. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 56</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – FNSC January 2016-July 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>415 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must be pointed out the investment in sports and returns on it has a social 

and economic component and both are included in the evaluation and evidence based report.  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, this concludes the response to the issues raised and I wish to commend the Committee 

and  its  work  in  highlighting  this  as  a  means  of  further  improving  the  work  of  the  Fiji  Sports 

Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission looks forward to continue its contribution 

</span></p>
<p><span>towards the sports development for all Fijians.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports for his contribution 

</span></p>
<p><span>to the debate.  Honourable Nawaikula you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  would  like  to  make  a  short  contribution,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  

Listening to Honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations and Youth and 

Sports, it looks like that he has been asked by the Government or the Commission to answer to the 

recommendations.  He reads through each of the four recommendations and he tells the House, this 

has been fulfilled so as to paint a good picture of the Fiji Sports Commission or what.  But that is not 

the true picture.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The true picture is that, you have a lot of problems.  We need a lot of development in this 

area.  We are denying our youth, their right to sports and the right to other things because of this.  We 

need to give capacity to this.  The Fiji Sports Commission needs to be improved, that is the story.  

But the law of the debate is that we are to debate the 2016 and 2017 Annual Report.  Let me just, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, go through this and point out some of the notes that are in these Annual Reports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In 2016, I note that in relation to sports grants, there is a note her that the Under 19 Cricket 

Team  participated in  the  ICC Under 19;  FASANOC Team  Preparation for the Olympics and  Fiji 

participated in the World Youth Weightlifting, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   Next to that, there is an important 

note by the Executive Chairman, Peter Mazey, where he says of the need for rural outreach in relation 

to sports.  That is one of the areas where this is lacking.  We need to take sports out to the rural areas, 

and he has correctly identified that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I can tell the Honourable Minister for Youth that all the rural villages need grounds.  Why 

has he not assisted all the villages to have their facilities?  They need playgrounds.  That is one of 

the issues that is being raised here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Going through the 2016 and 2017 Annual Report, let me just take a note of this, on the Sports 

</span><span>Development Unit.  Golden Triangle Sports Association established in Tunuloa, Cakaudrove, where 

sports played a big part in engaging youths who previously cultivated marijuana in that part of Fiji.  

Now we ask, what has happened to that sports association?  It is dead.  It needs to be revived, we 

need to breathe life into it.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we come to the Committee’s recommendations and there are four 

recommendations which had been partially answered by the Honourable Minister for Youth.  The 

first is that, the Commission should strengthen its network and secondly, the Commission should 

ensure that the Sports Integrity Commission is established, and two others.  But the point that I wish 

to make is this, we need to empower them and take it out to the rural areas.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you go to the rural areas, it looks like the concentration is happening only 

in the towns and cities.  In the villages, you know what the old people say, they used to play soccer, 

</span><span>they  used  to  play  cricket  and  they  used  to  have  boxing,  but  they  are  all  dead  now.    Why?    Ask 

</span><span>yourself, why?  And it is now, I feel, the responsibility of the Sports Commission and we need to 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 57</a></p>
<p><span>416 

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – FNSC January 2016-July 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>empower them.  It is serious, we are denying all these to the youth.  We are concentrating on the 

towns and cities and we need to take it out.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I agree, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the champions of this world, the best cricketers are still out there in 

the rural villages somewhere.  And remember that, our champion is Jerry Tuwai, he is not from the 

town, he was brought up in the village.  So we need to empower the Commission, we need to improve 

its legislation to take control of all the sports in Fiji, to regulate it better and even to address what 

Honourable Matanitobua said in relation to insurance.  We need to empower the Commission, we 

need to do a lot and improve it.  That is my contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank Honourable Nawaikula.  The Honourable Gavoka, you have the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just want to also add voice to what 

the Honourable Nawaikula has highlighted and that is the lack of suitable playgrounds in the rural 

areas.  I had a few years with Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) and one of the most contributing factors in 

the development of rugby was the lack of suitable playgrounds.  At one time, two tier one teams in 

the national competition played on a school ground.  I was horrified when I saw that Mr. Speaker, 

</span><span>Sir, and it has always been to me, the most pressing challenge for us in providing the development 

</span><span>of sports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there could have seen more Caucau or Serevi, if we had more 

playgrounds out in the rural areas.   I know we  all remember Caucau, he scored tries without any 

effort.  It was a delight to see Caucau play.  I mean, the loss to the country is that, we are not giving 

them the proper facilities where they can develop their talent.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I am not talking about stadiums, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The FijiFirst Government has promised 

us a lot of stadiums.  I am talking about the improvement to  existing grounds around Fiji.  In my 

province, the Sigatoka Village green can be better prepared for more sports, the Naviti Ground on 

the Coral Coast can also do with the a bit of touch up - drainage, proper grass and a bit of evening 

out on the surface, that is all we need to do.  We do not need to build stadiums as we have been 

promised.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I was driving through parts of Vanua Levu lately and I saw the Wairiki Ground.  Wairiki is 

where they have the Wairiki Sevens, which is a very popular event.  But that ground could do with a 

bit  of  improvement,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  it  would  not  cost  a  lot  of  money,  so  I  would  urge  the 

</span><span>Government to focus on this.  There are grounds already in existence, all they need is a bit more 

</span><span>touch up so that they can be more suitable for the development of sports. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I fully support what the Honourable Nawaikula is saying, grounds being a limiting factor in 

the way we develop our sports, and I would hope that Government will refocus its efforts into these.  

Forget about the big stadiums you have promised us, just do more of the playgrounds in the provinces 

around Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Gavoka  for  his  contribution.    Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Leawere, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise to contribute to the motion on 

the Review of the Fiji National Sports Commission 2016 – 2017 Annual Report and when looking at 

the  Report,  I  would  like  to  touch  especially  on  the  values  on  service  excellence,  and  also  on  the 

</span><span>entitlement that is in this Report.  

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 58</a></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – FNSC January 2016-July 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>417 

</span></p>
<p><span>From  the  outset,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  thank  the  Chairman,  Honourable  Pillay,  and 

Honourable Members of the Committee for this Report.  However, let me bring to the attention of 

this House on the values, as I have said, of the Commission, especially on service excellence. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sports  is  an  integral  part  of  our  lives,  especially  when  we  talk  about 

wellness, fitness and healthy living.  We need to have the experts and finance for the Commission to 

be successful in carrying out its duties and activities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Commission,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  needs  to  be  out  here  and  conduct  more  sports 

development and outreach programmes and especially so, in helping and engaging all our schools in 

the country.  The Commission then will be better placed to provide these statistics in the next annual 

report.    This,  again,  Sir,  will  depend,  to  a  large  extent,  on  staff  morale  which  is  about  service 

excellence, according to the Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016 devastated this country and was still 

reeling from its aftermath.  However, the Fiji National Sports Commission, from this Report, took 

this in its stride and they proceeded with the Rural Sports Outreach Programme and I would like to 

commend them for their dedication.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  begs  the  question  of  the  Commission  to  being  adequately  financed, 

especially its workers and staff.  The heart and soul of the Commission, Sir, are the staff, and we can 

improve their morale if they are appropriately paid.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Page 21, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the Review of the Fiji National Sports Commission as outlined 

in Section D on employment entitlement refers to long annual leave and long service leave.  This is 

what incentivises our workers and the staff on the issue of long service leave. Long service leave, 

Sir,  and  its  allowance  as  specified  in  the  Employment  Relations  Act  is  an  entitlement  where  the 

workers and staff will have their morale boosted if leave allowances are reflected in their employment 

contracts.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report states, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“The Commission does not have any long service policy in place. All employee 

</span></p>
<p><span>entitlement is expected to be used by employees within the fiscal year.”  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a poor show on the Ministry concerned, given the importance of sports 

</span><span>in  our  lives,  that  staff  are  not  paid  long  service  leave  allowances.    But  section  7(59)(1)  of  the 

</span><span>Employment Relations Act on Holidays and Leave is specific in this regard. I call on the Government 

and the Ministry concerned, even though the review is four years down the line, to take note that the 

nuts and bolts of the Commission, that is, the staff, must be given these incentives in recognition of 

their contribution. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to support also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comments made by Honourable Gavoka 

and Honourable Nawaikula on sports grounds. Serua, in the 2019-2020 budgetary allocation, was 

provided for in that Budget but I do not know where it is now. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member. Honourable Chairperson, you have your 

</span></p>
<p><span>right of reply.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I do not have any further comments.
