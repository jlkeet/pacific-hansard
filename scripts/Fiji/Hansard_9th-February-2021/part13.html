<p><span> Review Report – FPTCL 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  ADI  L.QIONIBARAVI.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  contribute  to  the 

motion before the House. I thank the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and 

its Honourable Members for their review report on the 2017 Annual Report of the Fiji Public Trustee 

Corporation Limited, a Government Commercial Company incorporated in 2006 and taking over the 

functions of the Public Trustees Office which was previously under the responsibility of the Ministry 

of Justice, the legal registries under the Administrator-General.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I acknowledge the vision and the foresight of the late Prime Minister, Mr. Qarase and his 

SDL Government for their initiative in carrying out the reform of the Public Trustees Office, from a 

Government Department to what is it today, an incorporated body.  The company is governed by the 

Fiji Public Trustee Corporations Act 2006.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  report  states  that  the  FPTCL  provides  deceased  estate  administration 

services, Wills preparation, trustee services, estate planning services and other legal services to the 

people of Fiji at no cost to Government.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, while it is commendable that there is no cost to Government, this entity has been 

very profitable and generous dividends and returns have been provided to Government. For example, 

</span><span>Government  received  $500,000  for  the  year  ending  2017.  This  has  taken  up  the  total  dividend 

</span><span>received by Government to $5 million in the span of 12 years within the FPTCL.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FPTCL  has  generated  profits  from  fees  for  services  rendered,  in 

accordance with the regulated fees, charges regulations under the Fees Regulations 2008, according 

to the Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FPTCL office did not charge fees from 1968,  when it was established 

to 2006 when it was  corporatized and started making generous profits, which the Government singly 

received a major portion of.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I ask the Honourable Minister and the board to review the charges and 

fees  levied  by  the  FPTCL  in  recognition  of  the  difficult  time  we  face  and  in  particular,  for  the 

impoverished clients of the  Corporation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  terms  of accountability,  I am  sad to  note that this Committee did  not 

receive  submissions  from  clients  of  the  FPTCL.    There  are  complaints  that  there  is  lack  of 

accountability by FPTCL to clients, even in terms of the statement of accounts to clients and how 

</span><span>funds have been spent.  This was changed, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is a most basic rule of governance 

</span><span>that those in charge of our funds must be accountable for how it is expanded and clients should be 

able to request statement of accounts when they need to. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, I now turn to the plight of child beneficiaries of FNPF.  There are questions 

over the amendment to the FNPF Act where funds for beneficiaries under the age of 18 are kept by 

the High Court rather than the FPTCL.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The High Court, Mr. Speaker, Sir, does not invest these funds. I urge the Honourable Minister 

to  review the situation and the best  interest  of the child claimants whether these funds should be 

returned to FPTCL or other entity to invest these funds for the benefits of this child beneficiaries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  apparent  that  the  FPTCL  legislation  needs  urgent  review,  as  the 

Honourable  Attorney-General  had  informed  Parliament  in  August  2019.    For  the  beneficiaries  of 

</span><span>these estates, I urge the Honourable Minister to accelerate the review to conduct consultations and 

</span><span>table the Bill in this august House. 

</span></p>

<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – FPTCL 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>421 

</span></p>
<p><span>I endorse the Standing Committee recommendations that FPTCL must: 

</span></p>
<p><span>(1)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(2)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>(3)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>introduce legal services to address non-core business arising from customer demands; 

</span></p>
<p><span>improves stakeholder relationships and conducting stakeholder training; and   

</span></p>
<p><span>improve  and  strengthen  its  stakeholders  relationships  through  regular  meetings  and 

consultations for optimum service delivery.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition  to  these  recommendations,  may  I  request  the  Social  Affairs 

Committee Chair to also invite clients from the FPTCL to have their say on the performance of the 

Corporation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The board can simply saying improve stakeholders relationship is a Corporate Annual Report 

talk. There seems to be just words on the page rather than actually implemented by the board the 

CEO and all staff of the Corporation exist to serve the public and not itself.  This must start with the 

client relationships and being accountable to clients.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The practice of accountability must be part and parcel of the normal procedure that estate 

</span></p>
<p><span>officers are able to provide this Report to clients upon request.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As alluded to earlier, the fees and charges levied by the FPTCL needs urgent review.  I call 

</span></p>
<p><span>on the Honourable Minister and the board to undertake this review urgently. 

</span></p>
<p><span>May I also remind the Honourable Minister for the review of the legislation. The Honourable 

Attorney-General had informed Parliament that there are many estates in Fiji where family members 

are not able to reach any consensus as to what to do with the property, it is left in a dilapidated state.  

It causes problems for the municipal councils. They do not pay rates and it is an eyesore overall.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, may I also remind the Honourable Minister regarding the management of FNPF 

funds for child beneficiaries, whether the High Court is the appropriate body to manage these funds? 

</span></p>
<p><span>To  conclude,  Sir,  I  agree  that  the  FPTCL  provides  an  important  service  for  the  public,  in 

particular those breadwinners have passed on early.  That is why I recommend that the review of its 

fees, legislation and to be more accountable to its clients.  The Board, CEO and staff must understand 

that they provide a service it must be accountable to those whose funds and property they administer 

</span><span>in trust. Their trust confirms that it is their fiduciary duty that confirms their duty of accountability 

</span><span>to the beneficiaries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  for  those  who  have  not  been  heard,  despite  their  interest  being 

</span></p>
<p><span>apparently paramount in the management of the estates. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank the Committee for their Report. I urge those at the FPTCL Board and the CEO to 

consider  our  recommendations  and  thank  you,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  respond.    </span><span>Vinaka  saka 

vakalevu</span><span>. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member.  I give the floor to the Honourable Ro 

</span></p>
<p><span>Teimumu Kepa to have the floor.  You have the floor, Madam. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Limited 

</span><span>provides services in the management and administration of estates and trusts to those beneficiaries 

</span><span>who have appointed the Fiji Public Trustee to be their administrator and executor.

</span></p>
<p><span> Review Report – FPTCL 2017 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  one  such  lucky  beneficiary,  when  at  16  years  old  my  father  died 

intestate  so I was very well looked after by the Public Trustee.  They also provide legal services and 

financial support.  Looking at the Committee’s recommendation, and I will just point out one, where 

it says that the Corporation must introduce other legal services to address non-core business arising 

from customer demands and in this regard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am looking at that executing of Wills 

and the writing up of Wills.  That is one area that needs to be addressed as many people, even highly 

qualified professionals such as Judges who one would think, would know better are dying intestate, 

that is, no will. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I will just tell a short story here, where this Judge had been telling his family, his wife and 

children that when I die, do not worry, I am not leaving you any money.  So, when he did die, his 

wife, children and his relative knew that he had no money.  Sure enough, when he died, there was no 

will, no money, no fighting.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one case, however not all cases are like that.  What are some of the 

problems with people dying intestate?  That means they left no Will. Google tells us that 70 percent 

of Americans died without a Will.  Sixty (60) percent in the UK, I am just wondering, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, what would be the percentage here in Fiji?  Would it be higher or lower?   

</span></p>
<p><span>I am looking around at our 51 Members of Parliament and your good self, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

70 percent that means 36 MPs with no Will.  I was just asking during the afternoon tea because I see 

our rich people across the floor, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how many of them have Wills. Some of them have, 

some have not.  So, 70 percent is the American number and in the UK, it is 60 percent, which means 

that 31 MPs would be dying with no Wills and 20 would have made their Wills.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir, the advice that is given to us today is, to make sure you write your will.  If you need help, 

go  to  the  Public  Trustee.    You  do  not  want,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  the  cause  of  serious  family 

disagreements  which  can  even  tear  a  family  apart.    Remember,  blood  is  not  thicker  than  water, 

especially when it comes to money.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Looking around this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can smell serious money from that side of 

the House.  Serious money, Mr. Speaker, Sir, especially the Honourable Minister for Agriculture.  I 

went and sat next to him during afternoon tea and I could smell the money in his pockets.  So, there 

you are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anyone wants a loan or anything, you know where to go in this House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  general,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  are  married  with  children  and  you  die  intestate,  your 

</span><span>spouse or your civil partner and children are your beneficiaries.  Not married but with children, shared 

</span><span>equally  amongst  your  children;  if  you  are  not  married  and  have  no  children  everything  is  shared 

equally amongst your many relatives - your parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles.  What 

if you are living with someone, but not married or in a civil partnership?  Under the rules, your partner 

will receive nothing at all, no matter how long you have been living together so I mean that is cause 

for us to think, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The fact of the matter is, you go to Public Trustee, if you need help, so when you die, the 

people  you  love  the  most  will  inherit  your  assets,  so  that  you  are  not  the  cause  for  family 

disagreements or cause of a family feud lasting generations.  I support this motion before the House, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Kepa  for  her  contribution  to  the  debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.

<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – FPTCL 2017 Annual Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>423 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I feel compelled to make a 

</span></p>
<p><span>few comments.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to thank the Committee for their Report and I also would like to thank the Board 

for their work.  Of course, this is a Report dating back to 2017.  Since then, the Board has changed 

and quite a few number of changes have actually taken place within the organisation too.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As rightly observed by Honourable Members from the other side that the Fiji Public Trustee 

Corporation  Limited  does  play  a  very  important  role.    It  has  assisted  a  number  of  families  and 

individuals, in particular when people die intestate, as the Honourable Kepa has highlighted, where 

they die without making a will and it is critically important for people to make a will.  I think a lot of 

people, Honourable Kepa, do not end up writing a will because they think they will not necessarily 

die very soon but as we know that death is inevitable, so we need to be prepared for it at all times.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I  think  the  issue  pertaining  to  the  various  recommendations  and  if  we  look  at  the 

recommendations by the Committee, a lot of it has to do with public awareness and also services to 

be launched and new modes and mediums of reaching out to members of the public, I think that is 

critically important.  Now, as people get lot more technology savvy, the ability for the Fiji Public 

</span><span>Trustee Corporation Ltd to provide online services, withdrawal applications, all of that is currently 

</span><span>being worked on by the current Board and the current management.  The CEO has been there for 

quite some time and he is very much attuned in respect of providing services.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Honourable Qionibaravi had raised the issue about fees for low income families.  The 

Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Ltd  actually  exempts  fees  for  low  income  earners  following  an 

assessment.    This  is  classed  as  a  non-commercial  obligation  with  a  budget  of  $50,000.    Also,  in 

respect of the High Court, money does actually get put in bank accounts so it does earn interest and 

that is how they actually gain some form of revenue on the funds. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Kepa, you may not have been aware of this but we actually amended the Family 

Law  Act  where  </span><span>de  facto</span><span>  relationships  are  also  now  recognised  in  law,  in  particular  for  property 

settlements.  We understand that at the time when the original Family Law Act was drafted, certain 

politicians  were  very  averse  to  the  idea,  as  you  would  know,  Honourable  Kepa  as  you  were  in 

Parliament then.  They were very averse to the idea of recognising </span><span>de facto</span><span> relationships because 

they would have been negatively affected too at that point in time.  We have since then amended the 

Family Law Act where it does recognise </span><span>de facto</span><span> relationships.   

</span></p>
<p><span>One of the points that Honourable Qionibaravi made is, again, on rare occasions where I do 

</span><span>actually agree with her, is the issue of dilapidated buildings.  You will find those in some places in 

Suva and in other parts and townships in Fiji where a number of properties are actually neglected.  I 

remember one at Berry Road, a very well-known property where they had a lot of siblings who were 

actually the beneficiaries of that property.  Some were in overseas, some were here, and even when 

family members lived here, the beneficiaries do not agree as to what to do with the property and the 

building actually deteriorated and it becomes an eyesore.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We  have  actually  been  considering  that  we  need  to,  of  course,  have  lot  more  public 

consultations.  We have looked at some other jurisdictions.  What other countries have done is, after 

a period of time where they give you a time reprieve if you like, if the estate cannot get around to 

making  a  decision  and  the  property  is  within  the  municipality  or  where  it  has  become  a  public 

nuisance issue, then the State can actually step in, sell the property and keep the money in trust for 

those people who are the beneficiaries of that particular estate and then they can sort it out amongst 

</span><span>themselves.  But it gives the State the power to be able to liquidate those assets, keep the liquid assets, 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 65</a></p>
<p><span>424 

</span></p>
<p><span>Questions  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>then subsequently for the beneficiaries of the estate but, at least, that particular property moves along 

and gets developed.  That is how a lot of countries have actually dealt with the situation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The other issue that I also want to highlight very quickly is that wills are also written by Legal 

Aid.  Legal Aid now provides a lot of services in respect of writing of wills and they also provide 

probate assistance to  low income families.  I note that in Recommendation 4, the Committee has 

mentioned about the competition.   So the competition obviously is not just coming from the lawyers 

in terms of drafting the wills, the competition actually also comes from the Legal Aid Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of the work that the Legal Aid does now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, the budget of Legal 

Aid is in access of $5 million a year and they are the largest law firm now, so they do a lot of civil 

work which includes probates, settlement of properties and also the writing up of wills.   

</span></p>
<p><span>With those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for their Report 

</span></p>
<p><span>and support the motion by the Chairman.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Chairperson for his Right of Reply. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Attorney-General and all the Honourable Members 

</span></p>
<p><span>who have spoken on the motion.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote to note the content 

</span></p>
<p><span>of the report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put.
