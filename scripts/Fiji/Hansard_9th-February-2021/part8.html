<h3>REPUBLIC OF FIJI AND SOLOMON ISLANDS  
MARITIME BOUNDARY DELIMITATION AGREEMENT</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move:  

</span></p>
<p><span>That Parliament approves the signing of the Agreement between the Republic 

</span></p>
<p><span>of Fiji and the Solomon Islands concerning their Maritime Boundaries.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This particular Treaty was 

referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  and  the  Standing  Committee  has  come  back  with  its 

recommendation, essentially requesting Parliament to endorse the Agreement for signing by Fiji for 

the ratification. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Just by way of a very brief introduction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations Convention on 

the  Law  of  the  Sea  (UNCLOS)  provides  for  the  legal  principles  for  coastal  States  to  define  their 

maritime  boundaries,  and  to  enjoy  the  rights  and  obligations  set  out  in  UNCLOS,  to  utilise  and 

sustainably manage their resources within their EEZ. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know in particular being maritime countries, that these boundaries 

are critical for governance, security, law enforcement and maritime resource management within a 

country’s maritime zone.  Fiji is progressing in securing and finalising the delimitation of its maritime 

boundaries through negotiation with Pacific Island Countries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    the  Committee  has  actually  discussed  at  length  about  the  benefits  of 

ratifying this particular Agreement, and just by way of brief introduction, I would like to thank the 

Committee  for  this,  and  we  would  like  to  seek  Parliament’s  support  for  the  ratification  of  this 

Agreement.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Jale, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion moved by the Honourable 

Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and Communications.   This really is a 

welcome move.  There are only few countries that Fiji has not been able conclude an agreement with 

in terms of its maritime boundaries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We welcome the move by the Government of the Solomon Islands in Fiji to conclude one.  I 

know that this effort has taken a few years to conclude and negotiate.  I thank the Maritime Affairs 

Coordinating Committee (MACC) which comprise agencies of Government, for meeting, discussing 

and also negotiating with the Solomon Islands on the delineation of the maritime boundary that have 

seen the conclusion of the Agreement. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  stand  here  as  a  Member  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and  Defence  to 

support the motion.  It is only important now that we conclude the maritime boundaries with countries 

that we have not concluded agreements with because it is a matter of securing it.  If we do not secure

<p><span>Republic of Fiji &amp; Solomon Islands  

Maritime Boundary Delimitation Agreement 

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>a border, then other foreign vessels can exploit that.  Solomon Islands and Fiji have concluded and 

agreed to a boundary which will be respected by both countries.  At the moment, we do not have one, 

so that means foreign vessels are coming in and exploiting the resources of the two countries.  So, 

the sooner we put in place this Agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the better for the two countries.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, I thank the Government of Fiji and I thank the MACC for the good work that they 

</span></p>
<p><span>have done to bring us this far.  Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  Honourable  Jale  for  his  contribution.    I  give  the  floor  to  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I stand to actually support the motion, the 

</span></p>
<p><span>signing of the Agreement between Fiji and the Solomon Islands on the maritime boundaries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  among international maritime disputes between States, those concerning 

the  delimitation  of  maritime  boundaries  are  the  most  sensitive  and  these  relate  to  the  extent  of 

sovereignty, sovereign rights over natural resources or jurisdiction of coastal areas concerned.   

It 

has been noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that certain global trends have also increased the emphasis on the 

role of oceans in international affairs, an increase in seaborne trade, and the growing demand for 

marine resources and climate change effects on the oceans and most importantly, the location of those 

resources are all actual factors that have led to a renewed focus on maritime space.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually worth noting from the Report of the Standing Committee, as 

submitted by the Maritime Affairs Coordinating Committee (MACC), that there were no disputes 

between Fiji and the Solomon Islands on the maritime boundaries and hence, the need to agree.  It is 

good information for everyone to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the boundaries actually demarcate the 

sea into different sectors from the baseline to a country’s maritime zone, such as the territorial sea.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are three different versions, they have territorial sea which is 12 nautical miles from 

the  baseline,  the  contiguous  zone  which  is  24  nautical  miles  and  then  you  have  the  Exclusive 

Economic Zone (EEZ) which is 200 nautical miles and to some extent, the actual continental shelf.  

In measuring the 200 nautical miles for Fiji’s EEZ boundary, it was eminent that this was actually 

overlapping with coastal States like the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Tonga, Wallis and Futuna 

and New Caledonia.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has actually concluded and signed Maritime Boundary Agreements of 

its EEZ with Tuvalu, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia. The negotiations are ongoing for the 

conclusion of this boundary agreements with Tonga and Vanuatu.  The agreement between Fiji and 

the Solomon Islands is before us today.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Standing Committee also alluded to sovereign rights and sovereignty.  As indicated in 

the Report, there are two distinctive rights which the Honourable Attorney-General alluded to earlier, 

in terms of the law of the sea which is called the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 

(UNCLOS).  The  application  of  sovereignty  or  sovereign  rights  is  also  dependent  on  the  type  of 

maritime zone, for example.  Sovereignty means that a coastal State actually exercises control over 

territorial  sea  and  no  other  State  can  exercise  concurrent  sovereignty,  unless  international  law  or 

UNCLOS prescribes.  As opposed to sovereign rights, UNCLOS provides that a coastal State has 

sovereign rights in the EEZ for the purposes of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the 

natural resources whether living or non-living.

</span></p>
<p><span>Republic of Fiji &amp; Solomon Islands  

Maritime Boundary Delimitation Agreement 

</span></p>
<p><span>379 

</span></p>
<p><span>The overlapping EEZ boundary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, between Fiji and the Solomon Islands is 

actually settled through a principle called, “the equidistant principle”. That basically means equal 

distance from both countries of EEZ through a median line which is calculated from the base points 

of the respective countries and there is no dispute concerning this particular demarcation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the reasons why I stood up and spoke on this particular issue is that 

maritime boundaries and its zones are important to the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 

Transport,  as  this  actually  affects    the  safety  of  ships  and  navigation;  aids  to  navigation,  what  is 

commonly  known  as  ATONs,  such  as  lighthouses  or  landmarks;  anchorage    of  vessels;  wreck 

removals;  types  of  licences  to  be  issued  in  terms  of  the  ships  travelling  within  the  actual  zones; 

seafarer  certification;  duties  of  Flag  States;  reduction  and  control  of  pollution;  the  maritime 

environment  for vessels and enforcements and also  in terms of cross border trade, what is considered 

as domestic export is also dependent on the clear demarcation of maritime boundaries. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agreement, obviously, will have no financial implication or place any 

financial implication on Fiji.  The endorsement and execution of this Agreement will contribute to 

improving  governance,  security,  law  enforcement  and  the  management  of  the  marine  resources 

</span><span>within the EEZ.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House and the signing of the Agreement 

</span></p>
<p><span>between Fiji and the Solomon Islands.  I thank you, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution to the debate.   I give 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Leader of the Opposition, you have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I rise, not only in support 

of the motion but also in raising some concerns that have recently been alluded to by the Honourable 

Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport just a while ago.  The concern is really to do 

with the positioning of the maritime boundaries and how that relates to the ocean shelf.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I understand we used to have a problem with the Kingdom of Tonga because of the way the 

ocean shelf was structured, it was kind of protruding towards Tonga and Fiji.  The Government at 

that time thought that, that was part of the boundary as well but then it was well within the Tongan 

boundary as well.  I understand where the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 

Transport is  coming from, relating to the position and the distance from  some kind of  an aligned 

</span><span>agreement that has been imposed to ensure that there is no conflict.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again,  the  other  concern  that  we  have  on  this  side  of  the  House  is  under  sea  mining.    I 

understand a company that operates in Papua New Guinea, Nautilus had done some exploration rights 

in the boundary between Vanuatu and Fiji.  I heard from the Honourable Minister for Commerce, 

Trade, Tourism and Transport that, that is another boundary that is still to be finalised.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Again, sea mining has been successfully done there, the exploration side of it but these are 

some of the issues that we are concerned about because it affects the resources that we have, whether 

it is under the sea or on the land.  Secondly, when we determine boundaries such as this, the marine 

boundaries, how does that relate to the air space?  I mean, the sovereignty of the country.  I do not 

know whether the Air Services Agreement with the Solomon Islands is still outstanding or has it been 

successfully negotiated.  Does that, in any way, connected to the maritime boundary that we now 

have before us here?  These are some of the concerns that we would like to raise, Sir.  Thank you.

<p><span>Paris Declaration – Amendments to ISA Framework Agreement  

</span></p>
<p><span>9th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leader of the Opposition for his contribution to 

</span></p>
<p><span>the debate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Since  there  is  no  one  else  wishing  to  take  the  floor,  I  give  the  floor  to  the  Honourable 

</span></p>
<p><span>Attorney-General to speak in reply.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to thank all the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members who have spoken in support of that. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of issues. The Air Services Agreement, a completely different 

cattle of fish, if you like, because it has no correlation with the maritime boundaries.  Then, of course, 

the Air Services Agreement is all about aviation travel itself in terms of the number of flights and the 

number of seats available.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In respect of the issue that the Honourable Leader of Opposition talked about on Tonga, that 

is the Minerva Reef issue which, of course, Tonga disputes because of the continental shelf issue.  At 

one point in time, New Zealand also had some interest because of the stretching of that continental 

shelf, coming northwards from New Zealand.  That I think, will require a lot of negotiations.  We 

</span><span>have already lodged our baseline with UNCLOS regarding that and that has to be resolved through 

</span><span>the UNCLOS mechanism.   

</span></p>
<p><span>But of course, as it has been highlighted in respect to Solomon Islands, there has been no 

dispute as such. We are fully aware of our boundaries. This is essentially now just puts that agreement 

in  place  as  a  ratification  now  and  the  formal  recognition  of  those  boundaries.    Indeed,    the 

enforcement of those boundaries because it also helps us to be able to collaborate, in particular now 

with things like human trafficking, fishing and movement of cargo, et cetera, those  all have an impact 

in respect of our ability to enforce and also to gain revenue both, for Solomon Islands and also for 

Fiji .  

</span></p>
<p><span>Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  and  the  Solomon  Islands  authority  and  we  look 

</span></p>
<p><span>forward to the ratification of this particular Agreement.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  for  the  right  of  reply.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Motion agreed to. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil 

</span></p>
<p><span>Service and Communications, the Honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, to move his motion.
