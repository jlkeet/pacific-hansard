<body><h3>SPEAKER’S RULING</h3><p>Urgent Oral Question – Metformin Tablets</p><p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a received an Urgent Oral Question from 

the Honourable  Qereqeretabua with respect to a shortage of Metformin tablets.  I will now proceed 

to give my ruling with respect to the Urgent Oral Question.</p><p>I refer Honourable Members to two previous Speaker’s Rulings, one made on Monday, 24th</p><p>April, 2017 and the second on 22nd May, 2017, both on the issue of medicine shortage.</p><h4>Presentation of Reports of Committees</h4><p>Honourable  Members,  I  wish  to  clarify  that  Standing  Order  43(1)  provides,  firstly,  that  a 

written copy of the question must be delivered to the Secretary-General one hour before the sitting 

in which the question will be asked.   I can confirm that this was adhered to.  Secondly, the Question 

must be of an urgent character and relates to a matter of public importance and which the Speaker 

must decide whether the question satisfies the requirement of urgency and public importance.</p><p>Honourable Members, putting it another way, did something happened in the last two to three 

days that meant that an Honourable Member would not have been able to submit the Question within 

the processes for Oral Questions?</p><p>Honourable  Members,  with  respect  to  the  Urgent  Oral  Question  by  the  Honourable 

Qereqeretabua, I believe that the Question is of national importance but it does not relate to a specific 

issue, or an event that had occurred in the past two or three days before the sitting.</p><p>I am satisfied that the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services had sufficiently 

addressed the shortage of Metformin tablets on 15th February, 2021 and the Honourable Minister 

even confirmed that the shortage is a global concern and not only for Fiji.  Therefore, we will leave 

the matter at that.</p><p>Honourable Members, I trust that this clarifies the  matter for Honourable Members and  in 

that  regard,  the  Urgent  Oral  Question  submitted  by  the  Honourable  Qereqeretabua  is  disallowed 

under Standing Order 43(1).   Honourable Members, I must reiterate that Urgent Oral Questions must 

fully  satisfy  the  requirements  clearly  provided  for  under  Standing  Order  43(1).    Thank  you 

Honourable Members.</p></body>
