<p>Quality Control Measures - Fiji Roads Authority 

(Question No. 68/2021)</p>
<p>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 

Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  quality  control  measures  used  by  the  Fiji  Roads 

Authority in the improvement of roads around the country?</p>
<p>HON.  J.  USAMATE  (Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and 

Mineral Resources).- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, and thank you to the Honourable Member for the 

question and for stepping in for the Honourable Gavoka.</p>
<p>Our quality control of roads and the improvement of roads:  The Fiji Roads Authority, which 

has the responsibility for the road network for almost around 7,000 kilometres, bridges, streetlights 

and jetties has had in place its quality control measures to try to ensure the quality of the assets thatit has.</p>
<p>Page 89</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>931</p>
<p>In doing this, there are a number of things that it looks at and tries to do:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Have  standards  in  place,  so  it  tries  to  establish  quality  control  through  standards, 

mechanisms  in  place.  One  phase  is  the  compliance  to  the  road  work  standards  and 

specifications.  These  standards  and  specifications  list  all  the  vital  elements  in  which 

compliance is required in order to maintain the level of quality that is required in terms of 

general  construction  standards  for  Occupational  Health  and  Safety  (OHS),  for 

environmental management, quality assurance for traffic management, or quality control 

and testing,  for clearing  and grubbing, rock-filled stabilisation of  earthwork  materials, 

materials from road construction and all the nitty gritty details of ensuring conformance 

and standards - having these standards in place;</p>
<p>Ensure  that  hired  contractors  adhere  to  the  status.  FRA  ensures  that  they  engage 

contractors who produce works of quality and accuracy of detail to the requirements of 

the  specifications  and  drawings.    In  relation,  they  ensure  that  they  bring  on  board 

contractors that have the type of experienced workers, foremen, surveyors, et cetera, and 

other technical staff together with the right equipment and instruments to ensure that the 

contractor can deliver the kind of work that is needed.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Expect the engaged contractor to be carrying out all the examination and testing of the 

materials that they use in accordance with the requirements on the specifications.</p>
<p>(4)Making use of the numerous tools that they have.  Such tools as the technical review of 

FRA road standards, the FRA standard for drain requirements, the Code of Practice for 

temporarily  traffic  management,  the  manual  for  traffic  signs  and  markings  and  many 

more similar guides that the FRA uses to guide and ensure quality control.</p>
<p>This  is  important  as  they  provide  initial  guides  or  clarification  to  its  specific  design 

information and procedures.  The various systems, processes in place are all to ensure that Fiji has 

the best possible roads that we can have.</p>
<p>The  other  area  that  is  also  addressed  in  terms  of  quality  control  is  to  raise  awareness.  By 

ensuring  quality  services,  they  are  also  proactive  on  social  media  throughTwitter,  FacebookandInstagram  onpublic  awareness  on  road  blocks.  This  is  done  to  ensure  that  the  travelling  public 

manage their travel time to minimise delays of congestion as much as possible.</p>
<p>The fourth element they try to do in managing control of the quality is to set their own capacitywithin  FRA  in terms of getting the right people to do the job that is required within  FRA.  These 

people  with  the  right  knowledge,  the  right  experience,  right  qualifications,  people  who  are  well-

versed  with  the  overall  management,  contractual  obligations,  the  time  and  costs,  aspects  of  the 

contracts planning and executing, the implementation of the work discipline, on-site and off-site and 

also we were able to manage the various complexities that are involved in managing the development 

of roads.</p>
<p>The fifth aspect that they use is quality control in trying to enhance better quality data to work 

with the project that they do, enhancement of their GIS base system that registers all of their assets 

and plays a key role in prioritising maintenance, renewals and new road construction.  I think that in 

a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are major components of the things that FRA tries to use to enhance 

the quality of the assets that they are expected to maintain and develop. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister. Honourable Nawaikula, you have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>Page 90</p>
<p>932</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Could the Honourable Minister explain  why  with all those, we</p>
<p>still have so many potholes and even lovo holes?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There are two aspects of roads:  You 

have to have roads that you need to maintain to keep them up to a level where they do not disintegrate.  

As roads begin to disintegrate much more, that road has to be totally rehabilitated. Some of the roads 

that we are having  now in  Fiji where there are a lot of potholes, these roads have gone past their 

service ability lifespan. They need to be totally rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have quite a number of these roads. So when we have a lot of these roads 

around what we need to do at FRA, because they do not have all the contractors and the funds at all 

times to rehabilitate all roads, they will  have a planned programme to rehabilitate some and those 

that they are not going to rehabilitate immediately, they try to patch them up until they come to the 

time  when  they  can  rehabilitate.    For  instance,  this  week  I  heard  some  questions  about the  roads 

between,  is  it  Ba  and  Tavua?    That  particular  stretch  of  road,  FRA  has  got  the  plan  to  get  the 

contractor on board by the month of May. So in the meantime, what they do before they await thetime they are completed, their rehabilitate the roads.  That means they rip everything up, and fix thewhole road, in the meantime, they will do some small patch-ups on the potholes that are there.</p>
<p>There are some other places where you have some potholes after they have done the resealing 

then there are some small potholes that crack up. Those ones they also have a planned approach to 

try and remedy those potholes that they come up with.</p>
<p>I think the intention over the long term is to completely eradicate all potholes, to build the 

roads up to a standard where we do not have that.  But it is going to take some time  because the 

surface of the roads for some of the roads that we do have, are in conditions that we just basically 

have to rehabilitate the whole thing.  Ultimately, over the long term we need to have a number of 

plans, for example, for the seal roads, we make sure that we can bring up a better standard where we 

can remove all of the potholes.  For unsealed roads, we are to bring them up to a certain standard.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the meantime while the potholes that are there, as much as possible, we 

do not want to keep spending a  lot of money on potholes  but if we have to rehabilitate lengths of 

roads, you cannot rehabilitate all at once, you rehabilitate that much, the rest you keep on filling the 

potholes that you think you can rehabilitate the rest of the road. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Minister.  Honourable Peceli Vosanibola.</p>
<p>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My supplementary question to 

the Honourable Minister; can the Honourable  Minister advise Parliament on the timeline or plans 

towards the periodic maintenance of public roads on the maritime islands of Kadavu, Lakeba, Vanua 

Balavu, Gau and Ovalau?</p>
<p>HON. J. USAMATE.- Is that the maintenance of roads or the completion of the roads that are</p>
<p>being developed now?</p>
<p>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA.- The periodic maintenance.</p>
<p>HON. J. USAMATE.- The periodic maintenance is periodic.  That means it is planned. Theperiodic maintenance will be carried out because it is periodic, whether it is done quarterly, monthly,</p>
<p>Page 91</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>933</p>
<p>it is planned and those periodic maintenance will be done according to the period in which they are 

planned.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, we will move on.</p>
