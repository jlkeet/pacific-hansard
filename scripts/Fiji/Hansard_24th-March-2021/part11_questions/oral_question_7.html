<p>Co-operatives Concept Linkage to Livelihood Programmes 

(Question No. 71/2021)</p>
<p>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport explain 

how the co-operatives concept is linked with other livelihood programmes under the MSME 

Fiji or other Government initiatives?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Thank you, Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir. I thank the Honourable Govind for his question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in times of crises and economic strife, this co-operative model of business 

essentially entails pooling our best resources, be it our human resources, finance, infrastructure and 

equipment,  it  can  be  a  solution  towards  establishing  commercially  viable  income  generatingbusinesses. This is especially relevant to the rural and the grassroots communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>We currently have more than about 400 or so co-operatives which continue to increase on a 

weekly basis through new registrations and this is a very positive thing and they can be found in all 

the divisions even in some of the most remote places in Fiji, Sir.</p>
<p>I am happy to report, Sir, that the co-operative industry has more than $132 million worth of 

assets and was able to earn about $17.7 million in revenue despite the current economic situation so 

these are good numbers and they can only get better, Sir. Today, we have close to 25,000 Fijians who 

are actually members of co-operatives, Sir.</p>
<p>What we must also remember, Sir, is that the function of co-operatives is actually based on 

six  key  values  of  self-help,  self-responsibility,  democracy,  quality,  equity  and  solidarity.    Co-

operatives  at  the  moment  are  operating  through  so  many  different  sectors  and  is  not  limited  towholesale, retail agriculture, fisheries services, financial transport and real estate.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given our Pacific way of life and our way of communal living,  these co-

operative  business  models  are  very  much  suited  to  the  way  we  actually  live.    In  Fiji,  there  is  a 

minimum requirement of 10 people to form a co-operative and as recognised there was a legal entity, 

and automatic  it brings its natural benefits such as being able to access finance and going to contracts 

et cetera, and transparency and training to name a few.</p>
<p>A  number  of  co-operatives,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  been  able  to  access  Government 

Livelihood Programmes.  For example, through the Ministry, more than 25 co-operatives have been 

assisted  through  various  grassroot  grant  programmes  and  specifically  talking  about  the  human 

resources,  development  programme  and  national  export  strategy  and  MSME  Concessional  Loans 

which amount to close to about $1.4 million.</p>
<p>Just last week, Sir, unfortunately, I was unable to go, but the team has actually returned from 

Yacata Island after handing over a boat engine and a solar freezer to a co-operative in Yacata as part 

of their income generation aspiration.</p>
<p>The  Department of  Co-Operative  has  been  working  closely  also  just to  fortify  what  I  had 

mentioned earlier, so we are working closely with resource-based Ministries such as the Ministry forAgriculture, Ministry for Fisheries, Ministry for Forestry and Ministry  for Sugar and developmentpartners to also form co-operatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the actual structure of these co-operatives, they are able to access 

these livelihood programmes under other ministries as well as donor agency support.  For example, 

through various farm mechanisation programmes with the Ministry of Agriculture, co-operatives are 

able to receive tractors, et cetera and this is on a one-third, two-thirds basis.</p>
<p>Additionally, Sir, you will  notice  in sugar cane  belt areas, if  you ventured that way a  little 

while ago, there are boom in sugar cane harvesters.  Most of these harvesters are actually owned by 

co-operatives and the Ministry of Sugar introduced a Government grant for the purchase of the sugar 

cane harvesters a few  years ago whereby they would give $90,000 as grants to co-operatives who 

would use this grant as equity funding with the Fijian Development Bank to obtain a loan in order to 

purchase sugar cane harvesters.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  actually  seeing  this  today    because  the  Government  has  actually 

placed a strong emphasis more on service and value addition and resource-based co-operatives rather 

than just a simple consumer store.</p>
<p>I  am  not  claiming  that  co-operatives  are  actually  a  panacea  to  all  our  businesses  and 

entrepreneurship aspirations  but  it  is a  model that the Ministry actively promotes to empower the 

grassroot  community  and  the  right  to  economic  participation  which  is  guaranteed  under  the 

Constitution, Sir.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau, you</p>
<p>have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  TheiTaukeiAffairs  Fund  is  currently  conducting  business 

initiatives  amongst  someiTaukeicommunities.    Are  there  any  collaborative  efforts  between  the 

Ministry and theiTaukeiAffairs Fund on the current initiative? If not, are there plans for that?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>939</p>
<p>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  I  think  when  I  answered  Honourable  Kuridrani  a  little  earlier,  that 

answered the question that we collaborate with all ministries and we do not specifically go out and 

just look at one community; the whole of Fiji and every single ministry we do collaborate with them.</p>
<p>You  would  know  this  also,  Sir,  that  in  terms  of  the  representation  in  the  co-operative 

population, quite a few of them are actually based in the rural areas and that means there is a whole 

lot moreiTaukeipeople involved in it.  It is not about selectively looking at one particular community. 

We serve everyone but just by numbers, then at the end of the day because there is a village setting 

et cetera, there are a whole lot of co-operatives.  But yes, your answer to collaboration, we collaborate 

with all the ministries.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on.  Honourable Members, that brings to an</p>
<p>end the Oral Questions for today.</p>
