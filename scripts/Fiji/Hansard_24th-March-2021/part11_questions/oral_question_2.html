<p>Status of the New Ba Hospital 

(Question No. 66/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on</p>
<p>the current status of the new Ba Hospital?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Mr. Speaker, 

Sir,  I   thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  that  question  because  we  aware  the  Fijian  Government 

signed the Concession Agreement for the upgrading, development, operation and maintenance of the 

Lautoka  and  Ba  Hospitals  with    Health  Care  Fiji  (HCF)  which  is  the  ownership  is  Fiji  National 

Provident Fund (FNPF) 80 percent shareholdings and the remaining 20 percent is owned by Aspen 

Medical Limited.</p>
<p>Aspen Medical will be the operator of the hospital under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) 

and the company has wide range experience in delivering solution for hospital related activities and 

the management in delivery of health care.  It is also a trusted global provider, hospital staffing and 

management solutions including assisting clients to set the correct strategic direction, address specific 

operation, clinical needs and to develop in delivering the new operating models.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  Public  Private  Partnership  Agreement,  the  Clinical  Serviceswould  be  provided  and  this  includes  specialist  outpatient  services,  emergency  services,    Dialysis, 

Cardiac Catheterization, Cardiovascular Surgery, Adult  Intensive Care, Paediatrics Intensive Care, 

High Dependency Care, Coronary Care, Neonatal Care, Chemotherapy, Medical Oncology, Internal 

Medicine, Gastroenterology, Trauma Orthopaedic Stress Management, Gynaecology, Diabetes Care, 

Paediatrics, Burns and Plastic Surgery, to name a few.  These services are tied to very specific key 

performance parameters.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the Health Care Fiji (HCF) Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Annette Owttrim  is 

now in the country after going through the quarantine process. She has been meeting our Ministry of 

Health Medical Services officials and the Ministry of Economy team and has mobilised their team to 

progress work on the Public Private Partnership.  We all know  that PPP is the first of its kind and 

planning is vital before the operations begin.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruption, including the ability for themto actually begin last year as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and her staff were not able to come</p>
<p>Page 84</p>
<p>926</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>through. As such, operation details are currently been discussed  with Government and Heath Care 

Fiji and plans are in place to progress the project with the opening of the Ba Hospital Operation in 

the second half of 2021. This should be followed by the Lautoka Hospital.</p>
<p>It is now equally important, Mr. Speaker, that project design in corporate health standards a 

new  trend  driven  by  the  COVID-19  concerns.    The  National  Health  Capability  Development  and 

capacity building will be at the forefront of the partnership.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, the presence of the Health Care Fiji Chief Executive Officer in the country is 

an indication that work has progressed and it just a matter of time when this project will be fully large 

and significantly uplift the provision of tertiary care in the country.</p>
<p>Under its leadership working with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the Public 

Private Partnership when implemented and beyond the requirements of the concession agreement but 

without detracting from the contractual intended specified requirement of the agreement to further 

the  PPP  will  benefit  everyone.    For  instance,  training  and  capacity  building  programmes  will  be 

implemented not only  for the health care Fiji  staff  but there will  be opportunities  for wider health 

community nurses, doctors and other health professionals.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intention of this company HCF to develop training models with FNU 

and the Learned Medical Colleges in Australia and New Zealand for post-graduate medical training.  

I hear that already discussions are happening with the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in this 

respect. At present, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is limited formal post-graduate training programmes for 

nurses  in  Fiji.    HCF  is  working  with  FNU  and  the  University  of  Fiji  in  the  development of  post-

graduate  nursing  programmes  in  acute  nursing  such  as  Emergency  Nursing,  Operating  Theatre 

Nursing, Intensive Care Nursing, Paediatric Nursing, Orthopaedic Nursing and Specialist Surgical 

Nursing.</p>
<p>This training will  be conducted on a job through expatriatesâ€™ clinical educators within this 

area.    HCF  has  also  signed  an  MOU  with  a  major  Australian  university  who  would  be  bringing 

Australian students to Lautoka and Ba Hospitals for clinical placements in areas of general nursing, 

midwifery  and  para-medicine.    In  exchange  for  access  to  clinical  placement,  the  university  will 

provide on-site training to our staff and HCF nursing staff in addition to that by health care Fiji.</p>
<p>The upskilling of both medical and nursing staff will then carry on into the paramedical area 

where paramedical  border will  be  looked  in, that could  be  implemented not just in the support ofLautoka  and  Ba  Hospitals  but  also  to  provide  outreach  services.    Increased  allied  health  andparamedical skills capacity within Fiji will further enhance the Fiji health system and help support 

within  Fiji  their  safety  to travel  which  can  be  used  for  marketing  to the  tourist  sector to  increase 

economic growth.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  will  be  significant  upskilling  for  health  staff.    There  will  be 

engagement  with  social  enterprises  within  Fiji  to  attract  and  train  disadvantaged  people  for 

employment by HCF.  This model is used within Australia and HCF will be taking the lessons learnt 

from these engagements to ensure positive outcome for these persons.</p>
<p>Employment opportunities exists in areas such as laundry services, catering services, potter 

services and other services will also be explored.  Basic financial and other skills based training will 

also be provided to this person.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  HCF  is  exploring  employment  models  to  support  those  personnel  whocannot seek employment because they have young children and limited social-support to allow them</p>
<p>Page 85</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>927</p>
<p>to work.  These models will consider opportunities for their children to attend the on-site Child Care 

Centre  with  potential  volunteering  for  one  day  by  the  person  in-lieu  of  payment  for  Child  Care 

Services.  This model will assist in breaking the cycle of poverty for some disadvantage persons and 

provide opportunities for meaningful engagement in the workforce and society.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  we  want to  get the  PPP  project  done  and  done  right  and  apart  from  the 

capacity  building  in  employment  opportunities  within  health  care,  the  local  community  will  be 

engaged to ensure that capacity developed within Fiji and there is creation of new job opportunities.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, examples of this will be mentoring of personnel within the hospital to enable 

career  progression  and  appointment  through  to  executive  level  positions,  engagement  of  local 

contractors,  development  of  cadetships  for  ICT  graduates,  the  support,  the  implementation  and 

ongoing management of the health management system, the enterprise resource planning in human 

capital  management  system  as  well  as  other  systems  and  the  use  of  local  hotels  with  access 

accommodation capacity for many hotel service delivery.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only the PPP Lautoka and Ba Hospitals will ensure improved service 

and  better  value  for  money,  there  would  be  increased  economic  benefit  and  increase  skills  andcapacity within Fiji.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Niko Nawaikula you have</p>
<p>the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Can the Honourable Minister clarify whether hospital equipment 

were moved from Ba Hospital including hospital beds to Keiyasi for show during the opening of that 

hospital?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- There was no show. The beds that were in Ba Hospital are 

the beds of the Ministry of Health.  They were purchased but because we were worried about the 

lock-downs  of  COVID-19  happening  in  the  West  and  the  cases  that  was  springing  up  in  Ba  and 

Rakiraki,  we  prepared  that  hospital  with  consultation  with  our  PPP  partner  HCF  as  a  possible 

isolation facility.  That is why we took those new beds and put it there.</p>
<p>Once  that  is  being  cleared,  we  were  then  able  to  bring  the  beds  back  to  where  they  were 

intended for and that is the new Navosa Hospital.   That is why we took those new beds and put it 

there.    Once  that  is  being  cleared,  we  were  then  able  to  bring  the  beds  back  to  where  they  wereintended for and that is the new Navosa Hospital.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Is that a supplementary question?</p>
<p>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Supplementary  question.    Thank  you  for  the  explanation 

Honourable Minister.  Can you explain what are the plans for the current physical facilities for Ba 

Hospital and are there any plans for the staff in relation to the new initiative - PPP?  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first thing I want to say is in relation to 

the staff.  The staff have been advised, both Lautoka and Ba Hospitals that they could actually transit 

into the health care Fiji or if they wish to remain within the Ministry of Health, then we will repurpose 

them to other facilities.  That also will work well, for example, we may have the capacity to keep onincreasing our outreach health services, but certainly that is up to the individual staff.  They will sign</p>

<p>individual  contracts  with  the  company  first.    The  second  part  of  the  question,  if  I  remember 

correctlyâ€¦</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- He can only ask one.</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Alright, only one, thank you.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  We  move  on  to  the  third  Oral  Question  for  today.    I  now  call  on  the</p>
<p>Honourable Member to ask his question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
