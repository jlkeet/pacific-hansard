<p>Emergency Services Outside the Three Main Hospitals 

(Question No. 65/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. NAND asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on</p>
<p>the Ministry’s plan to provide emergency services outside the three main hospitals?</p>
<p>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE (Minister for Health and Medical Services).- Mr. Speaker,</p>
<p>Sir. I thank the Honourable Member for that question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, for over 10 years now the Ministry has been consistently working on improving 

the specialist field of emergency medicine in Fiji to elevate the standards of services provided at our 

Emergency  Department  in  our  main  hospitals,  as  well  as  our  sub-divisional  hospitals  and  health 

centres that deal with emergency cases on a regular basis. I know that all of us here could have had 

our loved ones taken to Emergency Departments and also remember that 10 year or15 years ago, the</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Emergency  Department  in  CWM  was  once  called  the  “Causality  Department”  and  that  actually 

changed.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  focus  has  been  on  developing  and  up-skilling  the  workforce  in  emergency 

medicine,  upgrading  equipment  and  medical  appliances  for  the  Department  and  addressing  the 

infrastructure and requirements to effectively deliver the services.</p>
<p>We  have  also  collaborating  with    the  Fiji  National  University  for the  establishment of  the 

Post-Graduate Training in Emergency Medicine for specialist doctors as we believe that having local 

specialists  will  drive  the  development  that  we  envision  for  health.  The  initial  Post-Graduate 

Programmes that the Fiji National University the former Fiji School of Medicine initially was in the 

five main areas for surgery - anaesthesia, obstetric, gynaecology, internal medicine and paediatrics.</p>
<p>As  time  went  on  emergency  medicine  was  actually  introduced  than  five  years  ago,  Mr. 

Speaker, we did not have any local specialist in Emergency Medicine. Now, after all the training, we 

have six specialists present in the Ministry with three employed by Fiji National University, leading 

the training in education of emergency doctors, two of the specialists are now based in CWM and 

one at the moment, is temporarily at Sigatoka Hospital.</p>
<p>In addition, five doctors have just completed their Masters Degree in Emergency Medicine at 

FNU and are undergoing supervision for specialist registration.  Sir, they have done the four years 

and they are doing another two or three years in terms of their supervision and peer review.  At the 

moment, another 21 doctors are currently undertaking Post-Graduate training to become specialists 

in  the  field  of  emergency  medicine  in  the  near  future.  Training  courses  are  also  available  to 

Emergency Department nurses and other support staff to upgrade their knowledge and skills in the 

care of patients in this department.</p>
<p>The Ministry is also upgrading Emergency Departments at the main divisional hospitals given 

their role as the main centres for specialist emergency medicine care, as well as their supporting role 

for the small facilities in the respective divisions.  The Labasa Hospital Emergency Department in 

2009 and 2010 with the support of KOICA had repairs and renovations of about FJ$1.4 million.  In 

Lautoka, this was $12.7 million in the whole repairs which included Emergency Department and it 

was opened in 2017 and last year, more than $750, 000 was the repairs and renovations done at the 

Emergency Department at CWM Hospital.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  is  also  invested  in  upgrading  equipment  and  appliances  and  set  aside  thebudgetary allocation each year to purchase and repair equipment and appliances for the department.2021  has  been  particularly  difficult  in  getting  the  medical  equipment  and  appliances  needed  - 

adequately sorted due to the global disruption of supply chain for medical equipment and appliances.  

Despite all that, the Ministry will be able to do this.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  is  remodelling  it  service  provision  model  with  the  great  focus  on  outreach 

services. The Emergency Medicine  speciality  has now begun to station specialists  in a  number of 

target health facilities around the country. We now have an Emergency Medicine Specialist attached 

at the Nausori Subdivision Hospital, the Valelevu Health Centre, Sigatoka Subdivisional Hospital, 

Makoi Health Centre and Nakasi Health Centre and their role is to facilitate the standardisation of 

Emergency  Care  and  critical  interventions,  such  as  early  thrombolysis  of  heart  attacks  at  the 

peripheral  facilities so that the same standard of care that is delivered  in the  main  hospital  is also 

provided in the smaller referral hospitals.</p>
<p>Emergency  Medicine  Doctors  have  also  joined  outreach  and  FEMAC  teams  providing</p>
<p>support and assistance post-disaster to Serua/Namosi, Nadroga/Navosa, Ra, Tailevu and in Vanua</p>

<p>Levu.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the Ministry continues to support Workforce Development efforts and Fiji 

National University (FNU) has commenced Post-Graduate training for emergency medicine this year 

at Lautoka Hospital which was also a step forward.</p>
<p>The Ministry  is pleased to note that the Government commitment effort  in developing the 

services  in  Fiji  is  bearing  fruit  and  we  are  looking  forward  to  achieve  its  vision  in  Emergency 

Medicine Specialists at the most significant health facilities around the country to be able to deal with 

emergency cases.</p>
<p>I thank the Honourable Member for that question and I thank you, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on.</p>
