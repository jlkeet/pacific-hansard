<p>Installation of CCTV Cameras - Urban Centres(Question No. 70/2021)</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development update Parliament on the status of the installation of CCTV cameras around the 

urban centres?</p>
<p>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR  (Minister  for  Local  Government,  Housing  and  Community 

Development).- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your permission I would like to clarify a comment made by 

Honourable Tabuya to the response to the Ministerial Statement on the NFA Integrated Community 

Firewarden and Emergency Response Framework.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Tabuya had claimed that National Fire Authority is charging 

for  services  for  uninsured  properties.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  of  now  NFA  has  never  received  any 

payment for cost incurred in attending to any uninsured property fire.  Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, in an 

audit by the Office of the Auditor-General as a matter of emphasis in the audit report, it was statedthat the owners of properties that are not insured are liable to pay to the NFA reasonable costs andexpenses  incurred  in providing  firefighting services as per section 33(e) of National Fire Services 

Act.</p>
<p>Therefore,  Mr. Speaker,  Sir, this  particular  family  mentioned  by  Honourable  Tabuya  who 

lives in Makoi was not asked to pay for NFA and they did not pay a single cent to NFA.  I can confirm 

that NFA...</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  The  Point  of  Order  is  that the  Honourable  Minister  is  misleading 

Parliament.  I had met with the family and I can verify that on the same night I called the CEO for 

the National Fire Authority who had said at that time they were not charging for it, but they however 

did come to me a few weeks later to say that they had to pay an amount.  That they had been pursued 

to pay for that amount.</p>
<p>So, that is the undertaking, they gave to me.  Now, unless she is saying otherwise that she has 

met with that family and they did not receive that, then she is misleading Parliament Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.  That was the undertaking that they gave to me.  Now, she is saying Mr. Speaker, Sir, that never 

been paid...</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You have made your point.  The rest of us take account of what she has</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank  you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  NFA confirmed that there was a  fire 

incident in Makoi on 20th October, 2020 and they did attend to the emergency but there was no cost 

charged to the family.  The cause of the fire was electrical overloading and NFA is emphasising that 

there is a provision in the law, which is very clear that they have to charge under Section 33(e) butthey have not been charging anyone.  No one has paid any money to NFA on uninsured property.That is the information I have.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to clarify that.  Now, moving on to the question that Honourable Tabuya has 

asked.  I want to thank her Mr. Speaker, Sir, for her question.  Now, CCTV cameras are installed to 

create safer environment for our people and to deal with the issue of vandalism in towns and cities.  

These cameras also increase people’s perception of safety and the use of public places.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total number of cameras currently installed by municipal councils are 

229 and the number of CCTV cameras yet to be installed are more than 56.  The councils are putting 

these  cameras  in  and  around  council  properties  such  as  markets,  kiosks,  and  parks  and  in  certain 

streets.  The councils are working closely with Fiji Police Force in deciding the location of camera 

installation and monitoring of live-feed.</p>
<p>I would like to reiterate that this initiative has been undertaken to ensure council properties 

and people are safe.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, some councils are currently in discussion with the Fiji Police 

Force Chamber of Commerce and the ratepayers on this subject.  There are at least nine councils that 

have taken the initiative of installing CCTV in the urban areas.  These are Suva City Council, LautokaCity Council, Lami Town Council, Nasinu Town Council, Nausori Town Council, Sigatoka TownCouncil, Labasa Town Council, Ba Town Council and Savusavu Town Council.</p>
<p>Only four councils have not installed any CCTV camera.  Suva City Council havs installed 

117 cameras in the public areas while Lami Town Council has one camera.  Suva City Council has 

replaced CCTV cameras at the bus stand in the last five years.  Currently, all cameras are in working 

condition, however, six cameras at My Suva Park have been disconnected by FRA to allow for road 

extensions. This will be restored after the completion of road works.</p>
<p>The Lautoka City Council  has 20 CCTV cameras installed, 15 cameras are  in the Lautoka 

Market area and five cameras are located at strategic positions in the city. The Nausori Town Council 

has six cameras installed in the CBD area and 16 cameras around the Nausori market.  The Nasinu 

Town Council has installed 28 cameras inside and outside Laqere Market.</p>
<p>Labasa has 16 cameras which were installed by Duavata Northern Crime Free Committee andSavusavu  Town  Council  has  eight  CCTV  cameras  on  the  Council  premises  covering  kiosks,  bus</p>

<p>stand  and  four  cameras  are  in  the  Council’s  depot.  The  Sigatoka  Town  Council  has  five  CCTV 

cameras  installed  in  the  town  and  Ba  Town  Council  has  eight  cameras  inside  the  Ba  Municipal 

Council.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that Labasa Town Council has engaged Datec to install 

20 bullet cameras and 26 dome cameras within Labasa Market and bus stand area in the next four 

weeks. This will assist the Council to monitor any illegal activities in the Market, assist in dispute 

resolution amongst market vendors and reduce vandalism and break-ins.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  Municipal  Councils  are  working  towards  installing  CCTV  cameras 

because we do understand that towns and cities need to be safe and we need to give that assurance to 

the public. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for that. Honourable Leawere, you have</p>
<p>the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    In  terms  of  the  effectiveness  of  this</p>
<p>initiative, I withdraw my question, Mr. Speaker.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I am disappointed. We will move on.</p>
