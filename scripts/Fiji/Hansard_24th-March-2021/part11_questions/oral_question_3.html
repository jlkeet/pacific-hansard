<p>Strategies to Create Market Opportunities 

(Question No. 67/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>With the global trade being affected by the pandemic, can the Honourable Minister 

for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform Parliament on the Ministry’s strategies 

to create market opportunities in new and existing markets?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).-Thank you, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Member  for  the  question.    Trade  is  actually 

integral to growth and economic development.  This applies to every single country.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, it has been under some tremendous pressure as a 

result of the COVID-19 pandemic as economies worldwide are actually suffering from the drop in 

production and also in consumption.  We have had pictures of empty supermarket shelves and panic 

buying, some panic buying were created by false rumours, it has been common in the first few weeks 

of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  shutting  down of  borders  and the  decreasing  trade  have  affected 

many countries, especially those that are heavily reliant on imports and exports.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual restoration of cross border trade is undoubtedly vital in driving a 

global economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic and a return to the trade-led growth will hinge 

on  creating  some  enabling  conditions  for  businesses  to  actually  trade.    One  of  the  most  effective 

means of addressing this is actually by creating new market opportunities and there are various ways 

to accomplish this.  The Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Tourism has been actively involved in 

this.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific Region alone  has a  combined population of about 10 million 

people, excluding Australia and New Zealand, of course.  Not only are they collectively Fiji’s largest 

trading partners, they are actually seen as a region that will continue as an important trading block, 

especially for Fiji.</p>
<p>Therefore, the modernisation of existing trade agreements, and I think this will happen across 

the world with many trade agreements, Sir.  The modernisation of these trade agreements such as the 

Pacific  Island  Countries  Trade  Agreement  (PICTA)  are  actually  important.    This  particular 

Agreement establishes a free trade area amongst the Pacific Island countries and is a stepping stone 

towards a wider trade integration of its members on both the regional and a multilateral scale.</p>
<p>However, one of the challenges that we have actually  faced  is  with respect to the rules of 

origin and that basically means that under which goods can enter respective markets duty free. Fiji ispart of that Committee that is reviewing the rules to enable more Fijian Made products to be tradedwith Pacific Island countries.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>929</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  another  critical  agreement that Fiji  is  advocating  is  the  Melanesian  Free 

Trade Agreement and this Agreement will take the Melanesian trade and economic integration to the 

next level as it includes trade in services and investment. However, Sir, this Agreement needs to be 

signed by Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu in order to be effective otherwise the old agreement will 

still apply.</p>
<p>With  regards  to  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  Sir,  the  South  Pacific  Regional  Trade  and 

Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) one on the Australian system of tariff preferences 

are the best two tiers going as far as our trade with Australia and New Zealand is concerned but that 

is not to say that our discussions on PACER Plus have come to a dead stop.  We have our issues with 

that, which we have raised and apart from our strategy to consolidate trade with the Pacific region, 

we  are  actually  also  pursuing  markets  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) 

region.</p>
<p>We  are  in  discussion  with  a  number  of  Asian  countries  on  bilateral  future  trading 

arrangements and everyone will appreciate that these actual discussions need careful consideration 

because apart from offering the biggest opportunities, Sir, these countries are also our most fierce 

competitors.    In  this  regard,  Fiji  is  actually  exploring  obtaining  observer  status  in  the  RegionalComprehensive Economic Partnership, commonly known as RCEP which consists of all the majoreconomies of Asia but includes Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As part of our multilateral strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in August last year, I am very proud to 

say  this,  Fiji  became  the  first  Pacific  Island  country  to  sign  a  Trade  &  Investment  Framework 

Agreement with the United States and this provides Fiji a platform for increased dialogue with the 

US on trade matters.  In addition, we are negotiating a historic agreement with New Zealand, Iceland, 

Norway, Switzerland and Costa Rica on Climate Change, trade and sustainability. This agreement is 

the first of its kind that has trade and climate change goals and sustainability at its core. It will enable 

freer  trade  in  environmental  goods  and  services,  thereby  environmental  and  trade  objectives 

concurrently accelerating access and uptake of environmental goods and services and technology.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  the  current  COVID-19  situation,  the  role  of  the  Trade 

Commissions,  our  Trade  Commissions  have  also  become  more  important  than  ever  and  whether 

through the ongoing delivery of consular services on which many overseas Fijians actually rely on 

or through continued trade and investment facilitation to contribute to Fiji’s economic recovery. Fiji’s 

Trade Commissions in Australia, New Zealand, China and North America are actually playing a key 

role in promoting Fiji as a trade and investment hub of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Our Commissions continue to help improve market access for Fijian products and services in 

the respective countries through market research and conducting some targeted media campaigns and 

proactively assisting Fijian exporters to tap into the new market. During the pandemic, Sir, the Trade 

Commissions  relooked  also  at their  strategies  and  have  found  innovative  ways  of  delivering  their 

services and liaising with important stakeholders.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important things also is whilst we are actually creating new 

market opportunities, we are also working  in terms of reforms on the area of doing business. We 

expect to make investment in both domestic and foreign and it is easier to be realised. Over the past 

few years, we have actually implemented a number of reforms in starting a business such as online 

registration of company business name, online tax registration, removal of business licences, launch 

of doing business platform, bizFIJI, the repeal of Stamp Duties Act and establishing of the Building 

Permits Evaluation Committee which I spoke about yesterday, Sir, to name a few.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>These reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue and we will incorporate technology also to 

facilitate  these  processes.    Despite  the  bleak  outlook  of  global  trade,  we  continue  to  focus  on 

strengthening  the  critical  sectors  like  agriculture,  I  mentioned  this  about  the  collaboration  that 

actually exists between the ministries and agriculture food processing that continue to grow despite 

global  value  chain  breakdown.    Also  the  support  that  we  provide  to  micro,  small  and  medium 

enterprises to strengthen their business resilience is also an important part of our strategy to sustain 

and increase our market presence.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  just  some  of  the  strategies  of  the  Ministry  to  ensure  that 

opportunities are created for Fijian businesses to induce economic recovery, so I hope that answer 

suffices.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable  Kuridrani,  you have the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir:    Can  the  Minister 

inform the House if his Ministry is working with other ministries like the Ministry of Agriculture, 

Ministry of Women, Ministry of Forestry and Ministry of Fisheries in this regard to finding marketsfor our non-sugar products? Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have said this 

on many occasions and I am not just saying this on behalf of this Ministry.  This whole Government 

has  a  collaborative  approach  with  respect  to  how  we  do  business,  whether  it  is  to  do  with  trade, 

overseas trade or whether it is actually us doing it locally, but to answer your question, Sir,  absolutely 

yes.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Members,  we  move  on  to  the  fourth  Oral</p>
<p>Question for today.</p>
<p>The Honourable Viliame Gavoka has excused himself and I have given permission  for the</p>
<p>Honourable Peceli Vosanibola to ask Question No. 68 instead.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
