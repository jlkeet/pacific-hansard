<p>Boats and Outboard Engines - Provision and Effectiveness 

(Question No. 69/2021)</p>
<p>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on</p>
<p>the provision of boats and outboard engines to schools and its effectiveness?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Honourable Prime Minister and the 

Honourable  Member  of  this  Parliament:  I  rise  in  Parliament  this  evening  to  address  the  question 

asked  by  Honourable  Adimaitoga  on  the  provision  of  boats  and  outboard  engines’  assistance 

provided to our schools.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  accordance  with  the  Fijian  Government  Policies  containing  thedemocracy and  sustainable  socio-economic development 2009 to 2014, it is to provide affordable 

transport  services  and  improve  accessibility  to  education,  the  Ministry’s  Travel  Assistance 

Programme  for  students  for  low  income  families  started  in  October  21st,  2009  with  the  Bus  Fare 

Assistance Scheme.</p>
<p>Honourable  Nawaikula,  let  me  draw  your  attention  to  the  comment  that  you  made  in 

Parliament regarding the Bus Fare Assistance Scheme. You called it a ‘scam’. Let me correct you:  

The  $18.1  million  that  you  asked  me  to  return  to  you  was  provided  to  Vodafone  for  providing 

assistance  to  well  over  80,000  students  in  that  particular  year.    In  other  words,  Honourable 

Nawaikula, you were misleading Parliament.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Answer the question.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- I do not want to talk you.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was very misleading and the reason I am trying to correct Honourable 

Nawaikula  here  is  the  tendency  of  some  of  the  Honourable  Members  from  the  other  side  to  putmisinformation on the social media pages to create this hype.  You called it a ‘scam’.  Let me correctit: There was no scam and I hope you understand that.</p>
<p>When you read a report, please, interpret the report correctly.   The Auditor-General did not 

even mention there was a scam.  All he said was, there must be an agreement with the company that 

is paid that money and we are in progress with that.  So, stop smiling, it is not funny at all, definitely, 

not funny at all.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, just stick to the question.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry, in 2010, made provisions to extend the 

Transport  Assistance  Scheme  to  students  that  used  other  modes  of  transportation.    Children  used 

trucks, mini buses, carriers and even punts to travel to schools in the absence of a bus service.</p>
<p>Page 92</p>
<p>934</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>To ensure all our children had access to transportation, the  Ministry worked with the Land 

Transport  Authority  (LTA)  to  issue  licences  to  other  transport  modes  that  were  provided  and  to 

operate in these remote areas.</p>
<p>Children were provided with transport vouchers that they could use to travel to school.  These 

vouchers  were  used  for  bus  services,  even  before  the  e-ticketing  were  introduced,  Rural  Service 

Licence (RSL) that we know, mini vans, trucks and boats.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, since 2014, the Ministry further extended the service to assist students in remote</p>
<p>and maritime schools through the provision of boats and outboard engines to schools.</p>
<p>In the interior and maritime zones, children did not have access to any form of transportation 

which  denied  them  the  basic  right to  education.   To  ensure  all  children  had  access  to  quality  and 

equitable education, we then assisted in 2014 till today, a total of 120 schools that accounts for 46,806 

students through boat and outboard motor assistance.  In the Eastern Division, we have so far assisted 

67 schools, 25 schools in the Northern Division, 13 schools in the Central Division and 18 schools 

in the Western Division.  I have a thorough list of the distribution of schools that received boats and 

engines and is available for any Member who wishes to have access to that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today we have more children in primary and secondary schools because of 

the transport assistance provided and this is our Government’s significant investment in the education 

sector.  Those schools needing support are required to submit the Boat Assistance Application Form 

through their District Office that goes to the Asset Management Unit of the Ministry for assessment 

on the need and approval.  And then of course the approval is granted on a case to case basis.</p>
<p>To  strengthen  the  allocation  and  distribution,  the  Ministry  has  put  in  place  a  Standard 

Operating Procedure to ensure that there is a licence operator to transport the children to school and 

that there are controls in place to eliminate abuse.</p>
<p>The FijiFirst Government has initiated many programmes that directly benefit Fijian children.  

The  boat  and  the outboard  engine  assistance  is  just one  of  the  many  initiatives  that  have  directly 

impacted the livelihood of our children. The financial responsibility has been taken off the shoulders 

of the Fijian parents and we are proud to say, we have more children in our schools today.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Boat  and  Outboard  Engine  Assistance  Programme  have  been  very 

effective.  As of today, we have more children in rural and maritime schools travelling to school.  In2012, before we started this  initiative, there were about 10,000 students in primary and secondaryschools in the Eastern Division.  Today we have 11,184 students enrolled in our schools.  The Eastern 

Division has received the most support through this initiative.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of student data, I have already mentioned that and the Ministry will 

continue to make efforts to ensure children are able to access education and must be thankful for the 

opportunities that we provide.  In terms of additional data, we still have for this budget year, we are 

still awaiting the outboard motor and engines  from  Asco Motors which should  be delivered to us 

soon and we have 15 schools that will be able to receive this assistance in the coming months.  Thank 

you.</p>
<p>HON  .SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    We  will  move  on.    Supplementary</p>
<p>question?</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the HonourableMinister for her response but let me just put this straight.  The boats and engines did not start in 2009</p>
<p>Page 93</p>
<p>24th Mar., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>935</p>
<p>but well before that because I was the one looking after this when I was in the Ministry of Education.  

A supplementary question, Sir, who pays for the fuel for these outboard engines?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I have the question repeated?</p>
<p>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  The  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  who  pays  for  the  fuel?    Is  this</p>
<p>budgeted in the Ministry of Education’s budgetary provision?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you very much for the question.  

For the  boats that  are owned  by  the  communities  and  provide  services  to the  nearby  schools,  the 

students are provided with a boat voucher.  The schools that get the boat and engine from us, there is 

a transport allocation, the boats are handed to the school management on the condition that the boats 

will  be used  for transporting the students and sometimes  for teachers as well.  The fuel and other 

costs is provided for by the Ministry.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- We  will  move on. The  sixth  Oral Question  for today and I call on the</p>
<p>Honourable Tabuya to ask her question.  You have the floor, Ma’am.</p>
