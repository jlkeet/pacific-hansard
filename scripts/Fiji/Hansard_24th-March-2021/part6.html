<h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic 

</span></p>
<p><span>Affairs to table his Report.  You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report of the Tourism Fiji 2013 and 2014 Annual Reports – 

Standing Committee on Economic Affairs 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 

to submit to Parliament, the consolidated Review Report of the Tourism Fiji 2013 and 2014 Annual 

Reports.   

</span></p>
<p><span>We are all aware of the extremely significant role the tourism industry has played towards 

Fiji’s economy.  Not only has it brought in revenue for the nation, it has also provided employment 

to thousands of Fijians.  In fact, in 2014 itself, Fiji welcomed a record 692,350 international visitors 

and tourism earnings was valued at $1.5 billion by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Over the years, Tourism Fiji has introduced and executed various initiatives and programmes 

in  its  efforts  to  market  Fiji  to  the  world.    In  2013  itself,  Tourism  Fiji  launched  the  global  brand 

campaign, “Fiji – Where Happiness Finds You” after extensive research which indicated there was 

something about the genuine warmth and welcoming nature of Fijian people, that enriched people’s 

visit to Fiji and left an enduring impact. While in 2014, Tourism Fiji launched its new online travel 

agent specialist training programme, the new Fiji Matai Specialist Programme and website was the 

destination training programme for tourism partners selling Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  commends  Tourism  Fiji  for  continued  progress  towards  increasing  Fiji’s 

</span></p>
<p><span>market share through their various campaign strategies and suggests that Tourism Fiji reports be

<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing  Committee on Public 

</span></p>
<p><span>Accounts to table his Report.   You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report on Management of Traffic Congestion - 

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Committee Review 

Report on  the  Management of  Traffic  Congestion.    The  negative  effects  of  traffic  congestion  are 

many, from increased stress levels, increasing energy use, pollution beyond deliveries, but stalling 

</span><span>local economies may not be one of them.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In  Fiji,  during  breaks,  traffic  congestion  eases.    However,  when  schools  resume,  business 

activities increase, from school pick-ups and drop offs, increased orders for uniforms, purchasing of 

stationery  and  teachers  travelling  to  schools.    Whilst  most  strategies  adopted  to  reduce  traffic 

congestions will greatly impact reduced energy use and pollution, it is important to note how such 

policies can affect economic growth.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Performance  Audit  Report  investigated  traffic  congestion  along  the  Suva-Nausori 

corridor.  This is characterised by the road length of about 20 kilometres, connecting land travellers 

between Suva City and the developing town of Nausori, with around 6,000 of its citizens needing to 

move the same time each day in the same direction.  This is according to the extrapolated from the 

Carpooling  Survey  taken  by  the  Land  Transport  Authority’s  Transport  Planning  and  Statutory 

Department in October 2016.  This immediately causes traffic congestion during peak hours.  This 

</span><span>means that the travelling public would be spending an average of two hours to travel between these 

</span><span>two destinations.   

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>24th Mar., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Traffic  congestion  is  a  sign  of  economic  growth  but  if  not  properly  managed,  it  can  have 

negative  implications that neutralises the  factors that drove the same economic growth  in the first 

place.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In Fiji, the Household Travel Survey 2018 Report shows not only increased household car 

ownership, but also increased local tourism, increased travel time for official work with low vehicle 

occupancy with 67 percent of vehicles carrying no passengers.  The scope of the audit was to assess 

the effectiveness of the three areas with management of traffic congestion, namely; the Institutional 

Framework, Addressing the Transportation Demand and Monitoring and Evaluation and Reporting 

Strategies.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  noted,  however,  that  the  Audit  Report  did  not  cover  issues  surrounding 

carbon  emissions,  time  wastage,  delays  resulting  in  late  arrivals,  inability  to  forecast travel  times 

accurately,  stressed  and  frustrated  motorists,  induced  spill-over  into  secondary  roads  and the  side 

streets, as Fijians look for other ways and means to reach their destinations on time.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst,  there  are  legislations  and  policies  that  govern  the  land  transport  sector  in  Fiji,  its 

effectiveness and adequacy  can  be  improved through proper and regular reviews and evaluations.  

</span><span>This warrants holistic reviews so that land transport issues, traffic congestion being a major one, can 

</span><span>be appropriately and expeditiously addressed.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Coupled with the absence of prescribed procedures at the Department of Transport, there is 

lack  of  formal  arrangements/agreements  to  establish  coordination  between  lead  agencies  in 

addressing the problem of congestion on Fiji’s roads.  This weak coordination is particularly apparent 

during  infrastructural  developments  where  Traffic  Impact  Assessments  are  in  most  parts;  the 

authority in charge of developing the road networks such as Fiji Roads Authority is not consulted 

prior to these developments. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The existence of certain governance structures, such as the National Transport Consultative 

Forum  is  acknowledged.  Although  the  Forum  finds  traffic  congestion  issues  encapsulated  in  the 

meeting themes, the lack of urgency in turning planned strategies into action, the forum entirely falls 

short of committing to alleviation and addressing head-on congestion management and its reduction 

as a primary issue. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The provision of duty concession has resulted in the increase in the volume of vehicles into 

the country. This  has  further added to the number of vehicles on the roads. Capacity constraint is 

</span><span>another issue that will need to be addressed when combating traffic congestion and high number of 

</span><span>imported  vehicles.  The  overarching  responsibility  for  congestion  management  strategies/project 

effectiveness will  need to be properly  integrated, in ensuring the  issue of traffic  is addressed  in a 

timely manner.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Transport Demand Management has not been effectively used in Fiji in providing the concise 

number of the forever growing population along the Suva-Nausori corridor as a tool for managing 

traffic congestion. While  limited transportation demand  management initiatives has  been explored 

and  implemented  since  2015,  collectively  this  has  been  neither  comprehensive  nor  sufficient  to 

materially impact transportation demand for road use and related congestion.  Apart from the daily 

work of  the  Fiji  Police  Force  in  directing  traffic  at  congestion  spots, other  recent  progress  in  the 

management traffic along the Suva-Nausori corridor has been from the supply of additional roads, 

that is, double lanes between Nakasi and Nausori. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  monitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements  are  comprised  by  the  absence  of  a  clearly 

</span><span>defined land transport sector-wide monitoring and evaluation system at the strategic level, absence

</span></p>
<p><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 

</span></p>
<p><span>849 

</span></p>
<p><span>of systemic reporting by agencies on the impact of nationwide congestion management initiatives, 

absence of traffic data to enable a full assessment of the holistic pattern of congestion, absence of 

key  indicators  and  trends  in  traffic  performance  measures  and  targets,  lack  of  collaboration  in 

integrating all related data in a centralised national transport database and monitoring not turned into 

action  responses  or  programme  modification.    At  the  national  level,  there  is  no  institutional 

integration  framework  to  manage  traffic  congestion  amongst  the  key  stakeholders  whereby 

monitoring and reporting arrangements can be further enhanced and improved.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee notes that the continuous efforts in the implementation of actions under the 

Fiji Decade of  Action  for Road Safety 2011-2020 National Plans.  However, it  is anticipated that 

there  will  be  more  effective  collaboration,  integration  and  results-oriented  efforts  from  relevant 

transport  agencies  in  controlling  traffic  congestion  and  at  the  same  time,  alleviating  the  carbon 

footprints in Fiji.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee was informed that the Department of Transport had, earlier this year, worked 

with  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO)  on  the  linkages  between  the  Sendai 

Framework and Transport. This will also be included as part of the review of the Maritime and Land 

Transport  Policies.  This  is  relating  to  SDG  Indicator  11.7(a),  which  states  that  by  2030,  provide 

</span><span>universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women 

</span><span>and children, old persons and persons living with disabilities. 

</span></p>
<p><span>SDG Indicator 11.7 (b) further states that by 2030, substantially increase the number of cities 

and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, 

resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilient to disasters and to develop 

and implement in line with Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic risk 

management at all levels.

<p><span>Given the review findings, the Committee recommends that the:

</span></p>
<p><span>Department of Transport should conduct more stakeholders meeting at national level to 

discuss transport-related issues and formulate strategies to ease traffic congestion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Department of Transport, in conjunction with  FRA, LTA and  the  Fiji Police  Force to 

review the oversight role, including planning and evaluation of systems and processes.  

</span></p>
<p><span>If practical, the Department of Transport to introduce digital intelligence transport system 

</span><span>to provide real time data in order to ease traffic congestion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Department  of  Transport  formulates  an  integrated  transport  master  plan  to  map  out 

policies and strategies and provide regular update and policy direction.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  introduction  of  sensor  traffic  lights  whereby  lights  will  change  according  to  the 

number of vehicles on the road.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There  should  be  a  dedicated  bus  lane  in  largely  populated  towns  and  cities  or  where 

appropriate.  The  Committee  suggests  that  during  peak  hours,  an  opposite  lane  is 

temporarily dedicated for management of traffic in or out of towns and cities.  

</span></p>
<p><span>All relevant stakeholders should have a target to reduce the deaths and injuries from road 

traffic accidents by, at least, 50 percent in Fiji in line with SDG 3 – Good Health and 

</span><span>Wellbeing by 2030.

</span></p>
<p><span>All traffic and transport stakeholders to provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and 

sustainable transport system for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public 

transport  with  special  attention  to  the  needs  of  those  in  vulnerable  situation,  women, 

children, persons with disabilities and older people in line with SDG 11 – Sustainable 

Cities and Communities by 2030.  

</span></p>
<p><span>While the Committee looks at strategies on how to address the issues of traffic congestion in 

moving forward given the allocated resources, the Committee commends the excellent work by the 

Fiji Police Force in the management of traffic congestion during peak hours, morning and afternoon, 

as this really eases the burden for the road-users to wait long hours on the road.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I thank the Acting Commissioner of Police, Mr. Rusiate Tudravu and his officers who are on 

the road in the early hours of the morning, regardless of whether the sun is shining or it is raining. 

You  are  on  the  road  to  ensure  ease  of  traffic.    On  behalf  of  the  general  public,  I  thank  you, 

Commissioner and your team for your dedication and service.  

</span></p>
<p><span>At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  all  Honourable  Members  of  the 

Committee, who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report; Honourable Joseph
