<h3>REVIEW REPORT - FIJIAN ELECTORAL COMMISSION 2014 ANNUAL REPORT</h3>
<p><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr, Speaker, Sir, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That Parliament debates the 2014 Review Report of the Fijian Electoral Commission, 

</span></p>
<p><span>which was tabled on 14th May, 2019. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND.- I beg to second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  invite  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 

</span></p>
<p><span>Justice, Law and Human Rights to speak on his motion. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I take this opportunity, as the Member 

moving the motion, to make a brief contribution on the Committee’s Report on the Fijian Electoral 

Commission 2014 Annual Report.   

</span></p>
<p><span>By way of a brief background, the  Fijian Electoral  Commission  2014  Annual  Report was 

referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights in the last term of Parliament 

and  then  reinstated  in  this  new  Parliament  and  referred  to  the  current  Committee.    The  current 

Committee  of  which  I  am  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  took  this  as  an  opportunity  to  complete  the 

commendable work carried out by our predecessors.  

</span></p>
<p><span> Just  as  the  previous  Committee,  the  current  Committee  was  mandated  by  Parliament  to 

review the Annual Report and report back to Parliament on its findings.  The Committee took note 

of and deliberated on the previous Committee’s extensive deliberation and reviewed the Report and 

noted its content.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee took note of all the evidences received from various  submissions, so as to 

ensure  that  all  possible  points  or  views  and  suggestions  that  were  received  were  given  relevant 

consideration.    In  its  pursuit  to  form  an  independent  view  and  stance,  the  previous  Committee 

addressed all the issues noted in the Annual Report and came up with its own recommendations to 

some of the main issues noted.   

</span></p>
<p><span>My  Committee  also  shares  the  view  of  the  previous  Committee,  in  that  some  of  their 

suggestions are either impractical or already been addressed in some way or the other since the initial 

tabling of the Annual Report in Parliament in 2016.  For example, the suggestion for a ballot paper 

to have pictures of candidates, party symbols and names would be impractical, as this would see a 

ballot paper the size of a workstation desk.  Such an issue has been dealt with in a more practical 

way, and so have most of the issues noted in the 2014 Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the other main areas of discussions addressed by the Committee are as follows:  

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>The  realisation  of  the  independence  of  the  Fijian  Electoral  Commission  by  having  and 

controlling its own budget, being able to utilise independent legal services and having clear 

demarcation on the governance structure of the Fiji’s electoral management body.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>453 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>The realisation of the aforementioned independence by considering proposed amendments 

to the electoral laws (2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, Electoral Act 2014 and the 

Political Parties (Registration, Conduct, Funding and Disclosures) Act 2013.  

</span></p>
<p><span>There was also a comparative analysis of various foreign jurisdictions conducted, to see the 

electoral practices of their electoral management bodies.  In that regard, I wish to advice of 

a Caveat which is the result of the comparative analysis where there is no perfect model or 

right practice for electoral management bodies.  The result was used as a mere guidance for 

the  Committee,  in  making  its  own  independent  view  of  what  it  thought  best  for  Fiji’s 

circumstance. 

</span></p>
<p><span>From the jurisdiction research, the Committee noted that there is no such thing as a perfect 

model for electoral management bodies.  The above statement should be the basis for understanding 

the main purpose for the Committee’s analysis of other jurisdictions. The Committee sought to see 

if the issues that were raised in the Annual Report are also present in other jurisdictions. There are 

various  forms  of  practices  across  jurisdictions,  however,  one  vital  aspect  noted  was  that  the 

fundamental principles behind the election processes remained the same – that an election should be 

impartial, independent, free and fair. 

</span></p>
<p><span>At the conclusion of the review, the Committee established that the response provided by the 

Fijian Electoral Commission on the issues raised on the Report were satisfactory and had provided 

the needed clarification. The Committee provided a few recommendations, which it believes would 

be a good starting point for any electoral system review.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Committee also notes that progress has been made with regards to addressing many of 

the concerns raised in  the  Annual  Report,  yet  every system has room for improvement. After the 

2018 General Elections, two election cycles have been completed under our new electoral system 

and this gives us a fuller understanding of the challenges of this new system and an opportunity to 

gather and consider lessons learned.  

</span></p>
<p><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge Honourable Members of this august House to 

take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report and to show support for the motion before the 

House. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Deputy Chairperson for his Report.  Honourable Members, 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   Honourable Prime Minister, you have the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by Honourable 

Sharma.    The  Fijian  Electoral  Commission  is  mandated  under  the  2013  Constitution  as  an 

independent non-partisan authority responsible for the registration of voters and the conduct of free 

and fair elections in accordance with written laws governing elections in Fiji.  In this respect, Mr. 

Speaker,  Sir,  both  sides  of  this  august  Parliament  need  to  acknowledge  the  work  that  has  been 

conducted by the Fiji Electoral Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  because of this very important  work that Members of both  sides of 

</span><span>Parliament are seated here during the tenure of our Parliamentary term.  The Commission, through 

</span><span>the Fijian Elections Office, conducts a very significant and important role through regular revisions 

and assessments of the National Register of Voters and Fiji’s population which will ascertain the 

number of representations in Parliament.  As we all know, Mr. Speaker, this is unique to Fiji and the 

2013 Constitution allows for that.  The 2013 Constitution allows for fair representation in Parliament, 

according to the number of population we have in Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><a>Page 16</a></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is also the mandate of Government, ensuring that our Fijian citizens are 

served  proportionately,  equally  and  equitably  unlike  the  past,  our  Parliament  always  had  a  fixed 

number of seats.  The Electoral Commission, as mandated under the 2013 Constitution ensured that 

this  is  changed.    Prior  to  the  2014  General  Elections,  the  total  number  of  population  and  voters 

registered then determined the total number of seats in Parliament to be 50.  Similarly, prior to the 

2018 General Elections, the Commission determined the total number of seats in Parliament to be 

51, an increase by one seat which also signifies the increase in our voter registration and population 

as a whole. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should now be in our best interest to support the role of the 

Commission.  I, therefore, commend the collaborative work of the Commission and the Supervisor 

of Elections to effectively manage the electoral system in Fiji on a daily basis. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, support the motion.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Prime Minister for his contribution to the debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Adi Litia Qionibaravi, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before 

the House, and I would like to thank the Chairperson of the Committee of Justice, Law and Human 

Rights for their review report which is their second review that has been carried out on the Annual 

Reports of the Electoral Commission, including references made to the report on the Multinational 

Observer Group Report on the 2014 Elections. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We note that the Annual Report of the Electoral Commission was tabled in the House in 2016.  

It is now 2021, and it has been over four  years since the report was tabled in the House  and two 

separate  Committees  of the  Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  have  both  reviewed  the  report.    The 

Annual Report of the Electoral Commission and its recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have a large 

bearing  on  how  Fiji  can  be  truly  governed  democratically,  as  it  is  the  relevant  provision  of  the 

Constitution, the electoral laws and regulations that determines who wins the general elections in 

Fiji. 

</span></p>
<p><span>We have had two general elections and it is unfortunate that this side of the House hold strong 

</span></p>
<p><span>views that both elections were rigged. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- All Opposition parties that made submissions to the Justice, 

Law and Human Rights Committee, as well as the Electoral Commission on a number of occasions, 

our  efforts,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  the  Court  of  Disputed  Returns  with  eight  witnesses  to  provide 

evidence of the rigging of the election had to be withdrawn because six key witnesses were declared 

to be persons of interest.   

</span></p>
<p><span>On that ground, Sir, we ask, who is not a person of interest in a general election?  Who is not 

a person of interest in the general election?  Every member of the public who missed the requirement 

to be a registered voter is a person of interest, as each voter has a preference on who to vote for, and 

the collective results of the voters who cast their votes less the invalid votes results in the decision 

on which party will govern the nation.  

</span></p>
<p><span>While  the  2013  Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  further  mandates  that  the  Court  of 

Disputed Returns decision cannot be further challenged in another Court of law, so that was the end 

of our strenuous efforts to seek justice with the Court of Disputed Returns, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>

<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>455 

</span></p>
<p><span>The political parties that made various submissions to the Electoral Commission, over 120 

recommendations from 2017 to 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Out of the 120 recommendations, less than 

10 recommendations have been approved.  In our view, that shows the ingenuous of the Government 

to enter into dialogue with this side of the House - the Opposition parties, and listen to what we are 

saying.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We speak on behalf of thousands of voters who voted us into Parliament that their needs to 

be substantive changes to the electoral laws in this country, as well as the 2013 Constitution of the 

Republic of Fiji.  We wholeheartedly share the intent of the two reports and anticipate serious and 

sincere dialogue and active cooperation with the FijiFirst Government, the Fiji Electoral Commission 

and the Elections Office in the implementation of these recommendations.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The changes required in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, can only be achieved through genuine dialogue 

and trust between stakeholders in a process that includes the people of Fiji, the civil society, the Fiji 

media and all those who can assist the elections process in Fiji.  The obligations or challenges to 

initiate necessary changes rests on the Electoral Commission.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Electoral Commission Chairman had assured the Opposition political parties initially that 

it  will  do  its  best  to  bring  about  changes  needed  to  ensure  free  and  fair  elections  under  the  law.  

However, those words were watered down that the Electoral Commission will only implement the 

laws as it is and not the law as it ought to be. This is the thrust of our submission, Sir.  The Opposition 

parties would like to enter into dialogue with Government to consider the review of the electoral laws 

so that the election can be held in this country and considered free and fair, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Electoral Commission 2014 Report, Sir, the changes it recommended should have been, 

with the assistance of donor partners completed by mid-2016.  However, the 2014 elections terms 

have lapsed and new commissioners were appointed in early 2017. To date, we still have not seen 

changes, approval, consideration or dialogue on the 120 recommendations that were made by the 

political parties to the Electoral Commission, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As Fiji moves forward, it is the prayer of the Opposition parties that the country and all its 

citizens will find a workable electoral process that will ensure the genuine will of the people, and that 

it will give them a group of citizens to  rule the affairs of their nation with  sincerity, honesty and 

compassion, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Section 23 of the 2013 Constitution provides that every citizen has the right to free, fair and 

</span></p>
<p><span>regular elections. The Electoral Commission is mandated under Section 75(2) and I quote: 

</span></p>
<p><span>“The  Commission  has  the  responsibility  for  the  registration  of  voters  and  the 

conduct of free and fair elections in accordance with the written law governing elections 

and any other relevant law.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, “in accordance with the written law governing elections” has largely 

prevented  the  Electoral  Commission  from  taking  up  recommendations  that  they  have  received  to 

Government,  so  that  Government  through  Cabinet  can  consider  the  changes  that  we  are 

recommending and the changes are made to the electoral laws of this country.  

</span></p>
<p><span>What  I  am  saying,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  the  2013  Constitution  literally  restricts  the 

Electoral Commission even though we are telling the Electoral Commission, “you have the right, you 

have  the  responsibility  to  ensure  free  and  fair  elections,  and  you  can  make  submissions  for  the 

changes in the law”, but they will not make a submission because they are saying that they will only 

hold elections on what the written law is.  So that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a big dilemma. Who is going 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>to make the recommendations to allow Government to consider what we are voicing today?  We have 

said a lot of things to the Electoral Commission. Our reports, our submission to the Committees have 

been documented by them, it will be pointless for me to continue to say this unless Government has 

the goodwill to listen to the opposition parties and review the electoral laws in this country so that 

Fiji can hold a truly free and fair elections in this country.  

</span></p>
<p><span>We support, Sir, the recommendations in the two reports – the Multinational Observer Group 

and the first Electoral Commission that was appointed before the first elections in 2013. Thank you, 

Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Adi  Litia  Qionibaravi.  Before  we  move  on, 

Honourable Whips and Acting Whips, make a list of those who are going to speak and get the list to 

me.  I do not want a repetition of yesterday, I am fishing around for speakers.    Do your job, I will 

do mine. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I give the floor to Honourable Professor Prasad. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Before I speak on the 

report, I just saw a front page picture of you and mine in the Government propaganda newspaper.  It 

is fake news, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, how come I am looking old and you are still looking 

</span></p>
<p><span>young? 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this report has come after the die was cast, so to speak.  As the report points 

</span></p>
<p><span>out, two General Elections have already been held and there has been very little .... 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Dr. Waqainabete interjects) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- You worry about Panadol, Honourable Minister.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, there has been little or no heed paid to the recommendations of the 2014 Annual 

Report of the Electoral Commission and, indeed, the Multinational Observer Group (MOG) findings 

into the 2014 General Elections.  However, Mr. Speaker, it is better late than never. 

</span></p>
<p><span>As the Committee states, it is important that a special parliamentary committee is established 

to review the entire electoral process and time is of the essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We are less than 

17 months away from when elections can be held at the earliest in 2022, which is July next year.  

This has been confirmed by the Electoral Commission during its recent meeting with the political 

parties. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Might I add, we have even lesser time, if the issuance of writs and nomination period is taken 

into account, Mr. Speaker, but instead, what we see is this Government actually forging ahead and 

blatantly ignoring what was recommended after the 2014 and 2018 General Elections.  It only made 

cosmetic and not real changes, as recommended by the Commission and MOG after the nation went 

to the polls in 2018. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Government seemingly has no intention, Mr. Speaker, of adopting major recommendations 

from the Reports in 2014 and again in 2018.  Basically, the Government is turning a blind eye to 

substantive changes.  It has decided to make some changes that it thinks are suitable, as seen in the 

</span></p>

<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>457 

</span></p>
<p><span>Electoral  (Amendment)  Bill  2020  and  the  Political  Parties  (Registration,  Conduct,  Funding  and 

Disclosures) (Amendment) Bill 2020 as tabled in December 2020. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do, however, wish to thank the Committee under the Chairmanship of the 

Honourable Assistant Minister for Employment, Productivity, Industrial Relations who is not here, 

for  the  bold  recommendations.    In  fact,  I  think  the  Committee  has  done  a  really  good  job  in 

scrutinising the report and making some very useful recommendations.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the Honourable Assistant Minister and his Committee, Mr. Speaker, if I may just add, 

have  done  justice  to  the  role  and  functions  of  a  Parliamentary  Standing  Committee,  in  my  view, 

fearlessly performing the role of scrutinising the merits and demerits of the report which was referred 

to the Committee by your goodself, Mr. Speaker.  I think this is the first time that I also see that there 

was no regard to political consequences.  The Committee did not stray from the truth and have made 

recommendations that, if adopted, will uphold unblemished electoral credibility and integrity.  So I 

really want to thank the Committee for doing their job. 

</span></p>
<p><span>An  example  of  this  is  the  Committee’s  agreement  with  the  Electoral  Commission,  the 

recommendation that it must have its own budget and be free to seek independent legal advice.  If 

you look at the Commission’s Report, it notes that its requests to the Minister for Elections on this 

issue  was  basically  ignored  and  we  wonder  why,  Mr.  Speaker.    Absolute  independence  of 

independent institutions is totally necessary for transparency.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Executive Summary on page 4 of the Commission’s Report which states, and I quote:  

</span></p>
<p><span>“… The EC’s work was affected by not having the services of an independent 

legal advisor.  Repeated requests for an independent legal consultant to the Minister of 

Elections remain unanswered.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does raise serious questions as to why the Commission’s requests were 

repeatedly  ignored  especially  when  the  Minister  for  Elections  happens  to  be  the  Honourable 

Attorney-General, as well as his also the General Secretary of the FijiFirst Party, he is the registered 

officer of the FijiFirst Party.  But that was 2014 – you fast forward that to 2021 and yes the status 

quo remains the same - the FijiFirst General Secretary is still the Honourable Attorney-General, still 

the registered officer and still the Minister for Elections.  

</span></p>
<p><span> The  Honourable  Minister,  I  heard  him  say  once,  in  the  previous  administration,  the 

Honourable Prime Minister was responsible for the Elections.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did not 

deal with the Elections Office in their political capacities.  Besides, we did not have this Political 

Parties Act or Electoral Act.  They did not have to operate under that and obviously they did not have 

a say in the appointment of the Supervisor of Elections. So the Electoral Commission, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, is very, very important.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The Electoral Commission’s recommendation for the position of Supervisor of Elections to 

be re-advertised  again  was  ignored.   I  mean,  if there was  a  requirement,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 

advertisement in the first place, then that should have been followed.  That is all history but what I 

would  say  to  the  Government,  “history  should  not  repeat  itself”  and  that  is  why  the  Standing 

Committee, in my view, has rightfully recommended a thorough parliamentary review of the electoral 

process.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I think it is absolutely important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the recommendations in the 

2014  Elections  Report,  the  Multinational  Observer  Group  (MOG)  and,  indeed,  the  2018  Election 

Observer Group, there are a number of issues that were highlighted by MOG, even though the terms 

</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>of  reference  was  very,  very  narrow.    I  mean,  ideally,  we  should  be  inviting  the  Commonwealth 

Observer Group or the European Union Observer Group.  These are credible observer groups that 

observe elections around the world. I remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commonwealth Secretariat 

had actually written to the Government offering a Commonwealth Observer Group to observe the 

elections in 2018.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Parliament did not deal with reports of the 2014 Elections.  We had 

four years.  We are looking at this report after six years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we should have, as 

a  Parliament,  as  leaders,  we  should  have  looked  at  the  2014  Election  Commission’s  Report,  the 

Multinational Observer Group and done the right thing.  Any talk of genuine democracy anywhere, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir, and in any country rests on the integrity of the electoral process.  If there is any 

perception that the election process or election conduct has any doubts, it does not lead to a genuine 

democracy.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Many countries around the world, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have elections.  Elections is just one part 

of achieving genuine democracy.  It is a very important part and we need to ensure that we accept 

the recommendations of this Committee.  In fact the Committee is saying, the Committee points out 

that two elections were held and it is time to review.  I think they are right. The Honourable Members 

in that Committee are absolutely right,  and they  ought to be commended for coming up with this 

recommendation.    

</span></p>
<p><span>Surely, Mr. Speaker, if we in this Parliament, believe in transparency, accountability and good 

governance but more importantly, absolutely independence of institutions because Parliament is the 

supreme oversight body.  Every institution in this country, including the executives, some newspaper 

so-called  “analyst”  they  do  not  understand  this  issue  of  separation  of  powers.    Parliament  is  the 

supreme  oversight  institution.    Every  institution  is  accountable  to  Parliament,  including  the 

executives.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You do not understand that! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. PROFESSOR B.C. PRASAD.- Executive is accountable to this Parliament.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  PROFESSOR  B.C.  PRASAD.-  They  are  accountable  to  this  Parliament.    It  is  very 

important, Mr. Speaker, for us to understand that and this is why the two Bills before the Committee 

are  premature.  We  need  to  go  by  the  recommendations  of  this  Committee,  let  us  set  up  a 

Parliamentary  Committee  and  deal  with  the  recommendations  and  I  am  sure  the  2018  Elections 

Report has been considered by the Committee right now.  Let us wait for that report and let us set up 

a Parliamentary Committee.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, politics is not just about winning elections.  Politics is about 

doing the right things by the country, by the people.  So, let us do that. Let us accept for once, this 

Parliamentary Committee’s recommendation and let us set up a Parliamentary Committee, we still 

have  time.  We  have  17  months.  Let  us  do  that  and  come  as  a  Parliament  and  deal  with  those 

recommendations so that when we go into the elections in 2022, we are all happy and sure  that the 

processes surrounding elections, the conduct of the elections, the role of the Electoral Commission 

are  all properly accounted for.  

</span></p>
<p><span>If we do not do that, Mr. Speaker, the perception of bias, perception of rigging, perception of 

vote buying, perception of not having a free, fair and a credible election will remain and we will 

remain a democracy struggling.

<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>459 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Leader of the NFP. I have four other speakers.  I 

now  give  the  floor,  first,  to  Honourable  Gavoka,  then  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries, 

Honourable  Bulitavu  and  then  the  Honourable  Attorney-General.  That  is  the  order  of  speakers.  

Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  must  say  that  I  am  pleased  that  the 

Committee has finalised its report and has highlighted certain areas that have been of concern to me 

over the years.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, much has been said by my colleagues earlier on, on the mark.  I would like to 

touch on one area and that is the number of people who did not vote in 2014 and 2018.  To me, that 

is the true measure of success of an election.  

</span></p>
<p><span>As we know, Mr.  Speaker, about  90,000 registered voters did  not  vote in  2014 and about 

171,000 did not vote in 2018.  I was part of Parliament in 2014 and was very concerned about the 

huge number that did not vote in 2014 and I was hoping that it would have improved by 2018, but it 

virtually doubled.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As a former business executive, I always measure success by the output, by the participation 

of groups into a project or into an event.  There is no reason why a small country like Fiji would have 

90,000  of  its  registered  voters  not  turning  out  to  vote,  let  alone  171,000  four  years  later.    Our 

Secretary of the Electoral Office continues to speak in glowing terms about the success of the 2014 

and 2018 Elections, but I beg to differ when I look at the number of people who did not vote. 

</span></p>
<p><span>To  me,  that  is  the  real  measure  of  success,  and  I  am  happy,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  I  see  some 

recommendations  here  by  the  Electoral  Commission  in  2014.    I  am  referring  here  to  what  I  would 

normally term as “confidence-building measures”. Over here, the Electoral Commission is saying that 

you must allow people to take a piece of paper into the voting booth with the number of the person they 

want to vote for, to help them vote for the person they want.  We do not allow that in Fiji.  We do not 

allow any paper, we do not even allow any images or anything to help our voters to vote for who they 

want. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker, when I think about all the work that the Electoral Commission carries out in the four 

years,  it  is  all  leading  to  one  moment  of  truth  -  all  the  television,  radio,  print  media  advertisements, 

everything they do leads to that one moment of truth is when a Fijian goes into the booth to decide who 

is to be in the Government; that is the moment of truth - to get them into that booth.  Whatever you said, 

whatever campaign you carry out in the country, the moment of truth is that time when they get into the 

booth, and that should be the driving factor, the driving force in whatever you do to build up towards an 

election.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, I am talking about here, about “confidence-building measures”.  You 

must give confidence to our people to enable them to go and vote.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Right now, Mr.  Speaker, it is very intimidating.  We must make it easy for them to go and vote 

because they are the ones who decide who is going to run the Government.   They are the ones who are 

going to decide who is going to run the Government, so let us look at confidence building measures, Mr.  

Speaker.  Why can we not have signs in the ballot paper, signages (like in the past), the symbols on the 

ballot  paper,  we  do  not  have  that?    Why  can  they  not  take  a  piece  of  paper  into  the  booth?   

Why can they not be taken to the voting booth by their political parties? 

</span></p>
<p><span>These are all steps we can take to give them the confidence to go and vote.  If you leave them the 

way  they  are,  they  will  just  say,  “No,  this  is  too  complicated”,  “I’m  afraid”,  I’m  intimidated  by  the 

atmosphere, by the environment”, “I will stay home”.  This is true, Mr.  Speaker, so what we would like 

to see, from this side, is to put in more confidence building measures, relax some of the rules.

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>As I said, Mr.  Speaker, no matter what we say, however we put it, we must look to that moment 

of truth when a citizen of this country goes into that booth every four years to make his choice on who is 

to be in this  government.  That, Mr. Speaker, is the most important criteria, the most important objective 

for the Electoral Commission and for all of us. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I  know  that  some  will  be  impeded  by  other  factors  but  maybe  in  other  jurisdictions,  we  can 

benchmark, it is simply less than 5 percent of those who do not turn up to vote, Mr.  Speaker.  In Fiji, this 

is way too high so, I would ask that going forward, the Electoral Commission must work towards making 

sure, look at all the factors, making sure that every citizen in this country gets into that booth.  That is the 

true measure of success for any election in a democracy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope what I am saying here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on confidence building will be heeded and 

taken into account.  There is so much confusion.  I know in the Malolo’s, people voted in one booth 

in 2014 and in 2018, they were told to go and vote down at another venue.  We have had voting since 

1970, our people know, “if I vote in Malolo Sewa in 2014, I will vote here again in 2018.”  It did not 

happen. It is not unique to that area, it happened all over Fiji.   

</span></p>
<p><span>I know in Sigatoka, someone voted in Conua in 2014 and was taken to Naduri in 2018. That 

is the kind of confusion, Mr. Speaker, that we will need to factor into the whole equation.   I hope 

that that is going to be taken into consideration and we want in 2022, the participation to be much 

higher and we want everyone to be given the opportunity to make that choice that is due to them, as 

part of our democracy.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  Honourable  Gavoka  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  respond  in 

support of the motion being debated in this august House.  I would like to thank the Chairperson and 

the Committee for a substantive review of the 2014 Fiji Electoral Commission Annual Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to acknowledge the Committee’s intensive work in identifying 

the  three  issues  and  recommendations  from  the  report.    These  are  areas  where  the  Committee 

suggested to be looked into, in ensuring productive outputs.  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 

like also to recognise the work conducted by the Committee in undertaking the comparative analysis 

of electoral management bodies in other jurisdictions more importantly, their ability to reflect that 

there is  not  a  perfect  model  or right  practice for  electoral  management bodies all over the world.  

However, models are used on what best fits Fiji’s circumstances.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also worthwhile to note that the disqualification of candidacy due to 

</span></p>
<p><span>conviction and to public office holders is a nog within the jurisdiction analysed. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Therefore, Fiji is not alone in this respect and we should support the work conducted by the 

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji Election Commission in this regard.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee highlighted four findings which include the emphasis on the 

issues that they have been able to identify.  Under recommendation two, they have highlighted the 

resources to ensure the independence of the structure. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I am sure that the eight recommendations that have been stated in the report and over time, I 

am certain that after seven years since 2014, issues that have been highlighted have been considered 

and implemented.

<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>461 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to just comment on a few comments coming from the Opposition.  I 

think it is quite unfair to be sitting in this House and suggesting the issues that have been highlighted 

in the National Election Report and yet on two previous elections, they have gone to elections, they 

have been elected and they are sitting here in this august House and they continue to sit here.   

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- If we do not agree to any suggestion or regulation that 

stand to any situation, all over the world candidates have not stood for elections because they do not 

agree to the document or to the conditions that have been given and yet, for the last six years, under 

these documents, they continue to come here and sit.  Look at them!  This is dishonourable and when 

the honourable Speaker says something and they do not agree, they walk out.  When you walk out, 

do not come back, please, stay out.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the international observers who came to observe the elections in Fiji stated 

that the election was fair and free.  In fact, they certified the election.  So if there is an independent 

body from overseas, an international body that comes here and reviews the election and says that it 

is fair and free, then who else do we have to accept?  Do we accept the Opposition who have lost the 

elections twice in two previous elections?  No!  Of course, they would complain.  It is the very same 

Constitution.… 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That was factually wrong, all 

they said was that it was credible, which is totally different from free and fair.  Get your facts right! 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Come with the facts.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  the  same  Constitution  that 

dictates the conditions for the election of the Leader of the Opposition, within their own constitution 

which they did not even abide by.  Now we still have a question of who is going to be the Leader of 

the Opposition today.  They come here and say so many things, but they are not even looking at 

themselves in the mirror.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  relevance,  please.    Can  he  be 

</span></p>
<p><span>relevant to the topic?  There is a lot of hot air coming out.  Relevance, please, Standing Order 60.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they degrade the Constitution, the 

same  Constitution  which  signifies  the  rules  they  will  abide  by  in  selecting  their  own  Opposition 

Leader and today, we are in a diabolic situation because they cannot even make up their minds.  They 

cannot even follow the constitution within their own Party, let alone …. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Members interject) 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!  Honourable Minister, we are not talking about their elections, we 

</span></p>
<p><span>are talking about the General Elections.

<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just highlighting because they 

</span></p>
<p><span>talked about the Constitution and the Electoral Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  The  Opposition  do  not  agree  with  the  electoral 

process.  If they did not agree they should not have stood for the elections, especially after we have 

gone through two general elections.  Unfortunately, they have stated so many negative things and 

stood for elections, and at the same time sit here, squander and lie.  The elections and the Constitution 

is very clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and if they continue to stand up, they are just basically squandering 

and wasting the time of this august House.  They should reflect on what they have gone through in 

the last two elections and come back here with constructive arguments to put to the floor.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Bulitavu,  you  have  the 

</span></p>
<p><span>floor.    

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a few comments with regards to 

the motion that is before the House, that is the Fiji Electoral Commission Annual Report 2014.  I 

speak from the Committee’s perspective as a member of the Committee.   

</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, Sir, I would like to thank the Office of the Speaker and the Secretary-General for 

the assistance given to the Committee in our public consultation and deliberation as we moved around 

the country receiving submissions from members of the public, giving their views on the report.  The 

current report that we have is the old report (2014) but there is still progressive work being done.  

The 2018 Electoral Commission Report, the 2018 Supervisor of Elections Office Report, the Joint 

Report and also the Report on the 2018 General Elections Report are also with the Committee. 

</span></p>
<p><span>I think it is public knowledge and the Committee has advertised its public consultation, calling 

on people to come and make written submissions and also oral submissions and all their views have 

been shared this morning.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I will just tell  a story,  given there is  plenty argument on the ballot  paper and whether the 

symbol and the names should be on the ballot paper.  In one of the submissions that we had received 

in Sigatoka where we were with the police officers who had been providing security during the two 

previous elections.  They relayed to us their experience with the past electoral system where they had 

to conduct elections in the upper hills of Navosa.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In the upper hills of Navosa, at the end of the day, one of the elders wanted to vote too so the 

Presiding Officer allowed that ballot paper to be taken to the home of the elderly who could not make 

it to the polling station.  When the Presiding Officer came, the old lady asked, “What do you have 

there?”  He said, “We have the dove here, we have the coconut tree, we have the mango tree.”  And 

the lady said, “I will have mango tree because it is sweet.”  That is how people make choices.  So 

coming back to the idea of having numbers in our ballot paper and as I have said, we have received 

submissions  and also  taken into account  most of  the things that we have  been arguing  about  this 

morning, the Committee is yet to deliberate on the things that we will look into.  

</span></p>
<p><span>On  the  Multinational  Observer  Group  (MOG)  Report  which  is  also  with  us,  I  think  their 

recommendations are also with the Committee and we are trying to synchronise it together with the 

various reports with us already.  Just to urge Honourable Members, there are also three Bills with the 

Committee  –  the  Electoral  (Registration  of  Voters)  (Amendment)  Bill  2020,  the  Political  Parties 

(Registration,  Conduct,  Funding  and  Disclosures)  (Amendment)  Bill  2020  and  Electoral 

(Amendment)  Bill  2020.    Some  of  the  changes  that  the  amendment  Bill  proposes,  probably  the

<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>463 

</span></p>
<p><span>Supervisor of Elections has also made an announcement recently where our voter registration card 

will be upgraded.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now,  if  you  have  your  voter  card,  you  will  have  your  EVR  number  but  this  particular 

upgraded one will also specify not only your address but also your polling station - that has been a 

problem where people did not confirm or clarify where they needed to vote and they ended up in the 

wrong polling station.  Those are some of the things that I wanted to say that it is all progressive work 

and we thank the Members of the Committee and also the drafters at the Solicitor-General’s Office 

who are currently working with us on the three Bills that are with us and also trying to bring in the 

opinion of the public and all that had made their submissions, and sitting down with the drafters and 

also looking into how we will best bring back those three Bills into the House.    

</span></p>
<p><span>But a big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu </span><span>to you, Sir, and also the Secretariat staff, our secretary; Ira and 

Jackson and also our IT officer, Mr. Miti Uculoa, and also the Hansard staff who have been working 

with us all around even during Christmas and New Year.  Probably next week, we will be calling for 

submissions in Suva for those who want to present their views, these are very big documents and I 

suggest that we read them and also participate.   

</span></p>
<p><span>As Honourable Members, I call upon everyone to assist in bringing people into these venues 

so  that  they  are  well  informed  on  the  things  that  needs  to  be  done.    These  are  very  informative 

sessions, where first the Committee tries to inform the submittees on what we are bringing to allow 

them to make submissions and to give their views on the Bills that we take around. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Those are some of the things that I would like to commend, contribute and also report on the 

current work that is there. This is progressive work, we still have other works that is in the Committee 

and we look forward when we bring that, and we will come and discuss in a very constructive manner.  

</span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, </span><span>Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Bulitavu for his contribution to the debate.  I give 

</span></p>
<p><span>the floor to the Honourable Attorney-General. You have the floor, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  I  would  like  to  thank  the 

Committee  for  its  work.    Of  course,  they  have  looked  at  a  number  of  areas  in  the  law,  I  do  not 

necessarily agree with all their recommendations or alternatively, a number of the recommendations 

that have already been made have been incorporated in the three Bills as Honourable Bulitavu who 

together  with  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  seem  to  be  making  the  most  constructive 

contributions in this particular debate.  But a lot of those issues that have been highlighted by MOG 

and the other Observer Groups, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact have been incorporated in those three Bills 

that are before Parliament.  I think some of the issues that have been raised obviously have become 

redundant because they have already been raised. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  highlight  a  number  of  issues.    I  seriously  cannot 

understand  why  the  Leader  of  NFP  cannot  understand,  as  an  academic,  the  separation  of  powers 

doctrine.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, all common law countries have the separation of powers.  The word itself 

“separation” means there is separation.  I cannot get any simpler than that.   

</span></p>
<p><span>What it essentially means, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is when the Judiciary, which is one of the arms 

of the State is carrying out its work, it is not answerable to this Parliament (the Legislature), nor is it 

answerable  to  the  Executive.    When  this  Legislature  is  doing  its  work  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  not 

answerable to the Judiciary, nor is it answerable to the Executive.   

</span></p>

<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Order! 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- When this Legislature makes laws - this arm of the State has 

the power to make laws - it does not mean it has the power to administer that law.  It does not mean 

it has the power to interpret the law but it goes before the Judiciary.  That is why there is a separation, 

so if the Parliament says, “Tomorrow, it is illegal to have people wearing rings.”  The Executive will 

actually enforce that law, the then Judiciary, if the person is charged will then actually interpret the 

law and apply the law.  That is how separation of powers functions.  Just because we have the power 

to make laws, it does not mean we have the power to interfere with the other arms of the State in the 

day to day operations.  It is very simple. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  wanted  to  obviously  make  and,  again,  he  is  so 

obsequious in his analysis.  The reality of the matter is, I do not really want to talk about it but he has 

opened up the door. I do not like talking about people who have passed away, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but, 

the Minister responsible for elections was the Prime Minister under the previous Constitution and it 

was the leader of SDL.  How more political can you get? In this particular instance, it was the leader 

of SDL, who is the Minister responsible. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the appointment of the Supervisor of Elections then, under the previous 

Constitution,  the  Constitutional  Officers  Commission  (COC)  had  to  consult  the  Minister.    In  this 

particular instance, the COC does not consult the Minister but consults the Electoral Commission. 

There is  a huge difference, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the position  of the Supervisor of Elections was 

actually advertised.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, there is a lot of misunderstanding about the difference in the 

various measures of elections. The Constitution actually talks about that the Electoral Commission 

has  a  responsibility  for  the  registration  of  voters  and  the  conduct  of  free  and  fair  elections,  in 

accordance with the written law governing elections. If you look at international benchmarks, in the 

early 1990s, the standards used then about free and fair but later on, the international community said 

that the standards of measure should be changed to what they call “credible elections”, so they looked 

at the entire process. They did not only look at the elections day itself, but they looked at the processes 

prior to that.  How were people registered? Were they allowed the opportunity to register or not? 

How were the ballot papers given out? Not the actual voting day itself. That is why the scope has 

been enlarged.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  none  of  the  Multinational  Observer  Groups  have  said  that  the  Fijian 

elections were not credible. They were credible, Mr. Speaker, and I had on the floor of this Parliament 

previously, as a matter of benchmark, raised this issue about the elections under the previous legal 

framework.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The EU Report which we have given out so many times, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and for the 2006 

Elections said that the legislative elections were reasonably conducted. Why, Mr. Speaker, Sir? It is 

because there are so many anomalies in those elections, so many glaring anomalies and I do not want 

to sort of list all of them but the fact of the matter is, those sorts of shenanigans do not actually happen 

anymore and I would like to highlight some of them, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The current five-member Electoral Commission … 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- A Point of Order! Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I would just like 

</span></p>
<p><span>to correct…  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order?

<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>465 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. ADI L. QIONIBARAVI.- The Point of Order is misleading the House, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. I would like to state in particular the MOG Report. What it stated was, it deemed this a credible 

election, however, they  also  stated, they noted the restrictions in  the electoral  environment.  They 

identified  the  compressed  timeframe  and  the  restriction,  especially  the  extremely  severe  penalty 

provisions, the legal framework of governing decrees which the parties content that render the 2014 

electoral environment unfree and unfair.   Thank you, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Honourable  Member  has  just  shot 

herself in the foot. The elections were deemed to be credible, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and let me get back 

to the point I was making.  It says about the Electoral Commission then, although it has the power to 

issue regulations, the Commission lacked the funding and staff as well as the initiative to become 

more  involved  in  the  2006  Elections.  Crucial  regulations,  the  duration  of  the  campaign  period, 

campaign  finance,  women’s  representation  and  a  code  of  conduct  for  political  parties  were  not 

introduced.  And, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes onto say, the lack of institutional knowledge due to the 

downsizing of the Office of the Supervisor of Elections during the inter-elections period, as well as 

the overly autonomous position of the four ROs (Returning Officers) led to partly incoherent and so 

implementation of procedures.  

</span></p>
<p><span>No guidelines were issued by the Office of the Supervisor of Elections on the recruitment 

criteria  for  polling  staff.  The  number  of  women  recruited  as  Assistant  Returning  Officers  and 

Presiding Officers were very limited and reflected the lack of policy guidelines. In breach of the 1998 

Electoral Act, the Register of Voters was not updated annually for the past five years, instead a new 

Register of Voters was compiled in 2005.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The new Register of Voters suffered from several shortcomings.  These included the: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span> </span><span>misspelling of voters’ names, wrong constituency allocations and the failure to register a 

</span></p>
<p><span>greater number of voters. 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>the Office of the Supervisor of Elections was not been able to meet the legally required time 

schedule to display the main voters’ roll in time for public scrutiny.  

</span></p>
<p><span>political parties discovered serious deficiencies on the roll and complained to the Office of 

the Supervisor of Elections and the Electoral Commission.   

</span></p>
<p><span>the  Office  of  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  had  undertaken  15,000  to  20,000  corrections, 

among them 3,000 raised by political parties. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list goes on.   The ballot papers printed had several deficiencies: 

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>The OSE contrary to the constitutional requirement, provided only ballot papers in English 

to the voters, thereby placing disadvantaged voters who were not literate in the vernacular, 

as it was required then. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The quality of the paper used was so poor that the official stamp on the back of the paper 

was visible on the front side, thereby obscuring some party symbols. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The OSE used old traditional wooden ballot boxes in three different sizes.  Although white 

plastic numbered tags were used to seal the lids, political parties complained that most ballot

<p><span>Review Report - Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report  

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>boxes still had sufficient gaps underneath the lids to allow a ballot paper to be inserted, even 

after it is locked. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list of preferences which had to be displayed was published one hour 

before  postal  voting  day.    I  just  wanted  to  highlight  these  because  a  number  of  these  have  been 

addressed.   

</span></p>
<p><span>There are so many to highlight, but I wanted to highlight one particular one, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  

Furthermore, the polling stations inquiry desks did not have copies of the main Register of Voters 

which contained information on all constituencies, but only voters’ registered for the constituencies 

for which the polling station issued ballot papers.   

</span></p>
<p><span>In cases there were too many or too few ballot papers in ballot boxes, officials decided in all 

observed  cases  to  accept  the  differences,  even  when  there  were  as  many  as  100  ballot  papers 

unaccounted for.  Furthermore, in one case, one automatic recount in Laucala Open Constituency 

where the final difference was only 11 votes, the invalid ballot papers were not re-verified since the 

ARO considered this  step out  of  the counting manual  as not  being part of the automatic recount.  

Unfortunately, the OSE only realised at the eleventh hour that its original planned practice, as detailed 

in the counting manual was in breach of the law.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is beautiful, the OSE did not provide an official explanation for a voter 

turnout of 101 percent in Cakaudrove East Constituency.  The Official Register of Votes, as the OSE 

stated,  7,639  registered  voters  in  the  constituency.  However,  the  Returning  Officer  (RO)  of  the 

Northern Division said that the total number of registered voters was 9,012.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to 

the late arrival of ballot papers and registers, voting in person started only one day late.  It goes on, 

Mr. Speaker, Sir. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The last point that I would like to make is, Honourable Gavoka talked about the voter turnout.  

There was a study and he was at that political party meeting, and I would like to talk about that later 

on which, I think, all of you need to read this because the Supervisor of Elections actually conducted 

a survey of voters and asked them why they did not vote and those who did not vote, what were the 

reasons for it and where was the source of information, but invalid votes is also important. 

</span></p>
<p><span>In  the  2006  Elections,  the  European  Union  observed  the  alarming  high  number  of  74,855 

invalid ballot papers or 9 percent of the total vote was mainly due to the strict Fijian electoral law 

which does not take the voter’s intention into consideration.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2014 and 2018 Elections, the invalid number of votes in 2014 was 

</span></p>
<p><span>0.75 percent, in 2018, the number of invalid votes was 0.92 percent. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue about party symbols that Honourable Bulitavu raised, that is an 

amendment to the Bill that we are talking about.  Party symbols will appear as proposed in the Bill 

on the Voter Instruction Booklet after the law is approved by Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make, 23 out of the 28 recommendations 

of MOG have already been implemented.  The Electoral Commission has its own budget.  It has hired 

its own legal counsel for representation.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of these changes are already taking place. I think the reality of the matter 

is  and  I  echo  the  sentiments  by  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  that  these  matters  were 

discussed when recently, NFP (I understand) was only represented by the secretariat as their leader

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report – Fijian Electoral Commission 2014 Annual Report

</span></p>
<p><span>was not there.    All the other parties were represented very well, SODELPA came in full force and 

the other parties were there also.   

</span></p>
<p><span>These  types  of  meetings  were  never  held  before  and  it  was  to  hear  from  the  respective 

individual political parties about some of the issues that they felt needed to be addressed.  They were 

actually raised, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, I think it would be most appropriate that when the three Bills 

come back to Parliament after the Committee have had their submissions, for us to be able to debate 

those proposals in respect of the amendments.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The reality of the matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that, the observer groups have said the elections 

were credible, the international communities has accepted them, there had been numerous changes 

being  made.  Honourable  Bulitavu  highlighted  some  very  critical  issues,  now  the  ballot  box,  if 

required, is taken to the voter not the voter taken to the ballot box; there is a huge difference.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we have specific provisions regarding disabled people, specific provisions regarding 

people who need to vote beforehand and in the law, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So we need to take account of 

the fact that enormous strides have been made. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The reality of the matter is, as I think, which was put very aptly by the Leader of Hope Party 

at that last meeting.  She said that if you want to participate in the Elections, it is your job as a political 

party to not actually whinge about it but support the laws that will make sure if people as you come 

and vote.     It  is  in  your  interest  to  do that.   It  is  not  in  your interest  for the three and half  years, 

condemn the system, condemn the law that you have come under and then go out and try and seek 

the vote and then complain in the same breathe, “oh, not enough people are voting.” 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is a paradox. It is actually an oxymoron. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  so  it  is  in  our  interest  to  ensure  and  everyone  wants  that.  Elections  are 

conducted fair and square, every electoral system in the world wants to improve their system. The 

Americans have a voter turnout of 51 percent sometimes, 64 percent sometimes.  Honourable Gavoka 

said that, that is the benchmark,.  In other words, the Americans had not had a proper elections.  Are 

we going to say that?  This is the point.  You cannot come here and pontificate about issues without 

actually  taking  a  nuance  approach  to  it.  We  have  to  understand  the  laws  that  are  operating,  the 

specifics of the country and how we can improve it; that is in our interest. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. 

</span></p>
