<h3>PRESENTATION OF REPORTS OF COMMITTEES</h3>
<p><span>Review Report on the 2017 Audit Report on the Economic Services Sector –  

Standing Committee on Public Accounts 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present the Committee’s review report on 

</span></p>
<p><span>the 2017 Audit Report on the Economic Services Sector.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Economic Services Sector included the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Fisheries 

and Forests, Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, 

Ministry of Sugar Industry, Ministry of Public Enterprises and Government Printing and Ministry of 

Local Government, Town and Country Planning and Environment.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Auditor-General  had  issued  three  unmodified  audit  opinion  and  four  modified  audit 

opinion to the various Ministries and Departments’ financial statements that were audited under this 

sector. It is important to note that Ministries and Departments that were scrutinised by the Committee 

were not invited for interview because of the COVID-19 restrictions that were in place at that time, 

but were requested instead to provide written responses on audit issues that were raised in the audit 

report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  noted  that  some  of  the  Ministries  had  addressed  some  of  the  audit  issues 

raised in the audit report while some were working towards resolving these internal control issues. 

The Committee strongly recommends that immediate action is required by the respective heads of 

these Ministries and Department in order to improve financial accountability within each Ministry.  

</span></p>
<p><span>I  sincerely  thank  all  the  Honourable  Members  of  the  Committee  for  their  valuable 

</span></p>
<p><span>contribution in the successful compilation of this bipartisan report, namely Honourable Alvick

</span></p>
<p><span>Resources, the Honourable Kirpal, to table his Report.  You have the floor, Sir.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Review Report on the Water Authority of Fiji 2016 Annual Report –  

Standing Committee on Natural Resources  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Committee’s  Review 

</span></p>
<p><span>Report on the Water Authority of Fiji 2016 Annual Report.  

</span></p>
<p><span>The Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) is a Commercial Statutory Authority that was formed by 

the  Government  of  Fiji  under  the  WAF  Promulgation  2007,  in  order  to  provide  environmentally 

sound, sustainable, efficient and effective water and wastewater services. The Committee noted that 

in 2016, the WAF revised its vision and mission statements and logo line to include sanitation. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee,  in  its  initial  deliberations,  focussed  on  the  overall  operations  of  the 

Authority, including the Authority’s functions and strategic objectives for 2016.  It was noted that in 

2016, WAF marked some major highlights and achievements, even through challenges such as the 

impact of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, which left a path of destruction.   However, the Authority’s concern was to 

keep clean, fresh water supplied to as many people as possible. 

</span></p>
<p><span>The Government’s 20 year National Development Plan, (NDP 2017- 2036) clearly defines 

WAF’s alignment to the national targets and, that is, to ensure that “Every Fijian has a right to clean 

and safe water in adequate quantities.”  For the urban areas, 100 percent access to clean and safe 

water  will  be  realised  by  2021  and  for  the  rural  and  maritime  areas  by  2030.    It  was  noted  that 

although the impact of the disastrous event continued to echo throughout the year, the Authority had 

to return to normal to carry out the planned projects assigned for 2016.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The  Committee  wishes  to  commend  the  Authority  on  its  Geographic  Information  System 

</span></p>
<p><span>(GIS).  The Unit was set up in 2012 and is responsible for capturing all WAF assets as a reference

</span></p>
<p><span>Ministerial Statement 

</span></p>
<p><span>10th Feb., 2021 

</span></p>
<p><span>point. The Unit has  recently developed into new heights in capturing all WAF assets in the three 

Divisions, respective to its water systems.  Likewise, with the increasing demands of water around 

the  country,  especially  in  Western  Division  where  resorts  and  hotels  are  being  constructed 

exponentially, technologies such as SCADA automation must be  adopted to properly manage this 

system.  

</span></p>
<p><span>Customer demand has also shifted whereby expectations to faster turnaround times, instant 

replacements and quick solutions are needed.   To create a quicker response time, WAF had some 

technologically advanced systems in place to help guide the staff for faster reaction.  The Standing 

Committee  on  Natural  Resources  has  conducted  the  review  of  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  2016 

Annual Report and recommends that Parliament takes note of the recommendations highlighted in 

the Committee’s Report. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Last but not the least, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the Honourable Members of the 

Committee who were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan report, namely; Honourable 

Jale Sigarara, Honourable Alexander O’Connor, Honourable Mitieli Bulanauca, Honourable Peceli 

Vosanibola and Honourable Jese Saukuru (Opposition Alternate Member).   

</span></p>
<p><span>With those few words, I hereby commend this Report to Parliament. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Please, hand the Report to the Secretary-General. 

</span></p>
<p><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General)
