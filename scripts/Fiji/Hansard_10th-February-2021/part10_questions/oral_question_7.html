<p>Role of NDMO - Raising Awareness and Educating People 

 (Question No. 26/2021)</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 

Maritime Development and Disaster Management inform Parliament on the role of NDMO 

in raising awareness and educating our people on how to prepare for natural disasters?</p>
<p>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU (Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, 

Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank 

the Honourable Member for the question.</p>
<p>Very quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the work of NDMO, again, I refer back to the Disaster Act of 

1998 and particularly, Section 81 and of course, Section 6 of the  Disaster Management Plan of 1995 

that guides the work of NDMO, particularly when it comes to awareness and educating our people 

on how to prepare for natural disasters.</p>
<p>In terms of raising awareness and educating our people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, specifically Section 

41 (2) of the Act also states that the NDMO shall be responsible for implementing, organising and 

coordinating public awareness activities.   Sir, in addition to this, the Act also stipulates that there be 

an annual National Disaster Awareness Week conducted prior to the beginning of the cyclone season.</p>
<p>That,  usually  is  launched  in  October  of  every  year.  But,  very  quickly  on  awareness,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir – one, there are activities organised by NDMO. I will briefly touch on those. But there 

are also three main committees under the National Disaster Council:</p>
<p>(1)Emergency Committee that sits often post-disaster to look at the emergency operations</p>
<p>and the response;</p>
<p>(2)Preparedness Committee; and 

(3)Mitigation and Awareness Committee.</p>
<p>I have stated about the work of NDMO but basically in these committees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

all Permanent Secretaries are divided amongst these three committees; the Emergency Committee, 

Preparedness  Committee  and  the  Mitigation  and  Prevention  Committee.    It  was  there  for  a  basic 

purpose, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that through their stakeholders these messages from the Disaster Council 

will trickle down to the communities that they work with.  For example agriculture, the Permanent 

Secretary has a responsibility to ensure that preparedness messages also go down to the farmers and 

likewise for all other ministries.</p>
<p>But not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have in the Council the Fiji Red Cross Society 

and  the  Fiji  Council  of  Social  Services.    These  are  our  two  key  partners  when  it  comes  to  the</p>
<p>Page 58</p>
<p>496</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>involvement  of  Civil  Society  Organisations,  faith-based  organisations  and  Non-Government 

Organisations as well. We have the shared responsibility of having this awareness.</p>
<p>Some of the strategies. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the media is a very effective tool of disseminating 

this information through the various platforms; TV.  In fact last year, Mr. Speaker Sir, late September 

before the launching of the National Disaster Awareness week in Ba which I will come to later, I 

launched the Media Awareness Campaign together with UNDP here in Suva and after the launching 

officials, the Permanent Secretary, the four Divisional Commissioners, the Director NDMO had turns 

on our TV, on our radio station programmes in the dissemination of information so that our people 

can prepare. Also in the print media, we also paid for a special advertisement, if I may say, on the 

preparedness that need to be given to the general public as well.</p>
<p>Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have pamphlets and flyers that are also paid for and 

distributed whenever we visit the rural communities. I remember when we went to Vatoa and Moala 

in Lau, we gave it to the school children and also to the parents.  A lot of these posters, if you go to 

the villages you will see how to, for example, prepare homes, in what needs to be in the home and 

even things like construction, how to do simple things like strapping, screws or nails on every grove.  

These are all the awareness messages that are also printed through flyers and booklets that we also 

distribute.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, social media is very, very important.  This is an area that we are engaged 

quite a lot particularly with the younger generation and also this year for the first time, we had a 

special  arrangement  withFacebookto  enhance  and  boost  awareness  on  disaster  preparedness.  I 

would say that this is a huge achievement and through this network,Facebook,Mr. Speaker, Sir, 

donated to us free coupons worth US$1,000 for boosting adverts and contents for disaster awareness 

on NDMO’sFacebookplatform.</p>
<p>That  is  one  of  the  strategies,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  particularly  the  media  apart  from  the 

committees and then we have the National Disaster Awareness Week. As I have stated, it is usually 

a one-week programme.  In 2018, it was held here in Suva, in 2019 it was held in Vanua Levu in 

Taveuni and lately in 2020 it was held in Ba.  Of course, we work in partnership with the Fiji Red 

Cross  Society,  Live  and  Learn,  the  Australian  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  New 

Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), 

the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  (UNOCHA),  the  United 

Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), World Food Programme (WFP), the World 

Food Programme, UN Women to name a few.</p>
<p>These are all the stakeholders, Mr. Speaker, Sir and part of that REACH programme we also 

visit the communities in the local area together with some demonstration on water rescue and a few 

other activities.  But let me also say here, Sir, that also we make very good use of the Government 

structure that is already in place as well particularly with the use of ourmata ni tikina, turagani koro,advisory councillors, the office of theRoko Tui, provincial councils and of course the Commissioners 

and other key stakeholders in the rural area.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge Live and Learn, not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also conduct 

training every year.  For 2020 we conducted about 400 trainings throughout Fiji.  The name of the 

programme is Community Based Disaster Risk Reduction (CBDR) and it was funded by Live and 

Learn and this is also a good opportunity for us to continue to advocate and raise awareness to our 

people because with this new norm, the level of information and preparedness is very, very critical 

if we are to minimise the losses and of course address some of the risks.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Jese  Saukuru  on  a</p>
<p>supplementary question.</p>
<p>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Minister for his explanation 

regarding  the  role  of  NDMO.    My  supplementary  question  is,  he  has  been  touring  the  Northern 

Division. How effective was their programme in communities they have conducted awareness and 

training in duringTC YasaandTC Ana?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  really  appreciate  that  we  have 

taken this initiative to conduct training in the communities. Even beforeTC Yasawe received even 

images from the villagers where the committee have already shifted the communities to safe places 

or to evacuation centres.  Even some have gone to the extent of having vests, hailer to assist them in 

performing this role. I would say very effective and we need to do more because it has really worked 

in the areas that we have already conducted in this training in.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  May I ask the Honourable Minister the 

process they follow to determine the precautions we need to take such as curfews.  Two weeks ago 

with a weather system threatening the country, we were told that curfew would be from Saturday 

until Monday which caused a lot of angst within our people and then it was changed to the normal 

curfew hours.  Can you explain how you go through the process to determine this precaution?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    First,  our  sincere 

apologies for the inconvenience caused because of the confusion and the implication of the decision 

that was based.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of curfew or other control measures like control movements, it is 

done in the interest of safety, that is first and foremost, apart from law and order and other concerns.  

We have a process and we take full responsibility too, the Office of the NDMO for that decision that 

was taken.</p>
<p>We base decisions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the forecasts that we are given.  Forecasts can be 

very accurate but forecasts also can be different from real life scenarios.  If we, for those that follow 

the weather forecasts, right at the centre there will always be the projected path but there will be on 

both sides of that path (on the extreme right and extreme left as well) the likelihood of the path (on 

the extreme right and extreme left as well), the likelihood of the path to sway according to the pressure 

and the environmental factors.  If we recallTC Yasa,Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially it was to make landfall 

on Viti Levu but what was interesting inTC Yasa, every six hours when there is an update from the 

Meteorological Office it continued to shift east, it continued to shift east.  So, it is working within 

the parameters that the forecasters have come up with.</p>
<p>So,  the  decision  on  the  curfew  that  was  taken,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  based  on  the  initial 

assessment that it will make landfall on Viti Levu and we know the situation in Viti Levu, particularly 

the informal settlements, squatters.  Based on the path and the timing, we worked out the timing from 

when it was going to make landfall and we know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that people will be in the towns 

and cities for markets and all the very reasons that we can come up with.  And working back from 

that, that was how the Police made the recommendations and of course we checked that together with</p>
<p>Page 60</p>
<p>498</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>the  forecast  and  we  agreed  on  that  initially.    But  that  changed  the  morning  after,  when  the  next 

forecast came in again.  It had shifted and of course the timing as well.  So, it is was from God as you 

know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and if it was from man, man can control it but it was from God, no one can 

do much about it but we take responsibility, we apologise for that but it is done in the interest of 

safety.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  We will move on to the eighth Oral Question for today and</p>
<p>I call on Honourable Kirpal to ask his question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
