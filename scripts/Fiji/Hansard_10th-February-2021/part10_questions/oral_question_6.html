<p>Counselling Support Provided to Teachers and Students  

(Question No. 25/2021)</p>
<p>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  inform  Parliament, 

what counselling support will be provided to the teachers and students affected byTC YasaandTC Ana?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- (Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir.  I rise to answer the question put to me through Honourable Pillay.  The question is asking, which 

support will be provided, but we have already started with our psychosocial support well before the 

school year commenced for this year.</p>
<p>When  we  talk  about  psychosocial  support,  this  normally  is  expected  after  disasters  and 

traumatic events and for us in the North, at the ground level when we went out and spoke to people, 

they said this is the first time for families in the North to experience a cyclone of such a nature and 

that is whatTC Yasatriggered us to activate our psychosocial support.</p>
<p>In terms of providing psychosocial support, the reason why we do that is to bring about a 

sense of normalcy, a sense of safety for our people, calming our people down, creating that social 

connectors that is needed and of course, hope.  While I am talking of hope, I  tried toGooglethe 

colour for hope and the colour for hope is yellow.  I would have expected us to unite by wearing 

colour yellow whenTC YasaandTC Anawere affecting our people, but today when I looked around, 

I see red, I thought valentine’s is today, then I realised valentine’s is on Sunday.  So, if I can urge our 

people in times of disasters and traumatic events, let us all unite and wear yellow so that our people 

know we are there to care for them, the whole nation expected us to unite.  I am really disappointed 

that we did not unite to assist when our nation needed our help and here we are uniting for one course, 

but then that is the choice people make.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we provide psychosocial support, we help change our people become 

active survivors rather than passive victims.  SoTC Yasawas, like I said, the first experience for our 

people in the North and it did not just take away the homes of the people, it took away livelihoods.   

While  the  families  tried  to  put  their  lives  back  together,  we,  the  Ministry  concentrated  on  the 

traumatic  impact  that  had  on  the  children  which  probably  would  have  gone  unnoticed.    As  a 

Government,  we  coordinated  with  the  NDMO,  Commissioner’s  Office  and  a  lot  of  NGOs  and 

individuals to assist families with food and rebuilding.  As a Ministry, it was our responsibility to 

ensure that our children got the support in dealing with the trauma so they had some normalcy in 

lives and their learning was not seriously hampered.</p>
<p>Sir,  small  things  like,  on  my  way  to  Lekutu,  I  stopped  over  at  one  school  in  Nasarawaqa 

because our students were in the learning spaces, I walked into the classroom and the kids were all 

happy, so  I started talking to them.  But when I looked around there was a small boy sitting in a 

corner, this was like a Year 7 boy.  The first thing I noticed was that, he was in civilian clothes that</p>
<p>Page 55</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>493</p>
<p>is one thing that we did, we allowed children to come back.  So, I took the teacher aside and asked, 

what is the issue here?</p>
<p>I was told that his family lost everything and when I looked at the kid closely, he was so sad. 

I did not want to pick on him, so we took him outside and asked; “what do you need?”  He said, “we 

need shoes and there are four other siblings.”  Simple things like that and we told the teachers to be 

mindful, to pick up the signs of those children who would not be willing to be in school but probably 

forced to come to school through parents, et cetera.  Sir, small help like that was given, not only by 

the Ministry, but a lot of NGOs.</p>
<p>But  well  before  school  started,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  engaged  our  Substance  Abuse  and 

Advisory Council, Medical Service Pacific and Empower Pacific, the correctional service and our 

seven recently trained full counsellors in the North to conduct counselling support programme in the 

Northern Division from 18th to 29th January this year, and this was for teachers and students.</p>
<p>There were various methods used by this organisation and we found out that the children were 

very quick to respond to the counselling tactics, while the teachers were probably still down with the 

trauma of losing their homes, their quarters and the rest of their stuff.  The programme was conducted 

in 22 northern schools which included 16 primary schools, 5 secondary schools and 1 special school.  

Our counsellors attended to about 1,938 students and 207 teachers in theTC Yasaaffected area.</p>
<p>The  Ministry,  for  the  first  time,  has  collaborated  with  the  Australian  Government  and 

provided 35 teachers from the Central, Western and Northern Divisions an opportunity to undertake 

a Diploma in Counselling delivered by the Australian Pacific Training Coalition (APTC).  All these 

35 teachers had graduated with a Diploma on 11th January, 2021.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand that the two recent cyclones have emotionally and financially 

impacted the lives of our families, teachers and students.  That is why the first week of re-opening 

our schools was to allow our teachers and students to settle into their classroom environment.  We 

are  currently  working  with  the  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  (DFAT)  to  run  a  pilot 

programme  in  the  Northern  Division  as  soon  as  the  North  opens.    With  our  recently  graduated 

counsellors and trained psychologists based at DFAT, DFAT has helped us prepare a counselling kit 

which  includes  materials  such  as  toys,  counselling  aid,  postures  for  our  students  that  will  be 

distributed to selected schools as part of the Student Support Service Pilot Programme.</p>
<p>Counselling  will  need  to  continue  for  some  time  and  we  intend  to  put  our  seven  trained 

counsellors in clusters and reduce the teaching loads, so they can attend to students and teachers from 

the  schools  in  their  cluster.    A  total  of  350  heads  of  schools  have  also  undergone  training  in 

counselling and we expect them to take a lead role in providing support to their students and teachers.  

We also plan to conduct further trainings for all our heads of schools.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at holding discussions with our teacher training institutions 

to request that they include counselling as part of the teachers training programmes.  In this way, we 

will systematically train all our teachers who graduate in the future to be able to provide the ongoing 

support to our students.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Niko Nawaikula, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- When these counsellors were conducting their counselling, were</p>
<p>they fully trained, or not?</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Because they graduated in January.  That is after the cyclone, were</p>
<p>they fully trained at that time, or not?</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- No.  Then how come they graduated in January?</p>
<p>(Honourable Members interject)</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  counselling  is  very  important.    It  requires</p>
<p>qualified people, not just any Tom, Dick and Harry.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What about Mary? You forgot about Mary.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very interesting, yes.  All 35 teachers graduated</p>
<p>with a Diploma on 11th January, 2021.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, courses completed well before graduation and seven of these counsellors 

were from the North.  The school was supposed to start on 20th January, we started our counselling 

from 18th January, well after they had graduated.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Salote Radrodro?</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Honourable Minister for 

Education.  I find it very hard to believe what she had mentioned because I, for one, have visited 

communities  afterTC  Yasaand  if  the  Honourable  Minister  can  enlighten  us  which  particular 

organisation specialises in counselling undertook this psychosocial counselling because I never met 

any of the Ministry of Education officials during that time, afterTC Yasa?</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister enlighten us, which particular organisation that specialises in 

counselling knowing that all the counsellors in schools have been withdrawn had undertaken this, or 

are you still planning for them and the children have not gone to school yet? At that point in time, 

they were home.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think they do not listen to media and probably read 

the  wrong  media  reports.    School  started  on  20th  January  and  I  have  said  it.    It  was  a  record 

attendance. We had 95 percent  students  attending school  in  the first  week and  I did  say  we have 

completed 22 schools. I did not say we completed all the schools. The North has close to 10,000-plus 

students, so we have completed 22 schools. Let me be more …</p>
<p>(Honourable Member interjects)</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- I cannot give you the names of the schools but Mr. Speaker, Sir …</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Order!</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- ... the programme was conducted in 22 Northern schools, 16 primary 

schools, five secondary schools and one special school.  I can give you the names probably in the</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>next session. We attended to 1,938 students and 207 teachers within these areas.  Not the whole of 

the North was affected, maybe the communities, Honourable Radrodro visited, we will still do it.</p>
<p>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Organisations?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Empower Pacific, Medical Services Pacific and of course, our trained,</p>
<p>seven trained counsellors that graduated from APTC – an Australian-accredited institution.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on.</p>
