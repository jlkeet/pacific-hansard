<p>Market Price Gouging  

(Question No. 21/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Given that price gouging is a market occurrence during times of disaster and crisis, 

can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform Parliament 

on the prevalence of the issue of price gouging pre and postTC YasaandTC Anaand the 

steps that were undertaken to minimise it?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Thank you, Mr.</p>
<p>Speaker, Sir.  I thank the Honourable Member for the question.</p>
<p>The past one year has been one of the most very difficult for our country and the economic 

devastation that has been caused by COVID-19 pandemic and has affectively crippled our highest 

income earner, the tourism sector.  Thousands of Fijians have lost their jobs and thousands are put 

on reduced working hours.  Whilst the Government was gearing towards rebuilding the economy and 

the new normal, Mr. Speaker, Sir, mother nature wreaked yet another havoc on our nation.</p>

<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,TC YasaandTC  Anahave  actually  destroyed  critical  infrastructure  and 

damaged households, risked our children’s education and displaced many.  To make it worse, these 

two cyclones were actually hit almost a month after each other.</p>
<p>One of the very first things that actually comes to mind, Mr. Speaker, Sir, post and often pre 

disaster  is  actually  the  price  gouging,  rightfully  so,  because  families  who  would  have  lost  their 

belongings and they worry about the availability of and price of essential commodities such as gas 

and basic food items.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a responsible Government, we have actually invested in and empowered 

agencies such as the Consumer Council of Fiji (CCoF) and the Fijian Competition and Commerce 

Commission (FCCC).  As such, due to policy actions by the Government and diligent action by our 

consumer protection agencies, the actual number of gouging cases reported to CCoF pre and postTC 

Yasawas six, out of which the Council has actually resolved five other cases, all with favourable 

outcomes.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCCC actually received complaints of price gouging in the 

Northern Division, which were acted on immediately and there were some retailers increasing the 

price of specific items such as food, batteries, torches, battery-operated live bulbs and solar operating 

items,  even  generators.    This  is  mainly  common  for  unregulated  items,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    For 

example, the solar battery-operated light would cost around $10 to $15 in normal circumstances, but 

postTC Yasa,this price increased to up to about $29 for the same product, and in some instances 

there was no price marking at all on the goods.</p>
<p>As  I  pointed  out  earlier,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  price  gouging  is  actually  prevalent  in  most 

countries around the world during times of disaster and for us we have been able to keep these types 

of  conduct  under  close  watch  and  control  and  this  is  a  testament  of  the  effectiveness  of  our 

collaborative actions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this actually demonstrates the effectiveness of the Consumer 

Council of Fiji and FCCC which actually ensures that the interest of the Fijian consumers are always 

put first and promotes effective competition and informed markets.  I hope that answers the question.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  You have the floor.</p>
<p>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    A  supplementary  question  to  the 

Honourable Minister.  Can the Honourable Minister inform this august House, are there any plans to 

merge Consumer Council of Fiji and the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission as their roles 

are similar and complementary?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the role of CCoF and FCCC slightly differ in the sense 

that Consumer Council is more of an awareness and advocacy agency of the Government, whereas  

FCCC has an enforcement role.  However, Sir, as correctly pointed out, the roles of the two agencies 

actually  complement  each  other,  but  the  initial  assessments  are  underway  on  how  best  the  two 

agencies can actually work together.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister.  Honourable Members, I now give the</p>
<p>floor to the Honourable Tikoduadua to ask his question.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
