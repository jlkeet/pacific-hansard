<p>FNPF Members with Zero Balance 

(Question No. 22/2021)</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Ministerfor Economy, Civil Service and Communications inform 

Parliament of Government’s plans with respect to the 60,000 Fiji National Provident Fund 

members with zero balance in their accounts?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and Communications).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would like to thank the Honourable Member 

for his question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of zero balance is not something new, of course, and this relates 

to members whose accounts are active. Sir, in 2002, the FNPF reported that 56,028 members had 

zero balances. This figure is a total sum of those with zero balances inherited over the years since the 

Fund began operations in 1966.  This also not only unique to FNPF, it is a common problem seen 

across  many  superannuation  funds  around  the  world  and  indeed  the  region.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of 

course, commercial banks deal with this too.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of members with zero balance currently stands at 59,751, 6.6 

percent more than what was reported in 2002. To put this into context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 

generally two main reasons behind the zero balance and we are talking about people who are actively 

working.</p>
<p>Firstly, the bulk or 76 percent of these accounts are due to inconsistent contributions where 

members make perhaps, only one or few contributions then leave the formal workforce. Sometimes, 

the employers would ask them to get an FNPF number, they may work for them for one year and 

then they leave. Again,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, all members of FNPF are covered for the special death 

benefit where $35 is deducted annually for a $8,500 death benefit cover. Over time, of course, if 

someone has only made contributions  of say  a $100 or $200, with  the deduction of that then the 

amount will get depleted.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second reason, the balance of the 24 percent of those with zero balance 

accounts  of  members  that  registered  and  have  made  absolutely  no  contributions  towards  their 

accounts.  So, for example, you have sometimes voluntary members, someone may come along as a 

volunteer and may say, “I want to open up an account”, they start up with say, $50 and then they do 

not come back again and we have seen that happen.</p>
<p>In terms of the age, 40 percent of 23,136 with zero balance accounts are over 55 years old. 

Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about 18,000 members of the 59,571 members have had no transactions in 

their accounts for over 10 years or more.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a high probability that some members are no longer in employment 

and may have migrated or some could have potentially died and the records have not been kept up-

to-date.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to note that the FNPF only closes a member’s account 

when he or she comes forward to fully withdraw from the Fund. In light of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the</p>

<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>487</p>
<p>FNPF Board is currently looking at related policy intervention to address the issue of zero balance 

and will explore options that will allow the Fund to –</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Terminate membership of those aged 55 years and have zero balance accounts as there is 

a high probability that these members are no longer in employment.  

Terminate membership for those with no transaction over 10 years for those below 55 

years. 

Deactivate  accounts  for  those  with  no  transactions  for  more  than  five  years,  cancel 

membership of no contributions received after a lapse of 12 months from the membership 

startup date.  

To review minimum deposit amount to those wishing to open a new FNPF account and 

members who have registered and have not made any contributions will be contacted, 

advised  on  the  importance  of  contributing  to  their  accounts  and  encouraged  to  make 

regular contributions even if it is a few dollars. It will also add to their savings and earn 

interest.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    Honourable  Leawere,  you  have  the</p>
<p>floor.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Honourable Minister, for the response. Just a question 

to the Honourable Minister, are there plans to invest internationally in order to boost these members’ 

contributions? Are there any plans with the Fund to boost the members’ contributions or offshore 

investment?</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So, the question is, if the FNPF is investing offshore.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Yes, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Yes,  they  have  some  accounts  offshore  already  at  the</p>
<p>moment.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- To assist the members.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sorry.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- In order to assist the members, Mr. Speaker, Sir?</p>
<p>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sorry,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  the  question  is  those</p>
<p>members who are offshore and have zero balances.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Could you repeat your question so we can be all clear?</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is, are there plans in place by the 

FNPF to assist those members with their contributions by investing internationally like offshore to 

boost their contributions.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- FNPF does invest offshore.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Aseri Radrodro, you have the floor.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>10th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  supplementary  question.  I  think  the 

Honourable Member’s first question was to enquire whether the Government will explore options to 

boost or increase the balances of those that are currently with zero balances.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- To increase the…</p>
<p>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Probably that is the line of question that has been asked.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I did not get it.</p>
<p>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  Whether the Government will explore options to  increase the</p>
<p>balances of those that are currently with zero balances?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just ask your supplementary question, forget him.</p>
<p>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A supplementary question to the 

Honourable Minister, you have mentioned about the existence of these zero balances, are you looking 

at any timeline on when and you will attend to sort of clean up the system in terms of accounts (ghost 

membership)?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to exorcise the ghosts from 

FNPF completely and this is part of the process. As I have highlighted, the management at FNPF is 

looking at cleaning up the system, in particular, those people, they see this general trend, a lot of 

people open up accounts, a lot of people, for example,  who go into their own business. So in the 

beginning they think it is a good idea, I will set aside my 8 percent or 10 percent and I will contribute 

as my savings, but as they start their business, they think, “well, I better not do it, I can still save it 

on the side”; so a lot of people do, do that. They start up their accounts and yet they do not continue.  

So those accounts have actually continued and FNPF obviously needs to clean that up in particular 

to also ensure that the books are truly reflective of the active members.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. We will move on to the fourth Oral Question for today. I call</p>
<p>on the Honourable George Vegnathan to ask his question. You have the floor, Sir.</p>
