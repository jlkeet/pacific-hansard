<h3>HERITAGE BILL 2021</h3>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHIAYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 

</span></p>
<p><span>That the -

</span></p>
<p><span>(e)</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>Heritage Bill 2021 (Bill No. 3/20221) be considered by Parliament without delay; 

Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 

Bill must be immediately referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 

Rights; 

Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the May sitting of Parliament and that upon 

presentation of the report on the Bill by the Standing Committee, the Bill must be debated 

and voted upon but; 

one hour be given to debate the Bill with the right of reply given to me as the Member 

moving this motion.   

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will be very brief.    The Heritage  Bill 

2016 was tabled as Bill No. 10 of 2016 for the First Reading on 9th February, 2016, that was during 

the last term of Parliament.  The 2016 Bill was developed to provide for the domestic application of 

the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and National Heritage which was 

adopted at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization commonly known 

as UNESCO, at their General Conference in 1972.  Fiji became a State party to the World Heritage 

Convention on 21 November, 1990.   

</span></p>
<p><span>The 2016 Bill  was later  moved in  Parliament for a second reading on 25 April, 2016 and 

referred to the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for review.  The review report on the 2016 Bill 

was not tabled by the Standing Committee during the last term of Parliament and as a result the 2016 

Bill lapsed in accordance with Standing Order 97(2) of the Standing Orders.  Following the lapse of 

the 2016 Bill, the Department of Heritage and Arts held further consultations and revised the 2016 

Bill.   

</span></p>
<p><span>Fiji as a State party to the World Heritage Convention is required under the World Heritage 

Convention  to  adopt  legislative  and  administrative  provisions  to  give  effect  to  World  Heritage 

Convention.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, quite a lot of work has already been done  and this Bill 

essentially tends to finish the work it started in 2016, domesticate the World Heritage Convention in 

Fiji thus the reference to the Standing Committee and to be brought back in May.  Thank you, Sir.  

</span></p>
<p><span>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General.    Honourable  Members,  the 

floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply 

from the mover.  The floor is open, if anyone is wishing to take the floor.  If there is no one wishing 

to take the floor, Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I have nothing further to add, Sir.  Thank you. 

</span></p>
<p><span>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Question put. 

</span></p>
<p><span>Motion agreed to.
