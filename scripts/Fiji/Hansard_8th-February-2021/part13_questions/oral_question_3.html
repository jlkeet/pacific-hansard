<p>Current Status of TELS and NTS 

 (Question No.  05/2021)</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I seek your leave in terms of, looking 

at the question on today’s Order Paper.  It is to do with the National Toppers Scheme.  If allowance 

can be made for me to ask that question based on the National Toppers Scheme.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He wants to change the question, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No change, no change.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, it is okay.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- You have the floor. Do not listen to the others.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service and 

Communications  update  Parliament  on  the  current  status  of  the  Tertiary  Education  Loan 

Scheme (TELS) and National Toppers Scheme (NTS)?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you, Honourable Member.  That is pretty clear.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM (Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service 

and Communications).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We had a discussion at morning tea time and</p>
<p>Page 51</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>351</p>
<p>the Honourable Member does not want to ask about TELS as I did ask him what exactly he wanted 

to know.  As he had indicated, he wants to know about the recent publicity surrounding the Toppers 

issue which we had resolved.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Honourable Member is aware and was widely reported in the media 

that there was some, unfortunately, miscommunication by the TSLB management in respect of the 

administration  of  the  Toppers  Scheme.    Fundamentally  just  to  highlight  some  of  the  key  issues, 

because we had to also look at it from a legal perspective.  A Topper has to maintain a grade or a 

GPA of 3.  If a Topper goes below that, the Topper is then put on a notice to say, “we are going below 

3,  please  perform  well  otherwise  you  will  be  suspended.”    If  they  do  not  perform,  then  they  are 

suspended.  When they are suspended, then they go onto TELS.  If they perform when they are on 

TELS, they can come back to Toppers, so the manner in which the notice was given to the individuals, 

the notice was actually not given to the individual students.  The management of TSLB did a blast 

message and what we said it was administratively unfair to do a blast message.</p>
<p>Out of all you, four or five do not perform well, we should contact you individually.  That 

was the main issue.  Because some of the students argued and perhaps not necessarily appropriately, 

but they said, “If we had been given individual notices, we would have performed better.”  That was 

why we said that anyone that was suspended as a result of been given a blast message, they no longer 

will be suspended, they will be given the opportunity to carry on and all these Toppers will be given 

the opportunity to individually liaise with the management team.</p>
<p>That was one particular issue itself.  The other issue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just as an aside, that 

in fact emerged, is that the two Universities in particular have different GPA systems.  For example, 

the GPA of USP, USP’s maximum is 4.5 whereas FNU’s maximum is 5.  So if you say that 3 is 

applicable to everyone, then those whose maximum GPA is 5, obviously in a  way is benefitting.  

That is one of the issues we have actually asked the Board of TSLB to look at how we can bring 

about some equity or level playing field in that respect.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they were the sort of key issues and I would like to thank, of course, the 

new TSLB Board for their co-operation.  They met up with the students also.  They have also asked 

the management to carry out some new changes.  We also found that just in the recent past, the TSLB 

management had not necessarily applied all the contracts equally because when you are a Topper, 

you actually sign a contract and the contract does say that if you get suspended as a Topper, you are 

entitled to TELS.  It still gets paid for but it is by way of a loan.  If you are a Topper, you do not pay 

back anything.  You simply have to work in Fiji for a particular period of time.  You do not even 

have to work for the Government, you can work anywhere else.  As long as you work in Fiji, you are 

contributing to  your country.  So, we found a couple of cases where the TSLB management, Mr. 

Speaker, Sir, had not applied the contract correctly, so that is also being rectified, that particular issue.  

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General.    Honourable  Leawere,  on  a</p>
<p>supplementary question, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  In terms of labour market needs, is 

there a system in place to determine students who are applying for this particular area?  Is there a 

training  need  analysis  that  the  TSLB  has  established  for  the  students  to  apply?    Thank  you,  Mr. 

Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Honourable Member for the 

question.  As announced in the Budget, given the current economic situation, apart from this sort of 

financial imperatives, there is also the job demand imperative.  So for example, if there is a glut in</p>
<p>Page 52</p>
<p>352</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>doctors,  we  do  not  necessarily  give  any  Toppers  for  doctors  if  there  are  too  many  doctors.    For 

example, we have never given Toppers for lawyers, they can become a lawyer but they get TELS.</p>
<p>Obviously the tourism sector will take about three years to four years to get back to the state 

that we were in, hopefully God-willing, we get back the same numbers.  So obviously we reduce the 

number of scholarships in the tourism sector because for them to do a course and then not to have a 

job because the tourism sector will not bounce back as quickly to the level it was.  So that is how we 

make those adjustments.</p>
<p>In respect of the qualifying mark for TELS, for Year 13 for this year was raised from 200 to 

250 marks to ensure people actually work hard and get those marks itself.  So, assessments are done 

- the Ministry of Education, the economic planning people in the Ministry of Economy liaise with 

the Ministry of Employment, look at the market itself, what are the areas in which there are jobs or 

there  are  no  jobs  and  that  is  how  it  is  tailored  to  be  able  to  ensure  that  people  who  are  on  these 

schemes actually get work easily.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you. Honourable Nawaikula, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Can the Honourable Minister clarify for both Toppers and TELS, 

whether the full extent of what was promised by the Government still applies or has it been reduced 

or there is none at all?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could please seek your indulgence.  I 

actually  do  not  understand  what  the  Honourable  Member  is  asking.    If  he  can  give  a  bit  more 

clarification then I can answer it.</p>
<p>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  am  basically  asking  clarification  for  new  applicants  for  both 

TELS  and  Toppers.    Is  the  full  extent  still  on  or  reduced  or  now,  it  is  totally  private  for  anyone 

wishing to apply?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General.</p>
<p>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Toppers  and  TELS  were 

introduced, the scheme is still there but as I highlighted, the numbers have changed.  So, for example, 

in last year’s budget we announced, going forward any new Toppers scholarships, the numbers have 

reduced, so we are giving to more priority areas.  The numbers have reduced but those people who 

are awarded TELS or Toppers, they obviously have to continue, we are still paying for them.  Just in 

terms of the statistics, I have the statistics here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.</p>
<p>Since  the  inception  of  TELS  and  Toppers,  we  have  a  total  of  48,579  students  who  have 

benefitted from the various scholarship programmes to date.  This consists of 43,604 under the TELS 

and 4,095 under the National Toppers Scheme.   There is about 880 who were beneficiary of various 

other schemes, some of the older ones, they had to continue and then finished.    To date, Government 

has spent a total of $747.2 million of which $525.7 million was for TELS and $165.9 million for the 

National Toppers Scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 10,004 inactive students are those who are currently not enrolled 

for any programme of study but can be re-activated when they return to undertake further studies. So 

there is an opportunity to reactivate the studies for those who have stopped.  For example, Technical 

College students who took mechanical and electrical courses, they may have been given a full time</p>
<p>Page 53</p>

<p>job during the attachment period. We have people like that.  So when they do electrical course, they 

may go out on a work experience and people hire them, so they do not necessarily finish their course 

but they start working but they can come back and finish their course under the same programme 

later on should they wish to do so.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  The last oral supplementary question. You have the floor,</p>
<p>Honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa.</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- In terms of policies and procedures on the Toppers Scheme, how is</p>
<p>the review done on that, Mr. Speaker?</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- In the numbers or the policies?</p>
<p>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- In the policies and procedures.</p>
<p>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned earlier on, when we 

had a meeting with the new TSLB Board, they have undertaken to do a full review, it was put out 

also in the press release and do proper audits also. In respect of the implementation of the Government 

policies, I think it is not just necessarily peculiar to TSLB.</p>
<p>In some of the other agencies where Government has made a particular policy announcement, 

we find that people who are at the coal face of implementing it sometimes actually let us down.  They 

do not necessarily follow it to its full let out to the full policy intent. So we have asked the Board to 

look at all the policies and ensure that it is in compliance not just only with Government policies but 

in terms of natural justice and procedural fairness.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.- Thank  you, we will move on. The sixth Oral Question for today, I give</p>
<p>the floor to the Honourable Rohit Sharma to ask Question No. 6/2021. You have the floor, Sir.</p>
