<p>(Question No.  02/2021)</p>
<p>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport explain 

what  assistance  is  available  for  MSMEs  in  Fiji,  especially  in  light  of  the  COVID-19 

pandemic,TC YasaandTC Ana?</p>
<p>HON. F.S. KOYA (Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport).- Mr. Speaker, 

Sir, I would like to thank the Honourable O’Connor for his question.  It is an extremely pertinent one 

because it concerns the vast majority of Fijians and the most vulnerable at that.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  a  known fact  that Micro,  Small  and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) 

actually play a critical role in progressing the economy as a catalyst for nation building.  According 

to  a  2019  World  Bank  Report  it  is  estimated  that  MSMEs  contribute  more  than  60  percent  to 

employment in low and high income countries. In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, during pre-COVID times it 

was estimated that MSMEs contributed about 18 percent to GDP and 60 percent to the labour force.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has always and will continue to have our MSMEs 

and grass root communities at heart, this is actually clearly spelled out in our National Development 

Plan to promote entrepreneurial culture through sustainable micro, small and medium enterprises.  

MSMEs operate across all economic sectors whether formally or informally and they actually remain 

at the pulse of a nation. The pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, compounded withTC YasaandTC Anahave tested our resilience, our grit and our determination as Fijians like never before.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am confident that under the leadership of our Honourable Prime Minister 

we  will  steer  clear  of  these  turbulent  waters  and  the  revival  and  continued  strengthening  of  the 

MSMEs will play a crucial role.  Whilst we remain focused on achieving this strategic goal of</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>promoting entrepreneur  culture amongst  the MSMEs, we have remodelled and  rethought  ways to 

actually achieve this and these unprecedented times require unprecedented and innovative solutions.</p>
<p>In addition to our ongoing programme such as the Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES), 

the  National  Export  Strategy  (NES),  the  Integrated  Human  Resources  Development  Programme 

(IHRDP) and the Northern Development Programme (NDD), the Fijian Government for the first time 

offered loan packages to MSMEs.  These loans at very concessionary rates ranging from 0.5 percent 

to  1.5 percent  and this fills the void  that was  actually left by commercial banks and offers much 

needed cash injections of up to about $21,000.</p>
<p>The loan packages, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were also offered to Fijians who were actually laid off 

due to COVID-19 and wished to venture into entrepreneurship.  This initiative bought together the 

public and private sector and public sector experts provided the much needed commercial input into 

the assessment process whilst the Government provided the actual funding.   I thank the members of 

Business Assistance Fiji who laboured for free to ensure our MSMEs remained afloat.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the 9,000 plus loan applications received, approximately 98 percent 

have been assessed with close to about $30 million loan by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services.  

Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is $30 million of direct cash injection into the economy.  This is a positive and 

a very remarkable achievement.  However, I wish to remind this august House that this is actually a 

loan and meaning that this money will need to be repaid after a grace period about a year and we 

expect these MSMEs to honour this arrangement.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to the concession loans the Ministry through various MSME 

programmes has funded over 830,000 MSME projects in various sectors.  The Ministry through the 

MSME Fiji and Co-operative Schemes offers business-savvy training which has helped  more than 

2,000 odd businesses in actually understanding their costs, pricing, the planning and forecast  and 

post disaster business recovery, and we will continue to provide mentoring and guidance.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also set up a dedicated Hotline/Help  Line which is 9986014 to 

allow the public to access MSME related information and advice.  In addition the business related 

guide is available on the BizFiji portal and we will continue to remain engaged with our MSMEs on 

a daily basis through routine visits.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Cooperatives team have just returned from Cicia.  Last week 

they undertook business advisory and monitoring, and also registered a women based cooperative 

that actually processed virgin coconut oil and will diversify into retail soon.  So we hope to further 

assist these cooperatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by locking them into the Fijian Made family to provide 

great market access.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what my Ministry is doing for MSMEs, we are not sitting in the comfort of 

our offices.  We are actually here to serve the Fijian businesses and we will continue to do so and 

given our feet and heart is closely planted to the ground will make more meaningful impact and we 

cannot do this alone. That is why we will continue to dialogue with our development partners and 

relevant Ministries to assist. Just recently, the Ministry participated in the UN Food and Agriculture 

Organisation Country Programme and Framework review where we discussed new opportunities to 

strengthen agro tourism and these are new innovative ways to continue to evolve and MSMEs need 

to take stock and be ready for business and we actually open our borders.</p>
<p>The  Ministry  actually  plans  to  submit  more  project  proposals  in  conjunction  with 

international  aid  division  of the Ministry of  Economy, to  donor agencies  emphasising the role of 

MSMEs in agriculture and tourism.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>347</p>
<p>Our support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will continue and more so in light of theTC YasaandTC Ana,especially in the North through the NDP will be processing applications and releasing funds soon.</p>
<p>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  been  very  proactive  and  once  again  have  partnered  with 

International Finance Corporation to conduct the business in fact survey, postTC Yasaand based on 

the preliminary results from more than about 1,500 respondents that is estimated that businesses have 

suffered around more than 25 million odd dollars in losses and damages.</p>
<p>All  in  all,  despite  our  hard  times,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  remain  positive  and  forward 

looking with the right support in targeted areas will continue to create an enabling environment for 

MSMEs and the wider business community.</p>
<p>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in going forward, we have a number of reforms that will continue 

to improve the business environment, especially for MSMEs and we are working on the finalisation 

of the MSME Investment Bill and the amendments to the Cooperative Act.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, I intend to make a Ministerial Statement later on this week, in which we will 

elaborate in a critical role the Ministry has actually playing in economic recovery.  I thank you, Sir.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  his  statement  and  reply  to  the 

question.  Honourable Minister, I must welcome you back to the House. You are looking trim, slim 

but I leave it at that.</p>
<p>Honourable  Members,  the  third  Oral  Question  for  today  is    supposed  to  be  asked  by  the 

Honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu but it will be  instead, asked by the Honourable Tabuya.  You 

have the floor, Madam.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I was  hoping to have the opportunity for 

supplementary questions in the previous question by the Honourable Minister,  I just want to clarify 

if that is still available, Sir?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.-  I think  you should just take this  question now.  You have to  be quick</p>
<p>regarding this, to take the question that you have now.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, Sir.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.-  You have the pleasure of speaking in place of the Honourable Leader of</p>
<p>Opposition and you should take that.</p>
<p>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Very well, Sir.</p>
