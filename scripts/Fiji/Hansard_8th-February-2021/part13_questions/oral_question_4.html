<p>Damaged Schools and Contingency Plans 

 (Question No.  06/2021)</p>
<p>HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice:</p>
<p>Can the Honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts inform Parliament on 

the number of schools that have been damaged fromTC YasaandTC Anaand the contingency 

plans that have been as a result of those damages?</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR (Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts).- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 

Sir. I rise to answer Question No. 6/2021 on the Order Paper. I would like to thank the Honourable 

Member for this question.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir,TC Yasacaused damage to about 126 schools in the Northern, Eastern and 

Western  Divisions  directly  affecting  12,400  students  and  890  teachers.  To  break  it  down,  this 

includes  23 early childhood centres, 11 standalone EC  centres, 73 primary schools, 90 secondary 

schools and of course this also included some of our teachers’ quarters.</p>
<p>The survey and the assessment done brought to our forefront that most of the buildings that 

were affected byTC Yasawere very old in structures apart from Yadua Primary School that was built</p>
<p>Page 54</p>
<p>354</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>in 2018.  It could be said that most of the buildings were not in a state to withstand the gale force 

winds of any cyclone above Category 3.</p>
<p>The initial assessment was carried by the NDMO with the assistance of the Commissioner 

Northern and his team and the Ministry’s own officers based in North and of course the Construction 

Implementation Unit (CIU) of the Ministry of Economy. We have identified 59 schools sustaining 

more significant damage than the others.  This included 41 schools in Vanua Levu, 17 in the Lau 

Group and one in the Lomaiviti Group.</p>
<p>Immediately after this, the Ministry and the CIU prepared a scope of works because it was 

decided that 30 of these schools could be quickly fixed and be ready for students before 19thJanuary.  

As of today, out of the 30 schools, we have completed 27, two are currently in progress and we expect 

the following to be completed throughout this week: Lekutu Secondary School, Bua District School, 

Yadua Primary School and Dama District School (need rebuild of classrooms). We have already sent 

out Expressions of Interest for Lekutu Secondary School.  Currently 1x9 classrooms was damaged 

and we had to put in temporarily learning shelters as we did forTC Winstonbut this time we make 

sure that these temporary learning spaces came with proper flooring so the children would not be 

subjected to the continuous rain that we are experiencing.</p>
<p>So, the expressions of interest are out and we have a preliminary meeting with the contractors 

next week to build a semi-permanent structure for Yadua Secondary School while the Government 

plans the next phase of work, that is the rebuild of it.</p>
<p>We have a contractor who has come on board to adopt Yadua Primary School and he is going 

to  help  us  build  1x3  classrooms  that  was  destroyed  byTC  Yasa.  For  Dama  Primary  School,  the 

Ministry will build a 1x3 semi-permanent structure while we work on the rebuild process.</p>
<p>For Bua District School, the Ministry is also looking at building a 1x3 classrooms to house</p>
<p>two streams of classes plus one ECE Center.</p>
<p>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding for that came from the Ministry and, of course, we were assisted 

by the Australian Defence Forces who were here on the ground who helped us rebuild Galoa Primary 

School. So, Galoa Primary School was handed back to the Ministry on the 15thof January completed 

and fully fitted with new furniture.</p>
<p>In terms of other schools which were damaged, we had initially put in 80 learning spaces 

which we know as tents but these included tents for the teachers’ quarters as well. We worked with 

the management to ensure that the teachers’ quarters could be fixed, however there are some schools 

where the teachers’ quarters could not be fixed and the teachers have found alternative housing. As 

of today, I made aware that there are three learning shelters used by teachers.</p>
<p>The  way  forward,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  assessments  continue  to  be  on  the  ground.  We  are 

continuing to carry out assessments. While we were doing that, cameTC Ana.  So,TC Anadid not 

do any structural damage but we had floods; 17 high schools in the Northern Division were impacted 

by the heavy rainfall duringTC Ana.To date we have managed to clean the buildings but we are still 

awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Health as most of these buildings at the moment we feel need 

to be properly dried out and disinfected before we can allow the students.</p>
<p>There has been some damage done to furniture and the Ministry is working in arranging for</p>
<p>new furniture to be provided to these children.</p>

<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>In terms of textbooks and stationeries, I have been saying this - we have had a lot of interest 

and assistance from our donor partners who have come on board but again, like I said, there are still 

some damages thatTC Anahad done.  We were ready to open schools on the 19thof January which 

we did but now with the damages byTC Ana,we are relooking at how we are going to assist these 

schools and students.</p>
<p>So,  at  this  point  in  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  put  on  record  my  sincere 

appreciation to the Australian Government, DFAT, the Commissioner Northern’s Office, NDMO, 

Australian Defence Forces, our own Republic of Fiji Military Forces officers who were on the ground 

to see that the construction work was completed, UNICEF, Vodafone Fiji Limited, Telecom Fiji, Fiji 

Ports  Terminal  Limited  -  Yard  Division,  Fiji  Teachers  Union,  TISI  Sangam,  TSLB  and  Markaz 

Janseva,  Fiji  Muslim  League,  Satya  Sai  Service  Organisation,  Labasa  Muslim  Sports,  greater 

Brisbane Community, Nasinu Junior Chamber, Members from the SODELPA who came on board 

for the stationery assistance, Max Marketing, Aqua Fiji Limited, FRIENDS Fiji and a whole lot of 

individuals who came up.  Through their assistance, we were able to assist more than 9,000 students 

with school bags and a full set of stationery.</p>
<p>Help still continue to flood in. Today, the Arya Pratinidhi Sabha of Fiji representatives also</p>
<p>gave us some donations to assist these schools and we will continue to do that.</p>
<p>As of today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have four active evacuation centres and hopefully these 

families are able to go back to their homes which were affected byTC Ana.  We hope to normalise 

things by next week but again that depends on the restoration of water, electricity, opening of access 

roads, et cetera, and we really want to start up the schools in the North but I can assure you, should 

we be delayed by another week, we can assure the House that the studies of these children will not 

be affected.</p>
<p>We will realign our school terms but we want the schools and the students to be safe along 

with  our  teachers  when  we  reopen  the  schools  for  the  North.    Right  now,  we  have  had  a  good 

attendance  turnout  for  those  students  who  have  turned  up  in  the  Eastern  Division,  Central,  and 

Northern Division.  I am yet to get a feedback as to what percentage of students have turned up but I 

would like to thank all the Fijian parents for making sure that education continues to remain a priority 

for our children.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister.    You  have  the  floor,  Honourable</p>
<p>Member.</p>
<p>HON. S. KIRPAL.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Could the Honourable Minister, please,</p>
<p>kindly explain the support provided by the Australian Defence Force afterTC Yasa?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  I thought that the Honourable Minister has answered that,</p>
<p>but I will give it to the Honourable Minister to answer the question.  You have the floor, Madam.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you.  I will just keep it short.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, again I would 

like  to  put  on  record  the  assistance  that  the  Australian  Government  and  the  Defence  Force  have 

provided.  The personnel from the Australian Defence Force have helped us rebuilt Galoa Primary 

School and right now, the students at Galoa Primary are housed in a new building.  Apart from that, 

DFAT committed $4.1 million in terms of Educational Assistance, in the form of provision of water 

tanks,  generators,  furniture,  school  stationery,  building  materials  and,  of  course,  the  biggest 

assistance they provided to us was allowing us to deliver the building materials for those hard-to-

reach places.</p>

<p>Questions</p>
<p>8th Feb., 2021</p>
<p>One only has to travel to these islands to understand how remote our communities are and 

how  difficult  it  is  to  ensure  that  supplies  and  other  stuff  reach  those  islands.    So  that  was  the 

contribution of the Australian Defence Force.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  The Honourable Nawaikula, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- For the cost of re-construction, is this fully Government-funded</p>
<p>or is Government looking for private and overseas sponsors?</p>
<p>HON. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Minister, you have the floor.</p>
<p>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you.  Like I had said, there are seven schools that have been 

categorised as Category 4 and Category 5.  This will require a lot of new structural buildings to come 

up, like I said,  assessments are still being carried out and at this stage, it is too early to say, how 

much actually the damage assessment costs are for these buildings as these buildings were pretty old.  

So, yes, Government has plans to rebuild schools back to better standards like we did toTC Winstonrehabilitation programmes.</p>
<p>We would be willing to work with donors and partners who would love to adopt the schools,</p>
<p>if not then these schools will be funded by the Government.  Thank you.</p>
<p>HON.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you.    We  will  move  on  to  the  next  Question.    Honourable 

Members,  the  next  question  was  supposed  to  be  asked  by  the  Honourable  Inosi  Kuridrani,  who 

unfortunately is away on Bereavement Leave and our thoughts are with him.</p>
<p>I have agreed that this question - Question No. 7/2021 to be asked by the Honourable Jese</p>
<p>Saukuru.  You have the floor, Sir.</p>
