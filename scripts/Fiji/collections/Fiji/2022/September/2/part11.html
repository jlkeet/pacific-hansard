<div><span>Palemo Convention on Human Trafficking 
<br/>(Question No. 165/2022)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the implementation 
<br/>of the Palemo Convention on Human Trafficking? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  First  let  me  thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  the 
<br/>Secretariat  for  allowing  this  question  to  be  carried  over  from  yesterday  because  of  some  official 
<br/>engagements, and I was not able to be in Parliament last night.  We had the New Zealand Defense 
<br/>Secretary and his team with us and they left again this morning - they were here over the last two 
<br/>days, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  honourable  Member  for  this  question  -  very  relevant,  very 
<br/>important and very applicable given the challenges that we face today.  I hope that all honourable 
<br/>Members will listen carefully and take responsibility as well in disseminating information and being 
<br/>alert and aware of what is happening around us and most particularly, if we can work together with 
<br/>the authorities concerned because this is a major issue that we all face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of the general public and all honourable Members when we 
<br/>look at our general security architecture, conventionally you could say that the threats are very low - 
<br/>the possibility of a conventional attack against Fiji and its interests.  But the biggest threat to security 
<br/>today not only for Fiji but probably in most countries, are what we call non-traditional threats.  For 
<br/>us in the Pacific consistent with the Boe Declaration, we have identified climate change as the biggest 
<br/>threat  that  we  face  (that  is  the  non-traditional  threat);  the  transnational  crimes;  and  this  Palemo 
<br/>Convention that I am going to respond to today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my response is about the Palemo Convention.  It is about the Convention 
<br/>Against  the  Transnational  Organised  Crime  because  the  biggest  contrast  in  society  today  and 
<br/>unfortunately, it is between the civil and the uncivil.  We are supposed to be civilised and we have 
<br/>progressed so much but unfortunately there are still elements within our society (and this is the fact, 
<br/></span><span>this is the reality) and unfortunately it is something that we cannot control but we need to monitor 
<br/></span><span>and perhaps keep to a minimum if possible - the uncivil amongst our community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  of  these  groups  are  involved  in  organised,  I  say  again  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  organised 
<br/>transnational crime.  It is very, very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are two major components 
<br/>to the Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime.  The first component being the Palemo 
<br/>Convention which is the protocol against the smuggling of migrants by land, sea or air. This was 
<br/>adopted by the UNGA in resolution 55/ 25 I will not go into those details.  This came into force 
<br/>around 2004 but this is what I want to say about the Palemo Convention.  It deals with the growing 
<br/>problem of organised criminal groups who smuggle migrants often at the risk of the migrant, but 
<br/>bring in profits and gains to the perpetrators, the offenders. It will become clearer as I delve further 
<br/>into the issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  component  is  the  Vienna  Convention  which  mainly  deals  with  Illicit  Traffic  in 
<br/>Narcotic Drugs and of course, arms as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But for Fiji, we acceded to the United 
<br/>Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, more commonly known as the Palermo 
<br/>Convention on 19</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2017.  This came into force in 2004, if I remember correctly, but it 
<br/>took us such a long time to accede to the Palermo Convention.  I will explain the logic behind it.  It 
<br/></span><span>is simply because when we deal with transnational issues, it involves a lot of cross border issues as 
<br/></span><span>well and people who understand security, will perhaps better understand this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of involvement - Ministries of Foreign Affairs are involved, we have Interpol 
<br/>and  so  many  agencies  because  most  of  the  issues  are  crosscutting,  overlapping,  therefore  the 
<br/>coordination between all of us, and not only that, we have our own sovereign laws.  Perhaps, this is 
<br/>an area for those who have been following the US Report on human trafficking. This is one of the 
<br/>issues that we have with Fiji, because they want to impose their laws on Fiji’s sovereign laws.  They 
<br/>have  gone  well  ahead  of  us  in  changing  their  laws  over  the  years  because  of  the  change  in  the 
<br/>dynamics of security, but we here, not only Fiji but most of the region, our laws are still archaic and 
<br/>it is not suited to it.  This is something that the honourable Attorney-General was talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When there are changes externally, we have to look at changes within and in most cases we 
<br/>will have to change the legislations first and then we will change the policies as well, and then the 
<br/>strategies and activities will come into line.  So this is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it took so long for Fiji 
<br/>because this is a transnational and global issue as well, before we zero it down to the local setting.  I 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2365 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am thankful that this is the first question for this morning because of its relevance and of course, why 
<br/>it is so important to all of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The three major components, we call it the three main Ps when it comes to this protocol.  One 
<br/>is the protocol to prevent, supress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
<br/>or known as the ‘trafficking in persons’ protocol.  We have had instances in Fiji where people have 
<br/>just been charged recently for trafficking people.  I will not  go into the details, but it is common 
<br/>knowledge.  People have been arrested and of course brought into court, prosecuted and most of them 
<br/>are serving their time now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps the bigger danger, if I may digress a bit here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This is why I have 
<br/>said that it is very important that we monitor our communities, particularly our children.  In some 
<br/>countries, there is a relation between drugs and  trafficking, and in some countries they attack the 
<br/>vulnerable, saying that this is a performance enhancement drug, particularly to farmers.  Then the 
<br/>farmers  who  have  no  money  start  taking  this  and  then  they  come  in  the  name  of  performance 
<br/>enhancement  -  ‘you  take  it  so  that  you  can  increase  your  productivity  because  it  is  good  for  the 
<br/>country, you will get more exports out of your products.’  Come a time the farmers are addicted and 
<br/>when they are addicted, this is when those behind this, the uncivil, start demanding for money.  They 
<br/></span><span>know that these farmers do not have money, therefore, they have already done their work and know 
<br/></span><span>that the farmer has three daughters.  Okay, you do not have the money, you cannot pay, how about 
<br/>you give me your three daughters and I will provide employment for them, and these three daughters 
<br/>will be arranged for jobs abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do your </span><span>Google </span><span>or go to </span><span>YouTube</span><span> - instances where Kenyan women are trafficked into India 
<br/>with the promise of jobs.  Once they arrive, passports are confiscated and there are claims against all 
<br/>the costs - it costs you US$27,000 to bring you from Kenya to here.  You have to pay me this money.  
<br/>How do I pay the money?  I was coming for a job.  Given makeups, everything, there is a pick up 
<br/>coming  at  six  o’clock  and  there  will  be  clients  waiting,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Protocol  to  Prevent, 
<br/>Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children - I hope I have covered 
<br/>enough to justify the importance of this Palermo Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two is the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (Smuggling Protocol).  In Fiji’s case, 
<br/>we  have  a  porous  border  but  we  are  now  signing  with  our  partners  on  shiprider  agreements,  air 
<br/>reconnaissance and we are also looking at the possibility of using drones, let us move with technology 
<br/>so that we can better influence, we can better influence our areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and of course the 
<br/>Protocol Against Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and 
<br/></span><span>Ammunition (Firearms Protocol) as well.  That is known particularly as the Firearms Protocol.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very  quickly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  Protocol  of  Human  Trafficking  and  Smuggling 
<br/>Protocol.    This  is  a  more  important  one  for  Fiji.    Although  we  do  not  want  to  dilute  the  threat 
<br/>particularly with firearms and the components as well but I think, out of the two protocols, this is 
<br/>more of the bigger challenge for us – the Smuggling Protocol.  Sir, on this I am pleased to say that 
<br/>Government  through  my  Ministry  has  taken  great  strides  to  enhance  our  efforts  to  combatting 
<br/>trafficking in persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In January, 2020, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 
<br/>was delegated the responsibility to administer Fiji’s Anti-Trafficking Inter-Agency Committee.  We 
<br/>have formed this Committee.  If I may just very quickly mention the Members of the Committee – 
<br/>the Ministry of Women and Children, the Ministry of Employment, Office of the Solicitor-General, 
<br/>the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Immigration, Fiji Police Force, FRCS, and we are 
<br/>open  to  all  agencies.    On  a  needs  basis  and  upon  invitation,  we  are  bringing  CSOs  and  other 
<br/>organisations and there are two key organisations that we also work with.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One is the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the other is very lately, the 
<br/>Asia Foundation is coming into the country and one of their main objectives is to specifically help 
<br/>Fiji in our human trafficking mechanisms, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But on the IOM – this is the International 
<br/>Organisation for Migration, not only when it comes to illegal smuggling of people but they are very 
<br/>important to us as well when we have disasters.  We work very closely with them because they deal 
<br/>with internally displaced people and refugees as well.  But in our cases particularly, post-disasters – 
<br/>many internally displaced people, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, work has been ongoing with the Committee and we are happy to say that Government 
<br/>has also approved a National Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy and  Action Plan as of 16 January 
<br/>2021 and it focuses on prevention, protection, prosecution and of course partnership as well.  I have 
<br/>mentioned the organisations that we work with apart from IOM and the Asia Foundation of course 
<br/>we have our bilateral partners and of course the international organisations for migration as I have 
<br/>stated and the Governments of United States, Australia and New Zealand as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally if I may just say Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have formed the committee, we have devised 
<br/>the National Action Plan and Strategy and also one of the key requirements is for us to have what we 
<br/>call  a  “Case  Management  Coordinator”  so  that  all  the  reporting,  all  the  activities  are  centralised 
<br/></span><span>particularly when it comes to reporting because it is a requirement that cases or those that become 
<br/></span><span>victims or survivor are provided with all and any necessary assistance that they may require and if 
<br/>there are investigations they must be supported and ensured that it goes all the way to prosecution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  so  far  with  the  establishment  of  the  strategy  and  the  case  management 
<br/>coordinator in the 2021-2022 Financial Year the case management coordinator has dealt with two 
<br/>referrals and to date in this Financial Year we have received and dealt with one referral so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, we are at the last stages of finalising a National Referral Mechanism 
<br/>that ensures that any and or likely cases of human trafficking are referred to the CMC and of course 
<br/>we need to maintain a consolidated database on the prevalence of human trafficking in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think I will stop there in the interest of time but there is a lot to cover in this, feel free to 
<br/>honourable Members, the Committee under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary for Defence 
<br/>and  National  Security  and  Policing  are  always  willing  to  give  information  and  work  with  the 
<br/>authorities, the leadership of this country and the communities so that we can all address these issues 
<br/>for the obvious reasons that I have stated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heart Surgeries - Lautoka Hospital 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 168/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament why 
<br/>heart surgeries at the Aspen managed Lautoka Hospital have not commenced as announced 
<br/>by the honourable Attorney-General on Thursday 24 March 2022? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for that 
<br/>question, it has been confirmed for the end of the month and the reason is that there has been a surge 
<br/>of COVID-19 cases as you know there has been a slight change in Australia and also there has been 
<br/>the </span><span>influenza</span><span> season in Australia.  This has actually put some pressures on the personnel who need 
<br/>to come over and actually do the open heart surgery for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The open heart surgery, maybe the honourable Member would know, is not a simple thing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where  someone  just  fronts  up  today  and  gets  an  operation  tomorrow  like  you  would  do  with  an 
<br/>appendisectomy.    It  requires  assessment,  optimizing  the  patient,  it  requires  making  sure  that  the 
<br/>patient who will have open heart surgery which means that the heart will be allowed to stop beating 
<br/>on its own and the heart-lung machine beats on behalf of the patient and making sure also that the 
<br/>patient will come back afterwards, that is the whole aim of the operation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So there is a whole process involved in that and the assessments that need to be done are being 
<br/>done by both our local doctors working with their colleagues in Australia at the moment as we know 
<br/>and the honourable Attorney-General had talked about the other day that we will now have more than 
<br/>700 of our staff that have now moved on to Health Care Fiji and we wish them all the best and some 
<br/>of them are my colleagues and I am very proud,  actually very happy and excited for them in this 
<br/>new adventure that we are heading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just before I sit down and just seeing honourable Tikoduadua (I know this is an 
<br/>opportunity  for  me  to  say  something  before  the  end  of  this  Parliamentary  session)  one  thing  that 
<br/>concerns  me  is  that  throughout  this  Parliamentary  week  is  the  fact  that  a  lot  of  the  Opposition 
<br/>Members just decided to go away.  At one stage there was only five of this august Parliament.  I 
<br/>know that some of them are unwell and they need to take rest but, Sir, this is Parliament. We must 
<br/></span><span>make time to be here in Parliament. All of us are busy. We are all busy.  Honourable Rasova I know 
<br/></span><span>you are busy.  We are all busy but we make time to be here in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tikoduadua was not here yesterday to actually ask the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>his question on USP in the corruption in USP. You should have ask it that he can know for sure what 
<br/>happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Biman  Prasad  and  honourable  Qereqeretabua  are  not  here.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, what concerns me is the level of personal attacks that happened and straight after that they 
<br/>go. This is Parliament where you actually come and discuss through debate and if you decided to 
<br/>make a personal attack be willing to stand as a woman and as a man to also receive not a personal 
<br/>attack but the reasoning why things have been made for the benefit of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Honourable Speaker, before I ask my supplementary 
<br/>to the honourable Minister, I just want to note there is nothing contravening any Standing Orders of 
<br/>Parliament  the  absence  of  any  Member  from  this  House  for  the  businesses  of  the  Members  own 
<br/>concern.  That is what the law says and is that not what we all are living by.  No one is running away 
<br/>from anyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway the honourable Minister is concerned about the actions of this side of the House, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>think the honourable Minister should go out there and do his job well...   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- When I was there in the hospital and where were you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- … and look after the State of our health system to make 
<br/>sure that when a promise is made and that is why we asked the question and that the honourable 
<br/>Minister on behalf of the Government should deliver the services as promised by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Ask your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is all I have to say, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I did not hear the honourable Minister say when it will commence. I 
<br/>mean, the promise was made can you give us definitive dates on when this will happen, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, he has answered that appropriately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I had alluded to earlier at the end 
<br/>of the month and in addition if you wanted to know, honourable Gavoka, more than $8 million worth 
<br/>of equipment that are coming across to Lautoka: $3.5 million is already in-house, there is a new CT 
<br/>Scan that is available and it is working; and another $5.5 million worth of equipment in other areas 
<br/>that are coming across.  All the equipment that is needed to do open heart surgery nearly all or all of 
<br/>them are actually in Lautoka and as I said it is the end of the month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Addressing IUU Fishing 
<br/>(Question No. 169/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the vast ocean space and the need to address IUU, can the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Fisheries inform Parliament on the arrangements carried out by Fiji to ensure that Fiji 
<br/></span><span>waters are efficiently patrolled? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Nath  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this subject of Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing has been 
<br/>discussed in one way or another in Parliament but I will go through the subject that is being asked 
<br/>this morning.  In general, the surveillance and the business of fishing vessels in Fiji waters is covered 
<br/>under three main headings: one is the legislative framework then we have the monitoring control 
<br/>surveillance and enforcement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  an  effective  approach  in  managing  our  vast  ocean  from  IUU 
<br/>fishing we must have  a  robust legislation that is  fit for purpose, forward  looking and address  the 
<br/>distinctive variables that exist in our ocean space.  The Offshore Fisheries Management Act of 2012 
<br/>and  its  regulations  of  2014  has  the  objective  to  conserve,  manage  and  develop  the  long-term 
<br/>sustainable use of all fisheries resources and as such has the legal provisions to address these needs.  
<br/>For example, part 5 of the Act under Licences and Authorisations it provides the legal basis in which 
<br/>licences are issued and also covers the need to have the needed permits to help track the fish trade 
<br/></span><span>from when it is caught until when it is eaten. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  as  I  have  alluded  to  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Act  provides  provisions  for 
<br/>monitoring,  control,  surveillance  and  enforcement.    In  the  work  undertaken  by  our  Fisheries 
<br/>Observers the monitoring exercise provides the critical scientific data that is needed to understand 
<br/>fishing  trends  and  tuna  stock.    Through  an  advance  approach  and  as  a  complement  to  having 
<br/>observers on board vessels, the Ministry implements an electronic monitoring system that records all 
<br/>activities  on  the  vessel.    In  fact  this  fiscal  year’s  budget  has  an  allocation  of  $550,000  for  the 
<br/>monitoring systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The use of video footage sightings and observer report is used by the Ministry to identify 
<br/>illegal activities that occur on any fishing vessels in our waters.  Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through 
<br/>our licensing and control mechanisms there are conditions in place to track the movement of vessels 
<br/>and activities that enter Fiji waters.  This includes the mandatory Entry and Exit Notifications where  
<br/>vessels will have to report their location, fish on board and their intention when entering Fiji waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from this manual reporting there are also mandatory requirements to 
<br/>assists  vessel  tracks  that  are  held  on  board  all  fishing  vessels.    These  are  called  the  “Vessel 
<br/>Monitoring System” (VMS).  This system works as a vessel tracker similar to GPS which are able to 
<br/>track using satellite reporting system housed at the Ministry of Fisheries and the Fiji Navy Regional 
<br/>Surveillance Centre. Through this collaborative work with the Forum Fisheries Agency all vessel 
<br/>movements in Fiji are analysed and monitored. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If vessels are suspected of illegal fishing these vessels are then tagged to indicate the need for 
<br/>thorough inspection and investigation during boarding and clearance exercise.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 
<br/>an annual average of 1,200 foreign fishing vessels transiting through our waters or making port visits 
<br/>it is vital that systems are in place to conduct relevant checks on these vessels.  Fiji is fortunate that 
<br/>it undertakes stringent boarding  and inspection exercises that are undertaken by our Enforcement 
<br/>Officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  boarding  and  inspection  are  either  conducted  out  at  sea,  in  port  or  along  the  wharf 
<br/>depending  on  the  type  of  vessels  that  pass  through  our  waters.    If  vessels  are  suspected  to  have 
<br/>conducted illegal fishing activities the current law gives provisions for our officers to seize the vessel 
<br/>and fish on board while investigations are conducted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the basis of proving that an offence has been committed, the vessels are either fined, seized 
<br/>or sanctioned through the court legal proceedings to recover the loss incurred by the government.  
<br/>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  address  the  vast  ocean  area  that  needs  constant  surveillance,  Fiji 
<br/>should in collaboration with regional members of the Forum Fisheries Agencies and conduct five 
<br/>annual surveillance operations throughout the year. These surveillance operations cover the EEZ and 
<br/>high seas in the Pacific region and use analysis historical and real time data to track fishing vessels 
<br/>that operate in the region.  This operation is assisted by surface and area lessons provided through 
<br/>the joint support for the United States, France, Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  Fisheries  and  Naval  officers  have  just  completed  one 
<br/>surveillance operations called Island Chief in which we saw our officers conduct joint patrol in our 
<br/>waters  on  one  of  the  Ministry’s  operatives  just  returning  to  shore  from  a  three  week  stint  in  Her 
<br/>Majesty’s New Zealand Ship (HMNZS) Wellington.  Additionally, through Shiprider Programme 
<br/>such as with the Governments of USA and UK our officers are now going on board USA Coast guard 
<br/>and UK Naval Vessels and conducting surface patrols in our EEZ.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is through such tools and platforms that Fiji is able to effectively manage 
<br/></span><span>fishing  activities  which  occur  within  our  waters.  This  coupled  with  fit  for  purpose  training  for 
<br/></span><span>observers, enforcement and Prosecution officers is what equips us to undertake the vital work needed 
<br/>to address our IUU fishing. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Measures to Address Poverty Nationwide 
<br/>(Question No. 170/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation update 
<br/>Parliament on the measures taken by the Ministry to gauge how poverty is being addressed 
<br/>nationwide? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Thank you, honourable Jale, for the question.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the 
<br/>outset, I would like to take Parliament back to yesterday’s discussion where this side of the House 
<br/>was labelled as pro-rich.  I would like to state here that this side of Parliament - the Government side,

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is very much pro-poor. We implement policies, we have programmes that are there to assist the most 
<br/>vulnerable of the society, including the senior citizens, the disabled, children, women and the poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Ministry is mandated to look after the poorest of the poor with all the Social Protection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programmes we have.  All in all, we have six Social Protection Programmes, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Child Protection Allowance; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Poverty Alleviation Benefit Scheme; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Social Pension Scheme; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Subsidised E-Transport Programme for Older Persons and the Disabled; 
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Food Voucher for Pregnant Mothers; and 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Allowance for Persons with Disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  on  7</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2022  in  this  Parliament,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  moved  a  motion 
<br/>regarding poverty.  Both sides of Parliament spoke on the motion and this side of Parliament very 
<br/>clearly put across the fact that alleviating and addressing poverty is a whole of Government approach.  
<br/>All the Ministries have their own budgets inbuilt within them, and across the Government, there are 
<br/>124 Poverty Alleviation Programmes with a total budget of $972 million per year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Ministry of Women looks after Social Protection Programmes and we have close to 
<br/>150,000 social welfare recipients who benefit from those Programmes.  Previously, we used to have 
<br/>the Welfare to Workfare Programme, unfortunately, that has been stalled, but we do hope to bring 
<br/>that back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those Social Protection Programmes, we assist, as I have said, the most poorest of the 
<br/>poor with cash allowances per month, vouchers and a whole range of things that had already been 
<br/>discussed  on  7</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2022.    We  have  a  small  Unit  -  Poverty  Monitoring  Unit  that  helps  other 
<br/>Ministries look at the performances of their Poverty Alleviation Programmes, and we hope that this 
<br/>will continue in order to see the impacts of our Social Protection Programmes in trying to assist the 
<br/>poor people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from  that, if  you look at  education, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  free education and  subsidised 
<br/>transports, it does have an impact of how families that are suffering from poverty, are able to sustain 
<br/>themselves.  The inflation mitigation package that has been rolled out by the Ministry of Economy, 
<br/>close to 200,000 Fijians will be assisted and payments have started to roll out.  We have heard a lot 
<br/>of positive stories from those beneficiaries on how these assistance will be able to help.  So, all in 
<br/></span><span>all, poverty remains a priority for the Government, and across all Ministries, the Government has had 
<br/></span><span>budgets  to  ensure  that  every  Ministry,  whether  it  is  Agriculture,  Rural  Development,  Fisheries, 
<br/>Forestry or Health are, there to assist people who need our assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; what process do you have in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your Ministry, to identify people who need poverty alleviation assistance in rural or remote areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Social Welfare has Officers all across 
<br/>the country and we have our Field Officers.  We make sure that our programmes are made aware to 
<br/>all  communities  when  we  go  and  talk  for  outreach  programmes.    So,  they  apply,  we  assess  their 
<br/>applications and try to make sure that in a shortest possible time, assistance reaches them.

<div><span>Prediction of Storm Surges and Other Extreme Weather Events 
<br/>(Question No. 171/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2371 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and 
<br/>Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  what  steps  have  been  taken  by  the  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Services to improve the prediction of storm surges and other extreme weather 
<br/>events that cause coastal inundation in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to address this question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also thank you, honourable Bhatnagar, for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Meteorological  Services  has  worked  very  closely  with  the  World  Meteorological 
<br/>Organization  in  developing  and  strengthening  the  systems  that  we  have  to  monitor  and  predict 
<br/>elements  related to  our climate that can  have an  adverse impact  on our country.   Because of this 
<br/>collaboration,  Fiji  was  chosen  as  one  of  the  demonstration  countries  for  the  Coastal  Inundation 
<br/>Forecasting Demonstration Projects (CIFDP).  So we have had a demonstration project here in Fiji 
<br/>to demonstrate how this technology can be used, and other countries  can then take that on board.  
<br/>This was funded back in 2012 by the Government of Korea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  result  of  this  CIFDP,  a  number  of  things  were  developed.    First,  was  a  storm  surge 
<br/>modelling programme.  Storm surge is when the water comes inland when you have storms, so this 
<br/></span><span>storm surge modelling programme kicks in whenever we have a tropical cyclone of Category 3 and 
<br/></span><span>above.  From the programme, they are able to estimate the water level heights and how this will go 
<br/>into inland and inundates our coast lands.  So that storm surge modelling is now in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, tropical cyclone with model.  This estimates the height of the waves that will be 
<br/>generated because of the cyclones.  Two things that are coming up - one is the surge inland which is 
<br/>a storm surge and secondly, is the height of the cyclone.  For those of you who have been part of the 
<br/>NDMO recent events when there was a tropical cyclone, the Fiji Meteorological Service is able to 
<br/>give an estimate of the wave heights that will be coming in, in different parts of Fiji waters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third model that has been put in place is in particularly in relation to the Coral Coast.  So 
<br/>there is a coastal inundation model for the Coral Coast, which looks at the damaging heavy swells 
<br/>caused by storms that develop to the far South of Fiji.  A lot of storms develop to the far South and 
<br/>they tend to impact on Kadavu and the Coral Coast, especially during our dry months.  So, that model 
<br/>is now in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth model is wave buoys.  We have wave buoys that are out in the ocean that can track 
<br/>the height of waves that are coming through.  So you have the forecast and you have the wave buoys 
<br/></span><span>that can give you real-time information on what the actual height of the waves are.  Wave buoys were 
<br/></span><span>deployed off the Coral Coast and Kadavu over the recent past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of this exercise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the CIFDP, the Fiji Meteorological Service 
<br/>has  worked  with  a  number  of  different  agencies  for  various  things.    These  include  the  Japan 
<br/>Meteorological  Agency  that  developed  the  storm  surge  model  for  Fiji  and  other  Pacific  Island 
<br/>Countries  in  the  region,  and  this  has  been  operational  since  2019,  and  there  is  still  an  ongoing 
<br/>collaboration with the Japan Meteorological Agency on further improving the model.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Service  has  been  able  to  work  with  Tonkin  &amp;  Taylor 
<br/>(International).  This is a NZ modelling agency which developed the tropical cyclone wave model.  
<br/>Once  again,  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Service  continues  to  work  closely  with  this  agency  to  make 
<br/>further improvements to the existing model.  That wave model is operational and limited to Fiji only. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the Fiji Meteorological Service also works very closely with the Secretariat of the 
<br/>Pacific Community (SPC), which is developing a higher resolution wave model for the Southwest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji waters up to seven days.  So, seven days in advance, we can get some estimates on the kind of 
<br/>waves that will be coming through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the wave buoy development for the Coral Coast 
<br/>and Kadavu, unfortunately, something happened to one of those deployed wave buoys,  I think in 
<br/>Nabukelevu in Kadavu.  Either someone stole it or may be </span><span>TC Sarai</span><span> has removed it and got tangled 
<br/>up, so there is an issue around that.  But the Fiji Meteorological Service is now looking to hopefully, 
<br/>deploy two more wave buoys just outside the Suva Harbour in the near future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these agencies that I have listed – the Japan Meteorological Agency, Tonkin &amp; Taylor 
<br/>and the SPC are also heavily involved in the training and capacity building for our Meteorological 
<br/>Officers, who use all of these products because all of these will help us to maintain the systems that 
<br/>we have when the projects  have ended.  These  developments  are first  for the Fiji  Meteorological 
<br/>Service  and  have  improved  our  warning  advisories,  as  well  as  our  confidence  in  providing  those 
<br/>advisories.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the developments that has also taken place as a result of the focus on capacity building 
<br/>in the Fiji Meteorological Service, we have a Senior Meteorologist at the Fiji Meteorological Service 
<br/></span><span>who has now developed a wave forecasting system for Fiji and the Southwest Pacific region as part 
<br/></span><span>of his Master’s degree programme at the Yokohama National University in Japan.  So, this model 
<br/>runs twice daily on the Fiji Meteorological Service server with hourly forecasts for up to five days.  
<br/>This also gives us more information on waves and ocean forecast and makes this available to the Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme itself has really improved and really advanced our ability to 
<br/>be  able  to  provide  adequate  warning,  and  also  for  all  our  coastal  communities  and  our  tourism 
<br/>industry.    The  CIFDP  actually  finished  in  2019  but  there  are  some  components  of  it  that  are 
<br/>continuing.  There are also plans to further extend this project and currently, the Fiji Meteorological 
<br/>Service  is  working  together  with  the  Government  to  source  adaptation  funds  so  we  can  do  some 
<br/>further improvements to our ability to be able to predict waves.  Part of that, hopefully, if the funding 
<br/>comes through, is to expand the high resolution wave model to the whole of Fiji waters to get high 
<br/>resolution and baseline data for both, topography and bathymetry.  Bathymetry is the study of the sea 
<br/>floor and the way that it is structured.  So, if you have good information on that, it gives you additional 
<br/>information on coastal inundation and the impact of coastal inundation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, is to expand the CIFDP to the other coastal areas of Fiji that are frequently impacted 
<br/></span><span>by coastal inundation and storm surges.  The wave buoys that we have, they complement the tidal 
<br/>gauges.  In Fiji, we have tidal gauges in Suva, Lautoka and Vatia.  So combined information from 
<br/>the  tidal  gauges,  wave  buoys  and  the  models  help  us  to  continually  improve  our  ability  to  give 
<br/>forecast for the benefit of the people of our country. Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Reconstruction/Rehabilitation – Kadavu Secondary Schools 
<br/>(Question No. 172/2022)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/>update  Parliament  on  the  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  major  secondary  schools  in 
<br/>Kadavu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I also thank honourable Rasova for

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2373 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three secondary schools in Kadavu and the schools are Vunisea 
<br/>Secondary School, Richmond Methodist High School and Kadavu Provincial High School.  We all 
<br/>know that in April 2020, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span> which was a Category 5 Cyclone caused significant damages to 
<br/>a lot of schools in the Northern Division and in the maritime zones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, climate change is  a sad reality which we have to  deal with  on a regular 
<br/>basis.  Tropical cyclones, whenever they come, cause a lot of damages not only to schools but to 
<br/>other infrastructure such as hospitals, residential buildings, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  a  period  of  time,  the  Government  has  been  spending  large  sums  of  money  to  repair 
<br/>schools and if you take into consideration the last Category 5 Cyclone that we had starting from 2016, 
<br/>the Government had spent more than $250 million just to repair and rehabilitate schools around the 
<br/>country.  The cost of damages sustained by all three Schools were substantial.  Richmond Methodist 
<br/>High School had damages valued around $1,226,895; Vunisea Secondary School - $235,000; and for 
<br/>Kadavu Provincial High School, it was close to a million dollars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after assessing the damages caused by </span><span>TC Harold,</span><span> the honourable Prime 
<br/></span><span>Minister sought assistance from the Embassy of Japan to restore the facilities of all three Secondary 
<br/>Schools.  The  Embassy  of  Japan  agreed  to  reconstruct  and  rehabilitate  the  facilities  by  providing 
<br/>funding directly to the Schools under the Grant Assistance for Grass-Roots Human Security Project 
<br/>(GGP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Japanese  Embassy  provided  $597,494  to  Richmond  Methodist  High 
<br/>School  to  build  three  new  concrete  classrooms  and  two  new  concrete  ablution  blocks.    Vunisea 
<br/>Secondary School received a grant of $589,791 to build two new concrete classrooms and a new 
<br/>girl’s dormitory.  The School was provided with 20 bunk beds with mattresses, 40 desks and chairs, 
<br/>teacher’s table and chairs, eight bookshelves, six long tables and benches, 6 mirror sets with frames, 
<br/>two  office  tables  for  teachers  and  an  ironing  table  by  Japan  International  Co-operation  Agency 
<br/>(JICA). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  sum  of  $1,686,303  was  given  to  Kadavu  Provincial  High  School  to 
<br/>construct six classrooms; two dormitories - one for male and one for female;, a new dining hall, and 
<br/>to supply 240 desks and chairs for students, six sets of tables and chairs for teachers, 40 double bunks 
<br/>for male and female dormitories and dining hall furniture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work at all the three Schools started during the pandemic, that is in March 2021 and we 
<br/>all know what happened in March 2021 - that was the second wave that the country was trying to 
<br/>handle and the COVID-19 cases spiralled during that time but I must give it to the contractors who 
<br/>were at the site and they tried to get on with the work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  work  at  Richmond  Methodist  High  School  and  Vunisea  Secondary 
<br/>School was completed by February 2022, and both Schools were commissioned and are now using 
<br/>the improved facility.  The project for Kadavu Provincial High School also started in March 2021 
<br/>but there were some issues related to adverse weather condition which caused some challenges to the 
<br/>contractor in terms of accessing the road to transport the materials to the site.  During that time, there 
<br/>were a lot of restrictions placed on the movement of people, although the goods could be taken to 
<br/>maritime areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Authority could not go to the island to fix the road and there was a delay in getting the 
<br/>road fixed which meant that at a later stage, the cost of the materials went up.  So, when the cost of

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Sept. 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  materials  went  up,  obviously,  no  contractor  wants  to  go  out  of  pocket.  In  that  situation,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education and Japanese Embassy  Officials all met with the contractor to assess extra 
<br/>funding that would be needed to complete the job.  And I must thank the Ministry of Economy that 
<br/>in this financial year, a sum of $375,000 was allocated for that particular work to be completed.   Sir, 
<br/>the improved facilities and better infrastructure such as new classrooms, new ablution blocks, new 
<br/>classroom furniture, et cetera, will create a better environment for teaching and learning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Embassy of Japan and the Government and people of 
<br/>Japan for assisting Fiji in rehabilitating schools and this unwavering commitment and support has 
<br/>enabled Fiji in the restoration of schools after </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>.  Even this year, the Government of Japan 
<br/>is  helping  six  other  schools  to  repair  and  rehabilitate  classrooms  that  were  destroyed  by  various 
<br/>cyclones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to assure all Fijians that this Government has and will always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prioritise education to transform the lives of our people for better future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Thank  you  very  much,  honourable  Minister,  for  a  very  detailed 
<br/>summary  of  events  that  happened  in  the  three  sector  schools  in  Kadavu.  Thank  you  also  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Japanese Embassy and JICA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My supplementary question is that in 2022, I was in Naleca, Kadavu, the US Army through 
<br/>the US Embassy was fixing the Kadavu Provincial Primary School. At this moment, we have not 
<br/>heard  anything  from  the  US  Army.    Can  you,  please,  provide  detail,  whether  you  have  known 
<br/>anything about the US Army coming to assist the Kadavu Provincial Primary School? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is completely a new question. The question was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on secondary schools, not primary schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is completely a new question, Honourable Member. We will move on to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the next question.

<div><span>Plans for the 2022-2023 IHRDP Budget 
<br/>(Question No. 173/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  update 
<br/></span><span>Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  plans  for  the  Intergraded  Human  Resources  Development 
<br/>Programme (IHRDP) which was allocated $500,000 in the 2022-2023 National Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Pillay for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Integrated  Human  Resources  Development  Programme,  commonly 
<br/>known  as  IHRDP,  is  probably  one  of  our  most  important  grant  assistance  programmes  under  the 
<br/>Ministry.  The Programme is actually designed for Fijian people with entrepreneurial ventures in the 
<br/>peri-urban, rural and the remote areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  under  the  leadership  of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister,  we  have  the 
<br/>confidence to invest in our Fijian people.  As the country progresses, we will not leave any Fijian 
<br/>behind.  This  Programme has been undertaken from  the mountains  of Namosi to  the coastline of 
<br/>Cakaudrove, to the Far East parts of Cicia and Yacata Islands, and these have all been assisted under 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IHRDP - the Programme that answers the needs of our rural entrepreneurs when no one gives them 
<br/>a chance and our honourable Prime Minister actually gave them a chance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Briefly, I just want to outline the plans for the IHRDP and I wish to provide a quick overview.  
<br/>The Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport  (MCTTT) has been  administering the 
<br/>Programme since 2016, and has funded a total of about 39 projects all around Fiji at an approximate 
<br/>value of about $1.7 million.  I am pleased to report that from the 34 projects that were monitored in 
<br/>the last financial year, we have created about 275 direct new jobs that have been created, leading to 
<br/>the improvement of approximately 1,303 livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2021-2022 financial year, the Ministry received an overwhelming response through the 
<br/>Expressions of Interest (EOI) and a total of about 171 applications were received, with a total project 
<br/>value of about $11.4 million.  In the last financial year, our private sector-led IHRDP Committee 
<br/>approved  16  projects  valued  at  $657,488.70  and  IHRDP  contribution  was  $441,433.98,  as  the 
<br/>funding is on cost sharing of one-third two-third basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the growing demand over the years for such support programmes, the 
<br/>Ministry in this financial year has been allocated $0.5 million to further roll out IHRDP, and this has 
<br/></span><span>been  dedicated  to  fund  successful  business  proposals  that  seek  funding  for  capital  projects.    Our 
<br/></span><span>assistance is targeted towards a wide array of sectors such as fisheries, forestry, agro-business and 
<br/>manufacturing.  The Programme encourages applications from the tourism and hospitality providers, 
<br/>information, communications and technology service providers and financial service providers and 
<br/>given  our  responsibility  also  with  respect  to  climate  change  initiatives,  Sir,  we  further  encourage 
<br/>applications in the renewable energy space or greener applicants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Applicants  from  the  mentioned  sectors  could  apply  for  procurement  of  manufacturing 
<br/>machines for value adding, farm mechanisation, construction of warehouses, storage facilities, eco-
<br/>tourism projects, product development for businesses and this grant can also be used as equity fund 
<br/>with financial institutions for capital expenditure and diversification processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue with the partnership on a one-third two-third basis whereby the two-third 
<br/>portion is paid through Government grant and one-third is applicant’s cash contribution.  This enables 
<br/>a sense of ownership and responsibility by the recipients towards objectives and our success of the 
<br/>project.  As I have said earlier, we are encouraging greener and sustainable business practices by our 
<br/>business sector, especially the MSMEs, and we have funded solar power systems that are providing 
<br/>renewable electricity for businesses in rural settings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance has actually opened, Mr. Speaker, to sole trader business partnerships, cooperative 
<br/>businesses and companies operating in rural areas.  We have quite a few cooperatives that have been 
<br/>part out of the Programme.  We have assisted groups and communities that have been shortlisted for 
<br/>funding to be formally registered as a cooperative business.  The formal registration allows these 
<br/>groups and communities to have some legal substance and legal recognition in the business society 
<br/>and carry out their businesses with much ease and proper governance structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  livelihood  of  many  Fijians  that  are  linked  to  such 
<br/>communities  and  groups  are  significantly  impacted  as  being  a  registered  entity  and  this  opens 
<br/>opportunities for easy access to finance and grants and entering large contracts with other business 
<br/>ventures.  We will amplify the stakeholder and community awareness on the Programme to ensure 
<br/>coverage on the topic is widespread.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2022-2023  Expression  of  Interest  (EOI)  for  IHRDP,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  will  open 
<br/>tomorrow,  Saturday,  3rd  September,  2022,  along  with  the  National  Export  Strategy  (NES)

<div><span>Programme.  We are working with relevant Ministries and stakeholders to ensure that the information 
<br/>about  this  Programme  is  widely  circulated  with  face  to  face  awareness  sessions  in  the  rural 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also take this opportunity to encourage eligible Fijians to apply.  Please, apply if you need 
<br/>assistance  and  information  on  MSME  Programmes.    Please,  visit  our  offices  in  Suva,  Rakiraki, 
<br/>Sigatoka, Lautoka, Labasa and Savusavu.  I also encourage all the Opposition Members to, please, 
<br/>tell your constituents to apply for such assistance and programmes offered by the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not a handout or a freebie, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they work hard, they enjoy the one-third 
<br/>two-thirds  contribution,  this  is  a  genuine  partnership  between  the  Government  and  our  grassroot 
<br/>communities and they will significantly improve the lives of our rural people.  I urge everyone to 
<br/>refer to  our success  stories and  two of the great  success  stories is  the Cicia Women’s Project  for 
<br/>virgin coconut oil and the Lovu Youth Cooperative from Gau that was assisted through a boat, engine 
<br/>and a solar freezer. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I hope that answers the question.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the next question has been withdrawn so we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move on to the last question for today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 174/2022 withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Role and Functions – Department of Children 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 175/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  Ministry’s  additional  budget  for  the  establishment  of  the  Department  of 
<br/>Children, can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation inform 
<br/>Parliament on the role and functions of the said Department and the plans in place to progress 
<br/>its establishment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable O’Connor for this very important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge that this is an important progress in Fiji’s history as it 
<br/>marks  a  serious  commitment  by  our  Government  to  finally  establish  a  dedicated  Department  for 
<br/></span><span>Children. Basically, it seeks to ensure a more coordinated, strategic, structured and reformed system 
<br/></span><span>to promote and ensure the prevention and responsive approaches to child protection nationally and 
<br/>internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the functions of the Department is summarised as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress in building the Fijian Child Protection System and delivering quality service 
<br/>for  children  is  hampered  by  limitations  in  legislation,  international  structures  and 
<br/>workforce.  
<br/>Legal reform is needed to bring the Fijian regulatory framework on Child Protection in 
<br/>line with international standards.   
<br/>Institutional reform is needed to ensure consistency between child protection mandate 
<br/>and Government structures in charge of its implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>A need for a specialised and clearly appointed child protection to ensure professional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>practice.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2377 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  of  Children  will  specialise  in  delivering  services  that  are  aligned  with 
<br/>legislative commitments and will serve to strengthen Child Protection and Child Welfare Services 
<br/>nationwide.  Specific roles and functions will include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensuring children’s goals, programmes and service reflect continuous learning of the 
<br/>effect of policies, programmes and services for the wellbeing of families and  
<br/>children; and  
<br/>ongoing development of an integrated child protection system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  specific  allocation  will  address  the  need  to  secure  the  Director  for 
<br/>Children’s  position  and  its  Administrative  Assistant,  while  existing  reforms  will  be  activated  to 
<br/>demarcate Child Protection and Welfare Officers from Social Welfare Officers within our existing 
<br/>structure. This will be an internal process which will require validation, alignment and realignment 
<br/>of its function and purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is making a conscious choice to reform its 
<br/>Child  Protection  System  through  the  establishment  of  the  Department  of  Children.  This  rational 
<br/>supports the dedicated approach Government has for resourcing for this financial year and will be 
<br/></span><span>able  to  pioneer  recruitment  of  the  Director  of  Children  and  the  demarcation  of  roles  and 
<br/></span><span>responsibilities to ensure service provisions on Child Protection and Child Welfare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I would like to add that recently, there has been reports 
<br/>of children on our streets, whether they  are begging or sleeping and homeless.  I believe that this 
<br/>Department will enable our Welfare Officers and Child Protection Officers to handle those cases.  
<br/>And on this note, I am pleased to announce that in this financial year’s budget, the Ministry has been 
<br/>able to secure financial support to ensure we engage an organisation.  We will outsource this service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are profiling the homeless people on our streets.  Currently, we have 189 across the nation.  
<br/>There is no reason for some of them to be on our streets but, unfortunately, circumstances beyond 
<br/>their control has pushed these people and they try to find shelter on our streets.  So, with the added 
<br/>allocation in this financial year, we will be able to secure and outsource the services  for a shelter 
<br/>where these homeless people and children who do not wish to return to their homes can find shelter.  
<br/>It  is  going to  work as  a  night  shelter, where they will get  food and a bed, but  only profiled ones 
<br/>because we are continuously progressing with returning some of these homeless men, women and 
<br/>children to their homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initially, I used to have this view that it is parental responsibility to make sure that the children 
<br/></span><span>stay home, but when we profile these children, we find out a lot of other reasons -reasons like why 
<br/>children do not want to be home so it is justifiable.  Whilst strengthening values for our children and 
<br/>strengthening family units, we want to make sure that children remain in their homes where they are 
<br/>safe and secure from the other evils that happen on the streets.  I thank the public for showing so 
<br/>much interest in the welfare of our children and I hope to get their support in future too so we can 
<br/>return these children back to their homes.
