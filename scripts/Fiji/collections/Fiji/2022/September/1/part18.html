<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Municipal Councils in Fiji are legislated under 
<br/>the  Local  Government Act 1972.   There  exists two  city  councils  and 11 town councils in Fiji.   The 
<br/>municipal councils provide overall policy direction to maintain and improve the quality of services and 
<br/>facilities for the ratepayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was referred the following Annual Reports of the Municipal Councils:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town Council 2006 – 2014 Annual Reports;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council 2006 – 2015 Annual Reports;  
<br/>Ba Town Council 2006 – 2018 Annual Reports;

<br/></span><span>Rakiraki Town Council 2011– 2018 Annual Reports;  
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lautoka City Council 2006 – 2014 Annual Reports;  
<br/>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Sigatoka Town Council 2005 – 2019 Annual Reports;  
<br/>9.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Savusavu Town Council 2005 – 2010 Annual Reports;  
<br/>10.</span><span> </span><span>Lami Town Council 2004 – 2014 Annual Reports;  
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Levuka Town Council 2005 – 2011 Annual Reports;  
<br/></span><span>12.</span><span> </span><span>Nasinu Town Council 2009 – 2010 Annual Reports; and  
<br/></span><span>13.</span><span> </span><span>Labasa Town Council 2004 – 2 017 Annual Reports, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  constitutes  126  Annual  Reports  which  the  Committee  assiduously  examined.  The 
<br/>Committee was referred these Annual Reports over multiple Parliamentary Sessions.  Our plan was to 
<br/>read the more recent reports and formulate pressing questions to be sent to the municipalities for their 
<br/>response, however equal attention were also paid to the more dated Annual Reports in the Operational 
<br/>and the Financial anomalies they contain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the scrutiny of the Annual Reports, extensive communication was made with the Town 
<br/>or City Councils either in person through the undertaking of site visits or via emails and correspondence. 
<br/>During the scrutiny of the Town and City Council Annual Reports, we observed the absolute financial 
<br/>impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operations of the councils, some of whom were facing financial 
<br/>difficulties, even before its concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consequently, Councils have had to delay the construction of some of their capital projects due 
<br/>to the diversion of funds to other urgent activities at that time.  The pandemic has also resulted in many 
<br/>ratepayers  defaulting  on  their  payments  due  to  financial  constraints.    These  has  resulted  in  further 
<br/></span><span>accumulation of rate and rental arrears for the municipalities.   I will now briefly highlight some pertinent 
<br/></span><span>findings  emanating  from  the  Committee’s  inquiries  in  relation  to  each  of  the  municipal  council’s 
<br/>operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council: the key achievement of Suva City Council from 2006 to 2015 involves the 
<br/>improvement of drainage systems, construction of road lanes, capital work projects, fencing, retaining 
<br/>walls and beautification of the city area.  Over the years, major building development and redevelopment 
<br/>approvals were issued. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To contribute to a sustainable city, the Suva City Council has implemented initiative to maintain 
<br/>and enhance the quality of life for people, cleaning initiatives and improvements to public trades.  We 
<br/>note that the total rates of the Suva City Council as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> March 2022 is $9.1 million in principal and 
<br/>balance is interest compounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Collection strategy of arrears was discussed with the Council Management and the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was informed that for defaulting cases:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2319 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payment arrangements were encouraged; 
<br/>source deduction is looked at as an alternative; 
<br/>caveats or charges are placed; and 
<br/>legal actions are taken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ba Town Council:  The Ba Town Council is in the process of programming flood mitigation 
<br/>works which includes drainage upgrading and desilting works.  For example, it has already started drain-
<br/>desilting works in Yalalevu Ward which is a low-lying area prone to flooding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue noted by the Committee was that due to COVID-19 tenants were unable to pay 
<br/>rent  on  time  and  therefore  have  arranged  with  the  Council  to  clear  the  arrears  through  instalment 
<br/>payments. The plans of Ba Town Council to collect outstanding rates include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>house to house visit by Rate Officers to make arrangement with ratepayers on outstanding 
<br/>dates; 
<br/>deduction at source; 
<br/>ratepayers owing less than $5,000 in rates are taken to Small Claims Tribunal; 
<br/></span><span>legal action is taken against ratepayers over than $10,000 in rates; 
<br/></span><span>ratepayers are contracted for arrangement of dues through emails and phone calls; 
<br/>ratepayers are also able to use the online banking platform; 
<br/>irrevocable authority is signed by ratepayers on weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis for 
<br/>arrangement of payments; and 
<br/>demand notices to be served to ratepayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nadi Town Council:  The COVID-19 pandemic posed a major challenge to the operations of 
<br/>Nadi Town Council. As we all know the pandemic had a major impact on Nadi due to its large reliance 
<br/>on tourism. This led to a reduction in the payment of town rates with tenants not being able to pay their 
<br/>rents.    Business  also  suffered  huge  losses.  This  resulted  in  reduced  collection  of  town  rates  thus  the 
<br/>budgeted revenue was not collected which led to some projects being put on hold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that these challenges were addressed as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All staff recruitment who are put on hold; 
<br/>contracts were revisited and tendered out for three years which brought in savings; 
<br/>Grass cutting contract was reduced from two cycles to one cycle on a monthly basis during 
<br/></span><span>the dry spell leading to a savings of approximately $14,000 a month; and 
<br/></span><span>House to house rate visit was undertaken and people were given opportunity to pay town 
<br/>rates instalments through direct deduction for employers, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Committee was informed that to address the issue of flooding in Nadi a significant 
<br/>budget will be required. We note that a project is being undertaken by Government to address flooding 
<br/>in Nadi.  Some of the works that have already been undertaken after the construction of five retention 
<br/>dams on the upper catchments of Nadi River. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ongoing works are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi  Flood  Alleviation  Project  (Part  A)  -  The  components  of  this  part  will  be  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improvements to the Nadi Town drainage system, dikes and retention catchment for the 
<br/>protection of Nadi Town.

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi Flood Alleviation Project (Part B) - the components of this part will be the overall 
<br/>protection  of  town  and  continuation  of  dikes  form  Part  A,  retention  catchments,  river 
<br/>widening and deepening, channel improvements, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi  flood  Alleviation  Project  (Part  C)  -  the  components  of  this  part  will  be  the 
<br/>improvement  to  the  catchment  area.  This  involves  improving  farming  techniques, 
<br/>rehabilitation of degraded slopes and planting of trees on deforested areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town Council:  
<br/>There are two major challenges faced by the Tavua Council: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council grapples with funding constraints. To generate income the Council is now 
<br/>charging fees for some of the services which were previously provided at no cost.  For 
<br/>example, fees are now charged for site inspection, heath inspection, Council referrals, et 
<br/>cetera.  Additionally, the Council will be proposing a garbage collection fee for Tavua.  
<br/>Also it has identified a land for its own car park. We note that these will provide additional 
<br/>income for the Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Council  is  experiencing  technical  expert  shortage.  Therefore  it  has  engaged  in  the 
<br/></span><span>sharing  of  resources  with  Rakiraki  Town  Council  whereby  it  has  shared  the  building 
<br/>Inspector and Health  Inspector with the Rakiraki Town Council. Request has also been 
<br/>made for the assistance of other municipal councils like Ba Town Council and Lautoka 
<br/>Town Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Nausori  Town  Council:  The  key  challenges  facing  the  Nausori  Town  Council  is  financial 
<br/>constraints and its invoice revenue is less than expenses.  The Committee notes that the Council 
<br/>is not in a position to operate without the Government Operational Grant.  Currently the Council 
<br/>receives Solid Waste Grant of $200,000 and Korovou Satellite Town Grant of $50,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Town Council informs the Committee that the plan to address these challenges is through: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing the garbage fees and finding creative ways to reduce cost, increasing the 
<br/>rate  levy  (the  current  levy  is  on  0.01  x  unimproved  capital  value  of  rateable 
<br/>properties).   The Council is in the process of  completing the sectional valuation 
<br/>which will increase the rate levy  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking for new revenue streams such as parking meters, new markets, sporting 
<br/></span><span>facilities and commercial investments. The Council is currently working to procure 
<br/>solar parking meters and collaborating with community or stakeholders to develop 
<br/>facilities or commercial complex 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conscious spending and curbing unnecessary cost: The Council has strengthened 
<br/>this area since 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exploring  more  shared  service  options  with  the  Suva  City  Council  and  Nausori 
<br/>Town Council.  This will help further reduce the cost of doing business and saving 
<br/>provision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Rakiraki Town Council:   
<br/>The total arrears of Rakiraki Town Council as at 28</span><span>th</span><span> March 2022 stood at $1,900.  We 
<br/>note that rate recovery includes follow ups with ratepayers who are making instalment 
<br/>payments.  Ratepayers who have outstanding rates since 2013 have been taken to Small

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Claims Tribunal while those who have tenants are approached to pay their rent in order to 
<br/>subsidise the landlord’s outstanding rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Rakiraki is a true agricultural community and the town council has built a modern market 
<br/>which has a women’s accommodation, conference room and the Council is in the process 
<br/>of building office rental space from the first floor of the market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Lautoka City Council: There are two major challenges faced by the Lautoka City Council 
<br/>and these are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly in relation to planning and development of service delivery with the inclusion 
<br/>of extended rural service areas formerly under the Lautoka Rural Local Authority 
<br/>for  development  permit  management  has  sustainably  increased  workload  in  the 
<br/>planning  and  development.  To  address  this  the  Council  is  in  the  process  of 
<br/>recruitment of additional staff for the department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To fast track approval processes the Ministry of Local Government and Ministry of 
<br/>Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  has  commenced  working  on  the 
<br/>digitalisation of online submission of applications for Ease of Doing Business and 
<br/>has formed a Building Permit Assessment Committee to process investment project 
<br/>applications in excess of a million dollar value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council will need to upgrade its IT system accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Sigatoka Town Council:  
<br/>The Committee noted that the Sigatoka Town Council does not have enough revenue to 
<br/>meet its objectives.  As such, the Council is now working on its plan to having properties 
<br/>which will boost economic return to the Council.  These projects include the construction 
<br/>of office space at its vacant property in Lawaqa, riverside development of cafes, restaurant, 
<br/>bars,  kiosk  and  amphitheatre,  location  of  new  parking  space  at  the  tramline  and  the 
<br/>construction of a new market and bus stand at the Etuba land to accommodate the increase 
<br/>in market vendors and buses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Council is also working with the Special Administrator Board to develop a master 
<br/>plan for Sigatoka Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Savusavu Town Council:  
<br/>The Savusavu Town Council faces the following major challenges: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of its final status, the Council was on overdraft from the Years 2005 to 
<br/>2010 which made it difficult to meet its objectives. 
<br/>In terms of revenue generating projects in the years from 2005 to 2010, the Council 
<br/>had  no  ongoing  revenue  generating  projects.    This  has  limited  the  Council  in  the 
<br/>achievement of its objectives.  We note that the Council is currently addressing these 
<br/>issues but trying to increase its revenue generating projects particularly in the aspect 
<br/>of implementing paid car parks, public convenience, parking meters, constructing a 
<br/>new market with SMA vendors and retail outlets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> There  are  more  revenue  generating  projects  in  the  Council’s  Strategic  Plan  which  it  will  be 
<br/>implementing in coming years to overcome its challenges.

<div><span> Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lami Town Council:  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to bring to the attention of the honourable Members a typographical error 
<br/>on page 14 of the Committee’s report specifically Item 3.11: In respect of the total arrears of the 
<br/>Lami Town Council, I wish to confirm that the total arrears for the Lami Town Council as at 12</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April 2022 stood at $12,173.35 and not $1,217,335 as stated in the Committee Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Committee noted that in order to recover the option in rates arrears, Lami Town Council had 
<br/>issued demand notices and tenants have arranged with the councils to clear arrears with monthly 
<br/>rentals. The major reason given for the default payment is the impact of COVID-19. The main 
<br/>causes  of  rental  arrears  were  due  to  tenant  seeking  time  to  clear  the  arrears  due  to  financial 
<br/>difficulties.  Monthly follow-ups are needed to reduce rental accumulation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  key  challenges  faced  by  the  council  are  the  lack  of  diverse  of  new  streams  and  poor 
<br/>governance resulting in financial losses. We note that the abuse of office at the Council and fraud 
<br/>has been reported to FICAC and is currently under investigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka Town Council:  
<br/>The Committee noted that one of the council pressing needs is greater revenue generation due to 
<br/></span><span>the limited number of ratepayers. For this reason, the town council resorts to the Government and 
<br/></span><span>NGOs for assistance. The Council is also looking at leasing some of the properties and engaging 
<br/>it to other developments in order to increase its revenue. We also note the council has completed 
<br/>its evaluation and we will implement it soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nasinu Town Council:   
<br/>Financial  constraint  is  the  key  challenge  for  Nasinu  Town  Council  as  it  has  limited  funds  to 
<br/>provide services such as grass cutting, drain cleaning, health enforcement prepares to council 
<br/>properties, infrastructure, et cetera.  The council informed us that it could not operate without the 
<br/>annual government operation grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Committee noted that the plan to address this issues is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing the current garbage fees of $78.48 and finding other creative ways to reduce 
<br/>cost.  Currently, the town council has outsourced its solid waste collection to the Suva City 
<br/>Council, the solid waste service requires a good set of fleet which was challenging for the 
<br/>council to cure because of its financial position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing the rate levy. The current rate levy is .006 x unimproved capital value of the rate 
<br/></span><span>property. The council is currently working to conduct the evaluation which it inform the 
<br/>Committee will result in an implement of rate levy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exploring new revenue scheme such as parking metres, construction of markets, spotting 
<br/>facilities and venturing to other commercial investments. The council is currently working 
<br/>to procure solar parking metres and its collaborating with the community or stakeholder to 
<br/>develop its facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conscious spending and carrying unnecessary cost, the council has strengthen these areas 
<br/>since 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exploring more shared services option with the Suva City Council and the Nausori Town 
<br/>Council. This will help further reduce the cost of doing business and provide services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Furthermore, the other challenges faced by the Nasinu Town Council was poor governance

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resulting in financial losses. The abuse of office and fraud cases have been reported to FICAC 
<br/>and is currently under investigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Labasa Town Council:   
<br/>The major challenges encountered .by the Labasa Town Council include natural disasters such as 
<br/>cyclones  and  flooding.  For  findings  in  some  defaulting  ratepayers  are  residing  in  overseas, 
<br/>property  transfers  being  conducted  without notifying the Council  and transfer  notices are not 
<br/>given to the town council, council to adapt to SMEs according to the current IFRS accounting 
<br/>standards. The total rate arrears of the council up until the time of the Committee Inquiry stands 
<br/>at $1,841,845.33 and this includes some of the informal settlements located within Vatia ward at 
<br/>Batinikama. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  encourage  the  Municipal  Councils,  its  Special 
<br/>Administrators, Chief Executive Officers and staff to continue to pursue their mandate or providing active 
<br/>and efficient basic services to Fijians and acknowledge the work done, thus to improve council operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Viam Pillay, the 
<br/>Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, in deliberating on this Review of the Suva City 
<br/></span><span>Council. There are 13 councils and towns that have never been reported since 2004.  Some have been in 
<br/></span><span>2005, some have been in 2007.  So, this reflects the administrations of all town councils how late they 
<br/>have been and I am glad these Annual Reports were tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May and come in August, now it is 
<br/>tabled for debate in Parliament and I thank the Committee for the speed of their review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we from this loyal Opposition, always argue with the honourable Minister that we have to 
<br/>have municipal elections and everything, and she said that the past election, the Mayors and everything 
<br/>were corrupted.  But given that, we are talking about 2004 and 2006, what is happening?  Is this a sign of 
<br/>corruption or non-corruption for the late of the Annual Reports to be reviewed?  This, we have been today 
<br/>in 2022 for 2004, it is irrelevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  will  caution the  honourable Prime  Minister.  Since Monday,  he has been 
<br/>calling me FICAC, and this has been going since 2020, when I was sitting right at the back there.  Every 
<br/>time, I stand up he calls me FICAC.  That curse today has been implemented by the institution.  That 
<br/>what has happened, and just a while ago, he cursed me he said, “FICAC- five years,” and my FICAC 
<br/>case is on Monday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  is  determining  my  future  and  I  hope  that  in  the  Privileges  Committee  for  the  purpose  of 
<br/></span><span>performing  its  functions  and  duties,  the  Committee  may  summon  any  person  to  appear  before  the 
<br/></span><span>Committee to give evidence or provide evidence and for the purposes of the Committee, has the same 
<br/>powers as the High Court to enforce the attendance of witnesses and examine to the oath, affirmation or 
<br/>otherwise  compel  the  production  of  documents  of  other  materials  of  information,  as  required  for 
<br/>performing functions and the duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister should respect the position, and I hope as the loyal Opposition, 
<br/>and respect your position.  Parliament is an independent arm of the State and is fully entitled to take such 
<br/>measures  it  deems  fit,  to  maintain  the  integrity  and  the  quorum  and  to  take  action  for  the  breach  of 
<br/>privilege or contempt of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Constitution and the Standing Orders of Parliament are very clear, in that the control 
<br/>and administration of Parliamentary precinct is vested with the Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, has the authority 
<br/>to  maintain  the  quorum  of  Parliament,  in  accordance  with  the  Standing  Orders.    It  is  the  Speaker’s 
<br/>responsibility to secure and maintain the honour and dignity of Parliament.

<div><span> Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister should refrain from calling me FICAC.  The five years will go 
<br/>against  me.    His  curse  has  been  happening.    I  hope  that  he  will  refrain  from  that  from  tomorrow.  
<br/>Tomorrow, is my last day in Parliament, so you should refrain from that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir with regard to the Suva City Council, it is unfortunate that it could not do its 
<br/>Annual Report since 2006 until 2015.  We do not have 2016, 2017, 2019 until 2022.  The anomalies have 
<br/>been  happening,  the uncollected  arrears for  the last how many  years, it is an embarrassment  for this 
<br/>government.  We are not blaming you but it is the paper that you present.  We are not embarrassing you, 
<br/>we  are  not  going  against  you,  performance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  that  is  what  you  call 
<br/>“unprecedented” but it does not show  here.   I  am not  getting angry,  I  am just  getting  angry  that the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister was teasing me by calling me FICAC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for bringing up 
<br/>the speed of all these.  Even though I can go on and on for the reviews of all the towns and cities in Fiji, 
<br/>we can go on until tomorrow morning, but I will reserve that.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the reviews even though that I have not gone in detail because the anomalies in there 
<br/>and I thank the Chairman.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir and I hope that you will talk to the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister not to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his contribution to the debate.  Sometimes, 
<br/>I am baffled by the honourable Member.  When he is making a complaint, he is smiling fully and I do 
<br/>not know whether he is pulling my leg or whatever and the moment he sits down and he is doing it now, 
<br/>so whether the joke is on the honourable Prime Minister or on me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I have no malice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is still open for debate on this motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk to this Report, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report on the various city councils and town councils on their annual reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee  and  the  Members  of  the 
<br/>Committee.  Looking at the size of the Report, the appendices, their job has been quite a big job and there 
<br/>are a lot of issues that have been highlighted in this particular Report and I think it also shows the enormity 
<br/>of the task that the Ministry of Local Government has had to contend with over the years, in trying to 
<br/></span><span>address the issues related to Municipal Councils all over Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to speak very briefly to some of the recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>recommendations that appear on Page 17 of the Report, the Committee recommendations.  There is a 
<br/>recommendation there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one is about the issue of poor drainage and frequent flooding, calling for the Municipal 
<br/>Councils to work with different stakeholders.  I can confirm in this House that the Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/>(FRA) has been working well with the local governments in looking after the drainage around the roads 
<br/>because FRA tries to the best of its ability to drain the water around the roads and into the waterways and 
<br/>over the past year or so, you have seen the emphasis that the FRA has put into improving drainages in 
<br/>not only around the city  councils and town council areas but all over the country.  There has been a 
<br/>massive exercise in that and FRA will continue to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third bulletpoint, Mr. Speaker, Sir, talks about Municipal Councils for the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government and relevant government agencies and other stakeholders explore ways of reducing traffic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congestion  in  towns  and  cities.    This  is  also  something  that  the  FRA  has  been  focused  on,  working 
<br/>together with local governments.  Over the past one-and-a-half years, we have seen a lot of investment 
<br/>that has been done in ripping and remaking roads all over our urban areas.  Lots of roads have been ripped 
<br/>up and remade to improve the surface of the roads, to make sure that we can try to enhance and reduce 
<br/>traffic congestion by making sure that the services provided have been improved.  This is, I think, more 
<br/>than a 100 kilometres have been done, not only around the towns and cities but all over Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third issue that  I  would like to talk  very  briefly  about is the  fifth bullet point.  The fifth 
<br/>recommendation there when it talks about municipal councils in consultation with the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government, the Ministry of Lands, iTLTB and other stakeholders to streamline the process of obtaining 
<br/>approval for rezoning.  This is also something that the Ministry of Lands has been involved with, together 
<br/>with the Director of Town and Country Planning and other agencies.  Looking at improving our SOPs 
<br/>and to try to make sure that we can speed up the consent to rezoning and subdivision simultaneously.  
<br/>Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I also thank the Committee for their comprehensive 
<br/>Report and at the speed at which they were able to clear the reports as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Local Government acknowledges the recommendations made by the Standing Committee and I will 
<br/></span><span>respond to the 10 recommendations of the Committee in this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  recommendation  one,  the  municipal  councils  are  using  multi-agency 
<br/>approach to work on mitigating measures related to drainage and flooding and you have just heard how 
<br/>the Ministry of  Local Government works with FRA in addressing the flooding issues, as well as the 
<br/>drainage issues in fact.  The Ministry of Waterways have been helping the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>and they have been allocating money to the Municipal Councils for drainage rehabilitation works.  In 
<br/>2019-2020,  the  Ministry  of  Waterways  allocated  $2.2  million  and  through  this  funding,  the  councils 
<br/>carried out maintenance works on drainage in towns and cities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  councils  have  also  carried  out  the  assessment  of  the  drains  and  the  culverts  to  improve 
<br/>drainage in towns and cities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, most town and cities were built on a flood plain when 
<br/>climate change was not a threat.  The drains lie fairly close to the water levels so at high tide, some of 
<br/>these drains fall below the water level, causing significant backflow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these drains are old and it needs to be replaced to deal with above average 
<br/>rainfall and excessive flow of storm water.  It must be noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most closed drains lay 
<br/></span><span>beneath the streets and laneways where roads needs to be ripped to improve the drainage. Accessibility 
<br/></span><span>and  locations  of  these  drains  become  a  problem  to  flush  it  out  completely,  what  we  need  is  new 
<br/>technology such as vacuum pump that can suck the silt and debris out. Where possible, the councils have 
<br/>progressed with the installation of new drainage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 2, the Ministry acknowledges that the council should 
<br/>vigorously pursue collection of all outstanding rates and rental revenues as per the recovery plan.  The 
<br/>Ministry  together  with  the  13  Municipal  Councils  conducted  rate  profiling  exercise  to  improve  rates 
<br/>recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rate Profiling was done for the first to understand whether ratepayers have genuine reasons for 
<br/>not paying rates and when the rate profiling exercise was completed, we found that there were people 
<br/>who rented out their homes and they were living abroad and they did not pay the rates, in other words 
<br/>they were collecting the rent but not paying the rates and similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are other house 
<br/>owners who have rented multiple flats but they still owe rates to municipal council and their businesses 
<br/>who also owe rates to municipal council.  So, rate profiling has really helped the municipal councils to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come up with strategies and to establish what changes can be brought about in the legislations so that 
<br/>simple methods can be used for rate recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I mentioned earlier on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for example in New Zealand, if a rate payer does not 
<br/>pay the rates, if the property is under mortgage then the bank will pay the rates and it gets added on to 
<br/>their loan amount.  So, we need to look at simple and practical methods to collect rate arrears, as we have 
<br/>heard, Mr. Speaker, Sir, councils are engaged in house to house collection, at source deduction, recovery 
<br/>through small claims tribunal and through Magistrate’s Court, placing Caveat on freehold properties and 
<br/>they have offered incentives to ratepayers through discounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the Ministry’s analysis of rate arrears, it was seen that the rate arrears 
<br/>collections has slightly improved in all 13 Municipal Councils.  The Nasinu Town Council showed the 
<br/>biggest rate arrears that is by 25 percent while Nadi and Lautoka recorded a 21 percent recovery of rates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the Nasinu Town Council did very well in 
<br/>rates collection and they opted for legal and debt recovery methods.  Nasinu Town Council filed 1,347 
<br/>cases in the court to recover $3.5 million owed to them, 186 ratepayers cleared the arrears at once and 
<br/>through that, the council collected about $430,000.  Other ratepayers have opted for payment plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of rental arrears, this remains an area to be improved by the Council.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, for rental revenues owed to Suva City Council from 2009 to 2015 has been recovered.  The areas 
<br/>were mainly due to the fact that most of the tenancy agreements had lapsed and were not renewed in a 
<br/>timely manner.    Therefore, the tenants did not feel obliged to keep up with the rental payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rent owed to Suva City Council as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2022 stands at $97,262.  The 
<br/>reason for the rental arrears is the adverse effect of the pandemic. These defaulting tenants have entered 
<br/>into arrangements and the arrears shall be cleared before 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 3, the Councils have initiated major projects that will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assist in the revenue generation and in some cases, the projects are also funded by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Councils rely on rates to deliver services which is the main source of revenues.  So, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some of the projects they have embarked on are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>installation of more than 100 parking metres in their respective municipalities. 
<br/>Children’s Park Event Bure developed in Savusavu. 
<br/></span><span>Namoli Green Night Market and Botanical Garden Coffee Shop in Lautoka. 
<br/></span><span> Market Development Projects for Savusavu, Levuka, Ba Open Shed, Rakiraki, Laqere, 
<br/>Namaka and proposed Navua Market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Mini-Market Development in Flagstaff. Also, the plan is there to develop Mini-Market in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mead Road, Raiwaqa and Nakasi. 
<br/>Sports facilities such as Govind Park and Ratu Cakobau Park which was recently fixed is 
<br/>also earning revenue for the Municipal Councils. 
<br/>Korovou Restroom in Korovou is also generating good revenue for Nausori Town Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 4, Parliament in March 2022 Session had passed an 
<br/></span><span>amendment to the Town Planning Act 1946, removing detailed steps in the scheme amendment process 
<br/>which primarily involved hearing of objections and timelines within which decisions are to be made.  The 
<br/>amendments have also empowered the Permanent Secretary responsible for town planning to modify the 
<br/>Town Planning Schemes by declaring identified areas where natural extension of commercial activities 
<br/>would prevail and block rezone them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2327 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above initiatives are established to streamline the rezoning process. This 
<br/>means that Municipal Councils can now work more efficiently with the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport (MCTTT) to identify more areas for block rezoning and ultimately, reduce the 
<br/>need for developers to make application in a piecemeal manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Recommendation  No.  5,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  has  been 
<br/>collaborating with Municipal Councils to enhance efficiency in their operations through fundamental 
<br/>institutional reforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work culture at Municipal Councils has been quite different from the way other corporate 
<br/>bodies operate.  The staff have been members of trade unions and have entered into collective agreements 
<br/>with unreasonable terms and condition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some collective agreements, there are provisions which is not offered by private sector or the 
<br/>Government. For example, a Council is giving 32 days annual leave to staff who earn more than $10,000 
<br/>and they can accumulate leave up to 124 days.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same Council offers 24 days leave 
<br/>to staff who earn below $10,000 and they can accumulate leave for 50 working days.  The Council also 
<br/>gives 19 days of paid sick leave annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  collective  agreements  are  impractical,  considering  the  changes  in  the 
<br/>Employment  Relations  Act  2007.    A  new  collective  agreement  has  been  drafted  and  cleared  by  the 
<br/>Solicitor-General Office for Councils to negotiate with the unions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Councils  have  new  organisational  structure  and  these  new  organisational 
<br/>structure have been drawn to focus more on customer service, revenue generation and for sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has developed the following policies for the Municipal Councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Manual; 
<br/>Human Resource Manual; 
<br/>Social Media Policy; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Whistle Blower Policy;  
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Council Meeting Guidelines; and  
<br/>Resource Manual for Special Administrators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry holds regular training for Finance and HR teams of the Municipal Councils and 
<br/>similarly, they also hold CEO Forum where guest speakers are invited to speak on different subject matter 
<br/>where the CEOs are given an opportunity to ask any question related to their Municipality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that some Councils have also developed Standard Operating 
<br/>Procedures  (SOPs) to  guide their operation.   On  Recommendation No.  6, section 88(1) of  the  Local 
<br/>Government Act allows Municipal Councils to enter into partnership, joint venture or other commercial 
<br/>arrangement  with  other  Councils  to  promote  health,  welfare  and  convenience  of  the  residents  of  the 
<br/>Municipality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one example of shared services between the Municipal Councils is the solid 
<br/>waste management between Nasinu Town Council and Suva City Council.  The Council also entered into 
<br/>an arrangement with Nadi Town Council to bulk buy digital display parking meters to save costs.  The 
<br/>orders have been placed with a New Zealand company using the Council’s procurement system.  The 
<br/></span><span>meters will assist the Councils in revenue generation. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Savusavu Town Council, under shared services, is helping Rakiraki Town Council and Nausori 
<br/>Town Council in procuring three compactor trucks to provide efficient waste management services in the 
<br/>Municipalities. Beside this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Municipal Councils have made arrangement to share human 
<br/>resource  services,  such  as  Finance  Officers  between  two  Councils  or  Legal  Officers  between  two 
<br/>Councils, and even IT Officers, Building Inspectors, Town Planners between two Municipal Councils.  
<br/>This is being done to save resources for each Municipal Council because the nature of the work is still 
<br/>the same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  No.  7,  the  Ministry  for  Local  Government  has  established  a  working 
<br/>relationship between the Municipal Councils and the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU), to ensure 
<br/>that capital construction policies are effectively implemented at the Council level, because we do realise 
<br/>that Municipal Councils lack capacity in this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 8, Municipal Councils have been working with the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government to put stringent measures against absentee landlords who are defaulting 
<br/>on rate payments, as I had mentioned earlier on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation No. 9, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dog licensing and the dog control is under the 
<br/></span><span>jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture as per the Dog Act 1968.  However, the Councils assist the 
<br/></span><span>Dog Control Programme of the Ministry of Agriculture, SPCA and Animal Fiji.  This includes licensing 
<br/>drive, unlicensed dog trapping and desexing drives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 10, Savusavu, Rakiraki, Tavua  and  Labasa Town 
<br/>Councils have been looking for appropriate dump sites for proper waste disposal.  The Savusavu Town 
<br/>Council has already conducted consultation with the landowners and iTLTB on the new side, which is in 
<br/>Naqere.  Discussions are still underway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rakiraki and Tavua Town Councils have plan to share one dump site, which will be located at 
<br/>Rabulu, Tavua.  The site is a freehold land.  The Council has engaged a valuer to provide valuation of the 
<br/>site.  The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) application has been submitted to the Department of 
<br/>Environment to determine the suitability of the site.  The Council is also in discussion with the Japan 
<br/>International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for their assistance in providing technical assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to honourable Rasova, he raised two issues; one was, why there 
<br/>was a delay in submitting all these Annual Reports?  That is a legacy issue with Municipal Councils, and 
<br/>if  you look at the Annual Reports that were submitted and reviewed by the Committee and  you had 
<br/></span><span>correctly pointed out these Annual Reports were due from 2004.  With a lot of effort placed by the Special 
<br/></span><span>Administrators, we managed to clear all those Reports.   But you must not forget that some of the delay 
<br/>was also because of the Auditor-General’s Office.  They were slow in clearing some of those Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding election, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we have discussed this issue so many times in this 
<br/>Parliament. We have heard the calls made by the Opposition to hold the Local Government Election. We 
<br/>had elected Councillors from 1972 until 2008. The question that I always ask is; what did they do to 
<br/>improve the cities and towns?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a nation, we have learnt a lot from the past when the towns and cities were run by elected 
<br/>councillors.  Past  experience  clearly  shows  that  elected  councillors  lack  the  vision  and  appetite  for 
<br/>progress and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under elected councillors, six Municipal Councils were dissolved due to corrupt 
<br/>practices.  For example, in 1977 within five years after Municipal Election was introduced, the Suva City 
<br/>Council under the Alliance Government was dissolved.  In 1998, again, under the Alliance Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nausori Town Council was dissolved.  Under the SVT Government in 1997, Lautoka City Council was 
<br/>dissolved and also Savusavu Town Council was dissolved.  In year 2000, Sigatoka Town Council was 
<br/>dissolved under the Peoples Coalition and in 2008, under the Interim Government, Nasinu Town Council 
<br/>was dissolved.  The only way forward for the Interim Government at that time was to carry out a review 
<br/>exercise just to find out some of the critical issues.  I will talk about that a little later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  2008,  amendments  were  made  to  the  Local  Government  Act  and  the 
<br/>Special Administrators were introduced to look after the affairs of the Municipal Council.  But talking 
<br/>about corruption, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems that we tend to forget what happened during that period.  Let 
<br/>me just share with you that Suva City Council sold six residential properties where one property was 
<br/>bought by a councillor.  Prime foreshore land was sold to FNPF because elected councillors had no vision 
<br/>for the future. And if you are complaining, why we do not have car parking facilities in the City of Suva 
<br/>then, again, we can talk about what the councillors did in the past.  They sold Stewart Street Car Park, as 
<br/>well as Greig Street Car Park.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such corruption existed and the worst that I found was how the councillors, 
<br/>during elected days, were using money from the council for their own gain.  The Councillors and Mayoral 
<br/>Allowance during that time stood at $189,000.83, excluding travel and reception or entertainment cost.  
<br/></span><span>Evidence shows that councillors were abusing the system by holding multiple meetings for the purpose 
<br/></span><span>of earning allowance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total cost borne by the Council on Mayors and Councillors 
<br/>during that period, that is, in 2007 was $422,128, and that is just for one Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Government review was conducted in 2009 by a three independent 
<br/>member committee, it was found that some Municipal Councils tried to keep their Councils small, in 
<br/>other words, they did not want to lose their political control and, therefore, they did not allow for boundary 
<br/>extension, not like what we are doing now.  We have extended our boundaries and we have included 
<br/>Rural Local Authorities under Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They also found that municipal funds in some councils were frequently expended in feasting and 
<br/>frolicking and, of course, paying salaries for officers who rarely worked or did not deliver at all.  So there 
<br/>are  a  number  of  reviews  that  gives  us  a  direction,  and  the  direction  is  for  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government to review the Local Government Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Local Government Act Review Committee shall be appointed soon to carry 
<br/>out the review exercise.  Areas to be examined will also include the consideration of the best possible 
<br/>model for Council members selection process, whether it should be appointed or elected, appointment, 
<br/></span><span>number of councillors per Council and a system to appoint the first citizen, how many terms a Councillor 
<br/></span><span>may serve, whether it is a system of Board, should continue or have a single boundary, how the election 
<br/>should be conducted, and many more other things.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/>Pillay. First, I wish to convey my appreciation and commend the work of the Chairman and Members of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in their comprehensive deliberations on the Annual Report on 
<br/>the 13 Municipalities.  The same also goes to the Management and Staff of all the Municipalities around 
<br/>the country for their steadfast commitment to overcoming the challenges brought by the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the challenges the Municipal Councils are facing as highlighted 
<br/>in  the  Review  Report  by  the  Committee,  and  the  colossal  financial  impact  of  the  pandemic  on  the 
<br/>Councils’ operations.  What is important to address in this august Parliament is, how these Municipal 
<br/>Councils through the Ministry of Local Government, are rectifying these issues in the context of our 
<br/>recovery which, I might add, are progressing well because we planned for it well.

<div><span> Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know that discussions and deliberations of Review Reports presented in this 
<br/>Parliament and operations of respective agencies in Government who were impacted by the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, and I am sure that honourable Members on the other side of Parliament will blame us for the 
<br/>once-in-a-century pandemic.  Sir, COVID-19 brought these challenges, and we are the ones who solved 
<br/>them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my Government has always promoted the modernisation of the delivery of services 
<br/>to its people and this include the services of Municipal Councils.  In all the years of operation of Municipal 
<br/>Councils legislated under the Local Government Act 1972, no other government has stepped forward to 
<br/>modernise the  services of these Councils.   No  other  Government,  Mr. Speaker, but my  Government 
<br/>recently  introduced  the  use  of  digital  transactions  across  the  whole  of  Government,  including  the 
<br/>respective  Councils,  which  is  funded  in  the  annual  budgetary  provision  under  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government’s budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, introduced its transaction services to facilitate the payments 
<br/>from customers through M-PAiSA and Electronic Fund Transfers at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) machines.  
<br/>It is safe to say that this is part of my Government’s vision to modernise services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is sad to say that there are some honourable Members on the other 
<br/></span><span>side who continuously condemn my stand in the international arena on climate change.  They go on to 
<br/>say that there has been no work done here in Fiji.  That is the shame because work related to climate 
<br/>change and disaster risk mitigation in Fiji happens on a daily basis and those who keep barking will keep 
<br/>on barking, without having a feel of what really is happening here in the country.  The seawalls  that are 
<br/>being built, the research being done on resilient crops, the innovation that is taking place guided by the 
<br/>Climate Change Act, that ranks amongst the boldest and most sweeping pieces of climate legislation 
<br/>anywhere in the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To put it into perspective, my Government believes in solutions that are transformative, practical 
<br/>and affordable enough to be embraced on a greater scale.  To this effect, Mr. Speaker, the disaster flood 
<br/>mitigation works in Ba and Nadi are ongoing, and will continue to be prioritised under my Government.  
<br/>I  acknowledge all development partners  who  have contributed to these  projects in  Nadi and  Ba,  and 
<br/>reaffirm my Government’s continued commitment in this regard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other major issue noted by the Committee is the arrears of rates, which have 
<br/>somehow impacted the operations of the Councils.  I acknowledge the work of the Councils with the 
<br/>respect  of  customers  on  the  established  agreed  modes  of  repayments.    Mr.  Speaker,  recognise  the 
<br/></span><span>uniqueness, quality of lifestyle and range of investment opportunities of each of our towns and cities, and 
<br/></span><span>I pledge my Government’s continued support to the tailored solutions needed at the local level.  Based 
<br/>on those remarks, I do support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief as the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister and Minister for Local Government have made a number of substantial comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, one of the issues that we wish to highlight also from an efficiency perspective is the close 
<br/>collaboration now between the different municipalities.  As we have seen, a lot of the municipalities are 
<br/>now sharing resources.  Before there was demarcation between each of the individual municipalities, 
<br/>whether it is Tavua, Ba, Lautoka, Nadi - they would have their own finance officers, they would have 
<br/>their own legal  people, they  would have their own sort  of  IT  people,  now there  is  an opportunity to 
<br/>collaborate and that is what they are doing precisely which means that we save on resources.  They do 
<br/>not have much overhead costs from that perspective and they need to obviously keep on doing that even 
<br/>further and have a more sophisticated approach in that sense.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Municipal Councils 2004-2019 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a number of challenges in respect of the municipalities as has been 
<br/>highlighted vis-à-vis climate change.   Towns like Nadi, Ba and of course even towns like Labasa, they 
<br/>do get affected by rising waters, and they do get affected by climatic events.  That has a huge impact on 
<br/>the ability of the council to deliver services but also to be able to upgrade the infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have now seen that FRA is responsible for all the footpaths, street lighting, et cetera.  There 
<br/>is an arrangement with FRA and the municipal councils.  It does mean that we need to be able to share 
<br/>or be able to get the right organisations to provide those services.  In the same way, Sir, recently we have 
<br/>seen some of the larger projects that the municipal councils want to engage in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) is now involved and they are helping the councils 
<br/>because sometimes, as we have seen with some of the smaller municipalities, they may not necessarily 
<br/>have  the  right  expertise  and  level  of  technological  understanding  to  carry  out  some  of  these  capital 
<br/>projects.  So even things like tender documents that have been issued or expressions of interest, do not 
<br/>necessarily capture the essence of what is required and indeed some of the sophisticated approaches to 
<br/>construction.    That  is  why  we  have  now  seen  closer  collaboration  between  CIU  and  the  municipal 
<br/>councils.  We have heard about the Lautoka Swimming Pool issue where we have now got them involved 
<br/>to be able to provide that level of expertise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  other  point  that  the  Minister  responsible  for  Local  Government,  honourable  Premila 
<br/>Kumar highlighted in respect to the municipal councils, is that unfortunately a lot of the issues that we 
<br/>are facing now in particular, has to do with asset base.  A lot of prime real estates were in fact sold off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The site just in front of Suvavou House is owned by Carpenters - it is State lease that was sold off 
<br/>to Carpenters.  The land was just lying idle until when Minister Koya was Minister for Lands, threatened 
<br/>them that they had not carried out any development, they suddenly started doing some work on it.  They 
<br/>put up an incomplete building that is still there to say that we have carried out development.  We need to 
<br/>amend the law in response to the definition of “development”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen a number of asset base that has been eroded and a lot of people do not understand 
<br/>that land now is becoming far more valuable in particular in the municipality areas and we need to be 
<br/>able to address that issue.  We need to be able to also partner with the private sector.  There are a lot of 
<br/>creative  ways  in  which  we  can  partner  with  the  private  sector.    The  Minister  and  I  were  having  a 
<br/>discussion the other day as to how we can get private sector to, for example, build infrastructure.  There 
<br/>could be some shared not just services but also shared profit margins then we could have in profit sharing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point from the  governance  perspective,  the  Minister  has  also led the  charge in  local 
<br/></span><span>government regarding things like developing finance manuals - many of the municipalities did not have 
<br/>a finance manual.  They did not have for example, a human resources manual.  They did not have a social 
<br/>media policy or whistleblower policy, how to conduct council meeting guidelines, resource manual for 
<br/>special  administrators  –  these  are  fundamental  governance  issues  and  none  of  these  existed  in  the 
<br/>councils.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are very necessary documentations and necessary guidelines critical to 
<br/>have, in order to ensure we have governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I wish to make Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that in March, 2022 of this year of course, 
<br/>Parliament  passed  an  amendment  to  the  Town  Planning  Act  1946,  removing  the  superfluous 
<br/>arrangements that we have to put in place to get a scheme amended in the process so as we have said and 
<br/>we hope to do that very soon through the town and country planning in the municipal areas.  There are 
<br/>certain areas - you know if you look at Rewa Street, some of it is commercial, some of it is residential 
<br/>more  and  more  commercial  requirements  are  there  now.    If  you  look  at  Bau  Street  some  are  still 
<br/>residential/commercial.  We should be able to declare these areas which will happen, as all commercial.  
<br/>If people still want to continue as residences they can.  They will pay the residential rate but those who

<div><span> Review Report - FRA 2016-2018 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>want to upgrade it to commercial they simply can do so without having to go through the process of 
<br/>applying for rezoning each and every time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point also Mr. Speaker, Sir, to also encourage investors in the municipal areas is the 
<br/>idea to  have mixed development.  We  do  not have that  approach of mixed development.   If  you  go 
<br/>overseas to places like Singapore even Australia and New Zealand you will find a building in which you 
<br/>may actually have a hospital or medical clinic, you may have restaurants, you will have offices, you will 
<br/>have residences so it is what  you call mixed development. Our laws in fact have not allowed that to 
<br/>happen - you either apply for residential or commercial or having a supermarket.  But we should be able 
<br/>to have all and this is part and parcel of growing this sort of business environment, having the flexibility 
<br/>and  the  liberal  approach  to  town  planning.    This  is  critically  important  not  only  to  instil  investor 
<br/>confidence but also to allow for collection of rates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many countries in the world Sir, even if you are renting a flat that is not owned by you but owned 
<br/>by someone else obviously, your rent actually includes your municipal rates and if you do not pay your 
<br/>municipal rates you actually cannot leave the country.  In Fiji we are very flexible.  People have not paid 
<br/>rates for years, they come in and out of Fiji as and when they like.  In fact in places like France if you 
<br/>have parking metre fines owing, you cannot leave the country you have to pay that and only then will 
<br/></span><span>you be able to leave.  We are not saying that we are going to do that in Fiji but this is just to show how 
<br/></span><span>seriously municipal rates need to be taken into account.  Many jurisdictions have done that, but we have 
<br/>taken a more liberal approach.  We need to ensure there is responsibility by the ratepayers and in the 
<br/>meantime of course, these governance issues have been addressed.  Thank you Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,
