<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - RESERVE BANK OF FIJI INSURANCE  
<br/>2019–2020 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I move : 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Reserve Bank of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Insurance 2019/2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BJHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V. NATH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing  Committee on Economic Affairs  tabled its 
<br/>Report on the Consolidated Review Report of the Reserve Bank of Fiji Insurance Annual Reports for the 
<br/>years 2019/2020  which was tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, certain risks are unavoidable and we all agree. Insurance is an essential risk 
<br/></span><span>mitigation  and  an  investment  tool  especially  when  injuries  and  unexpected  hardships  can  befall  on 
<br/>anyone.   Insurance has continued to play an important role in mitigating loses of this nature at household, 
<br/>businesses, national and global level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji plays  a pivotal supervisory  role in the insurance  industry  under  its 
<br/>financial  stability  mandate  as  to  ensure  that  insurance  companies  remains  safe  and  sound  while  also 
<br/>delivering quality customer services. The Committee while deliberating on the 2019/2020 Annual Report 
<br/>agreed that insurance underwriters needed to work with relevant stakeholders to launch the awareness 
<br/>programme so that insurance covers are seen as a risk mitigation factor rather than additional expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee  was made  aware that  certain insurance companies have made  access  to their 
<br/>services easier by adopting digital technology including but not limited to applications, online payment 
<br/>and probably claims submission.  Given the lessons that COVID-19 has taught us, initiatives such as this 
<br/>are welcome and encouraged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, submission from the Governor of Reserve Bank and his team reinforced the 
<br/>Committee’s view that climate was another area that was expected to persist with its own set of challenges 
<br/></span><span>and efforts were made to increase coverage for disaster risk and mitigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on success of micro-bundle insurance the Committee has encouraged the consortium of 
<br/>underwriters to come up with various packages that is affordable to all Fijians.  The Committee also 
<br/>believes that further avenues could be explored to include other agricultural produce such as </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, </span><span>dalo 
<br/></span><span>and other subsistence farmers, cooperatives and market vendors in Fiji Care Micro-Bundle Insurance.   
<br/>Based  on  the  RBF  Annual  Report  and  the  subsequent  presentation  by  the  relevant  stakeholders  the 
<br/>Committee commended the overall performance of the insurance industry during the period under review.  
<br/>With those few comments, I request that the Parliament debates on this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Firstly I want to thank the Committee for this Report and I support the 
<br/>motion.  We all understand that Insurance is an essential risk, mitigation and also an investment tool to 
<br/>safeguard people from possible risk and uncertainties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution is basically giving three suggestions which I believe should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bridge the gap in insurance coverage for our communities and also food for thought for relevant
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report - RBF Insurance 2019-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders.  I will quickly draw your attention to the Committee Recommendation No. 2 and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Given  the  large  volume  of  vehicles  on  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  the  Committee 
<br/>recommends insurance companies to conduct a comprehensive insurance study to identify 
<br/>basic insurance package that could be offered to all motor vehicle owners at a reasonable 
<br/>cost” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2020  we  have  130,000  motor  vehicle  on  our  roads  and  to  date  this  must  have  increased 
<br/>significantly  and  likewise  the  number  of  accidents  through  drunk  driving,  careless  driving  and  stray 
<br/>animals.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I therefore suggest that there is an urgent need to provide insurance cover for 
<br/>people in our society who suffered financial loss through no fault vehicle accidents. What I mean, Sir, the 
<br/>same insurance cover that apply under the Accident Compensation Commission for victims under the no 
<br/>fault policy – compensation is provided  to people who suffered personal injury or death as a result of 
<br/>accident caused by motor vehicles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am suggesting that this could be replicated to cover the no fault policy in vehicle accidents. 
<br/>There are numerous numbers of vehicle owners in our country who have been victims of this no fault 
<br/>category and some have faced difficulties to repair their vehicle since the vehicle causing the accidents 
<br/></span><span>are not insured. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I have come across many cases where victims have reported the case to the police but they 
<br/>are told that the police cannot force the instigator to pay for the repair costs if the vehicle is not insured.  
<br/>This  leaves  the  victims  with  no  option  but  to  lodge  a  claim  to  the  Small  Claim  Tribunal  which  we 
<br/>understand will take months and years, but if they are covered under the no fault policy then repairs will 
<br/>be immediate and life goes on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My second suggestion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to stakeholder is to expand its micro bundling insurance 
<br/>scheme for pensioners and civil servants to cover cyclone and flood damages in the insurance cover.  So 
<br/>far it only offers indemnity for life insurance for $3,000, funeral expenses $1,000, fire and explosion to 
<br/>the insured person’s house is $3,000 and $3,000 for personal injury. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2019 RBF Insurance Annual Report has indicated that the major natural 
<br/>disaster losses comes from flood related causes and in Fiji’s case it is also cyclone damage.  But this has 
<br/>not been covered in the bundling insurance scheme and I suggest if this Government to spend a few extra 
<br/>dollars to expand this coverage to flood and cyclones.  This will help home owners to rehabilitate after a 
<br/>cyclone, flooding or disasters immediately.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My third suggestion is for that bundled insurance scheme be extended to </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers.  To 
<br/>date the bundled insurance only covers sugar cane farming, rice farming, copra farming and dairy farming 
<br/>but  </span><span>yaqona  </span><span>farmers  are  missing  here  which  is  very  unfortunate  since  </span><span>yaqona  </span><span>has  been  the  leading 
<br/>exporting commodity and leading foreign income earner for the last four years in agriculture.  We need 
<br/>to address this issue with some urgency to maintain sustainability in the industry that has been providing 
<br/>employment opportunities and contribution to our GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vijay Nath. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Insurance Industry is regulated by the Reserve Bank of Fiji to ensure 
<br/>that the industry remains sound with a strong solvency position.  Insurance is an essential risk mitigation 
<br/>measure against possible harm simply put, Mr. Speaker Sir, it protects against uncertainties - something 
<br/>that is more important than ever given the worsening impacts of climate change.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - RBF Insurance 2019-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2355 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we hopefully all know, all interested insurance companies need to be licensed 
<br/>by the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  The RBF is required to ensure that the insurance industry performs within 
<br/>the laws of the Insurance Act while delivering quality services to the Fijian people.  According to the 
<br/>World Bank, Fiji is one the country’s most vulnerable to climate change and climate related disasters.  
<br/>Fiji is ranked 14th out of the 181 countries in terms of risk from natural disaster according to the World 
<br/>Risk Index 2021.  Beside these threats, Sir, there are those that affect us personally such as damage to the 
<br/>property, health and medical coverage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  is  a  developing  country  and  it  is  susceptible  to  many  risks  aside  from  natural  disasters 
<br/>including volatile global crisis and other global economic challenges.  Today, around 41 percent of Fijians 
<br/>have access to an insurance product.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir is an encouraging figure that is largely due 
<br/>to the introduction of the Bundle Insurance Product in 2017 that saw more people taking up insurance 
<br/>policies  through  coordination  with  established  farming  bodies  such  as  the  Sugarcane  Growers  Fund, 
<br/>Copra Millers Limited, Fiji Rice Limited and Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji together with the UN capital development fund, recently introduced another 
<br/>two new parametric micro-insurance products to the Fijian market.  The products offer insurance cover 
<br/>against cyclones including both heavy winds and rainfall and are designed to offer immediate financial 
<br/></span><span>support after extreme weather events for our most vulnerable communities including farmers, fishers, 
<br/></span><span>market vendors and small businesses.   The second product specifically targets Department of Social 
<br/>Welfare recipients living in high climate risk locations and will be rolled out in partnership with the Fijian 
<br/>Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and the World Food Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, in the most recent Insurance Annual Report prepared by the RBF for 2020, it 
<br/>was noted that despite the pandemic driven decline of the global economy, the Fijian Insurance Industry 
<br/>recorded positive performances in 2020 similar to the global insurance market.  This trend has continued 
<br/>with the recent revision of macro-economic forecast for Fiji in June, 2022, and the insurance industry is 
<br/>expected to contribute positively to economic growth this year as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, insurance is an important financial tool for addressing risks that Fijians face 
<br/>every day. These last two years alone have shown how important it is to have a defence life insurance in 
<br/>difficult times.  When insurance industry continues to grow with more Fijians choosing to get insured.  I 
<br/>hope to see more affordable insurance options and for more Fijians to embrace this protection.  It is the 
<br/>right choice to protect our families, to protect our lives, to protect our businesses in our community from 
<br/>the uncertainties of the future. Based on these remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion. Thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  I just want to highlight to 
<br/>honourable Members that Government has been trying to ensure that we have more insurance products 
<br/>available and indeed become affordable.  As has been seen through the latest budget we delivered, Sir, in 
<br/>the latest update on August, 2021 you will see that insurance products include life insurance, medical 
<br/>insurance, parametric insurance which the honourable Prime Minister had mentioned, are VAT exempt.  
<br/>It  is  absolutely  no  VAT  on  that  to  be  able  to  make  it  look  more  affordable,  Sir.  Of  course,  any 
<br/>compensation is paid out by ACCF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need to obviously have a life insurance is critically important when more 
<br/>and more people have life insurance as a safety net for themselves and also for their families, in the event 
<br/>they have what we call “term-life insurance”.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wish to make, 
<br/>honourable Kuridrani I hope you have  heard the honourable Prime Minister mentioned that parametric 
<br/>insurance is now which actually covers people for cyclones or winds and also rainwater damage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Kuridrani would be pleased to know that just about a week and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report - RBF Insurance 2019-2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a half ago, we launched at the GPH, the augmentation of that.  So Government currently is paying the 
<br/>premium for parametric insurance for those people who are the most vulnerable, who are social welfare 
<br/>recipients.  We are giving them parametric insurance.  They are also given, what we call the micro-
<br/>insurance that you had mentioned.  He had mentioned that one of </span><span>dalo</span><span> and </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers recommended 
<br/>that they should be included.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the only reason why we have sugarcane, dairy, copra and rice farmers, is that 
<br/>they  have  organisations  that  represent  them,  so  the  deduction  of  the  premium  is  done  through  those 
<br/>organisations.  If we had one organisation for </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers, one organisation for </span><span>dalo</span><span> famers, it wold 
<br/>be very easy for them to do so.  That is the only reason and that is the only thing that is stopping them.  
<br/>And we have seen the recommendation for co-operatives; indeed co-operative organisations can also 
<br/>have that and they are open to that.  We understand that Fiji Care is reaching out to those organisations 
<br/>to enable more people to be insured.  If you see the statistics, in fact close to $300,000 has already been 
<br/>paid out under the micro-insurance bundle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point I wish to make is, honourable Kuridrani mentioned motor vehicle 
<br/>insurance under the no fault system - you cannot have motor vehicle insurance under the no fault system.  
<br/>No fault system is what we call for Worker’s Compensation under ACCF. We have no fault system so if 
<br/></span><span>you have a third party or if you are a passenger in the vehicle or if you have a road accident where the 
<br/></span><span>person  actually  dies,  it  is  not  for  compensation  for  the  material  damage  to  the  vehicle,  but  it  is 
<br/>compensation for the physical damage to a human being, which is what we want to be covered for.  That 
<br/>is the no fault system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The no fault system is that we do not assign, so before, previously, if you have a child running 
<br/>out in front of a bus crossing the road, they get hit by a car, the insurance company that represents the 
<br/>motor vehicle owner will say that is contributory negligence, that the child actually ran in front of the bus, 
<br/>therefore, we are not culpable, we should not pay for it, because it is the child’s fault.  We have now 
<br/>removed that.  Even though it may have been the child’s fault, the family will get compensation, if the 
<br/>child dies.  If the child does not die but has some form of disability as the result of the accident or some 
<br/>of inability to carry out normally bodily functions, they will get compensation, in the same way with 
<br/>Worker’s Compensation.   Before, under the old scheme, for example, if I am a sawmiller, I am talking 
<br/>about forestry, if I went to work and accidently my finger went into the sawmill and I lost the finger, the 
<br/>employer through the insurance company could say that is contributory negligence because when he 
<br/>came to work, we saw him not walking straight because he was drinking too much grog the night before.  
<br/>As a result of that, he contributed to the negligence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now under the ACCF scheme, whether or not he contributed, or whether he was grog doped or 
<br/></span><span>not, if you are at the work place, you get injured, you get paid for it.  And also there are set amount of 
<br/>figures that you get paid.  If I am right handed and I lose my right hand, the amount of payout for my 
<br/>right hand will be a lot more than my left hand.  If you want to challenge that amount that you are getting 
<br/>paid without engaging lawyers actually, you get those payout without engaging lawyers, but if I want to 
<br/>challenge that, I have the right to go hire a lawyer and challenge that.  We cannot have that for material 
<br/>damage to motor vehicles, because insurance is also about making sure it is sustainable.  You need to 
<br/>have a pool of people who will insure and they are paying the right premium given the risk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have already highlighted this and honourable Kuridrani kind of answered the question.  There 
<br/>are a lot of accidents in Fiji, there are a lot of people who overspeed, there are still a lot of people who 
<br/>actually drink and drive.  So if we ourselves change our behaviour in how we act and perform on the 
<br/>road, then the risk will become lower.  In the same way, before people used to get cyclone insurance, but 
<br/>because  there  has  been  increase  in  cyclones,  it  has  become  a  very  high  risk.    Therefore,  insurance 
<br/>companies do not actually homes unless you meet certain certification.  That is why we developed the 
<br/>parametric insurance.
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2357 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the RBF for monitoring the insurance companies and we 
<br/>are seeing now lot more activities. I also would like to single out, the insurance companies like Fiji Care 
<br/>that actually came to our assistance during COVID-19, where they provided products, they are currently 
<br/>working now with Sun Insurance as far as parametric insurance is concerned but with the micro insurance 
<br/>bundling,  they  were  the  first  ones  who  came  forward  and  are  working  together  with  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last issue that I also wish to mention is health insurance.  As we have said, 
<br/>now ordinary Fijians can get access to General Practitioners so they do not actually need to be able to 
<br/>afford  to  go  see  those  doctors,  the  Government  actually  pays  for  it,  but  with  the  surgeries  current 
<br/>procedures are not available in Fiji.  One of them, of course, being open-heart surgery.  We did mention 
<br/>that there has been some delays with it because of COVID-19.  God willing in the next few weeks’ time, 
<br/>they will be able to do open-heart surgeries but it means that the cost of insurance for medical insurance 
<br/>will come down.  If a lot of the procedures are available in Fiji then the cost of insurance will come down.  
<br/>It is already VAT exempt and in that way people having a lot better and easier access to procedures, some 
<br/>of it which will now be available in Fiji but also some that may be offshore which will bring down the 
<br/>overall  cost  of  insurance  in  Fiji  as  far  as  the  health  sector  is  concerned.    I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>Committee for their Report.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and honourable Inosi Kuridrani for their contributions and I take this opportunity to thank the 
<br/>Governor of RBF, Mr. Ariff Ali and his team.  Honestly speaking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Ariff Ali is a 
<br/>workaholic.  He was very efficient and always responded to the request of the Committee whenever we 
<br/>wanted him to respond and throwing the question to and fro.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once a week at least someone will give me a call regarding FijiCare Bundled 
<br/>Micro Insurance and ACCF.  These two products in fact are mind-blowing and I thank the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister.  He is the only person probably I would say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who had the vision to 
<br/>launch  these  programmes.    No  other  government  ever  thought  of  this,  probably  in  their  dreams.  
<br/>Honourable Inosi Kuridrani is shaking his head.  We thank the honourable Prime Minister for launching 
<br/>this product which everyone is talking about.  When you have death in the family, when social welfare 
<br/>recipients  need  the  money,  often  they  call  us  and  find  out  how  they  can  get  this  money  for  funeral 
<br/>purposes.  So I take this opportunity, Sir, to thank the honourable Members for their contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note  the  content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
