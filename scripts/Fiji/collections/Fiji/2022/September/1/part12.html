<div><span>Review Report - Electoral Commission Annual Report 2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  by way of introduction, the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Justice,  Law  and  Human  Rights  was  referred  the  Electoral  Commission  Annual  Report  2019  and 
<br/>mandated to review the Annual Report and table its findings back to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like the other Committee Reports tabled this week, the Committee Report tabled 
<br/>today provides details of the Committee’s review of the Annual Report including the initial deliberation; the 
<br/>findings,  and the concluding  remarks by  the Committee.   I  would like to  mention a few highlights and 
<br/>activities for the Commission in 2019 that were identified from the review, which includes –

<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The immense support provided to the Commission from development partners including 
<br/>the  Election  Commission  of  India  and  the  Australian  Electoral  Commission,  which 
<br/>included visits to the two respective jurisdictions for the purpose of observing their electoral

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  also  standout  matters  noted  from  the  Annual  Report,  that  the 
<br/>Committee felt needed further deliberation, which included somewhat insufficient financial information 
<br/>recorded in the Annual Report.  A few discrepancies were noted in the budget references and discrepancy 
<br/>in  the  recording  of  the  number  of  Commission  meetings.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  these  matters  were 
<br/>addressed accordingly by the Committee through discussions with the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of the review, the Committee identified few key findings, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Electoral Commission had undertaken a review of the 2018 General Elections and had 
<br/>identified  the  main  areas  of  improvements,  which  includes  continuous  assessment  and 
<br/>monitoring  responsibilities  in  key  areas  of  the  Electoral  Management,  with  a  focus  on 
<br/>improving  the  process  that  guide  the  Commission’s  service  delivery,  and  ensuring 
<br/>acceptability of the election process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  key  positive  changes  realised  by  the  Electoral  Commission,  which 
<br/>strengthens its independence, and one of which is the ability of the Commission to control 
<br/>its own budget that is separate from the Fijian Elections Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was encouraging to note the numerous activities and initiatives that the Commission is 
<br/></span><span>undertaking  and  is  planning  to  undertake,  which  promotes  gender  equality  and 
<br/>empowerment of women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.   The Commission had demonstrated that it also prioritises reducing inequality and promotes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>political inclusion of everyone in Fiji and those who are living with disability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reiterate one of the key challenges faced by the Electoral Commission which 
<br/>was the  publication  and spread of  false  and misleading  information through online and 
<br/>social media platforms in the last General Election.  This is the key issue we noted as the 
<br/>Committee  that  needs  to  be  given  enough  consideration  and  address  through  necessary 
<br/>means, for example, changes to legal framework governing such publications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.    Relevant amendment provided in Bill No. 49 of 2022, can cater for these issues highlighted 
<br/>by the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, regarding the challenges 
<br/>faced by the electoral management bodies during the 2018 General Election, which was 
<br/>misleading  and  false  information  flooding  the  social  media  platforms.    This  diverted 
<br/>necessary resources from the running of the election to trying to curb such unethical tactics 
<br/></span><span>during the election period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Another point of discussion that was done with Electoral Commission was on the size of 
<br/>the ballot paper and what action would have been taken by the Electoral Commission in 
<br/>case of multiple parties.  Little did we realise at that point in time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in 
<br/>this General Election we would have at least 10 registered political parties with potentially 
<br/>more than 500 candidates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Having said that, the size of the ballot paper in 2018 was A3 size.  The Committee had 
<br/>already suggested if the size of the box on the ballot paper can be increased a bit to easily 
<br/>locate the numbers.  If the numbers of the candidates increases, then the size of the ballot 
<br/>paper will increase.  If over 500 candidates contest the election, it will be impossible to fit 
<br/>the ballot paper books and other election materials in the ballot box for transportation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  such  scenarios,  the  law  needs  to  be  flexible  and  allow  the  Electoral  Commission  to 
<br/>determine  the  most  practical  means  to  transport  the  ballot  paper  securely  and  in  a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparent manner from the polling station to the national result centre.  Therefore, there 
<br/>was a discussion that numbers allocated to candidates should be restricted to three digits.  
<br/>This will maintain consistency as well as not increase the size of the ballot paper. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the conclusion of the review the Committee acknowledges and commends 
<br/>the Electoral Commission for the strides it has taken in improving many areas of their service delivery in 
<br/>the electoral system in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  honourable  Members  will  note  from  the  Committee’s  Report  there  were  numerous 
<br/>achievements by the Commission including successful General Election in 2018, which was considered 
<br/>by Multinational Observer Group as having processes that were transparent and credible overall, and the 
<br/>outcome broadly represented the will of the Fijian voters.  Additionally, it was noted that there were 
<br/>further improvements of processes for the election, and numerous initiatives that the Commission was 
<br/>undertaking to promote gender equality and empowerment of women and inclusion of all persons in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee, honourable Rohit Sharma, honourable Mosese Bulitavu, honourable Salik Govind, 
<br/>honourable  Mikaele  Leawere  and  former  Member  honourable  Ratu  Suliano  Matanitobua  for  their 
<br/></span><span>deliberation  and  input,  and  alternate  Members  who  made  themselves  available  when  the  substantive 
<br/></span><span>Members could not attend, and the secretariat for their support.  I also acknowledge the representatives 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  electoral  management  bodies  who  kindly  answered  the  Committee’s  request  and  made 
<br/>themselves available to answer pertinent questions which assisted the Committee with its work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I close my address this morning, I take this opportunity on behalf of the 
<br/>Committee to commend the great work carried out by the Electoral Commission in terms of the work 
<br/>post-election and the work it has done, and is doing, to improve many areas of their service delivery in 
<br/>electoral system in Fiji, in anticipation of the upcoming General Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Committee  I  commend  the  Electoral  Commission  Annual  Report  2019  to 
<br/>Parliament and request the honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the contents of 
<br/>the Committee’s Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary- General)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Fiji Meat Industry Board Annual Report 2015 – 2017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased to 
<br/>submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of Fiji Meat Industry Board Annual Report 2015–
<br/>2017.  The FMIB works with the mission of proving slaughtering and processing services in facilities 
<br/>that are internationally-benchmarked for safety, hygiene and quality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of its deliberations, the Committee invited executives from FMIB to provide a submission 
<br/>for the period under review.  It was noted that the industry has been facing numerous challenges which 
<br/>includes but are not limited to dwindling livestock numbers and high maintenance costs due to aged 
<br/>abattoir facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee made recommendation for FMIB to develop a multiyear strategic plan which 
<br/>systematically addresses these challenges and sets the organisation in the right direction.  Furthermore, 
<br/>the Committee during its deliberation also noted the need to review the Meat Act of 1970.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommended  for  FMIB  to  consider  the  option  of  vertical  integration  which 
<br/>would entail exploring the viability of having an own supply farm as part of a retail butcher.  It will also 
<br/>enable FMIB to complement its supply of live animals and maintain the minimum throughput necessary.  
<br/>I  would like to take this  opportunity  to  extend our appreciation to the representative from FMIB  for 
<br/>making time to present before the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced 
<br/>this Report – Deputy Chair, honourable Veena Bhatnagar, honourable Sachida Nand, honourable Inosi 
<br/>Kuridrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.  I also take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the 
<br/></span><span>parliamentary staff who have given us invaluable support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Review Report of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FMIB Annual Report 2015–2017 to the Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General)

<div><span> HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – Office of the Auditor-General Annual Report 2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker,  at  the  outset,  I  am pleased to present the Committee 
<br/>Review Report on the 2021 Annual Report of the OAG.  The Committee reviewed the above-mentioned 
<br/>Report and provided the details of the review that was carried out by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OAG is established under Section 151 of the Constitution of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji and the Audit Act 1969 further specifies the powers of the Auditor-General to audit the Whole of 
<br/>Government  Financial Statement  and the Report of all  entities  of Government.  It also  empowers the 
<br/>Auditor-General  to  conduct  Performance  Audit  of  government  entities  to  ensure  Parliament  that  the 
<br/>entities are achieving their objective effectively and in doing so, economically and in compliance with 
<br/>the relevant legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Auditor-General  is  responsible  on  behalf  of  the  Parliament  to  audit  the  accounts  of  all 
<br/>government  agencies,  state-owned  entities,  statutory  authorities,  municipal  councils  and  provincial 
<br/>councils except for its own office and those entities that may be exempted by law.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Auditor-General  carried  out  the  audit  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  provisions  of  the 
<br/>standards on the auditing issues by the Fiji Institute of Accountants or other relevant standards considered 
<br/>appropriate.  Moreover, Section 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji states that at least 
<br/>once in every year, the Auditor-General shall inspect, audit and report to Parliament on: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The public accounts of the State; 
<br/>The control of public money and public property of the State; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>All transactions with or concerning the public money or public property of the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Supreme  Audit  Institution  (SAI)  plays  a  critical  role  in  strengthening 
<br/>governance, accountability and transparency in government.  As such the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>(OAG)  is  expected  to  promote  transparency  and  accountability  through  good  governance  of  its  own 
<br/>affairs in an ethical manner and within the ambit of law in order to fulfil its mandate.  To assist in this 
<br/>crucial role, it is important that the OAG leads by example and be a model organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  UN  resolution  acknowledges  the  role  of  Supreme  Audit  Institution  in 
<br/>fostering  government  accountability  for  the  use  of  resources  and  their  performance  in  achieving 
<br/>Sustainable  Development    Goal  16  –  To  promote  peaceful  and  inclusive  societies  for  sustainable 
<br/></span><span>development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions 
<br/></span><span>at all levels.  The OAG plays a critical role in ensuring efficient and transparent use of resources and the 
<br/>achievement of SDG target 16.6 which is to develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at 
<br/>all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, the Committee notes that whatever questions raised by the Auditors in terms of the 
<br/>utilisation and management of Government expenses, it is related to the achievement of SDG target 16.6.  
<br/>Through the execution of its mandate, the OAG promotes efficient, accountable, effective and transparent 
<br/>public administration and governance in achieving nationally and internationally agreed development 
<br/>plans.  The SAI can also be considered as an oversight mechanism under the review and monitoring 
<br/>frameworks as evident in its inclusion in the National Development Plan (NDP) 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For information, the OAG now prepares its annual financial statements using the International 
<br/>Financial Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-sized Entities known as  IFRS, as the financial 
<br/>reporting  framework.    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  OAG  is  funded  through  an  annual  one  line 
<br/>appropriation by Parliament.  This enables the OAG to fulfil its audit mandate on public sector entities 
<br/>and  these  includes  financial  audits,  performance  audits  and  special  investigations.    In  the  year  2021 
<br/>financial year the budget appropriation stood at $5,048,231 compared to $5,606,269 in 2020, and it was 
<br/></span><span>noted that only 93 percent of their budget was utilised due to COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee after carrying out a thorough review on the OAG’s 2021 Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report, the Committee in a bipartisan approach agreed on the following recommendations; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG  partners  with  the  line  Ministries  Head  (Permanent  Secretaries),  Provincial 
<br/>Council  and  Municipal  Councils  to  train  their  staff  to  prepare  and  submit  quality  draft 
<br/>annual financial statements for audit in a timely manner as by the OAG. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That a proper training plan be developed to be in line with the audit training needs of the 
<br/>staff so that they are able to better improve their performances and productivity; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG to conduct a comprehensive exit meeting to allow ministries and departments to 
<br/>rectify pertinent issues before tabling of audit report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the

<div><span>Committee  who  were  part  of  the  successful  compilation  of  this  bipartisan  report  namely  honourable

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Air, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a future 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Office of the Auditor-General of the Republic of Fiji Compliance Audit Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, this Report provides the Committee Review findings on 
<br/>the Report of the Office of the Auditor-General of the Republic of Fiji on Compliance Audits that were 
<br/>carried out on the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Management of Unemployment Benefit; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Management  of  Concessional  Loan  Package  to  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(MSMEs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  undertook  a  compliance  audit  on  the  Management  of 
<br/>Unemployment Benefit COVID-19 facilitated by the Ministry of Economy and administered by the 
<br/>Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) in 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit’s primary  objective was to  obtain  sufficient and appropriate  evidence to  form a 
<br/></span><span>conclusion on whether the Ministry of Economy and Fiji National Provident Fund had paid COVID-
<br/>19 unemployment benefits for workers in the tourism sector and the informal and formal sectors, is 
<br/>in accordance with the required criteria.  Whilst the compliance audit objective on the management 
<br/>of MSMEs concessional loan package was to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence to form 
<br/>a conclusion on whether (in all material aspects) the processes and internal controls are adequate and 
<br/>effective to ensure that only eligible MSME businesses benefited from the initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, under the Management of Unemployment Benefits Scheme, the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy is responsible for managing public finances in accordance with the Constitution and the 
<br/>Finance Management Act (FMA) 2004.  Government made a commitment through the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy  to  provide  financial  assistance  of  $150  per  redundant  worker  business  owners  in  the 
<br/>informal sector. Assistance was provided to those Fijians who had been affected due to the lockdown 
<br/>in Lautoka, Suva and Nasinu that were eligible for the financial assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the COVID-19 response plan for redundant workers, the Government of Fiji budgeted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>2266 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> Sept., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a total of $210 million for redundancy and unemployment benefits of which $60 million is subsidised 
<br/>by Government and $150 million is provided through FNPF. As at 31st August 2020, a total of $35.6 
<br/>million has been paid under this COVID-19 response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  together  with  the FNPF also  implemented relief packages  to assist  the FNPF 
<br/>members and employers in two phases as Fiji faced the economic impacts of the novel coronavirus 
<br/>(COVID-19). This saw the facilitation of the formal sector unemployment benefit pay-out. The Phase 
<br/>1 Government subsidy financial assistance commenced on 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2020 and closed on 29</span><span>th</span><span> May, 
<br/>2020 while Phase 2 was effective from 29</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2020 until 9</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2020 respectively, being paid 
<br/>out in three different categories.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As at 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2020, Government subsidy that has been paid out totalled up to $80,576,019 
<br/>to 73,721 eligible applicants.  Recovery of over payment and implementation of recommendation can 
<br/>assist  in ensuring  the  integrity  of the  Government’s  financial assistance data in the  financial  and the 
<br/>member information management system used by FNPF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition the Ministry of Economy, through lessons learnt during pandemic, can develop and 
<br/>design detailed SOPs for similar programmes undertaken by the Government so that staff are able to carry 
<br/></span><span>out  tasks  correctly  and  consistently  to  reduce  variation  within  a  given  process.    Properly  designed 
<br/></span><span>operating procedures will assist in enhancing accountability and transparency on the use of public funds.  
<br/>Processes  and  procedures for any  detection of payment made in error or over-payment,  can  assist in 
<br/>significant  saving  in  time,  effort  and  costs,  instead  of  determining  and  effecting  recoveries  after  a 
<br/>significant time lapse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of the above audit finding, the Committee noted that majority of the issues identified 
<br/>herewith have been taken into consideration with necessary implementation undertaken by the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  with  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank  under  the  Fiji  Social 
<br/>Protection project has adopted a Cash Transfer Operations Manual for the unemployment 
<br/>cash  assistance  program.    The  manual  defines  the  guiding  principles  and  specifies  the 
<br/>detailed arrangements and procedures with regards to eligibility criteria and procedures for 
<br/></span><span>the verification of beneficiaries and the amounts of cash transfers and so forth; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>A separate Cash Assistance Operations Manual (CAOM) developed with implementing 
<br/>partners and with the assistance of the World Bank will be adopted soon.  The CAOM was 
<br/>developed for the $360 payments and aims to :

<div><span>Under the Management of Concessional Loan Packages to Micro Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>(MSMEs), the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted all businesses including Micro, Small

<div><span>declined due to weak demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the tourism industry coming to a halt and its adverse flow-on effects to almost all sectors of 
<br/>the  economy,  several  businesses  are  struggling  and  unemployment  has  been  on  the  rise.    The 
<br/>Concessional Loan Package is provided to eligible MSME businesses with a five year repayment term 
<br/>including  two  year  grace  period  with  no  principal  or  interest  payment.    The  loan  repayment  will 
<br/>commence  from  the  second  year  with  the  flexibility  of  a  single  annual  repayment  or  even  with  the 
<br/>payments spread over the year.  Interest calculation will be based on a simple interest method. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  the  audit  and  evidence  gathered,  the  MSME  Concessional  Loan 
<br/>Package  programme  was  implemented  with  its  intended  intent  however,  there  were  instances  where 
<br/>control measures were not effective to mitigate the risks associated with the programme.  In addition, 
<br/>absence of comprehensive assistance risk assessments to identify potential risks and how these could 
<br/>have been mitigated, reflects that more awareness needs to be done on risks in planning for the delivery 
<br/>of such programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to state that the two programmes were rolled out 
<br/>during the severe health crisis whereby Fiji, with every nation on earth, was at war with coronavirus 
<br/></span><span>thereby resources and communications were limited.  That being said, the Ministry of Economy and 
<br/></span><span>FNPF are taking necessary measures to address those issues and put in place mechanisms for future use 
<br/>on such programmes, through lessons learnt from and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a positive note Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of the programme is largely attributed to the 
<br/>Public-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  with  participation  of  the  Women  in  Business,  Fiji  Chamber  of 
<br/>Commerce,  Fiji  Commerce  and  Employers  Federation  and  Fiji  Institute  of  Accountants.    The 
<br/>commitment of the assessors to voluntary assess applications resulted in the survival of at least 6,000 
<br/>Fijian owned MSMEs.  It is also encouraging to note that through this programme, the private sector 
<br/>partners have formalised their partnership through the legal entity - Business Assistance Fiji - who have 
<br/>furthered their network with organisations such as Business Link Pacific and Fiji Development Bank to 
<br/>support MSMEs and the informal sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, I thank the executives from the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Commerce, Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport for their responses to the audit issues that were raised and staff from the Office of 
<br/>the  Auditor-General  for  providing  technical  clarifications  on  those  issues.    Most  importantly,  we 
<br/>acknowledge the two ministries efforts in addressing the gaps that were identified during the audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Committee who were part 
<br/></span><span>of  the  successful  compilation  of  this  bipartisan  report  namely  honourable  Joseph  Nand  (Deputy 
<br/>Chairperson), honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa, honourable Virendra Lal and honourable Aseri Radrodro.  
<br/>On behalf of the Committee, I also extend my appreciation to the Secretariat staff for their timely support 
<br/>in compilation and preparation of this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I commend this Report to Parliament.
