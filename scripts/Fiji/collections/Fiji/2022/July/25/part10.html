<div><span>Vacant Seat - Hon. Ratu S. Matanitobua 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as alluded to on Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, I will now address the House on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the issue of the vacant seat of the honourable Ratu Suliano Matanitobua.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 63(1)(d) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji expressly provides that “the seat of a 
<br/>Member of Parliament becomes  vacant  if the member  ceases  to have the right to be nominated  as  a 
<br/>candidate for election to Parliament under Section 56” of the Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Section 56(2) of the Constitution lists the criteria for who may be a candidate for an 
<br/>election to Parliament and inter alia provides under paragraph (g) that a person may be a candidate only 
<br/>if  the  person  has  not,  at  any  time  during  the  eight  years  immediately  before  being  nominated,  been 
<br/>convicted of any offence under any law for which the maximum penalty is a term of imprisonment of 12 
<br/>months or more.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, since honourable Matanitobua has been convicted with one count of tendering false 
<br/></span><span>information to a public servant under section 201(a) of the Crimes Act 2009, and one count of obtaining 
<br/>financial advantage under section 326(1) of the Crimes Act 2009, honourable Matanitobua is, therefore, 
<br/>disqualified from being a candidate in the 2022 election of Members of Parliament.  This is particularly 
<br/>so, given that the maximum penalty for the offences that he was convicted of, is a term of imprisonment 
<br/>of five years and 10 years respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, take note that I had also written to the honourable Matanitobua on Wednesday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2022, to inform him that his seat in Parliament has become vacant pursuant to Section 63(1)(d) of the 
<br/>Constitution which, in this instance, became vacant on the date of his conviction being Wednesday, 6th 
<br/>July, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, the honourable Matanitobua’s seat in Parliament has become vacant pursuant to Section 
<br/>63(1)(d) of the Constitution which, in this instance, became vacant on the date of his conviction being 
<br/>6th July, 2022.  A written notification of this was provided to honourable Matanitobua on Friday, 15th 
<br/>July, 2022, and the same was conveyed to the honourable Leader of the Opposition on the same day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, pursuant to section 20(1) of the Electoral Act 2014, the Chairperson of the 
<br/></span><span>Electoral Commission has been notified accordingly.  I had also notified the Chairperson of the Electoral 
<br/></span><span>Commission that pursuant to Section 64(3) of the Constitution and given that honourable Matanitobua’s 
<br/>seat  has  become  vacant  more  than  three  years  and  six  months  after  the  first  meeting  of  Parliament, 
<br/>following the most recent general election, the honourable Matanitobua’s seat so vacated remains vacant 
<br/>until the next general election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I thank you for your attention and we will now move on to the next item 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the Order Paper. 
<br/></span></div>
