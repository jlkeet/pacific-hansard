<div><span>DEBATE ON THE 2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  rise to deliver  our response  on the 
<br/>Budget that was presented by the honourable Minister for Economy, who is also the learned Attorney-
<br/>General, on the eve of 15</span><span>th</span><span> July in this august House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I wish to pay respects in the presence of the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Ministers of Cabinet, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Government Backbenchers, Sir, not 
<br/>forgetting  the  honourable  leader  of  the  National  Federation  Party  (NFP)  and  his  colleagues  and 
<br/></span><span>members of SODELPA in the Opposition, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there is no doubt that we are living in a period of uncertainty, an unprecedented volatility 
<br/>due to the current geo-political environment.  There are lessons to be learnt from these extraordinary 
<br/>and unexpected events which has brought out the truth that things are not as buoyant as perceived by 
<br/>the Government of the day.  Therefore, structural adjustments have to be made to ensure the long 
<br/>term survival of our nation.  We must continue to be innovative in developing better measures and 
<br/>implement relevant and practical policies to cushion and address challenges facing the nation today, 
<br/>not only as a small and vulnerable nation, but as being part an integrated global community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must continue to be proactive and look at better practical ways that are sustainable, rather 
<br/>than being reactionary and business as usual, Sir, as practised by the FijiFirst Government whereby 
<br/>the  Government  continues  with  its  unsustainable  borrowing  spree  to  finance  Government 
<br/>expenditure, particularly on operating expenditure.  Our focus should be on sustainable use of our 
<br/>resources, especially our resourced-based sectors through the effective and meaningful participation 
<br/>of resource owners.  I will be revisiting the importance of participation of resource owners in the 
<br/>development of our resource-based sectors when discussing sectoral performance, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we all agree that COVID-19 pandemic is here to stay.  Simply put, we are not out of the 
<br/></span><span>woods yet, especially with new strains identified on a regular basis, in addition to monkeypox which 
<br/>is spreading in some parts of the world due to the opening of its international borders, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Sunday, 18</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, the Ministry of Health  update stated we  now have about  784 
<br/>cases, after recording 59 new cases since Friday, 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2022.  The spread of the virus continued to 
<br/>increase, Sir, and we only had 229 active cases on Tuesday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022.  This is a testimony and 
<br/>confirmation that COVID-19 is here to stay, in addition to other global and environmental challenges 
<br/>that we will continue to face.  The unprovoked attack by Russia on Ukraine has further exacerbated 
<br/>challenges,  Sir,  of  recovery  after  two  years  of  stagnation  and  negative  growth  experienced 
<br/>worldwide, which has led to where we are today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate that more and more of our people are facing hardship and are falling below 
<br/>the  poverty  threshold.    This  is  despite  the  World  Bank’s  assessment  which  has  downplayed  the 
<br/>poverty figures in the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) Report of 2019-2020, a 
<br/>period prior to the pandemic, that our poverty rate had decreased from 30 percent to 25 percent.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I find such adjustments by the World Bank quite contradictory and dubious because it 
<br/>also  agreed  that  the  National  Poverty  Line  remains  virtually  unchanged.    Sir,  as  a  layman,  if  the 
<br/>National Poverty Line is unchanged, therefore, the poverty level remains the same.  There are many 
<br/>studies that demonstrate that any change to the consumption basket would vary poverty line and thus, 
<br/>significantly vary the poverty rate which is visibly to what the World Bank has done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  a  recent  United  Nations  publication  in  2017 has  pointed  out  that  inadequate  data  is  a 
<br/>common problem and the use of the same poverty definition by using different equivalence scales or 
<br/>using income rather than or using income rather than consumption can produce quite different results 
<br/>both within and across the country. This to some extent can also affect policy decisions which we 
<br/>clearly see in the announcement of the Revised Budget on 24</span><span>th</span><span> March this year which made bold 
<br/>statements  rather  than  taking  a  more  targeted  approach  in  some  of  the  key  policy  measures 
<br/>announced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reduction of VAT on 21 basic food items will not only benefit the poor but the rich as 
<br/>well.  At  the  same  time,  the  increase  of  VAT  on  items  such  as  footwear  and  textile,  will  make  it 
<br/>difficult for an average citizen to acquire such basic necessity. Sir, I will elaborate on this later when 
<br/>discussing sources of government revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me, Sir, the real issue here is why the World Bank is making such an adjustment to follow 
<br/>international  comparability  when  the  more  pressing  issue  is  country  specific.  Today,  we  can 
<br/>confidently say that more than 40 percent of our population are living in poverty and an additional 
<br/>20 percent are facing real hardship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, Fiji will not also be spared by the supply chain disruption and the increase in the price of 
<br/>petroleum  products.  Like  any  other  Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS),  the  impact  of  these 
<br/>extraordinary events will be much greater because our economy is narrow-based and we very much 
<br/>depend on the importation of fossil fuel. More so, a fair share of our food products are also imported, 
<br/>compared to our large neighbours with broad economic base.  The lack of vision and totally ignoring 
<br/>the reality of our vulnerability has made us more worse off than those countries that have taken a 
<br/>more cautious, pragmatic and practical approach in managing their economy.  It is time that we must 
<br/>be united and all work together for the common good rather than being divided by our own personal 
<br/>ambition, party interest and narrow political agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the General Election of 2018, the former Leader of Opposition, Major 
<br/>General (Ret’d) Sitiveni Rabuka on many occasions, has reached out and urged the Government that 
<br/></span><span>we should all work together through a bipartisan approach to map out the  best and practical way 
<br/></span><span>forward  in  addressing  socio-economic  challenges  facing  our  beloved  nation.  Basically,  the 
<br/>suggestion is based on the premise of our vulnerability status and anticipation of future shocks, such 
<br/>as the regular occurrence and high intensity of natural disasters which continue to be experienced by 
<br/>our nation due to climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sorry, Sir, that the FijiFirst Government, despite numerous calls made from this side of 
<br/>Parliament  for  genuine  dialogue  for  bipartisan  cooperation  were  totally  rejected.  On  almost  all 
<br/>occasions,  Sir,  motions,  petitions  and  better  alternatives  recommended  by  this  side  of  Parliament 
<br/>have been rejected outright or totally ignored.  The truth is and surprisingly, many suggestions and 
<br/>recommendations from this side of Parliament in the last three years were key elements in the Revised 
<br/>Budget which was announced in March this year. The impact of these policies could have worked 
<br/>better  and  more  effectively  if  they  were  implemented  earlier  rather  than  later.  They  were  more 
<br/>relevant and cost effective then.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, due to the unwillingness of the FijiFirst Government to foster partnership 
<br/>and  consensus  building,  we  are  experiencing  more  social,  political  division  and  mistrust  in  the 
<br/>country which is very unfortunate and has indeed driven our communities further apart and led to 
<br/>disunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The results of fear mongering tactics and lack of transparency, the current Government has 
<br/>created division among our different communities which has led to the overall lack of confidence 
<br/>and disunity in the country.  We must all continue to be proud and embrace the diversity within our 
<br/>multicultural and multiracial society which should be considered as our strength in moving the nation 
<br/>forward rather than as a hurdle or stumbling block.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Talk about the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Rather than embracing and promoting values and the 
<br/>richness of our diversity, the FijiFirst Government has tried to force cultural autonomy, integration 
<br/>and assimilation in our society which will never work or be realised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- How does autonomy and assimilation go together? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  Our  different  communities  are  very  proud  of  their 
<br/>unique identity and heritage in our multiracial and multicultural society.  We must all continue to 
<br/>value, embrace and recognise that our differences are our strength and we must continue to nurture 
<br/>and build on them to have a united and cohesive society, rather than one dominating the other or 
<br/>allow the philosophies in the sunset clause to determine our destiny.  I say this because the few rich 
<br/>who  are  cronies  of  the  Government  have  become  richer  while  the  majority  of  our  citizens  are 
<br/>suffering and left behind. This is very much inconsistent with the current Government policy which 
<br/>normally claims that no one should be left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as usual is indeed very well-articulated, convincing and full 
<br/>of promises which we know too well will not be realised at all. It is all about grand announcement 
<br/>rather than effective implementation.  The reality of the matter, Sir, announcement does not fully 
<br/>reflect what has been claimed or the reality on the ground. The reality on the ground is totally the 
<br/>opposite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence, the honourable Minister for Economy is trying to argue that something is not or 
<br/>basically faking the facts or twisting the truth and this is the very reason I call all previous budgets 
<br/></span><span>particularly the revised budget and this one as a smokescreen.  All the budget presentations have been 
<br/></span><span>designed to disguise the real intention by quibbling with statistics to continue misleading the people 
<br/>of Fiji that everything is rosy but the fact of the matter is that it is not so rosy.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On consultation, you will agree with me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that members of this side of the 
<br/>House represent almost 50 percent of those who voted in the last Election, despite the fact that almost 
<br/>30 percent of our registered voters did not cast their votes. The claim that this is the first time in 
<br/>history the Ministry of Economy travelled to the rural areas of Vanua Levu for budget consultation 
<br/>is absurd. The real intention of the travel to Vanua Levu is to campaign and drum up support from 
<br/>the people of the upcoming Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, genuine and regular consultation is a prerequisite to ensure that the need and interest of 
<br/>all citizens are taken on board in the formulation of laws and implementation of policies that will 
<br/>directly impact the daily lives and not just on the Budget alone.  We noted with interest the extensive 
<br/>consultation undertaken on the proposed 2022-2023 Budget by the honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1493 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>personally, Sir, rather than the Officials from the Ministry, particularly in the rural areas around the 
<br/>country.  This is unprecedented, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the motive of such extensive and exhaustive consultation is well-known because this is 
<br/>an election Budget.  On many occasions matters of critical importance such as the passing of laws 
<br/>and the development of policies that have far reaching implications and very limited consultations 
<br/>were undertaken with stakeholders prior to the approval in this august House or in the implementation 
<br/>of policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been a norm and a common practice for the Bainimarama Government to undertake 
<br/>consultation  after  laws  have  been  passed  or  policy  announcements  made.  Such  </span><span>modus  operandi</span><span>
<br/>creates uncertainty, confusion, resentment, reservation and an environment of mistrust to those who 
<br/>are directly affected, particularly the resource owners and members of the public.  This is the very 
<br/>reason as to why questions have been raised on the real motive of the extensive consultation which 
<br/>is quite unprecedented.  Is it genuine consultation or the real intention is just campaigning for the 
<br/>2022 General Election which is quite obvious?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the findings  of the Open Budget  Survey 2021 carried out  by the  International  Budget 
<br/></span><span>Organisation  is  quite  compelling  and  revealing.    It  clearly  shows  that  out  of  the  120  countries 
<br/></span><span>surveyed,  Fiji  and  Papua  New  Guinea  are  ranked  among  the  worst  countries  in  terms  of  public 
<br/>participation  in  preparation  for  their  respective  National  Budget.  Such  review  confirms  that 
<br/>consultations undertaken by the honourable Minister for Economy is just window-dressing and the 
<br/>real  intention  is  just  campaigning  for  the  Elections,  especially  in  the  misuse  of  taxpayers’  scarce 
<br/>resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  time  and  again  we  hear  the  Government  continue  to  boast  and  preach  about  the 
<br/>unprecedented growth achieved in the last 10 years or the “Bainimarama Boom” prior to the COVID-
<br/>19.  They do not tell us that but continue to deny that our economy was already in crisis in early 2017.  
<br/>Again  when  the  Revised  Budget  was  presented  in  this  august  Parliament  on  24</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy boasted that the nation is on the road to recovery and the forecast 
<br/>is  that,  I  quote:  “economy  will  grow  around  11  percent  in  2022  which  is  unprecedented  in  our 
<br/>history”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The latest economic review by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) at the end of June suggested 
<br/>that our growth forecast for the 2022-2023 has been revised upward from 11 percent to 12.4 percent.  
<br/>This is despite the fact that the global growth trend has been revised downward from 4.1 percent to 
<br/></span><span>2.9 percent for 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its World Economic Outlook Report published in 
<br/>April 2022 clearly shows that the growth rate of our major trading partners will be much lower and 
<br/>has been revised downwards as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>US Growth rate will be around 3.7 percent; 
<br/>Eurozone 2.8 percent; 
<br/>Australia 4.2 percent; 
<br/>New Zealand 2.7 percent; 
<br/>Japan 2.4 percent; and 
<br/>China 4.4 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe that the expectations and projections that our economy will grow at 12.4 percent are 
<br/></span><span>based probably on the 12.4 percent growth projections for tourist arrivals.  It is unlikely that we will 
<br/></span><span>achieve the 12.4 percent growth projections because of the challenges due to increase in the fossil

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fuel price with the correspondingly increase in the cost of travel and most importantly, the high risk 
<br/>in the spread of the omicron variant and monkeypox.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The “Bula Boom” catch-phrase is very doubtful, Sir.  The revision is based on the premise 
<br/>and I quote, “that the world economy today enters what is more likely an extended period of weak 
<br/>growth and high inflation”.  This brings to question the impartiality and independence of the RBF in 
<br/>providing sound independent assessment of the state of affairs of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On many occasions, we were told that with the current growth trend experienced prior to the 
<br/>COVID-19, we will be in the same league with Singapore and better than Australia and New Zealand.  
<br/>It is so sad that we are trying to compare ourselves with Singapore, or to be better than Australia and 
<br/>New  Zealand  when  those  countries’  average  GDP  per  capita  is  already  over  US$40,000  mark 
<br/>(Australia is over US$55,000, Singapore is over US$59,000 and New Zealand is over US$41,000) 
<br/>whilst our per capita is only around US$5,000.  Such comparison is a sick joke, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does not matter how high we leapfrog or punch beyond our weight, we 
<br/>will never be like Singapore or better than Australia and New Zealand, but there are lessons to be 
<br/>learnt from their experiences.  Our effort should be directed at improving the standard of living of 
<br/></span><span>our  people  at  our  own  pace,  taking  into  account  our  God-given  resources  and  our  own  internal 
<br/></span><span>capacity rather than trying to be like other well-developed countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It reminds me of a saying by the late Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, and I quote, “</span><span>Meda vakusakusa 
<br/>ena vakasosolo vakamalua.  Me da kakua ni  vakusakusa vakatotolo”.   </span><span>Basically, it means, let us 
<br/>make haste slowly, we should move forward cautiously but steadily rather than rushing and fail at 
<br/>the end which we are experiencing today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, rather than comparing ourselves with Singapore and to be better than Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand, let us compare ourselves with similar countries in terms of resource endowment and human 
<br/>resource capacity.  We should be comparing ourselves with countries such as Papua New Guinea, 
<br/>Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Mauritius, who are on the same development par and comparable to 
<br/>Fiji’s economy.  It is interesting to observe that these countries have provided progress further than 
<br/>Fiji as indicated in the progress made in all areas of socio-economic indicators, whilst our nation 
<br/>continue to lag or fall behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Even much smaller economies like Samoa and Tonga 
<br/>in  the  last  10  years,  have  made  some  substantial  progress  compared  to  Fiji.    The  growth  rate  in 
<br/>countries like Papua New Guinea, Mauritius, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu for the period 2009 to 
<br/>2019  were  much  better,  compared  to  Fiji  because  their  respective  Governments  were  more 
<br/>accountable and transparent in their operations.  More importantly, there was confidence in these 
<br/>economies because of good governance and consistency of policies which boosted their respective 
<br/>level of investment compared to Fiji.  The claim that there will be a 11 percent unprecedented growth 
<br/>as announced by the honourable Minister for Economy for this year which has been further revised 
<br/>upward to 12.4 percent is all wishful thinking and a straight-out lie which will not deceive the people 
<br/>of the nation again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members of the Government side should seriously consider 
<br/>taking some time and review the Bureau of Statistic’s figure in its 2020 Annual Report, especially 
<br/>on Page No. 16 which provides our real GDP growth figures using 2014 as a base year, which we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1495 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are currently using rather than accepting lies by the honourable Minister for Economy as the gospel 
<br/>truth and let us look at the real growth ratio.  In 1973, our real GDP growth was 12.7 percent, 1979 - 
<br/>12 percent, 1989 - 12.9 percent and in 1999 - 8.7 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the claim that we are going to achieve an unprecedented growth of 12.4 
<br/>percent  is  not  true  and  misleading because the  global trend has been revised downward  from  4.1 
<br/>percent to 2.9 percent, which means we have to make this necessary structural adjustments since we 
<br/>very much depend on the importation of petroleum products and a fair share of our food items are 
<br/>also important.  In addition, we have to pray for the increase in imported inflation which we are now 
<br/>currently experiencing, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  real  GDP  per  capita  in  2020  using  the  2014  base  is  only  around 
<br/>$9,917.40 which is equivalent to around US$500,000. Our per capita income, in fact, has declined 
<br/>from $12,099.50 in 2018 to $9,917.40 in 2020. This also implies that our purchasing power parity is 
<br/>also on a declining trend.  On the claim that Fiji has experienced unprecedented growth in the last 10 
<br/>years or so prior to COVID-19 is a straight-out lie and quite deceiving.  If we review our growth 
<br/>trends in a 10 year period using the same data in the Bureau of Statistics Report of 2020, it clearly 
<br/>shows, Sir, the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Between 1971 and 1980, our real growth rate was 4.85 percent; 
<br/>Between 1981 and 1990, our real growth rate was 2.46 percent; 
<br/>Between 1991 and 2000, our real growth rate was 2.44 percent; 
<br/>Between 2001 and 2010, our real growth rate was 1.36 percent and;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Whilst our growth rate between 2011 and 2020 was only around 3.18 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, where is the unprecedented growth and the Bainimarama Boom as normally claimed by 
<br/>the Bainimarama Government when our growth  performance were much better in  the  1970s, Sir.  
<br/>They were totally better off in the 1970s that had a growth rate of 4.5 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even if we take a five-year growth period, the highest growth rate experienced in the country 
<br/>was between 1971 and 1975 with a growth rate of 5.36 percent, followed by 4.08 percent for the 
<br/>period 1986 to 1990, and only 3.64 percent for the period 2011 to 2015.  In view of these compelling 
<br/>facts as clearly reflected in the figures provided by the Bureau of Statistics, I urge the honourable 
<br/>Members of the Government to take some time to confirm that the honourable Minister for Economy 
<br/>continues to distort information and mislead the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said earlier, it is more practical and realistic to compare ourselves 
<br/></span><span>with  similar countries  rather than Singapore,  Australia and New  Zealand.  Before  giving  a broad 
<br/>overview  of  the  Budget  announcement,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy  for  his  unprecedented  two-and-a-half  hour’s  marathon  in  his  Budget  Address.    It  is 
<br/>unfortunate that he spent more than 60 percent of the time in giving a lecture full of praising and 
<br/>campaigning to the people of Fiji.  The claim that the 2022-2023 Budget is about the welfare of all 
<br/>the people of Fiji is a joke.  He cannot deny the fact the truth that this is an electioneering Budget 
<br/>and it is all about buying votes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  am  sorry  that  I  have  to  deviate  from  analysing  the  Budget  figures  at  this  point  in  time, 
<br/></span><span>because I am compelled to do so due to the numerous uncalled and childish accusations throughout 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy’s  Budget  Address  whereby  he  continues  to  play  the  blame 
<br/>game when things do not go right.  He either blames previous Governments or some extraordinary 
<br/>events such as natural disasters, the pandemic or global events for Government’s failure.  The truth 
<br/></span><span>of  the  matter  is  that,  the  Government  and  in  particular  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  his 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Economy, have been in power for almost 16 years.  Therefore, they should

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>take the ‘bull by the horn’ and address issues rationally with clear vision rather than just putting the 
<br/>blame on someone else.  However, when they achieve some success, they never stop boasting and 
<br/>continue to claim that it is unprecedented.  The only unprecedented achievement of this Government 
<br/>is inconsistency and manipulation of information so that they can look good in public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so much has been said about the lack of transparency, accountability and 
<br/>corruption during budget announcements by previous Governments and especially, this side of the 
<br/>House.    We  all  understand  that  the  real  intention  of  such  convincing  presentation  is  to  make  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government look good in the public domain as we move towards the General Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  voters  of  this  country  are  not  naïve  any  more.    They  know  the  truth  on  how  this 
<br/>Government operates. There are many glaring examples that are still fresh in the public’s mind about 
<br/>the lack of transparency, accountability, corruption and cronyism in the last 15 years or so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  You  listen,  honourable  Prime  Minister  so  it  might 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remind you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- One just has to review the Auditor-General’s Reports 
<br/>in the last 10 years to confirm what I am saying.  Three cases that are still fresh in the public’s mind 
<br/>include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  $33  million  digger  scam  at  WAF,  which  is  still  under  investigation  by  FICAC 
<br/>which has taken more than three years, whilst some minor selective cases are hurriedly 
<br/>investigated for political expediency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of transparency and secrecy in the way EFL shares were sold to a Japanese 
<br/>consortium.  Questions are still lingering in the public’s mind whether proper evaluation 
<br/>of assets were carried out prior to the sale, and why was the sale personally arranged by 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Economy while on medical treatment in Singapore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Concerns  have  been  raised  by  the  public  on  the  sale  of  Fiji  Airways’  shares  to  the 
<br/>workers superannuation fund, that is, Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF).  The general 
<br/></span><span>sentiments expressed is the secrecy and the lack of clarity in the sale particularly: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the lack of risk assessment associated with the sale, taking into account the substantial 
<br/>government guarantee; 
<br/>how shares have been allotted, taking into account the shareholding position of Air 
<br/>Pacific in Fiji Airways; and  
<br/>among other technical details which were not fully disclosed to the workers of this 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to the proposed Budget for the 2022-2023 Financial Year.  It is 
<br/></span><span>anticipated that the total expenditure will be around $3.81 billion, with an estimated revenue of $2.93 
<br/>billion, which will attract a net deficit of $872.2 million which is about 7.4 percent of GDP.  If one looks 
<br/>at the proposed Budget holistically in the context of our total debt exposure, it would be around 108.4 
<br/>percent.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1497 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me repeat that, Sir.  That is the total debt exposure we have now let ourselves with.  The 
<br/>Budget estimate for the next financial year both in terms of revenue and expenditure have been artificially 
<br/>inflated.  This has been the norm since the current Minister took over the finance portfolio.  He knows 
<br/>too well that our current pace of recovery will be much lower than anticipated due to the uncertainty in 
<br/>the global trading environment.  This is a face-saving exercise - presenting a Budget that sounds good, 
<br/>look good and cover or hide all the weaknesses in the lack of transparency and accountability in managing 
<br/>our economy, particularly as we move towards the General Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said in my introductory remarks, this is just another smokescreen and an electioneering 
<br/>Budget.  It is unrealistic and is quite an over-ambitious one.  The revenue estimate of $2.94 billion is over 
<br/>optimistic and unlikely to be realised, unless there is another secret sale of Government asset or shares of 
<br/>Government owned entity to cover the shortfall, so that we can pay our debt of about $307.49 million for 
<br/>the next financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of these over-ambitious and unrealistic Budget will lead to either 
<br/>delay in implementation, deferment of key projects or the shelving of others, as we have experienced in 
<br/>the past.  The anticipated net deficit of $872.2 million and a net deficit of 7.4 percent of GDP does not 
<br/>reflect the commitment of any fiscal consolidation.  The Government continues to mislead the nation 
<br/></span><span>with its financial strategy in consolidation of Government finance but the truth is that, it continues to take 
<br/></span><span>an  expansionary  approach  which  will  continue  to  increase  our  deficit  and  further  increase  our 
<br/>unsustainable debt level.  The real intention is to portray and market the Bula Boom and by the end of the 
<br/>year, I hope it is not “</span><span>Election Kaboom or Moce Kaboom”.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the fiscal framework, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to fully understand and appreciate how realistic and 
<br/>the practicality of this Budget, one has to re-visit the Government Fiscal Framework which is now a 
<br/>requirement of the amended Financial Management Act 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  took  a  very  keen  interest  in  reviewing  the  Pre-Election  Economic  Fiscal 
<br/>Update that was released by the honourable Minister for Economy on  9</span><span>th</span><span>   May, 2022.   In the usual 
<br/>manner, the honourable Minister for Economy clearly stated and boasted that it is the “first-ever pre-
<br/>Election economic fiscal update” and, of course, this is now a requirement under the amended Financial 
<br/>Management Act 2021.  We do not really know its real intention, particularly as we move forward to the 
<br/>2022 General Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  has  been  a  norm  and  a  common  practice  for  successive  governments  to  provide  a  Fiscal 
<br/>Framework in its Supplementary Budget Document when presenting any budget.  By convention, the 
<br/></span><span>framework ought to provide a realistic status of government finance in the short and medium term rather 
<br/></span><span>than just a look-good exercise which has been the practice in the last eight years or so.  I do not see 
<br/>any reason to be boastful when it is the requirement of an amendment of the Financial Management 
<br/>Act that fiscal framework must be produced.  One wonders about the real intention of the amendment 
<br/>before the election come 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bainimarama  Government  has  been  in  power  for  more  than  15  years  but  no  such 
<br/>amendments of this nature was made earlier.  As usual, the honourable Minister for Economy will 
<br/>argue that it is all about good governance, transparency and accountability but the real intention is to 
<br/>hinder political parties making promises when campaigning for the 2022 Elections, which is around 
<br/>the corner and has been a common practice in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To fully appreciate the practicality and how realistic the government framework is, one has 
<br/>to go back at least in the last five years to have a better appreciation and to see how true the picture 
<br/>is on, whether the government has been transparent on the status of public finance in the country.  A 
<br/>fiscal framework since 2011 looks good and very convincing on paper but the reality of the matter is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>1498 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that, there are a lot of inconsistencies and as usual a fiscal framework does not truly reflect the reality 
<br/>on the ground but provide a better and clear reflection of our future prospect in the short and medium, 
<br/>and long-term as well, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  may  argue  that  the  framework  is  just  a  guide  or 
<br/>benchmark and there are variables that are unpredictable such as natural disasters, the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic and other extraordinary events.  I would like to reiterate at this point in time a point that I 
<br/>made earlier that any fiscal framework produced must be practical, it must be realistic and consider 
<br/>our high vulnerability of index rather than taking a bullish approach in the management of our public 
<br/>finance.  The result is the unsustainable debt level which the honourable Minister continues to claim 
<br/>and defend that it is sustainable.  I will be discussing our unsustainable debt level later on in my 
<br/>deliberation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, at this juncture, I would like to share my experiences as a former cabinet minister on a 
<br/>number of occasions in the preparation of annual budgets.  During my time in government, financial 
<br/>year was from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December.  I clearly recall that at the end of March or April every 
<br/>year, the then Ministry of Finance, in consultation with the key central agencies or the Ministry of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs’ Strategic Planning Office, the RBF and the Prime Minister’s  Office with its key 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders in FRCS, jointly present a fiscal framework for the following year’s budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  framework  will  be  only  approved  by  cabinet  if  it  is  confident  that  the  rigorous  due 
<br/>process of validation has been undertaken, Sir.  The key feature of the fiscal framework is that any 
<br/>additional  request  or  adjustment  has  to  be  made  within  the  approved  framework,  Sir,  rather  than 
<br/>moving the goal posts by one minister.  This is the very reason why variations and deficits does not 
<br/>deviate from the approved framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have experienced in the last seven years is the high degree of error and substantial 
<br/>variation which has led to unacceptable level in the deficit and unsustainable debt which now we are 
<br/>experiencing today, Sir.  Based on a quick review of the Government fiscal framework since 2012, I 
<br/>have come to the conclusion that the honourable Minister for Economy’s presentations are full of 
<br/>manipulation of statistics which, again, sound convincing, full of false hope and fake promises to 
<br/>make people better, but the reality on the ground  is totally the opposite.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, Sir, the following observations are very clear.  On the revenue side, since 2014, the 
<br/>gap or shortfall between budget revenue and actual revenue continues to increase substantially and 
<br/>has reached unprecedented levels.   For example, Sir, the 2014 revenue shortfall was only around 
<br/></span><span>$350  million.    In  the  2017-2018  financial  year,  the  revenue  shortfall  increased  to  $613  million  - 
<br/></span><span>almost doubled, Sir, whilst prior to COVID-19, that is, in 2018-2019, the shortfall was around $1.1 
<br/>billion.  Such degree of error or variations is just unrealistic or unacceptable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While on the expenditure side, there was an under-expenditure of $160 million in 2014.  Again, 
<br/>in the 2018-2019 financial year, there was an under-expenditure of over $1 billion, Sir, which is almost 
<br/>half the total budgeted expenditure.  In the 2019-2020 financial year, there was an under-expenditure of 
<br/>$487  million.    The  reality  here,  Sir,  is  that  the  variations  or  margin  of  errors  are  too  high  which  is 
<br/>unacceptable.  It shows poor budgeting, poor forecasting and poor implementation of the Government 
<br/>development agenda, just to paint a rosy picture when the reality on the ground is totally the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To make it worse, Sir, on many occasions, the anticipated revenue from the sale of assets were 
<br/>not realised, which increased our deficit substantially.  The Government knows too well that sales will 
<br/>not be realised, as we all know that the sale of assets is a one-off revenue stream. In the following year, 
<br/>there will be nothing else to sell.  Today, there is nothing else left to sell, Sir.  Therefore, our revenue will 
<br/>continue on  a declining trend because it has been  artificially  overstated unless we continue  with our 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1499 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>borrowing spree, which is the hallmark of this Government, or to increase our revenue through high taxes 
<br/>which is now a norm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Such trend has led to commitments made in the annual budget, either not implemented at all, 
<br/>incomplete or deferred for later years.  There are many cases highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report 
<br/>which clearly state that major capital projects were either incomplete because of cost overrun, deferred 
<br/>or not implemented at all.  Some of the glaring examples are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Incomplete construction of a $2.5 million swimming pool in Lautoka with a cost overrun 
<br/>of $12.6 million.  I believe, Sir, this is still under investigation by FICAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Anomalies in the major capital works carried out by the Municipal Councils, for example, 
<br/>the Reclamation of the Sigatoka River Bank Project and the incomplete Savusavu Market 
<br/>for more than five years now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited progress in the upgrading and renovation of the CWM Hospital since 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of a new Nausori Hospital which has not commenced since 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ba Hospital which commenced construction in 2013 was not opened in the last year or so, 
<br/>some seven years after it was initially constructed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commitment in the 2015 Budget for the construction of the Vunidawa Sporting Complex 
<br/>which has not commenced yet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of a swimming pool and a sporting complex for Nasinu which was promised 
<br/>in 2019 and is still hanging in the air, among many other glaring examples of false promises 
<br/>which will be highlighted by my honourable colleagues on this side of the House in their 
<br/>respective portfolios.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Although funds have been allocated annually in the last three years for the construction of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a new Prime Minister’s Office, no progress has been made so far.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The unacceptable high level of variation in figures has totally distorted Government revenue and 
<br/>Government  expenditure  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.    Therefore,  Sir,  I  can  confidently  say  that  the 
<br/>Government framework is not worth the paper it is written on because it is not forward-looking and does 
<br/></span><span>not reflect reality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government always argues that adjustments have to be made during the year because of 
<br/>unforeseen events  such as cyclones and drought,  amongst others.  The sad  reality  is  that, not  enough 
<br/>resources are placed under Head 50 to address short term shocks and not to disrupt implementation of 
<br/>existing projects.  Again, it is a sign of overambitious forecasting, bullish and poor budgeting with no 
<br/>consideration of our capacity to effectively implement projects, and our vulnerable position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the very reason, Sir, that there is a lack of confidence by the private sector and both, local 
<br/>and foreign investors, in our country.  The investment trend in the last 15 years or so, is a clear evidence 
<br/>that there is no confidence or appetite for investment in the country, particularly from the private sector. 
<br/>This is despite the claim by the FijiFirst Government that investment has continuously been buoyant and 
<br/>continues to increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prior to COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, the total investment in the country was only 15.8 percent 
<br/>of GDP compared to 22.1 percent in 2002 and 21 percent in 2011. The current level of investment is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>much lower than the required level of 25 percent investment as a percentage of GDP, that is the standard 
<br/>norm,  Sir,  because  that  is    necessary  to  generate  employment  opportunities  to  support  sustainable 
<br/>economic growth.  Despite the non-availability of aggregate investment data since 2020, I am certain that 
<br/>investment as a percentage of GDP is well below the 10 percent mark.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investors are reluctant to borrow despite the high level of liquidity and high foreign reserve and 
<br/>low interest rate.  The declining trend of investment since 2013 clearly shows the lack of appetite or lack 
<br/>of confidence due to our poor human rights record and breakdown of law and order, inconsistency of 
<br/>policies and lack of</span><span> </span><span>transparency and accountability in the way this Government is running the country.  
<br/>There is no doubt, Sir, and we all agree that well-targeted meaningful investment for capital projects will 
<br/>generate income that will give people purchasing power to spend money and generate demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the medium term, this will, in turn, increase the supply chain rather than driving the economy 
<br/>through consumption spending by giving handouts which is considered unsustainable in the medium term 
<br/>and long term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- It is not a handout! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  may  recall  that  when  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Economy presented the revised Budget in March in this august Parliament, he 
<br/>boasted about the beauty of the Keynesian model that has been used by the government for decades to 
<br/>create jobs and boost consumer demand.  The argument is that, government intervention to the economic 
<br/>cycle through expansionary policy to speed up economic recovery is false. The sad reality, Sir, is the lack 
<br/>of deep understanding of how the Keynesian model works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  has  been  taking  an  expansionary  approach  since  2017  which  has 
<br/>crowded  out  the  private  sector  investment  opportunities  through  a  consumption-driven  approach  by 
<br/>giving large sums of freebies or handouts, rather than productive investment.  It is important that we 
<br/>understand  all  the  variables  in  the  model  and  how  they  are  inter-dependent  to  stimulate  growth.  
<br/>Consumption on its own does not drive growth, but productive investment that is supported by confidence 
<br/>and consistency of policy will provide the impetus for growth which has been missing from the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government formula. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A 100-level Economics student knows too well of the model and the environment and extent to 
<br/>which such a model will work. The down side of relying on such models in isolation is that our economy 
<br/>is small and narrow-based among other vulnerabilities such as climate change. Taking an expansionary 
<br/></span><span>approach and focusing on consumption rather than productive investment will lead to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing our deficit which, in turn, increases our debt to an unsustainable level which we 
<br/>are  currently  experiencing  today.    I  will  discuss  the  sustainability  of  debt  later  in  my 
<br/>deliberation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Borrowing to finance consumption through handouts or freebies that are not well targeted 
<br/>will  make  the  cost  of  borrowing  unfavorable  through  high  interest  rates  and  financial 
<br/>crowding out. When the interest rate increases, this discourages investment by the private 
<br/>sector which should be considered as an engine for growth rather than Government taking 
<br/>a lead role.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Another challenge of fiscal expansion by the Government in the medium term when the 
<br/>economy is recovering is inflation. Today, we are experiencing the high cost of goods and 
<br/>services which has been exacerbated by the disruption of the global supply chain.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1501 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite clear today that the expansionary approach taken by the Government since 2014 has 
<br/>caused more hardship and poverty in the country in the medium and long term.  Again, the latest IMF 
<br/>Report has warned that the Government should consolidate government finance to ensure we have the 
<br/>fiscal space to cushion future shocks.  Sir, this is not the first time that our multilateral development 
<br/>partners such as the Asia Development Bank (ADB), World Bank (WB) and IMF have warned the 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, ADB and IMF warned that the country is facing headwinds and must consolidate 
<br/>Government finance to ensure the availability of space to cushion future crisis. Today, we just do not 
<br/>have  any  room  to  move  because  the  Government  did  not  take  heed  of  sound,  practical  and 
<br/>professional  advice.  This  advice  fell  on  deaf  ears  and  Government  continued  on  a  consumption-
<br/>driven  spending  spree.    Today,  Sir,  our  debt  is  almost  reaching  the  $10  billion  mark  which  is 
<br/>unacceptable for a small and narrow-based vulnerable country which is contrary to the claim by the 
<br/>Honourable Minister for Economy that our current debt level is sustainable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will now turn to the topical issue of unsustainable debt level which is a very big concern 
<br/>to all or most of us accept for the Bainimarama Government.  Again, the Honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy  gave  this  august  Parliament  a  convincing  lecture  to  justify  our  high  debt  level  and  the 
<br/></span><span>benefits accrued to the nation, of concessional loans. The sad reality is that he did not tell us or the 
<br/></span><span>people of Fiji how unsustainable debt level will directly affect ordinary citizens and its associated 
<br/>risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me as an individual who also borrowed for investment, I fully understand risks associated 
<br/>with borrowing. The difference between personal and Government borrowing is the volume and the 
<br/>capacity to mobilise fund through taxation. For the Government it is simply borrowing on behalf of 
<br/>the  people  of  Fiji.    The  point  that  I  would  like  to  make  is  that  it  does  not  matter  whether  it  is 
<br/>concessional or interest free loan, debt has to be repaid, Honourable Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not all of it.  You do not understand basic economics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Multilateral agencies, such as the World Bank, ADB 
<br/>and the IMF have warned the Government of our unsustainable debt and the lack of fiscal space for 
<br/>future shocks.  Today, our average debt per capita has increased from $2,500 in early 2000 to over 
<br/>$10,000  today  and  there  is  a  high  risk  of  defaulting  as  debt  servicing  obligation  increases.    The 
<br/></span><span>downside risk of high unsustainable debt include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span>As national debt per capita increases, there is a strong possibility of default.  Therefore, 
<br/>the Ministry of Economy will have to raise the yield of newly issued treasury securities 
<br/>to attract new investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase in debt reduces the amount of tax revenue available to be spent on Government 
<br/>services because the first call on Government revenue is payment of its principals and 
<br/>interest.  This means the lower standard of living we are experiencing today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the rate of treasury securities increase, investors will increase their purchase of 
<br/>these new securities.  Therefore, they have to raise the price of their goods and services 
<br/>to meet the increase in the cost of their debt service obligation.  Over time, this will 
<br/>cause people to pay more for goods and services resulting in inflation.

<div><span>Increase yield in treasury security will increase the cost of borrowing to individuals to 
<br/>purchase homes. This exacerbated further due to short term contracts for civil servants 
<br/>which made it difficult for them to purchase a home which is a basic need.

<div><span>Risk investment such as corporate debt and equity investment will lose its appeal.

<div><span>The crowding out effect tends to encourage the growth in the size of Government and

<br/>any reform agenda in the right sizing of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  high  risk  of  default  as  debt  obligations  increase,  the  country  loses  its  social, 
<br/>economic  and  political  power  which  will  become  a  national  security  issue,  as 
<br/>experienced now in Sri Lanka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2005, our total debt stock stood at $2.4 billion accumulated since independence - that is 
<br/>well over a 30 year period.  Today, within 17 years down the line our current debt is almost reaching 
<br/>the $10 billion mark which has increased more than fourfold.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of us believe that the current debt level is unsustainable in the medium and the long 
<br/>term.    If the Government  does not  consolidate our public finance in  the short term,  our debt  will 
<br/>surely  continue  to  increase.    Our  total  debt  stock  consists  of  68  percent  of  domestic  debt  and  32 
<br/>percent of  external  debt  as at  30</span><span>th</span><span>  May, excluding  an additional US$100  million  provided by the 
<br/>World Bank to support Social Protection and COVID-19 Response and System Development Project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to revisit the response made by the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Economy  to  honourable  Adimaitoga’s  question  (Question  No.128/2022)  in  the  last 
<br/>Parliament session asking him to inform Parliament on “Why Fiji’s debt remains unsustainable and 
<br/>cannot  be  compared  to  the  Sri  Lanka  Crisis”.    Sir,  such  a  self-serving  question  prepared  by  the 
<br/>Government to cushion concerns raised by the public of our unsustainable debt level will not take 
<br/>away  this  fact.    I  would  like  to  reiterate  and  echo  the  recommendations  by  the  IMF  that  the 
<br/>Government needs to consolidate its Government finance and provide fiscal space for future shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Economy was quite witty in his response and continued to paint 
<br/>a picture or argue as usual that everything was hunky-dory - that our debt is sustainable, while the 
<br/>situation  in  Sri  Lanka  is  worse.    Before  responding  to  the  question  raised  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Adimaitoga,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  first  ridiculed  people  like  the  honourable 
<br/>Professor  Prasad,  who  is  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  National  Federation  Party  in  Parliament, 
<br/>Professor Wadan Narsey and the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> for raising issues regarding our unsustainable debt level.  
<br/>He should have taken such comments from experts constructively and positively and look at ways in 
<br/>reducing our debt rather than ridiculing and criticising them for raising their genuine concerns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  common knowledge that  Sri  Lanka does not  have adequate foreign 
<br/>reserves.  While he continues to boast that Fiji has over 10 times more revenue available to service 
<br/>its  debt,  he  also  claimed  that  lenders  have  stopped  lending  to  Sri  Lanka,  while  our  lenders  have 
<br/>recently been lending five times more than they were lending before.  The truth of the matter is that, 
<br/>previous  Governments  took  a  more  cautious  and  responsible  approach  in  borrowing  and  only 
<br/>borrowed  for  capital  formation  rather  than  consumption,  which  has  become  a  norm  for  this 
<br/>Government because there is always a shortfall in revenue collection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we should look at the issue in its proper context and perspective.  There is 
<br/>no doubt that our foreign reserve is quite high and currently hovering around $3.6 billion which is 
<br/>equivalent to 8.4 months of retained imports of goods and services.  The truth is that our foreign 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1503 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reserve includes grants, budget support and loan funds.  There is nothing to be excited about the high 
<br/>level of foreign reserves because our reserve was not earned through the sale of goods and services 
<br/>abroad, but has been artificially increased by budget support, loans and grants.  What happens when 
<br/>all the grants, budget supports and loans are fully exhausted? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As usual, the Government will continue its borrowing spree without due consideration for the 
<br/>long term consequences.  The long term  consequences that will be putting pressure on our future 
<br/>generation to pay our debt and disadvantage them from borrowing for future inspiration.  To claim 
<br/>that  the  lenders  have  stopped  lending  to  Sri  Lanka  is  a  straight-out  lie  and  manipulation  of  facts 
<br/>without any due respect to a Sovereign Nation in crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact of the matter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the latest information available is that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>

<div><span>3.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Bank is lending US$600 million to Sri Lanka;  
<br/>India has  committed US$1.9  billion and will lend another US$1.5  billion to  support 
<br/>import when the need arises; 
<br/>The G7 countries  (Canada, France,  Germany,  Italy, UK and US) have committed to 
<br/>provide help to Sri Lanka;   
<br/></span><span>Sri Lanka is working with China for the reconstruction of its loan portfolio; and 
<br/></span><span>The IMF also stands ready to bail the country under certain conditions as normally done 
<br/>for countries that are facing debt crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sri Lanka is not the first country to face debt crisis.  A number of countries in Europe, such 
<br/>as Greece, Italy, even Pakistan and Laos among others, face similar challenges in the past.  To claim 
<br/>that no lenders is willing to lend to Sri Lanka is an outright lie and mischievous. The claim that Fiji 
<br/>has 10 times more revenue available to service its debt and our current revenue is over $3 billion is 
<br/>deceiving the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, if we have 10 times more revenue available then why are we still borrowing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- If we have sufficient revenue, we can finance all public 
<br/>expenditure  and  have  a  surplus  budget,  but  our  deficit  continues  to  increase  exponentially.  The 
<br/></span><span>argument  that  we  borrow  just  because  it  is  concessional  (that  is  what  the  honourable  Minister  is 
<br/></span><span>saying) is ridiculous, to say the least, with no consideration of its consequences in the medium and 
<br/>long term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, on 9th May, 2020, the World Bank just provided us with an additional loan of US$48.9 
<br/>million for our social-protection on COVID-19 Response and System Development project. This is 
<br/>to complement our earlier loan of US$50 million for the same purpose.  I believe the complementary 
<br/>funding is to support handouts given to the people of Vanua Levu. The timing of the payment of 
<br/>freebies is questionable since we are on the eve of elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Sir, the claim that current revenue is now over $3 billion and that our revenue during 
<br/>COVID-19 was high, is straight out misleading, deceiving and dishonest. Based on the data in Fiscal 
<br/>Framework, the actual revenue collected in the 2021 Financial Year was only $2.1 billion and it is 
<br/>anticipated that revenue to be realised in the 2021-2022 Budget is around $2.3 billion. This is short 
<br/>from the $3 billion claimed by the honourable Minister for Economy, whilst actual revenue collected 
<br/>was only around $1.6 billion.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, Sri Lanka is in the same league as Fiji and they also have access to concessional loans. 
<br/>His claim that we only borrow for capital expenditure is not true at all. Today, we have received over 
<br/>US$100 million of unemployment support which has been given out as handouts or freebies rather 
<br/>than for any capital formation which I will deliberate on later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a layman, not an economist, my understanding is that, government debt is the people's 
<br/>debt. The simplest way to compare our debt is that with Sri Lanka is to look at the ratio of debt on 
<br/>per capita basis.  Sri Lanka has a population of around 22 million and their debt is around $50 billion. 
<br/>Whilst, Fiji has a population of around 900,000 and our debt is hovering around $9 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- One is Fijian dollar and one is US dollar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- On per capita basis, each citizen of Sri Lanka owes 
<br/>$4,500, whilst every Fijian citizen owes at least $10,000. With this simple illustration, we can clearly 
<br/>see  that  on  per  capita  basis,  we  are  more  debt-ridden  and  worse  off  than  Sri  Lanka.    Sir,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister should stop hoodwinking, misleading and deceiving the people of Fiji because 
<br/></span><span>they  know  the  truth.  At  the  same  time,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  should  show  some 
<br/></span><span>respect to our friendly nations and respect their sovereign right of self-determination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  on  the  US$100  million  for  employment  support,  during  the  crisis  it  is 
<br/>commendable but we are not against it because the intention is noble, particularly during the crisis. 
<br/>However, there are better programmes and effective means in helping our people in the short-term 
<br/>through better targeting in the use of this US$100 million.  It reminds me of the old proverb which 
<br/>says, “It is better to teach a man to fish rather than giving him fish”.   Basically, the moral of the 
<br/>proverb is that if you should give a man a fish, he will only survive for a day but if you teach the man 
<br/>to fish, you will feed him for a lifetime.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is creating an environment where people are forced to be dependent rather 
<br/>than being innovative.  On a number of occasions, I suggested to the Government that they should 
<br/>consider  Cash  for  Work  Programme  to  those  who  really  need  our  support.    The  Cash  for  Work 
<br/>Initiative  in  the  public  sector  has  worked  well  in  many  developing  and  least-developed  countries 
<br/>during the crisis and is considered the most effective and sustainable approach in a crisis situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The biggest challenge for the Bainimarama Government is that they remove the Public Sector 
<br/></span><span>Investment  Programmes  (PSIP),  a  three-year  rolling  programme  which  contains  well-developed 
<br/></span><span>projects that are ready to be implemented immediately when funds are available.  Projects in the PSIP 
<br/>have gone through very vigorous consultation process and vetting which is consistent with priorities 
<br/>of the Government, drawn from its medium term plan.  In the absence of a PSIP, this Government 
<br/>continues to take an </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> approach in the identification and implementation of capital projects, 
<br/>which has led to the delay in implementation, cost overrun and increasing cost.  I have elaborated on 
<br/>some of these projects earlier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A better option is to target those who need assistance through food stamps when the need 
<br/>arises.  I believe we have the machinery in place to implement such programmes effectively.  The 
<br/>current direct cash grant assistance through M-PAiSA and My Cash has failed miserably because it 
<br/>is not well targeted and is a waste of limited resources.  A fair share of those who receive this money 
<br/>spent them on alcohol and purchase of mobile phones and other items. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are reliably informed that during pay-out periods, there were liquor outlets that ran out of 
<br/>stock and taxi drivers were having a windfall from our youth who have spent the money on alcohol.

<div><span>This US$100million employment support would have gone a long way if it was better targeted for 
<br/>those who really need them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy, as usual in all his Budget Addresses, 
<br/>always emphasise and continue to be boastful on the Government’s success in the implementation of 
<br/>its reform agenda. In announcing the Revised Budget on 24th March, 2022, he boasted and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Several  big  picture  reforms  will  create  more  vitality  in  healthcare,  urban 
<br/>development, housing, land leasing, human development, transportation and agriculture.  
<br/>They will do that by loosening or removing structures that have become too bogged down 
<br/>with bureaucracy, that favoured a privileged few or that no longer serve a purpose”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister should be ashamed of making such a grand statement in the success 
<br/>of  Government  reform  agenda  which  generally  has  failed  miserably  and  had  cost  the  taxpayers 
<br/>millions and millions of dollars.  In addition, the Government reform agenda has brought about more 
<br/>favouritism and favoured privilege few which is totally contradictory to his claim.  The people of this 
<br/>country know too well and there are strong evidence that suggests that the Government has failed 
<br/>miserably in its reform agenda and there is a trend of consistency in favouritism and nepotism to the 
<br/></span><span>selected few in the implementation of major public sector reforms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are too many announcements without any action.  Reforms are not 
<br/>well  thought  out  before  announcements  are  made.  It  is  unfortunate  that  most  of  the  initiatives 
<br/>implemented are on ad hoc basis, which has become costly and failed on many occasions.  The key 
<br/>to  success  in  the  implementation  of  any  reform  agenda  is  harmonisation  and  the  sequencing  of 
<br/>activities taking into account the existing capacity.  People who are directly involved in the reform 
<br/>must be consulted first so that they can take ownership of the reform and it must not be forced upon 
<br/>them.  This is the very reason why most of the Government reform agenda have failed miserably 
<br/>because stakeholders were not consulted and they do not take ownership of the reform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the health sector, the IFC, a member of the World Bank Group in its Country Private Sector 
<br/>Diagnostic Report titled, “Creating Market in Fiji” clearly stated that Fiji’s healthcare system has 
<br/>challenges in its entire value chain from inadequate infrastructure for early screening and diagnosis 
<br/>of diseases to the availability of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals and disposal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening  Fiji’s  healthcare  system  will  address  the  growing  burden  of  Non-
<br/>Communicable Disease (NCDs).  Around 95 percent of deaths in 2019 were due to NCDs.  They 
<br/></span><span>estimated  that  by  2040,  the  rising  number  of  premature  deaths  caused  by  NCDs  will  cost  Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>economy  roughly  10.9  percent  of  its  current  GDP,  which  is  estimated  to  be  around  $10  billion 
<br/>annually.  This is very much contrary to the claim that Government is modernising and continues to 
<br/>improve our health system.  The initiative to improve private-operated GPs in rural areas will not 
<br/>work because it is not viable for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to urban development, little progress or headway has been made because the 
<br/>Government wants to continue to control municipalities. Garbage is not collected, streets are in poor 
<br/>conditions, the lack of affordable housing in our urban centres around the country and regular street 
<br/>fights, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by our youths are regular occurrence, especially in our major suburban areas.  
<br/>The  biggest  challenge  is  that  the  municipalities  are  still  centrally  controlled,  very  much  heavily 
<br/>centrally controlled.  Election should be allowed so that the ratepayers can organise themselves better 
<br/>and decide the best way forward in their respective municipalities rather than have control which 
<br/>defeats the whole purpose of any reform agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the public service, OMRS has failed because it is a disincentive to our locals who could

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>easily take up positions rather than bringing in expatriates.  They do not last long because of political 
<br/>interference from the Government.  Today, at least 13 positions of Permanent Secretaries are vacant, 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  How can an organisation run without a leader? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  agriculture,  the  reform  in  the  sugar  subsector  has  failed  miserably  despite  substantial 
<br/>injection of public funds and subsidy.  Production continues to decline, more and more farmers are 
<br/>leaving, the mills continue to be inefficient and Tonnes of Cane to Tonnes of Sugar (TCTS) has not 
<br/>improved at all.  I will be elaborating on the failure of Government reform agenda when discussing 
<br/>each specific sector, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be interesting if the honourable Minister for Economy can inform this august House 
<br/>the actual cost of public fund paid out in the implementation of its reform agenda in the transportation 
<br/>sector, particularly in the establishment of FRA and the reason why they were terminated halfway 
<br/>through the reform programme. Despite the substantial amount of funds allocated annually to FRA 
<br/>for the upgrading of our road network and infrastructure, very little improvement is visible.  There is 
<br/>little improvement in the conditions of our road, particularly in the major urban centres and access 
<br/>roads in our rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  honourable  Minister  presented  the  Revised  Budget  on  24</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  he  sounded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>optimistic and very positive by saying and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We are proud to report that recovery is underway, all preliminary data and partial 
<br/>indicators show that the  economy is  on track to  record the highest  growth rate in  Fiji’s 
<br/>history.  Sir, VAT collection, import of consumption goods, sales of both new and second 
<br/>hand vehicles, retail sales and consumption spending and business  activities are roaring 
<br/>back to life and have recorded strong growth in the last three years.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As usual, the honourable Minister for Economy continues to misguide the people of Fiji by 
<br/>painting a picture of false hope which is quite deceiving.  The people of Fiji know too well that this 
<br/>is  not  the  case  and  recovery  will  take  some  time  to  kick  in  because  there  are  serious  structural 
<br/>challenges facing the nation and there are still people looking for jobs and ordinary citizens of the 
<br/>country are facing difficulties in putting food on the table or at least making it possible to provide 
<br/>two decent meals a day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that,  our  macro  indicators  suggest  mixed  signals.  Although 
<br/>consumption has marginally increased, it does not truly reflect the challenges faced by more than 60 
<br/></span><span>percent of our population who are struggling to make ends meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economic review at the end of June suggests otherwise.  It clearly shows that the global 
<br/>growth is expected to be lower than anticipated, which will surely trickle down to Fiji and its impact 
<br/>will  be  much  greater.  This  is,  indeed,  totally  contradictory  to  what  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy has boasted about that because of the spread of the omicron variant in our source market, 
<br/>the arrival from Australia is down by -33.3 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key indicators that drive the domestic front clearly show that the recovery will be very slow.  
<br/>Electricity production fell by -4.2 percent in February, showing the decreasing demand. Although 
<br/>aggregate demand has slightly improved, it is still far below the pre-pandemic level.  The sad reality 
<br/>is that, the increase in consumption is driven by high inward personal remittance which increased by 
<br/>almost 4 percent and consumption-related loans which increased by 121.3 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, we can confidently say that the economy is still driven by consumption rather than 
<br/>productive  investment.    More  attention  should  be  directed  at  productive  investment  to  provide

<div><span>employment  opportunities  so  that  ordinary  citizens  can  earn  a  sustainable  level  of  income  in  the 
<br/>medium term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  over-optimistic  outlook  and  manipulation  of  information  given  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy, knowingly that it is not.  This will give the wrong signal to investors and 
<br/>consumers alike since they do not have the confidence and that they do not trust the Government due 
<br/>to the manipulation of data and misleading information.  Investors do not have the confidence and 
<br/>faith in the Government and continue to take a very cautious approach, especially a ‘wait and see’ 
<br/>approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The artificially high foreign reserves and high liquidity clearly shows that investors do not 
<br/>have the appetite for investing in the country. The high level of keen interest shown by registered 
<br/>investors as claimed by the Government, has not translated to real investment on the ground.  As I 
<br/>have said earlier, investors are playing a wait and see game because of the volatility in the global 
<br/>trading  environment,  inconsistency  of  policy  on  the  domestic  front,  poor  human  rights  record, 
<br/>breakdown of law and order and lack of transparency and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now revisit the performance of key sectors of the economy and the anticipated impact 
<br/></span><span>of the proposed Budget to them.  First, our resource-based sector, in particular, is agriculture. In my 
<br/></span><span>introductory remarks, I made it very clear that we are living in difficult times.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an environment of uncertainty and unpredictability due to the war in Ukraine, which 
<br/>has  disrupted  the  supply  chain  in  the  supply  of  grains  around  the  world,  accompanied  by  the 
<br/>unprecedented increase in the price of fossil fuels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, as a nation, must focus and direct our limited resources to sectors that will surely give us 
<br/>the competitive edge  and ensure there is  food security so that  we  continue to  have  a competitive 
<br/>advantage in terms of our export, if we want to achieve the Bula Boom, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Agricultural Sector, as we all know, can be divided into two major subsectors which is 
<br/>sugar and non-sugar.  First, our sugar subsector is important because a fair share of our population 
<br/>depend on it for survival.  More than 250,000 of our citizens either directly or indirectly very much 
<br/>depend on the sugar subsector for survival. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  sad  reality  is  that  the  sugar  subsector  continues  to  be  heavily  subsidized  by  the 
<br/>Government, compared to non-sugar agriculture.  Many studies have been carried out after the events 
<br/></span><span>of 2006.   First,  the  </span><span>Deloitte Report</span><span> recommendations  in  the early 2010  were implemented which 
<br/></span><span>included the privatisation of one mill, in addition to the overhaul of the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the </span><span>Deloitte Report</span><span>, there were many other reviews and studies that followed.  
<br/>Despite such effort, the sugar subsector continued on a declining trend, whilst Government on an 
<br/>annual basis continues to inject substantial taxpayers’ money to revitalize the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key indicators suggest that the sugar industry has not responded to reforms or the additional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>substantial injection of taxpayers’ funds. These include the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugarcane production continues on a declining trend. In 2006 the total cane produced 
<br/>was around 2.8 million tonnes.  In 2020 only 1.8 million tonnes of cane were produced 
<br/>a reduction of almost 1 million tonnes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The number of active farmers have not improved.  In 2006, there were around 15,730 
<br/>active farmers.  In 2020, the number of active farmers dropped to around 11,622, a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reduction of 41 percent.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The TCTS has not improved at all and it is hovering around 10:46 whilst the best ratio 
<br/>should be below 9.  This is the tonnes of sugar produced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar production has also been on a declining trend in 2006 sugar produced was around 
<br/>288,911  tonnes.  In  2020  sugar  production  is  around  168,703  tonnes,  a  reduction  of 
<br/>about 120,208 tonnes of sugar produced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Export of sugar including molasses declined substantially from as high as $224 million 
<br/>in 2006 to around $87.3 million in 2021, a reduction of more than 50 percent despite 
<br/>substantial increase in government subsidy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  indicators  clearly  show  that  the  reform  agenda  implemented  by  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government to revitalize the sugar industry has failed miserably.  The solution, Sir, is to look at other 
<br/>alternatives rather than continue to pour taxpayers money with no results at all.  Some of us in this 
<br/>august  House  may  recall  the  initiative  by  the  Qarase  Government  in  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>“Alternative Livelihood Programme” with the commitment of all our local stakeholders and support 
<br/></span><span>from our development partners. This Programme involves diversification within the sugar subsector. 
<br/></span><span>The  European  Union  committed  over  $300  million  in  grant  to  support  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>Programme which was withdrawn due to the event of 2006.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is unfortunate that the Programme was cancelled in 2007 by the administration led by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  The Programme took a holistic approach whereby all stakeholders’ vis-
<br/>à-vis government, private sector, industry players and development partners working in partnership 
<br/>to revitalize the sugar industry.  I believe this Programme still has some merit and should be revisited 
<br/>by government with adjustments taking into account the changing environment and at the same time 
<br/>encourage the effective participation of all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  importance  of  non-sugar  agriculture  has  come  to  the  forefront  due  to  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic when those that lost their jobs turned to agriculture particularly home gardening to sustain 
<br/>their  livelihood  during  the  crisis.    Despite  opportunities  available  in  the  non-sugar  agriculture 
<br/>subsector very little attention has been given by the government in its development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation  of the Rural  and  Outer  Island Development  Programme has not  been 
<br/>given the prominence it needs in providing food security and the potential opportunities for export. 
<br/></span><span>The  Government  should  pay  more  attention  to  alternative  high  valued  crops  as  substitute  for  the 
<br/></span><span>ailing sugar industry  rather than continuing as business as usual.   There  are  greater potential and 
<br/>opportunities in other resource-based sectors such as forestry and fisheries which should be given 
<br/>priority and given the necessary resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, now I will highlight allocations to key agencies. In doing so, it is interesting 
<br/>to note that operating expenditure has increased by $198 million and a reduction of $105.1 million 
<br/>in capital expenditure compared to the revised 2021-2022 Budget. These are very important figures, 
<br/>although the government continues to claim that this Budget is about investment but the sad reality 
<br/>is that they have reduced capital expenditure by $101 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, with regards to FRA, its allocation has increased by $38.5 million from $338.2 million to 
<br/>$376.7 million. What surprises me is that the announcement made grand statements regarding the 
<br/>work to be carried out by FRA, including the four lane highway from Suva to the West. The question 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, is how realistic is this amount for FRA to achieve all those targets?  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation given to FRA in the 2022-2023 Budget is less than the budget allocated for 
<br/>roads in 2005 and 2006.  Interestingly, the FRA continues to be on a declining trend from $653million 
<br/>in 2015-2016 Financial Year and continues to decline.  Taking into account the substantial allocation 
<br/>to FRA from 2015 to 2019-2020 for the last five years averaging $500 million, Sir, there was very 
<br/>little improvement in our roading infrastructure.  With the current level of funding, it is unlikely that 
<br/>the conditions of our road will improve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  there  was  a  lot  of  excitement  and  euphoria  from  the  Government  side  when  the 
<br/>announcement was made that a study is going to be undertaken as pointed out by the Honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy just a while ago.  I would like to inform this august House that this is nothing 
<br/>new. There were two studies carried out for the transport sector in early 2000.  Key recommendations 
<br/>of the studies suggest that it is not visible and viable to construct a four lane highway because the 
<br/>traffic count was low and the loading was not adequate to justify the construction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rather than funding a totally new study, a review of the transport sector study carried out 
<br/>earlier would be suffice to determine the viability of such undertaking. The study also considered the 
<br/>construction of a light rail system between Suva and Nausori and the finding suggests that the volume 
<br/>is not enough to warrant the construction of such project.  Sir, the point I am trying to make is that 
<br/></span><span>Government should stop trying to reinvent the wheel and review previous work undertaken to ensure 
<br/></span><span>cost effectiveness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On rural electrification, I have noted that a sum of $19 million has been allocated under Head 
<br/>50 to be paid out to EFL. The amount allocated for rural electrification is quite substantial and very 
<br/>little work has been carrid out.  In Savusavu, Sir, if you drive along Buca Bay West Coast and the 
<br/>Hibiscus Highway not forgetting that in the northern part of Taveuni you will see power poles along 
<br/>the way since 2017 but no electricity supplied. As of today, nothing has improved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  capacity  in  Savusavu  to  generate  power  has  not  increased  and  the  town 
<br/>experience,  at  least,  four  to  five  blackouts  in  a  day.  I  believe  this  is  similar  to  other  parts  of  the 
<br/>country. My concern is the issue raised in the Auditor-General’s Report regarding rural electrification 
<br/>where funding has been transferred to shareholders account and not used for its intended purpose.  A 
<br/>review  should  be  undertaken  as  to  how  much  of  this  funding  has  been  utilized  for  its  intended 
<br/>purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The EFL is a natural monopoly with an overseas shareholder. The need for a major reform to 
<br/>ensure  cost  effectiveness  and  transparency  is  necessary.  This  could  be  easily  achieved  through 
<br/></span><span>separation of functions. We need to separate the production side from distribution and also ensure an 
<br/></span><span>independent regulatory body. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government continued to claim that the health and medical services are very important 
<br/>in the country. This is also confirmed by the  Country Private Sector Diagnostic Report known as 
<br/></span><span>“</span><span>Creating  Markets  in  Fiji</span><span>”</span><span>  clearly  stated  that  Fiji’s  healthcare  system  has  challenges  in  its  entire 
<br/>value chain, as I have stated earlier from inadequate infrastructure for early screening and diagnosis 
<br/>of disease to the availability of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals and disposal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the claim by the Government and the finding of the report, the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services has decreased by $11.5 million from $406.6 million in the Revised Budget and 
<br/>only $395 million in the 2022-2023 Budget. This clearly reveals the hypocrisy of this Government 
<br/>in saying something but doing the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not least, most of the increases in the Ministry are for Operating Expenditure rather 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>than Capital Works, such as the increase in the:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sorry to say that we, on this side of Parliament, are not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in a position to support this 2022-2023 Budget basically for the following reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very clear in our mind that this is an electioneering Budget and does not address the 
<br/>deep rooted structural challenges facing the nation today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has lied and deceived the nation that fiscal consolidation for the 
<br/>Government  medium-term  fiscal  strategy.    The  focus  will  be  on  reducing  deficit  and 
<br/>growing the size of the economy by enticing new investment and economic diversification. 
<br/>The fact of the matter is that, there has not been any real effort or commitment for fiscal 
<br/>consolidation.  This is reflected in the increase of our net deficit to a whopping $872.2 
<br/>million which is around 7.4 percent of GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government’s total exposure is over 106.4 percent, I think, this is a very important point 
<br/>for  us  honourable  Members.  The  total  exposure  is  106.4  percent  of  GDP  which  is 
<br/>unprecedented and unacceptable for a small and vulnerable country like Fiji.  The total 
<br/>exposure includes $8.6 billion of Government debt and $1.7 billion of contingency liability. 
<br/>Majority of our contingency liability are considered high risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  very  limited  attention  given  to  strategies  to  stimulate  growth  as  we  are  going 
<br/>through a volatile recovery period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reduction  of  Government  capital  expenditure  by  $105.1  million  (this  is  another 
<br/>interesting point) is a concern.  Therefore, capital works in major resource based sectors 
<br/>and the upgrading of key social infrastructure will not be realised or probably be deferred 
<br/>as usual. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The manipulation of figures and the bullish forecast for economic growth is unacceptable 
<br/>and gives the wrong signal to investors both, domestic and foreign.  They are fully aware 
<br/>that realistically, we will not be achieving the 12.4 percent projected growth because of 
<br/>uncertainty volatility of the global trading and geo-political environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bula Boom is unlikely to be achieved just like the Bainimarama Boom.  What is clear 
<br/>on the horizon is an Election Kaboom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  first  acknowledge  the  extraordinary 
<br/>achievements  of  our  sportswomen  by  congratulating  the  Fiji  Pearls  on  qualifying  for  the  Women’s 
<br/>Netball World Cup next year in South Africa, the Fijiana for winning the Pacific Nations Cup and our 
<br/>Fiji Girls Soccer Team (the Kulas) for advancing to the semi-finals of the OFC Women’s Nations Cup 
<br/>after last night’s victory against the Cook Islands, a win I was proud to witness first-hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, winning at the highest level is all about preparation.  It demands consistent 
<br/>practice to deliver an effective game time strategy.  That is true in sports.  It is also true in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our game plan is the National Budget we put before the people.  When we consider the totality 
<br/>of the pandemic, the strength of our recovery, the stability and certainty that our people and businesses 
<br/>needs at this time, I believe this is the most important budget that we ever presented in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, families need more support and they need it now.  This Budget gives it.  The private sector 
<br/></span><span>needs stability, certainty and long-term consistency.  This Budget delivers that in spades, and this Budget 
<br/></span><span>broadens and lengthens the causeway to recovery we established from day one of the crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Its expenditure has been called balanced, disciplined and responsible.  Its social support has been 
<br/>called fair and compassionate.  Its policies have been called pro-active and pro-growth, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>That is all true.  This was all possible because when Fiji needed a clear vision and decisive leadership, 
<br/>my Government supplied it.  When we called on the Fijian people, they stood with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in the early days when we understood very little about the virus and what we knew was 
<br/>changing daily, we began readying Fiji for a recovery.  Everyday, we worked to get back to the FijiFirst 
<br/>forged path towards an economy that was diversifying, digitising and delivering resilient infrastructure 
<br/>in our communities and breaking records for growth - an economy that was connecting our most rural 
<br/>communities to clean water and reliable energy, relocating communities at risk to sea level rise and lifting 
<br/>people out of poverty and the policies that were driving up investment, driving down unemployment and 
<br/>empowering our landowners.  You do not mess with the fundamentals of our winning record like that, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, so through the pandemic, we preserved business institutions and industries like tourism that 
<br/>helped to make it all possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We secured vaccines and deployed them for free for all eligible Fijians in all parts of the country.  
<br/></span><span>We repatriated more than 45,000 Fijians and adapted best practices in COVID-19 management from our 
<br/>national carrier - Fiji Airways, which obtained some of the highest possible recognitions in COVID-
<br/>safety to our airports and our hotels. Through the pandemic, our strategy and confidence did not only 
<br/>distinguish ourselves from our opponents, we distinguish Fiji among nations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We made Fiji the number one country in tourism readiness in the entire Asia-Pacific.  Our policies 
<br/>and our people did that. Together, we made Fiji the most COVID-safe tourism destination in the most 
<br/>populous region of the world.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I then promised that Fiji would be opened by Christmas, 
<br/>but some critics said that that was a fantasy.  We re-opened our border well before that date and proved 
<br/>that small minds cannot comprehend bold visions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now surging out of this once-in-100-year crisis.  Our economic growth this year will break 
<br/>records.    Yes,  of  course,  that  reflects  recovery  from  the  pandemic-induced  decline,  but  it  is  a  valid 
<br/>indicator that our business sector is resilient and our economic fundamentals are strong enough to create 
<br/>a Bula Boom in tourism and economic activity.  While countries like Samoa and Tonga still have not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fully opened their borders, Fiji has been opened and recovering for nearly seven months - creating jobs, 
<br/>paying wages and attracting investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what decisiveness delivers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and those are all good news, but no one in 
<br/>Government believes that Fiji is free of its challenges.  There is still a war going on and we cannot turn 
<br/>away from it.  Aside from killing thousands of civilians, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has decimated 
<br/>the global supply of wheat and seed oils.  A fragile agreement was signed just two days ago to increase 
<br/>grain exports out of Ukraine, but that is far from guaranteed to actually happen.  Vital supplies of fuel are 
<br/>being  cut-off  to the  world  as  well.   This  has  all  made  lagging  pandemic  shortages  and supply  chain 
<br/>disruptions even worse and sent prices even higher. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We responded earlier on by dropping customs duties to zero or near-zero on over 2,000 items.  
<br/>We responded again by raising the national minimum wage which, let us not forget, this Government 
<br/>introduced.    We  responded  further  by  removing  VAT  on  21  essential  food  items.    We  are  also  the 
<br/>Government that freed the lowest-earning Fijians from paying any income tax at all and that subsidises 
<br/>electricity and provides free water for low income families.  We are also the Government that covers fees 
<br/>for market vendors and that covers the licence renewal fees for taxi drivers, carrier drivers and bus drivers.  
<br/>We are the Government that covers the fees for members of the public seeking their birth certificates or 
<br/></span><span>police clearance to fill out job applications.  We also cover the fees for fishermen to get their licences and 
<br/></span><span>we have extended all the support for another full year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All through this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will become the Government that responds with 
<br/>compassion once again through a new $60million inflation mitigation package.  It includes cash support 
<br/>to families paid out per child - $1 per day or $7 a week or $30 a month.  It is not a fortune by any means, 
<br/>but it is a difference maker for many needy families.  It certainly will be for a mother of four who will 
<br/>receive  $720  in  direct  cash  support  between  the  start  of  August  and  the  end  of  December.    One-off 
<br/>payments of $180 will also go to tertiary students, people on Government pensions, in aftercare and the 
<br/>social welfare recipients.  The situation is extremely volatile, which is why we will review our response 
<br/>in six-month’s time.  If more support is needed, it will be given. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  deeply  impressed  by  the  balance  achieved  in  this  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    We  have 
<br/>delivered the support while also committing to the path towards fiscal consolidation that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General has assured us we would embark upon once our recovery gained steam.  During the 
<br/>crisis itself, we had to deal with the choices that were before us, not the choices we wish we had.  We had 
<br/>to choose the best option for our people and our businesses because the perfect option did not exist, so 
<br/>we acted as governments are supposed to do.  We borrowed as in we, the Government, borrowed so that 
<br/></span><span>families could put food on the table and businesses do not have to shut down forever.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me be crystal clear on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if our people had not been given access to the 
<br/>unemployment benefits we rolled out in the pandemic and the social support which we never cut through 
<br/>the pandemic, families would not have been able to feed their children and keep their homes.  Businesses 
<br/>would have been forced to borrow much more at much higher rates to simply survive, if they had been 
<br/>able to borrow at all.  The bottom line is that our borrowing protected families and businesses, and that 
<br/>was the right call.  Our recovery is the proof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I love to hear all the positivity and excitement this Budget has created - our 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and his Ministry for Economy team deserve those accolades.  Though I 
<br/>would say the most telling commentary comes from our opponents.  They have all called this Budget an 
<br/>“elections budget” - that is their funny way of admitting that it is a damn good budget for the people.  
<br/>They said the same thing fours ago and it provides some insight into their thinking, since they have no 
<br/>guiding philosophy of government or economic management and only seem to be driven by the desire to 
<br/>be elected to office.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1513 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me let them in on a secret, Mr. Speaker, Sir; elections are decided by the people and I answer 
<br/>to the people.  So, when my political opponents call this an ‘elections budget’, they really mean it is a 
<br/>people’s budget and so is every budget that we have passed before it, because we do not work towards 
<br/>an election.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we work for the people.  When you serve the people, the people support 
<br/>you; it is not complicated.  They say our support and service to the people is “freebies”.  With one silly 
<br/>word, Sir, they expose their own intellectual bankruptcy, because a response like that is designed to cut 
<br/>off discussion, not engage in it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask what would they prefer?  Should we force the most vulnerable Fijians 
<br/>to pay the full price of Russia’s war?  Should we demand the most vulnerable Fijians to front the full cost 
<br/>of rising bus fares?  Should we abandon those who need their government the most? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, only a politician seated in the comfort of an 
<br/>office would ever dare to call social support a “freebie”.  Government is not holding a “buy one, get one 
<br/>free” sale on new television sets.  We are providing security for those most vulnerable in society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mothers do not call money they can spend buying food for their children, a freebie. No one calls 
<br/></span><span>free medicine they need to survive, a freebie.  No one calls the free education they can provide for their 
<br/>children, a freebie. No one calls the roads they rely on to travel to their jobs or to the market, a freebie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people need this support and our opponents are too blinded by political ambition to see it. In 
<br/>fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think they have become bitter and twisted.  Let me remind them, especially the 
<br/>NFP - bitter and twisted.  Their personalisation of politics and the economy could not be more different 
<br/>from our sober, visionary, and rational decision-making.  It is the differences Mr. Speaker, Sir, between 
<br/>tweeting and leading.  It is the difference between policy-making and power-seeking.  I have been to 
<br/>communities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and spoken with the people - I know the difference this assistance makes 
<br/>for families, children and for those most vulnerable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All that our political opponents have offered the nation, are insults.  They cry and howl like a 
<br/>pack of wolves in public, but behind closed doors they are more like a flock of timid sheep searching in 
<br/>vain for a shepherd, or maybe even a sheep dog - anyone who knows anything about economic statecraft 
<br/>and has the courage to propose strategies that will lead them out of their confusion and stupor into a safe 
<br/>political meadow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have had 10 days to provide any credible alternative policies and we have heard nothing 
<br/></span><span>from them but schoolyard tantrums.   I still wonder what our opponents hope to accomplish by these 
<br/>attacks, not for themselves because we know the answer to that, but for the people of Fiji.  What kind of 
<br/>economy would they envision in these troubled times and what difficult choices would they summon the 
<br/>courage to make; we do not know because they do not propose.  They just whinge and criticise, and say 
<br/>no.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- So true!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I trust the people to tell the difference between those working to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>serve them and those who could not even be bothered to present them with an alternative budget.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Those who could not even be bothered to complete their terms in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- True! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- And those who cannot be bothered to tell the truth to the public, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, like the missing honourable Professor Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He has left us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- It took honourable Professor Prasad a number of days after the 
<br/>Budget to begin lying to our cane growers. Despite the A-G’s total assurance that we would pay the full 
<br/>$85 per tonne, honourable Biman Prasad said we would not be paying that guaranteed price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- That is an outright falsehood; our growers will get the full $85 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per tonne as we promised they would.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- I am seriously concerned that honourable Professor Prasad does 
<br/>not  understand  the  most  basic  premise  of  our  support  growing  programmes  for  cane  growers.  
<br/>Government funds a top up on the world market price for sugar, which means that when the world market 
<br/>price goes lower, we step in to cover the difference to grant our growers certainty, and when the world 
<br/>price rises, we do not have to spend as much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  world  price  of  sugar  is  rising,  so  Government  does  not  have  to  subsidise  as  large  of  a 
<br/>difference as it did in previous years to reach the $85 price floor. The budget allocation reflects that.  If 
<br/>the professor cannot comprehend those basic maths, he should go back to school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Very poor!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- In fact, he should go speak with his old colleague, Dr. Rup Singh, 
<br/>who has said clearly that Fiji’s debt levels are sustainable, by the way.  That is real analysis, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>from  a  brilliant  professor  who  still  believes  in  objective  truth,  who  has  not  sacrificed  his  academic 
<br/>credentials on the altar of political ambition. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Leaders  do  not  lie.    Leaders  solve  problems.    Leaders  create 
<br/>solutions.  Honourable Professor Prasad and his new bed-mate Rabuka only know how to paint the worst 
<br/>possible picture of the country through conjecture, pessimism and fabricated theories.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not speak the truth and that is the truth.  Honourable Professor Prasad, your new National 
<br/>Bank destroying buddy nearly turned our Fijian dollar into used serviettes when he was in government.  
<br/>He devalued our dollar by more than 50 percent without the help of a pandemic. We kept our dollar strong 
<br/>during the entire crisis.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1515 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- That is the truth.  Too much dancing, I guess.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is also true, Mr. Speaker, is that this Government supplies ideas.  We supply policies and 
<br/>purpose that the Fijian people deserve from their elected representatives.  We have strategically delineated 
<br/>$3.8 billion worth of expenditure.  We have written a roadmap for delivering sustained growth.  We have 
<br/>sensibly reduced public spending to allow businesses in the private sector to step forward and drive our 
<br/>recovery.    We  have  committed  to  keep  taxes  low  for  three  years  at  least,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    That  is 
<br/>consistency that businesses and the Fijians they employ can count on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Across my portfolio, the Immigration Department will use its allocation to continue its reforms 
<br/>then make it more technologically savvy for the benefit of our citizens and visitors.   That includes a 
<br/>complete online permit processing and payment system, and I welcome the extension of the business visa 
<br/>duration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  sugar,  the  guaranteed  price  of  $85  per  tonne  will  be  paid,  Mr.  Speaker.    We  have  again 
<br/>allocated a $25 million budget to ensure that our growers continue to pay $20 per every 50-kilogramme 
<br/></span><span>bag of Blend A, B and C fertiliser they will procure, despite the skyrocketing price of the commodity 
<br/></span><span>globally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of iTaukei Affairs will continue to implement policies that reflect the philosophy 
<br/>that our landowners should be financially empowered by the constitutionally-protected assets they own. 
<br/>The Ministry’s budget has been increased to survey more unsurveyed land, preserve and revamp our 
<br/>iTaukei records, and host more roadshows, leadership and cultural awareness trainings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our opponents have already embarked on their usual campaign of lying to landowners about 
<br/>threats to their land and security.  They said the same thing about the 2013 Constitution.  They said the 
<br/>same in the 2014 Elections, they said we would sell Kadavu to the Chinese and they had said the same 
<br/>thing about Bill No. 17, which is now Act No. 21.   Of course, no land has been lost, no landowner has 
<br/>not been consulted but on the contrary, iTaukei land is only rising in value.  No rights have been infringed, 
<br/>instead, iTaukei landowners have been emboldened and empowered to seek development opportunities 
<br/>and earn more money in lease payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry’s  $17.7  million  allocation  will  fund  the  steady 
<br/>development of a greener Fijian economy, creating sustainable livelihoods that our people can count on 
<br/></span><span>for generations.  That is what we are in the business of doing – creating long-term solutions that support 
<br/></span><span>long-term recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, during the entire pandemic, our opponents have tried to shrink the nation’s ambition.  
<br/>They have tried to make this about them, versus us.  The real fight has been the Fijian people against the 
<br/>virus and the global pandemic and economic crisis it created.  That is the fight I have been focussed on 
<br/>for the past two-and-a-half years - that is the fight that matters and that is the fight we are winning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you look at how they act and little they have told us about how they would lead, it becomes 
<br/>clear,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  our  opponents  are  among  the  greatest  risks  facing  our  recovery.    When  we 
<br/>consider future threats, like conflicts overseas, climate change and COVID-19, we sadly must consider 
<br/>the remote possibility of our opponents entering Government.  Their incompetence rises to the same level 
<br/>of risk as the other crises we face, because their indecisiveness and inability to craft meaningful policies 
<br/>would make us far more vulnerable to every other threat on the horizon.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vision does not unite them, policy does not unite them, and neither does common sense.  They 
<br/>are married by nothing but bitterness, spite and pessimism.  God forbid, if they ever entered Government, 
<br/>they  would  spend  years  trying  to  figure  out  who  would  lead  them,  much  less  make  any  policy  that 
<br/>improves people’s lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government is united, not by hatred towards anyone but by principles and by 
<br/>ambition for Fiji.  We want what is best for Fijian families.  We want what is best for the hardworking 
<br/>people and the businesses and industries they rely on.  We want what is best for Fiji today and what is 
<br/>best for our children and grandchildren tomorrow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wholeheartedly endorse this Budget as our game plan to deliver that vision for all Fijians.  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, it is, indeed, a winning recipe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an election budget.  It pleases the people for 
<br/>the next six months until election time - after that, they will remove or substantially reduce that.  But 
<br/>people are not as ignorant or fools as the FijiFirst Government or Party.  One might say, “You can fool 
<br/>the people some of the time but you cannot fool all the people all the time”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People do not vote for the FijiFirst Government or Party, nor do they vote for the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister or the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy.  Why?  It is because the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  or  Party  is  led  by  them;  one  is  a  </span><span>coup</span><span>-maker  and  an  alleged  murderer.    The 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  supported  Speight’s  </span><span>coup</span><span>,  then  as  Commander,  could  not  protect  the 
<br/>President then, the late honourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, and shifted him to a boat out in the sea, 
<br/>and then </span><span>couped </span><span>Speight again after the </span><span>Muanikau Accord</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bainimarama is also an alleged murderer either or both physically and spiritually 
<br/>murdered the CRWs and no justice being made under his leadership since.  I would have thought a 
<br/>budget is set aside for a Court or Justice Commission clearing his name before he is unceremoniously 
<br/>elected out of Parliament this year.  He then </span><span>couped</span><span> the Military Counsel for his contract renewal in 
<br/>2004, </span><span>couped</span><span> the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase and Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) Party in 
<br/>2006  after  having  lost  all  his  independent  candidates  in  the  General  Election.    His  </span><span>coup</span><span>  was  for 
<br/>personal  reasons  to save his  skin.   Shame on him  and also  shame on the Fiji  Military  Forces for 
<br/>supporting such a selfish personal motive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other, honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, is a bomb-maker and a terrorist.  Without a 
<br/>budget for a Court of Law to hear his case, although may be ignorant until proven guilty in the eyes 
<br/></span><span>of the public, he is a bomb-maker and a terrorist, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They both have also </span><span>couped</span><span> the iTaukei people from their rightful place of cultural leadership 
<br/>in their own land and country.  They removed the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC), took away the 
<br/>iTaukei rights, benefits and interests in what they own through the 17 to 23 Decrees (now Acts), stole 
<br/>from the iTaukei landowners to give others those benefits, therefore, they also become racists. They 
<br/>robbed Peter (iTaukei) to give Paul (other races). There should be a budget set aside for a Commission 
<br/>of Inquiry to inquire into those for justice to prevail.  It is important for the Budget to include all that, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has often boasted that iTaukei ownership of 
<br/>land is safe under the forced 2013 Constitution. While ownership under the entrenched Acts in 1970, 
<br/>1990 and 1997 Constitutions were intact, there was further protection under the Parliamentary setup 
<br/>of the House of Review (Senate) by two-thirds majority in both the Houses, including two-thirds 
<br/>majority of GCC Senate representatives.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1517 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the iTaukei is locked under the forced 2013 Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, blinded, 
<br/>dumped, lamed and with no mind by 17 Decrees (now Acts), the iTaukei Lands Trust Act, iTaukei 
<br/>Lands Act and the iTaukei Affairs Act setup are exploited, forced and rushed through under Standing 
<br/>Order 51 in Parliament by a mere 51 percent vote, for example, Bill No. 17.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  have  successfully 
<br/>shifted the right of policy decisions over iTaukei land from the landowners to a politician or foreign 
<br/>thinking.  This was done by shifting the chairmanship of iTLTB, FAB, et cetera, from the President 
<br/>of Fiji who is a landowner by recommendation of GCC to the Prime Minister, a foreign political 
<br/>agent - shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTaukei is just witnessing the effects of that dramatic change of leadership and decision 
<br/>making  over  iTaukei  resources.  Please,  all  iTaukei,  do  not  vote  for  the  FijiFirst  Government  or 
<br/>FijiFirst Party.  This is your only chance.  The FijiFirst Government claims that it is a responsible 
<br/>budget  but  from  proven  record,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  Government  revenue  estimates  or 
<br/>budget is normally on the high side, to look attractive and good.  So, this is another look-good Budget. 
<br/>The expenditure estimates on record for the FijiFirst Government is normally on the higher side too, 
<br/>to throw out a profitable or smaller deficit outcome - again to look good.  The FijiFirst Government 
<br/></span><span>is smart in producing look-good budgets as for this one too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The actuals or variance for the FijiFirst Government record is normally the opposite.  Revenue 
<br/>is lower and expenditure is even lower, resulting in a bigger or higher deficit. Note, actual deficit 
<br/>shows a steady rise from 2 percent in 2014 to about 14 percent  in the 2021-2023 Estimates.  The 
<br/>reality  is  different,  worse  off,  particularly  for  2022  which  is  election  year,  and  many  unexpected 
<br/>irresponsible expenditures will go into buying of votes or freebies for the FijiFirst Government.  Total 
<br/>revenue trend as to actual and variance widened since 2013 so as the expenditure trend. How can this 
<br/>be a responsible budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 10-year intervals (1971-1980), the late honourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, a 4.8 percent 
<br/>of GDP but for this Government only 3.18 percent GDP from 2011-2020.  On five-year intervals, the 
<br/>late honourable Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, GDP was 5.8 percent compared to -2.32 percent from 2016-
<br/>2020 for the FijiFirst Government.  So the target of reducing 13.8 percent to 7.4 percent as proven 
<br/>track record may and will end up in 20 percent deficit if we are lucky – worse off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debt  benchmark  for  developed  countries  is  around  60  percent  of  GDP  and  a  developing 
<br/>country like Fiji is around 40 percent, but Fiji is around 80 percent.  Including contingent liabilities, 
<br/></span><span>we are about 106 percent.  Debt is ever increasing and is out of control.  Why can you not reduce it?  
<br/></span><span>We will, by creating more productive revenue earning areas or initiatives.  Other Pacific nations with 
<br/>even smaller or bigger economies (Tonga, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, et cetera) 
<br/>are doing better than Fiji.  Shame, Mr. Speaker, Sir!  As a result, each member of Fiji’s population 
<br/>owes or has to pay a debt now equivalent of $10,000; an increase from $8,000 to $9,000 in 2018.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very irresponsible Budget, particularly now when they want to save their own 
<br/>skins.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  introduction  of  low  tax  regime,  attractive  tax  incentives,  improvement  in  business 
<br/>processes; why only low tax regime and attractive tax incentives in the election year?  To buy votes?  
<br/>Sorry, you will not get those votes.  We have been preaching about these for the last four to eight 
<br/>years.    Low  and  attractive  tax  incentives  to  include  business  people  and  entrepreneurs  to  pursue 
<br/>profitable and sustainable productive initiatives available in Fiji, particularly in the primary industries 
<br/>and manufacturing areas for increased exports to reduce imports.  Why only this year?  It is too late 
<br/>for you.  We will do it and continue with it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I totally agree that we improve business processes (Ease of Doing Business initiatives) 
<br/>in cutting down cost of doing business and delay in decision making.  This had greatly affected the 
<br/>productivity in the timber industry where in one instance the processing of logging renewal licence 
<br/>which took almost eight months, backdating effective date of renewal to eight months ago when the 
<br/>application was only received four months to expiry and applying for annual renewal again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is now the position of reducing log prices from mahogany logs by 20 percent due to 
<br/>COVID-19?  The Prime Minister as Chairman of the Mahogany Industry Council has approved but 
<br/>is still sitting with the Minister for Economy today - why the delay?  Who is the Chairman of the 
<br/>Mahogany Industry Council?  Is it the Prime Minister or the Minister for Economy? The Minister 
<br/>for Economy and the Prime Minister are racist against the mahogany landowners; the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  There 
<br/>has been lack of decision making to forge the mahogany industry ahead with increased production 
<br/>and export for more revenue, for production had been well below 20,000 cubic metres with potential 
<br/>for 8,000 cubic metres.  Many are left behind, in particular the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remittances  is  number  one  revenue  in  times  of  pestilences  when  tourism  is  vulnerable  to 
<br/>external  factors.    Why  not  provide  tax  incentives  for  investment  remittances  to  encourage  more 
<br/>investments in productive areas of business, in particular to primary industries and manufacturing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  I support the assistance to  children, students,  youth  and the  aged, why only for six 
<br/>months?  So these are to buy votes for FijiFirst Government - unfortunately, it will fail.  People will 
<br/>not vote for the FijiFirst Government, they have burnt their fingers in the last four years, they will 
<br/>accept the gifts or assistance, they will say, “thank you for doing your responsibility but they will 
<br/>vote for Opposition parties.”  It is time to go for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where are the jobs for TELS and Toppers students?  How can they pay loans?  We will free 
<br/>them from these debts.  Where are the technical  schools for skills training, FNU cannot cater for 
<br/>them, many will miss out in skills training necessary for wholesome or holistic livelihood.  Many are 
<br/>left behind again, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On poverty, 40 percent are below poverty line with an additional 20 percent bordering that 
<br/>line.  Of the 40 percent, 75 percent of that is </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>according to the Fiji Bureau of Statistics’ figures. 
<br/>So many of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> on poverty are left behind.  That is the result of racist policies of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government such as in this Budget; a racist Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On tourism, while we continue to encourage tourism, we must not lose focus on growth in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our primary industries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On agriculture, our food import is increasing at a faster rate than our exports, in particular 
<br/>food,  crops,  vegetables,  meat,  et  cetera,  that  we  can  grow  here.  We  must  take  the  lead  role  in 
<br/>encouraging people to go commercial and produce for export rather than remain at subsistence level. 
<br/>Assistance to Fiji Agro Marketing, subsidy to agricultural lease rentals, commercial farmers equity 
<br/>package,  mechanisation  and  hired  machines  on  50:50  basis  are  not  enough  to  revolutionise 
<br/>agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to increase funding here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and ensure growth in all areas in demand. 
<br/>We  need  to  set  up  Growth  Centres  to  further  develop  co-operative  efforts  and  infrastructure  to 
<br/>decentralise to farm gate levels - processing, value-adding niche export products and commodities at 
<br/>rural  growth  centres,  for  example,  storage  and  cooling  stations  in  identified  </span><span>tikina</span><span>  and  districts. 
<br/>Provide these centres with clean water and appropriate infrastructure in clean power/energy, roads, 
<br/>et cetera.  Substantially, increased expenditure is needed here for increased production for exports 
<br/>and to fulfil local demands to reduce imports.

<div><span>We need to demilitarise Fiji.  Why keep increasing Military budget for nothing? Who will 
<br/>want to invade Fiji? Who is going to fight a war with Fiji and for what reasons? We should have a 
<br/>military just enough to continue with peace keeping and security for our nation at any point in time.  
<br/>While  I  am  not  advocating  the  disbanding  of  the  Military  but  reinforcing  the  institution  with 
<br/>productive aspects of life and while we continue to recruit, train the youth for three to five years in 
<br/>positive  discipline  of  productive  life,  they  are  released  to  various  schemes  each  most  suited  or 
<br/>excellent in, whether in agriculture, business, engineering profession, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course continuing education and training refresher military courses are to continue. We 
<br/>would, therefore, need to open up areas for agricultural subdivisions to accommodate our military 
<br/>agricultural  and  business  schemes.  We  can  even  issue  up-to  99  years  agricultural  leases  but  with 
<br/>proper consultation, consent and clear benefits to </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>landowners.  We do not need high class 
<br/>expensive, unproductive premises such as we have in Black Rock in Nadi, et cetera, a waste of money 
<br/>and resources which can be better utilised in other productive areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We should not be more concerned on fighting enemies with guns and bombs to kill but an 
<br/>army to evangelise and win for Christ Jesus and God the Creator who is mightier, our fortress, is safe 
<br/>or everlasting by the end of the day with Christ Jesus.  Fiji will succeed and win - Fiji the way the 
<br/></span><span>world should be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The crime rate should be reduced but how can that come about?  Nip it in the bud - at the 
<br/>source.  People will follow rules or laws when they see meaning in life.  Crime cannot be reduced 
<br/>with  increasing  budgets  to  serve  increasing  number  of  prisoners.    A  clear  FijiFirst  Government 
<br/>mindset  is  depicted by the picture of small  health centres and huge police stations at Nakasi  and 
<br/>Valelevu  –  leadership  priorities  should  be  on  the  health  of  its  population,  particularly  in  dense 
<br/>populated areas of Nasinu and Nakasi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crime can only be reduced when people or the population finds the truth in leadership and 
<br/>meaning  in  life  –  we  have  not  found  that  in  the  FijiFirst  Government.    Therefore,  education  and 
<br/>training must be maintained at home.  Family as an institution or Government must be given priority 
<br/>to build up Fiji as a nation – strong families, a strong nation.  Increased budget and funding need to 
<br/>be re-diverted to institutions that nurture and nourishes godly family values and principles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  I  agree  with  top  budget  for  education,  I  do  not  agree  with  education  focussing  on 
<br/>Knowledge  Based  Education  for  it  is  only  the  education  of  the  head.    People  or  population  or 
<br/>workforce based only on theory qualifications will bring about chaos and life without meaning at all. 
<br/></span><span>They will just enjoy grog drinking whole day, according to the honourable Minister of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget, therefore, must be given more emphasis in funding institutions that also educate 
<br/>both the heart and hands.  Where has our technical schools, students and teachers gone to?  Sir, FNU 
<br/>cannot  accommodate  them.    Budgets  for  institutions  such  as  Montfort  Boys  Town,  Tutu  Rural 
<br/>Training Centre, Navuso Agriculture School,  CATD Nadave, et cetera, must be increased and such 
<br/>institutions need to be replicated all over the country to promote more  productive people.   By the 
<br/>way, we will immediately pay USP Grant, despite the independent investigation to be carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On health, apart from necessary medicine and equipment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, maintenance of 
<br/>premises  and  quarters.    More  budgetary  allocation  needs  to  be  poured  out  in  the  preventative 
<br/>healthcare system. Focus needs to be made to promote healthy living, even to a point of encouraging, 
<br/>promoting and regulating what we should eat and drink for an improved health and immune system 
<br/>to  prevent  us  from  pestilences,  such  as  COVID-19,  monkeypox,  et  cetera.    This  is  better  than 
<br/>regulating for compulsory vaccination in untested and non-experimental vaccines.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  or  Party  took  away  all  our  rights  here  to  force  everyone  to  be 
<br/>vaccinated and it is still going on despite new evidences of deceitful manipulations of science by the 
<br/>World  Economic  Forum,  WHO,  UNICEF  et  cetera,  for  depopulation  in  infertility  through  these 
<br/>untested and non-experimental vaccines.  The FijiFirst Party will continue to take away our rights, 
<br/>your rights, children’s rights, parent’s rights, youth’s rights, women’s rights, adult’s rights and even 
<br/>rights  to  justice  and  fair  trials  and  decisions  with  courts  in  Fiji.    Any  court  decision  found  to  be 
<br/>politically-motivated will be reversed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People, more of your rights will be taken away because we are being led by the Government 
<br/>that wants to be God and will force us to serve and worship it as God.  Fiji must now stop the FijiFirst 
<br/>Party from further leading us into the evil gut side of life through dictatorial leadership.  We must 
<br/>remain with our Lord Christ Jesus, God the Creator, source of freedom once and for all at all times 
<br/>because at the end of the day, we will be blessed with eternal blessings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the rich, urban and educated population through the use of technology and knowledge, 
<br/>particularly  benefiting  businesses  and  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  is  excluded  by  design.    I  recall  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister stated that  in  early 2006, the rich of this country  called  him to  a dinner and they 
<br/>blackmailed him about the Qoliqoli Bill to be returned to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> owners.  The rich influenced the 
<br/></span><span>honourable  Prime  Minister  to  stage  the  </span><span>coup</span><span>  or  they  will  take  their  money  and  leave  and  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister followed, obeyed, bought and surrendered to that corrupt, racist demand.  
<br/>The honourable Prime Minister, therefore, is a racist against </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  Why did you not tell the rich, 
<br/>“take your money and leave?”  He has been bought.  Shame!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to tell the rich that if you want to take your money elsewhere, it is up to you, that is 
<br/>your freedom but just do not meddle with the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> resource ownership.  Fiji does not need your 
<br/>money, we need our resources that the Lord Christ Jesus gave to us - that is all we need.  This Budget 
<br/>is a continuation of the rich people’s demand on resources and </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people here in Fiji.  All </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>people must vote other Opposition parties, do not vote for the FijiFirst Government or Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has done only a few things, like the development 
<br/>of $10 million now reduced to $2 million, the equal shares in lease money, et cetera, but they forgot 
<br/>about  the  many  things  previous  Governments  have  done  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  people  -  education 
<br/>scholarships, reserved business ventures with  51 percent; businesses like backpackers in  tourism, 
<br/>shareholdings in Fijian Holdings, Real Estate buildings around here in Suva and in all urban centres 
<br/>like in Suvavou, Rewa, Tavua, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine Forest Plantation:  Have you ever established any plantation in Fiji?  No!  Mahogany 
<br/></span><span>Forest, Fiji’s 10 percent shareholding is taken away and no 20 percent for log price for COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Village/Settlement Housing Scheme: They have done nothing to date, compared to what was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  education  funding  for  secondary  and  higher  tertiary  institutions,  we  will  continue  to 
<br/>extend that.  </span><span>Qoliqoli</span><span> surfing area agreements, we will continue to do that as well as the State and 
<br/>Native Land swap because the landowners will benefit more.  The Great Council of Chiefs Complex 
<br/>in Rewa, what is being done with it?  The iTaukei Trust Fund, what is it being used for that?  Those 
<br/>are questions the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are asking.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for forestry, just to conclude, it is important that the reversion of business 
<br/>for landowners for pine and mahogany increase value adding to exports because there are more than 
<br/>50 percent of exports on sawn timber.  We need to have more exports on value adding.

<div><span>Also,  the  Nabouwalu  township  in  conjunction  with  economic  developments  will  create 
<br/>manufacturing business opportunities, employment and increase population to create demands.  First, 
<br/>create tax free zones in Dreketi, Nakadrudru and Nabouwalu and build up infrastructure, water, et 
<br/>cetera, and an international airport for all that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on infrastructure, to conclude, we will tarseal the roads from Nabouwalu to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nabalebale, 10 metres from each road each year and within four years, it will be completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you very much indeed for your time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General,  fellow  Cabinet  colleagues,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  to  the 
<br/>thousands of Fijians watching this on the Fijian Government </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page; I rise today to contribute 
<br/>to the discussion on what has been a smart and innovative Budget and one that empowers grassroots 
<br/>Fijians, protecting the vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  and  his 
<br/>hardworking team for yet another amazing Budget.   This  Budget  assists  multiple  sectors  that  are 
<br/></span><span>critical to Fiji as a country and also protects everyday Fijians from the devastating impacts of the 
<br/></span><span>Russian-Ukraine war.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cash support provided to families with children of about $30 per month 
<br/>per child may not seem like much to the privileged but for many people, it will make a world of 
<br/>difference.  University students will also receive $180 over a six-month period, not forgetting that 
<br/>these are added benefits to existing initiatives, such as the Free Education Grant, the National Toppers 
<br/>Scheme,  Tertiary  Education  Loan  Scheme,  Water  and  Electricity  Subsidies  and  countless  other 
<br/>initiatives.  This is a sign of a good Budget and a good Government as it creates opportunities for all 
<br/>citizens.  For example, the hike in fuel prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war has forced an increase 
<br/>in bus fares and our response is to subsidise 10 percent of the bus fares across the board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We understand that many Fijians rely on buses for transportation and thus, we cannot let the 
<br/>industry die.  However, there needed to be some cushion for Fijians on the impact of inflation and 
<br/>thus, we now pay 10 percent less on bus fare across the board.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the situation in the 
<br/>world  right  now  is  that  there  is  a  war  raging  in  Eastern  Europe  which  is  causing  the  prices  of 
<br/>everything to go up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is a small nation and we are often impacted by global events that we have not caused nor 
<br/></span><span>can influence.  The only way we will survive as a small island nation is through unity and looking 
<br/>out  for one  another.   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems  that irresponsible politicians have 
<br/>decided that his tough global situation is their opportunity to gain political power.  While we have 
<br/>seen  the  good  side  of  the  vast  majority  of  Fijians,  we  have  also  seen  the  worst  from  people  like 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad, his new leader Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka and many other failed politicians 
<br/>like Ms. Lynda Tabuya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can go on social media where they say and I quote, “Take the freebies 
<br/>and vote them out”.  What an irresponsible thing to be telling our people and teaching our children, 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad and honourable Tikoduadua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these power-hungry politicians are encouraging people to take more than 
<br/>they need as if it is some funny joke, as if assistance for people is a political tool for them.  There are 
<br/>Fijians to whom assistance that you call “freebies” provide the opportunity for a better life.  Free 
<br/>Education is not a freebie, it is the pathway for our young ones to get an education and make our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country a better place for generations of Fijians to come.  Free access to doctors and medicine is not 
<br/>a freebie and could mean the difference between life and death for many Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  not  heard  once,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  our  political 
<br/>opponents say that the Russian-Ukraine war is causing all of the prices to go up.  We have not heard 
<br/>them once tell people that factors beyond our control are causing prices to rise around the world.  
<br/>Why do you think that is Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Because, they want to mislead everyone.  They want to 
<br/>lie to our people, Sir, instead of helping their country and helping our people they are creating more 
<br/>problems.  They are trying to create anger in society, and they are directly harming many people with 
<br/>their lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TELS has been a revolution.  It is assuring to see that TELS will continue 
<br/>to provide students with the opportunity to work had and get an education.  We owe it to our children 
<br/>to ensure that TELS and Toppers are there to provide them with education and this Budget has done 
<br/>this.  Every Fijian child on TELS and Toppers has accessed and will have access to this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will never go back to the days when parents had to choose between which of their children 
<br/>to send to school and university, while on the other hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/></span><span>and honourable Gavoka are demanding that we release the money to USP.  They are asking us to take 
<br/></span><span>taxpayers money (our money) and give it to an institution without getting a proper account of how this 
<br/>money is used.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Listen!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  USP  has  been  asked  to  look  into  our  serious  financial  concerns  which  every  Fijian 
<br/>taxpayer, parent and student has the right to have.  Instead of doing a simple and fair investigation, 
<br/>they are taking to the media along with Opposition politicians.  Is that what honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad wants - taxpayer dollars given without accountability?  That may be the way for PAP, NFP 
<br/>and  SODELPA  as  we  have  seen  many  times  before  and  how  Rabuka  had  run  the  NBF  into 
<br/>bankruptcy.  But those days are gone, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  NFP called this Budget a </span><span>saqamoli</span><span> budget.  Those are the words of someone 
<br/></span><span>privileged enough to visit Treasure Island, honourable Qereqeretabua.  For the everyday Fijian, this 
<br/></span><span>Budget  is  the relief  we  needed.   It  is  the FijiFirst  Government  that is  supporting female business 
<br/>leaders by subsidising loans for women-led businesses through FDB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- During the lockdown when many Fijian men had lost their jobs 
<br/>or were working on reduced hours, it was these women, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that became the much-
<br/>needed  providers  for  their  families  through  their  small  businesses.    Now,  it  is  time  for  those 
<br/>businesses to grow and their government has got their backs.  We want all our citizens to succeed 
<br/>and initiatives to support Fijian business owners such as this - show the world that we care about 
<br/>every Fijian no matter their background.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Budget on expanding the free Dental Practitioners (DP) and 
<br/>General Practitioners (GP) Scheme.  We have successfully beaten the COVID-19 pandemic under 
<br/>the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister.  Now, our Government has taken its approach to 
<br/>every Fijian’s health further by providing free medical services in partnership with private medical 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>practitioners.  We have raised the standard of health services accessible to low-income households.  
<br/>We have ensured that no one will be denied quality healthcare simply because they cannot afford it.  
<br/>We are committed to bettering the life of every Fijian.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  will  allocate  $7  million  to  provide  mechanised 
<br/>agricultural equipment to Fijian farmers.  As a farmer, I know first-hand how much this will truly 
<br/>help many farmers. Our farmers feed the nation and support like this comes at a time when we are 
<br/>ready to grow further.  We have already seen our farmers benefit from the many initiatives of this 
<br/>Government.  Last  year alone our Fijian agriculture sector grew by 8.1 percent and I hope Lynda 
<br/>Tabuya is watching this so that she can get her facts rights next time before misinforming our people 
<br/>about the agricultural industry.  With this new assistance to access better equipment, I know that our 
<br/>farmers will sleep easier, knowing that their Government is supporting them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am a proud Lauan woman, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I know how difficult it is to travel from one 
<br/>place to another when there are no reliable forms of transport available.  We are thankful to the SEA 
<br/>subsidy which has enabled many Fijians living in maritime areas to travel to school, be able to expand 
<br/>their  businesses  and  access  other  services.    But  I  am  more  grateful  that  in  this  Budget,  the  SEA 
<br/>subsidy is being expanded to Fijians living in the most isolated coastal areas of Viti Levu and Vanua 
<br/></span><span>Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA’s Viti Levu cross-country highway will connect Fijians throughout 
<br/>the most remote parts of Viti Levu to business hubs, like Nadi, Lautoka, Sigatoka and Ba.  Better 
<br/>road  infrastructure  means  that  more  homes  can  be  built  further  away  from  cities  and  Fijians 
<br/>throughout  the  nation  will  have  greater  ease  in  doing  business.    The  nation’s  social  fabric  and 
<br/>economy both depend on a modern transportation system.  More homes mean a better quality of life.  
<br/>A  better  quality  of  life  means  more  Fijians  will  have  the  ability  to  start  a  business  and  thrive.  
<br/>Suddenly,  the  value  of  land  in  the  interior  of  Viti  Levu  will  shoot  up.    This  project  will  bring 
<br/>opportunities for success to Fijians throughout the island and create greater access to markets for 
<br/>businesses. If a business in Rakiraki could reach 10,000 people before, it may be able to reach 20,000 
<br/>and more after this cross-country highway is completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a diverse and vibrant country with many talented people.  We have a 
<br/>growing arts industry and this Government is taking on the responsibility of ensuring that these talents 
<br/>are not wasted and given the recognition and support they deserve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with this responsibility, the Government has doubled tax deduction for hotels, restaurants 
<br/></span><span>and other similar businesses to hire local craftsmen, dances and musicians.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 300 percent 
<br/></span><span>is how much of a tax deduction a restaurant down the street or a hotel would get for hiring a singer or a 
<br/>local </span><span>meke</span><span> group to entertain their guests.  The entertainer benefits, the restaurant benefits and our people 
<br/>benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 1,000 homes in remote communities that do not have access to Energy Fiji 
<br/>Limited’s  main  grid  will  benefit  from  solar  home  systems.    That  is  why  I  say  that  this  Budget  is 
<br/>innovative.  Our Government has gone out of its way to ensure that every Fijian, no matter their education 
<br/>and skills, benefits from our Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  all  saw  for  ourselves  the  transparent  consultations  process  that  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy’s team undertook to ensure Fijians were heard 
<br/>in this Budget, while the Opposition have been hiding and holding secret meetings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the FijiFirst Government has been on the ground working hard to help our people, NFP 
<br/>and PAP have been trying to scare Fijians by  comparing  Fiji to Sri  Lanka.    But did  you know, Mr.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, we all know that, that is something that honourable Professor Prasad’s partner, through a 
<br/>signed MOU, has been advocating on </span><span>TikTok</span><span>.  I wonder why honourable Professor Prasad has not called 
<br/>Lynda Tabuya out or told her to stop that nonsense.  Maybe, Rabuka is the boss in that relationship.  
<br/>Perhaps, honourable Professor Prasad does not care about the economy and only wants so desperately to 
<br/>become a minister.  The funny thing is that, the policies of the PAP-NFP Alliance is what put our economy 
<br/>in danger, while they attack our policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an election year.  That means, many politicians will make false promises 
<br/>and do anything for a vote.  My plea to Fijians is to be smart - value actions over words.  Look at the 
<br/>progress you see around you.  Look at how far we have come and how easy it is for your children and 
<br/>grandchildren to get an education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  support  this  Budget,  as  presented  by  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for

<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  In  my  contribution  to  the  debate  on  the  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  as  a 
<br/>Christian, I wish to base my contribution in a </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse that has always challenged me. This is from the 
<br/>Book of James 2: 15-16, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. And someone says to 
<br/>him, ‘Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,’ but does nothing about his physical 
<br/>needs, what good is it?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can all relate to this, Mr. Speaker.  As individuals, many of us will give the shirt of our back 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to clothe someone or give food to the hungry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The challenge is more pronounced for us politicians and Parliamentarians, as our calling is on a 
<br/>national scale and we are charged to look after our people, or as we say in SODELPA, </span><span>lewenivanua.</span><span>  As 
<br/></span><span>some may put it, we do not leave anyone behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know of a woman who could no longer afford dialysis. When she went for the last time, there 
<br/>were tears from the staff members at the facility who knew she would not last and, indeed, she was gone 
<br/>shortly after.  We know of a young lady, educated through TELS who cannot find employment and unable 
<br/>to pay TELS and is now selling her body.  My grandchildren have a friend in primary school who is from 
<br/>a family of 16 living in one room. What can we do as leaders to ensure no one goes home to die because 
<br/>she could no longer afford dialysis, or that a young woman resorts to selling her body or that housing is 
<br/>so bad, families live in congested homes?  As the Bible admonishes us, we cannot say, “Go, I wish you 
<br/>well.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it all comes down to funding and we cannot continue to say that we do not have the 
<br/>funds. We can raise the funds, if we are smart with our taxation or rather, if we strictly align the funding 
<br/>of Government to the needs of our people. We are already doing that in some ways but not in a manner 
<br/>that places our people as paramount.  Put very simply, Mr. Speaker, our taxation is giving too much away 
<br/>to  businesses  and  short  changing  the  </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span>.    In  short,  there  is  too  much  favouritism.  Let  me 
<br/>highlight some examples, including the changes being proposed with the Income Tax Act and indirect 
<br/>tax measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one is concessionary rates of tax for regional or global headquarters.  This facility, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, was set up in 2013 to entice foreign companies to move their headquarters to Fiji.  Only one 
<br/>company has done that… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Two? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- …the ANZ Bank.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corporate tax was reduced to 17 percent and 150 percent tax deduction on capital items acquired 
<br/>for the relocation. The proposed change is to increase corporate tax to 20 percent, but says nothing in the 
<br/>150 percent tax deduction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, corporate tax was 28 percent in 2011 but reduced in 2012 to 20 percent for resident 
<br/>and non-resident companies - 17 percent for those moving their headquarters to Fiji and</span><span> </span><span>10 percent for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1526 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those listed in the South Pacific Stock Exchange (SPSE).  Sir, SODELPA proposes to take corporate tax 
<br/>back to 28 percent for resident companies and 33 percent for non-resident companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Comparing our rates, Mr. Speaker, in Papua New Guinea, the  corporate tax is 30 percent; in 
<br/>Samoa, it is 27 percent; in Sri Lanka, it is 24 percent; in Tonga, it is 25 percent; in Jamaica, it is 25 percent; 
<br/>in Australia, it is 30 percent; and in New Zealand, it is 28 percent.  The non-resident average corporate 
<br/>rate for the five developing countries is 31.6 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Including that, Mr. Speaker, tax collection on corporate tax with PAYE was $403,823,900.  By 
<br/>2018-2019, it was down to $121,771,500.  We do not have the breakdown between the Corporate Tax 
<br/>and PAYE but certainly an increase to Corporate Tax will increase the tax collected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is on the Corporate Tax Rate for the South Pacific Stock Exchange 
<br/>listed companies.  This was introduced in 2014 to reduce tax to 10 percent to incentivise more companies 
<br/>to list, but only four companies took the initiative during 2014 and 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To create a level playing field, Mr. Speaker, SODELPA will increase Corporate Tax to 28 percent 
<br/>for all listed companies.  Sir, SODELPA raises the question whether Capital Gains Tax exemptions and 
<br/></span><span>Income Tax exemptions will still apply for shareholders who trade in the SPSE?  They trade for gain and 
<br/></span><span>engage in schemes or arrangements. it derive huge profits from the disposal of their shares.  They are 
<br/>sources of revenue SODELPA will realise for the </span><span>lewenivanua.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third, Mr. Speaker, is the Electric Vehicle Charging Station Development Package.  This 
<br/>Income Tax concession was introduced in 2016 with a minimum investment of $3 million.  This was 
<br/>reduced to $500,000 in 2017-2018, reduced to $100,000 in 2018-2019 and now reduced to $50,000.  Sir, 
<br/>SODELPA asks the question, are there no takers?  This Income Tax concession can be open to abuse, 
<br/>especially by those companies with more than one income streams.  They can load this concession into 
<br/>one of their businesses of income stream and not pay tax.  Sir, SODELPA will not allow this to happen 
<br/>and will keep the minimum investment at a higher level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth, Mr. Speaker, is Non-Resident Withholding Tax refunds.  Sir, when you see this, it is 
<br/>an indication that Fiji was not upholding the Double Tax Agreement (DTA) in accordance with Section 
<br/>1409 of the Income Tax Act 2015.  What happens, Mr. Speaker, if you uphold the DTA of December 
<br/>2022? Sir, SODELPA knows that Fiji is not upholding the DTA when it comes to dividend distribution. 
<br/>The DTA provides Fiji the taxing rights to tax dividends paid to non-resident shareholders,  even though 
<br/>we have excluded the taxing right of dividend from our domestic law.  Sir, the DTA overrides domestic 
<br/></span><span>law and Fiji is letting go of revenue it should collect, SODELPA will rectify this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fifth, Mr. Speaker, is Special Capital Gains Tax on sales of shares.  Sir, SODELPA questions 
<br/>the difference between the resident person and a Fiji citizen.  The Fiji citizen is now part of this Act but 
<br/>in the Income Tax Act, it defines a person as an individual, company partnership, trust, Government 
<br/>political subdivision or a Government or international organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji citizen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not defined in the Income Tax Act.  A Fiji passport holder is 
<br/>treated as a Fiji citizen and if residing overseas and paying tax overseas, that citizen is also eligible for 
<br/>capital gains exemption and upon disposal of their shares, they will remit and declare the proceeds to the 
<br/>tax jurisdiction overseas and Fiji loses out on tax revenue it direly needs.  There are a number of scenarios, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, that can be developed and SODELPA will make sense of all these. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, SODELPA will ensure that we stay only with Fiji residents in the Act and do away 
<br/>with the provision on Fiji citizens.  It is very confusing and it can be subject to abuse.  A question that 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1527 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comes up is, how we treat shares and what type of assets are there in the Income Tax Act 2015?  Also, 
<br/>will Income Tax apply for the sale of shares acquired prior to May 2011? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capital  Gains,  in  general,  the  rate  today  when  disposing  capital  assets  is  10  percent.    This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>encourages lots of tax planning, while the Income Tax of 20 percent apply.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tax planning, Mr. Speaker, is that process that ensures all elements work together to allow you 
<br/>to pay the lowest tax possible.  Sir, SODELPA will increase the Capital Gains Tax of 28 percent similar 
<br/>to Corporate Tax to avoid tax planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sixth, Mr. Speaker, is VAT extension on disposal of residential dwellings.  In 2010, the VAT 
<br/>Act was amended that if you would to earn residential rent above $100,000, then you would be able to 
<br/>register for VAT, that is, to claim VAT on all your construction works and charge VAT on your rental.  
<br/>In  2020,  this  was  repealed  and  section  23(9)  was  introduced,  allowing  those  with  residential  flats  to 
<br/>deregister from VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, VAT works on a credit offset mechanism.  If you claim VAT on purchase of goods, 
<br/>you will declare VAT on sales of those goods.  Section 23(9) had allowed those who claimed VAT on 
<br/></span><span>their purchases not to declare sales on deregistration from VAT.  We are allowing those selling their 
<br/></span><span>properties,  even  though  they  had  claimed  VAT  on  purchases,  not  to  declare  sales  on  selling  their 
<br/>properties - those that built between 2010 and 2020 and claimed VAT returns.  One can only imagine the 
<br/>loss in Government revenue in that VAT refunds claimed as construction expenses and Government will 
<br/>not collect on deregistration or selling of properties.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA would repeal section 
<br/>23(9) and ensure the credit offset mechanism is maintained to protect revenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The seventh, Mr. Speaker, is VAT rate.  There are three VAT rates - zero for basic items and all 
<br/>exported goods, 15 percent for normal supply of goods and services and 9 percent for other goods and 
<br/>services.  These three rates, Mr. Speaker, brings about inconsistencies and difficulty in application in both 
<br/>taxpayers and FRCS alike.  Sir, SODELPA will have a single rate for VAT at 10 percent for normal 
<br/>supplies  of  goods  and  services  and  zero  percent  for  export  and  basic  items  stipulated  in  the  second 
<br/>schedule of the VAT Act. This fosters tax compliance, ease of facilitation by businesses, easier policing 
<br/>by FRCS and hence, increase in revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The eighth, Mr. Speaker, is dividend withholding tax.  Dividend withholding tax used to apply at 
<br/>9 percent to non-residents and 3 percent to residents. All these were repealed in 2017 and there is no 
<br/>longer  any  dividend  withholding  tax  in  Fiji.    In  2014-2015,  Government  collected  $71,$728,000  in 
<br/></span><span>dividend  tax.    In  2016-2017,  it  came  to  $120,038,000  tax.  Sir,  SODELPA  will  bring  back  dividend 
<br/></span><span>withholding tax for non-residents of Fiji.  When Fijians are crying out for help, we cannot be forgoing 
<br/>this revenue to please certain people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ninth, Mr. Speaker, is branch profit tax which was introduced in 2008 and known as branch 
<br/>profit remittance additional to normal tax.  The rate was 15 percent on branch profits remitted to overseas 
<br/>head office and we used to collect some $70 million to $80 million annually through this tax.  This was 
<br/>repealed in 2015 which was strange as we were taxing income derived in Fiji.  Sir, SODELPA will bring 
<br/>back the branch profit tax and will only be fair as we also intend to bring back non-resident withholding 
<br/>tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tenth, Mr. Speaker, is stamp duty.  The stamp duty, Mr. Speaker, was one of the oldest Acts 
<br/>in Fiji and goes back to the 1930s.  It was repealed in 2020.  In 2018-2019, it fetched the Government 
<br/>$85,170,000.  In 2019, it brought in $66,323,000. Sir, SODELPA will reintroduce the Stamp Duty Act. 
<br/>We cannot be deaf to the cry of our </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span>, claiming there is no money when we abolish sources 
<br/>of revenue such as stamp duty.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just wondering, Mr. Speaker, when this proposal came up from the leadership in FijiFirst, did 
<br/>the people say, “Look, we are going to be losing $80 million, do not do it.  We are going to lose $120 
<br/>million, do not do it”?  I am just amazed that no one spoke up when this kind of revenue was being lost 
<br/>in Fiji because of an ill-thought tax proposal. They need to speak up, Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  some  tax  policies  that  need  to  be  gazetted.  The  Non-resident 
<br/>International Shipping Income Act was legislated in 2016, yet today it is still on the shelf and yet to be 
<br/>activated.  For six years, we are not realising income on this taxation that was legislated.  There is a 
<br/>presumptive income tax legislated in 2016 also sitting on the shelf, not being activated.  We are losing 
<br/>revenue because we are not activating this.  The mining entities, Part 6 of the Income Tax Act, 2015 is 
<br/>specifically for mining operations.  Implementation of Part 6 can create revenue as it cuts out leakages in 
<br/>the tax revenue, but it needs to be activated; sitting on the shelf, legislated.  Hello FijiFirst, are you awake 
<br/>here?  Why are we not activating these sources of revenue?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are tax revenues to be legislated, the VAT re-write.  Professor Lee Burns 
<br/>is reviewing this Act which is currently in its seventh draft.  He is an Australian and has identified best 
<br/>practices across countries which would minimise VAT refunds and increase VAT revenue.  Two areas 
<br/>that are so potential that supply of remote services through an electronic market places in the likes of 
<br/></span><span>Netflix, Alibaba,</span><span> </span><span>Amazon</span><span>, et cetera.  Imagine that we can tax these people for the content we view in this 
<br/></span><span>country and this is happening globally, and we need to work on it and move very quickly.  Please do not 
<br/>put it on the shelf, FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Creditable  acquisitions  which  stipulate  the  tax  credit  can  only  apply  to  what  is  acquired  as  
<br/>consistent with the tax activity of the person.  Both have potential for government revenue and SODELPA 
<br/>will have them legislated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On zero rating, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the VAT re-write has also been revised and this allowed a lot of 
<br/>services related to export of goods; this will minimise VAT refunds and increase revenue.  They are some 
<br/>tax policies that need to be abolished.  One is debt forgiven, multinational and business tycoons who lend 
<br/>money to their businesses here and claim tax on it.  They use to pay tax on it but it was repealed in 2020 
<br/>and again it is money down the drain for the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is the VAT refund for film production companies.  Section 70(c) was implemented 
<br/>in the Act in 2016, entitling film production companies to claim refunds on its qualifying expenditure 
<br/>under Income Tax Regulation.  It will not declare income but will be entitled to claim VAT on all the 
<br/>expenses  borne  in  Fiji.    Consequently,  film  production  companies  have  received  huge  refunds.  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, SODELPA believes that income tax rebates offered to these film making companies is 
<br/></span><span>sufficient and section 70(c) should be removed from the VAT Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some tax policies to be reviewed.  One is the ring-fencing on salary income.  This 
<br/>provision was part of the COVID-19 recovery where someone paying PAYE could take in his losses 
<br/>from other business to reduce his tax.  I think COVID-19 has gone, it should go back to this and ring-
<br/>fence the salaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The domestic mission fund VAT refund.  I know that in this Parliament we have people who have 
<br/>served  in  the  diplomatic  corps  overseas,  but  in  Fiji,  people  in  diplomatic  missions  or  international 
<br/>organisations, whatever they buy here is VAT refundable - personal or for the organisation.  We must be 
<br/>the only country that is doing this because our people overseas do not benefit from this.  Of course, we 
<br/>also look at the Tax Refund Scheme for tourists, because we believe that Fiji is attractive enough, we do 
<br/>not need this incentive in shopping.  We also review all the tax incentives and tax holidays, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, to see whether we are really helping the economy.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1529 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SODELPA  will  introduce  a  new  resource  tax  regime  to  benefit  the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> to include upgrading of the villages and settlements in the urban areas.  It will be collected from 
<br/>industries that affect the environment and the resources of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  These industries are logging, 
<br/>fishing, petroleum, mining, water industry, tourism, airline, Water Authority of Fiji, Energy Fiji Limited 
<br/>and others we may identify, going forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on STT, the rate was 6 percent on gross earnings. On ECAL, the rate was 10 
<br/>percent on gross earnings - both have been repealed.  The resource tax by SODELPA will be on 5  percent 
<br/>of the gross earnings of the industries named above. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, SODELPA hears the cry of the people (the </span><span>lewenivanua</span><span>) and 
<br/>they are desperate for too long and you have been saying there is no money.  This is not true, there is 
<br/>money.  If we have the will to collect what is due to government to deliver for the people - SODELPA 
<br/>has the  will to  collect the required revenue  as allowed by  law  and meet the cry  of the  </span><span>lewenivanua.  
<br/></span><span>Government is not committed to making these collections and many will be left behind.  This Budget, in 
<br/>many ways, falls short and I therefore do not support this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me the opportunity to contribute to 
<br/></span><span>the debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill as presented to Parliament by the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>for Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  alluded  to  in  the  honourable  Minister’s  Address,  Suva  was  certainly  buzzing  as  the  51</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>Meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders took place earlier in the week of the Budget Address on 
<br/>11</span><span>th</span><span> to 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022.  It was the first face to face meeting since 2019 with Fiji playing host as Chair of 
<br/>the Pacific Islands Forum in the past year.  Visitor arrivals would have spiked with the attendance of 
<br/>member country delegations, various regional organisations, multilateral organisations, observers, private 
<br/>sector and civil society representatives.  Unfortunately, the convergence in Suva created a super spreader 
<br/>event for COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is noted from the foreign meeting communiqué, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the leaders adopted the 2050 
<br/>strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent as the overarching blueprint to advance Pacific regionalism for 
<br/>the next three decades, articulating the Region’s long term vision, values, key thematic areas and pathway 
<br/>strategies.  The communiqué also spelt out priority areas one being education and  I quote - “leaders 
<br/>recognise the need for increased investment in their people with a specific emphasis on education”.  It is 
<br/>there Mr. Speaker, Sir, that our honourable Prime Minister is put in a precarious position of being chair 
<br/>of this premier Pacific regional body while his Government, through the insistence of the Minister for 
<br/></span><span>Economy, defaults on his payment to USP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also tragic Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is no allocation to USP in this 2022-2023 Budget 
<br/>Estimates.  Pacific regionalism is important to Fiji’s leadership role in the Pacific and those at the helm 
<br/>of the  Government must  not  ignore it, and for this,  I  wish to  express my  disappointment  as shadow 
<br/>Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Opposition Members of Parliament were not invited to engage and attend 
<br/>any official events.  But this is typical of a government that has no respect for Parliamentary democracy 
<br/>and the legitimate constitutional role of the Opposition Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific Island Countries under the umbrella of the Pacific Islands Forum are 
<br/>entering a challenging time through their unity and relationship.  Their  Blue  Ocean  is  attracting  the 
<br/>attention and the envy of some rich and powerful countries in the world and are vying for support 
<br/>from foreign member countries.  Sir, the unity of the Forum-member countries are now under threat.  
<br/>Pacific countries can only guarantee the safety and security of their people when they stand together 
<br/>in unity and solidarity.  Fiji should take the lead role, rallying the Pacific Island countries together.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The area of international relations is not unfamiliar to you, Sir.  Fiji derives a lot of benefit 
<br/>from the diplomatic ties to other nations and organisations.  We need to nurture these ties, however, 
<br/>it is important that Fiji reviews her relationship with a nation and organisation from time to time in 
<br/>light of new developments around the world.  We are certainly disadvantaged because of our size, 
<br/>economic strength and location.  We should hold ourselves high on the basis of equality and should 
<br/>not accept pressure from nations of economic and military might to impose their will on us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji knows friends who have stood with us in conflict situations and in good times.  They have 
<br/>been with us for years and never deserted us.  They never came to take away things from us but to 
<br/>give us assistance with no strings attached.  The geo-politics of our region is not to be underestimated.  
<br/>The US-China rivalry for supremacy being played out in the region calls for a review of our foreign 
<br/>relations and to be wary of the cheque book diplomacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year in my budget response to the 2021-2022 Estimates, I described it 
<br/>as a sugar-coated, debt-funded budget as the nation was gripped with the second wave of the delta 
<br/>virus and rising death toll. Despite the outright denial of the honourable Minister for Economy in his 
<br/>Budget Address that this is not an election budget, I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This is not a crisis budget, Sir. It is a confidence budget because that is what Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs at this moment, neither is it an election budget.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the final budget ahead of a forthcoming election, so it is an election 
<br/>budget.  It is not rocket science but then the honourable Minister for Economy is the master of sweet 
<br/>talk.    In  fact,  I  went  back  to  the  Minister’s  2018/2019  Budget  Address  and  guess  what  –  all  the 
<br/>sweetness that are hallmark of an election budget are back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before the 2018 Elections, all children born in a family earning $30,000 a year or less were 
<br/>given $1,000.  Now, before the 2022 Elections, he is giving families with $50,000 per annum or less, 
<br/>$1 per day per child from newborns to Year 13 - $180 for six months per child.  Is he encouraging 
<br/>another baby boom?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This time he goes further.  This is extended to social welfare recipients, pensioners, aftercare 
<br/>beneficiaries, all will be receiving $180 over the next six months.  All tertiary school students will 
<br/>also receive a miserable $180 pay-out over six months.  The question is, why only six months?  There 
<br/>is some reference in the Budget Address, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This will be assessed in December based on where food price stands and that time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as we expect prices to stabilise and even decrease within a year.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it is not rocket science.  By December we have an election, of course, 
<br/>if the economy outlook worsens, all these will stop.  In foreign aid, there is a term referred to  as 
<br/>“boomerang  aid”.    This  refers  to  the  idea  that  aid  benefits  the  aid  donor  more  than  the  recipient 
<br/>country.    Apply  to  this  situation,  the  $180  handout  is  boomerang  assistance,  tantamount  to  vote 
<br/>FijiFirst  back  into  power  rather  than  improve  the  situation  for  families,  pensioners,  low  income 
<br/>students  and the poor.  Handouts perpetuates dependency.  These handouts  which do not address 
<br/>structural deep-seated poverty, crime, health, hunger do not get people out of poverty but rather keep 
<br/>people in poverty and dependent of Government handouts.  This is “dependency boom”.

<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is your alternative budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy says that the boom 
<br/>is back and insist on a Bula Boom.  Recovering barely half of the projected visitor arrivals of 500,000 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this year compared with 2019 arrivals of 900,000 is not a boom.   The post pandemic recovery is 
<br/>extremely tentative, this is an explosion of fresh cases in principle tourism source markets.  Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand offer a much more virulent COVID-19 variant  BA.5 that is leading to increase 
<br/>people admitted to hospitals and  growing concern for  governments.    It  is reported that this latest 
<br/>Omicron sub-variant is able to evade previous immunity from COVID-19 and vaccination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  heard  it  all  before,  “Boom,  boom,  kaboom”.    Previously,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy was boasting of nine straight years of growth of prosperity that 
<br/>they were proudly calling the “Bainimarama Boom”.  I quote from one of the honourable Minister’s 
<br/>reported statements: “Fiji has experienced strong encoded growth for the nine consecutive years and 
<br/>on track for a decade of positive economic growth, the Bainimarama boom”. That all went kaboom 
<br/>with the COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  reported  that  Fiji’s  growth  rate  from  2010  to  2019 
<br/>averaged 3.3 percent.  The economy contracted by 0.4 percent in 2019 before plunging by 19 percent 
<br/>in  2021.  Sir, ADB forecasted a contraction of 5 percent  in  2021, interestingly the economic and 
<br/>fiscal update supplement to the 2022-2023 Budget Address confirms the decline of 0.6 percent in 
<br/>2019.  The severe contraction of 17.2 percent in 2022 estimated a decline of 4.1 percent in 2021.  The 
<br/></span><span>fact of the matter is that ADB analysis and forecast can be trusted.  So what does ADB say about 
<br/></span><span>2022?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  what  ADB  reports,  a  rebound  could  occur  in  2022  and  2023.  
<br/>Contingent on resumption in tourism, even if a recovery does start in the coming one to two years, 
<br/>the debt of Fiji’s depression means that it will take many years to return to pre-pandemic income 
<br/>levels.  So, here again, we see that the honourable Minister’s prediction of 12.4 percent projected in 
<br/>2022 is all sweet talk.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No it is not, it is a fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  JALE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  strange  that  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy did not say anything or did not say much about FNPF in his Budget Address when FNPF 
<br/>has featured extensively in the last three Estimates.  The people of Fiji deserve an explanation from 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Economy who is responsible for FNPF on the decision to convert the Fiji 
<br/>Airways  Limited loan from  FNPF to  equity or shares.  It  means that the  FNPF monies have been 
<br/>invested in a company that is in dire financial situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investment policy of FNPF appears to have been compromised by the Board of Directors 
<br/></span><span>obviously through the pressure from the Government of the day. Mr. Speaker, Sir, from recollection, 
<br/>FNPF can only invest in a company that has proven to have made profit in the last four years.  The 
<br/>FNPF has been used by this Government as a cash cow for too long.  The primary intent of FNPF to 
<br/>provide retirement benefit to members have been sidelined. We need to bring back the membership 
<br/>of FNPF Board to its original tri-partisan structure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNPF funds are contributed too by the workers and employers and they should rightly 
<br/>be represented in the FNPF Board, safeguard their interest and rights.  It has been proven in the past, 
<br/>in the cases of two Provident Funds in neighbouring countries, the main cause of their collapsed was 
<br/>government interference. I call on the new government in Fiji to immediately institute an enquiry 
<br/>into the affairs of FNPF from 2006 to now.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, here again, the Government is trying to poke its nose into 
<br/>the affairs of Airports Fiji Limited (AFL) which has been handling the affairs of airports in Fiji.  It 
<br/>is a smack in the face of the management of AFL and its employees. The Government in what it is 
<br/>proposing to do is saying that the AFL and its employees lack the expertise and skills to manage our 
<br/>airports and trust the Fiji Airways more to look after our airports.  Why cannot AFL conduct a reform 
<br/>on its operation if that is needed? Bringing in the management of Fiji Airways who have shown a 
<br/>lack of professionalism and expertise to run a profitable national airline defies logic and rationale. 
<br/>My advice to the honourable Minister for Economy to leave AFL alone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2019-2020 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) confirms 
<br/>once again that the Eastern Division has the highest rate of poverty amongst the four Divisions in 
<br/>Fiji.  Given this situation, what is in the Budget to address the problem and give the Eastern Division 
<br/>special consideration?  The Division consists of three maritime Provinces and Rotuma. To worsen 
<br/>this  poverty  stricken  situation,  already  shipping  services  to  the  maritime  Provinces  have  been 
<br/>disrupted. The efforts to bring about safe, reliable and affordable shipping services to the maritime 
<br/>Provinces have been thwarted by runaway inflation and rise in fuel cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rural to urban drift is a common concern for the Eastern Division. Villages are now empty 
<br/></span><span>of  people  who  have  left  for  urban  centres  in  search  of  a  better  life.    Economic  activities  are  not 
<br/></span><span>available to them.  Why has the Government failed to address the problem? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  are  some  of  the  immediate  assistances  that  the  Government  can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implement to assist Fijians in the Eastern Division: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has to subsidise the boat and air fares up to 50 percent of the fares;  
<br/>Government has to subsidise up to 50 percent freight for the first 20 kilograms of cargo for 
<br/>passengers from the islands to Suva; 
<br/>Government to pay $500 per year Hardship Allowance to each Fijian living permanently 
<br/>in the Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will repeat my sentiments in the last Budget which is that 
<br/>the new Government replacing the Fiji Government will be so disgusted and overwhelmed by the 
<br/>state of indebtedness that the Government has got itself into.  The ADB confirms that we, even before 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic, Fiji public debt to GDP ratio was higher than Small Island Developing States 
<br/>(SIDS) and has been steadily rising from 43 percent in 2014 to a forecast of 89.4 percent at the end 
<br/>of July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these boastings about unprecedented growth is really a 
<br/>camouflage  the  fact  that  the  FijiFirst  Government  cannot  be  trusted  to  manage  the  economy 
<br/>sustainably and any means of clarification of Fiji’s Government, Moody’s and S&amp;P Global rating, 
<br/>recent downgrade of Fiji’s long term sovereign credit rating and International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
<br/>view of rising risk of debt distress ring alarm bells. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government cannot be given another Budget to manage nor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can they be trusted with the welfare and the future of the people of Fiji.  It is time for a change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND.-  The honourable Speaker of Parliament,  the  honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen; good afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a contribution in response to the National Budget 2022-
<br/></span><span>2023 as presented to this august Parliament on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 by the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Minister for Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  extend  my  sincere  thank  you  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and his hardworking team at the Ministry of Economy 
<br/>for  presenting  such  a  thoughtful  Budget:  a  Budget  which  has  been  developed  through  broad 
<br/>consultations which included the  youths of this country; the next  generation of leaders as well as 
<br/>rural and urban communities, government agencies, the private sector and without also overlooking 
<br/>communities which are in remote areas of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The broad consultation  is  an indication of this  Government  enduring  concern of all in  the 
<br/>plight of each and every citizen.  It is abundantly clear in the details of the Budget and as has been 
<br/>presented that the needs of all, including especially the vulnerable categories of the population have 
<br/>been identified and strategies for our appropriate and effective responses provided.  It is certainly 
<br/>impossible  to  address  each  and  every  individual’s  need  by  providing  cash  grants  over  time.  
<br/>Nevertheless, this Budget has taken into consideration the specific areas of urgent and basic needs of 
<br/>those most vulnerable with provisions for the immediate support while the economy as a whole take 
<br/>time to recover.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenging contexts and circumstances of this recovery within which 
<br/></span><span>the 2022-2023 Budget has been developed is now common knowledge but it is worth a reminder to 
<br/>underline  the  difficulties  ahead.    A  devastating  combination  of  the  global  pandemic  COVID-19, 
<br/>effects of climate change, contraction of critical supply lines by an unexpected war and unfinished 
<br/>recovery  from  recent  hurricanes  cannot  but  create  a  disaster  risk  situation  for  any  economy  and 
<br/>society and not the least, Fiji as a Small Island Developing State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many countries continue to struggle with the devastation caused by COVID-19 pandemic and 
<br/>indeed still do after a long period some over two to three years and are still continuing to see the 
<br/>impact. But in Fiji, we have been steadfast and robust with our responses.  Thanks to the able and 
<br/>decisive  leadership,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  our  Prime  Minister.  This  astute  and  forward-looking 
<br/>leadership has obviously shorten the period of darkness and gloomy days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, on hindsight, the decisions taken have to be applauded like those to have lockdowns, 
<br/>curfews,  border  closures  and  more  importantly,  to  expeditiously  vaccinate  the  entire  population 
<br/>including even compulsory vaccination rules for our civil servants and employees to return to work 
<br/>now seem appropriate and commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the full recovery of our economy will not take only days but years and that 
<br/></span><span>too with full support of our people, every sector of Government, private sector, non-governmental 
<br/>organisations and the entire communities will be achieved with the same strength and vision of our 
<br/>leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2022-2023  Budget  has  taken  some  bold  and  positive  steps,  steps  to 
<br/>support our private sector, including these small and medium enterprises. The significant role in the 
<br/>economy and the recovery has been well acknowledged, cognition of the role budget has done this 
<br/>without increasing any taxes that were announced but rather provided several incentives to assist and 
<br/>enhance the full participation in the road to recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very encouraging to see many employees that were redundant during COVID-19 period 
<br/>are now able to once again get their job back and support their families.  This is very clearly evidenced 
<br/>in the tourism sector as we can now see that many hotels that were closed for long periods are now 
<br/>opening up for businesses.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at individual and family level, the 2022-2023 Budget has provided support 
<br/>for families with children with cash grants to buy them basic food items and other amenities.  This 
<br/>will help families to alleviate the rising cost and inflation due to price increases of several food items 
<br/>that are beyond the control of Government.  The cash grant is also provided to students in secondary 
<br/>and tertiary institutions and will supplement other subsidies such as bus fare, text books and school 
<br/>fees.  These are all indicators of Government’s concern with people’s wellbeing and welfare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget has not forgotten our elderly population in need, with 
<br/>sometimes chronic ailment, people with disabilities and recipients of welfare assistance.  The increase 
<br/>of $38 monthly subsidy in addition to their current monthly welfare allowances would enable them 
<br/>to cushion the short due to rising cost of daily needs to some degree.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Despite the substantial decrease in Government’s revenue, there have been no cuts in key 
<br/>allocations.    This  means  that  the  essential  services  such  as  health,  education,  housing,  water  and 
<br/>electricity, transport and shipping to rural areas will continue to be provided.  In fact, in some areas 
<br/>such  as  health,  the  budget  has  gone  a  long  way  to  make  sure  that  the  health  services  are  easily 
<br/>accessible and affordable to the people in most need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This inclusion of additional General Practitioners to provide primary care at grassroots level 
<br/></span><span>will  help  people  to  access  healthcare  services  without  waiting  for  long  periods  at  public  health 
<br/>facilities.  These services will not only cover consultation but diagnostic tests and emergency supply 
<br/>of medicines too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023 National Budget is people-centred with a long term vision 
<br/>as shown in the impressive work in infrastructure and key capital projects that are well-reflected in 
<br/>the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I once again thank the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership in steering 
<br/>the country forward in the most difficult and challenging times in our history and also the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and his team in presenting the people-centred Budget for 2022-2023.  I also thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to respond to the Budget. I fully support the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of this Parliament and our fellow Fijians listening in 
<br/>from all over the world and in Fiji; I want to say, </span><span>cola vina</span><span> to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I deliberate on the Budget Estimates before Parliament, allow me to make some very 
<br/></span><span>generic  observations  on  the  Budget  presentation.    It  is  another  grandstanding  lecture  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Economy  about  social  protection  and  economic  recovery,  but  the  fact 
<br/>remains that his well-articulated presentation make a ‘look good budget’ in theory, but in reality, it 
<br/>is very deceptive.  It is irresponsible and lacks the direction, yet again failed to allocate resources to 
<br/>the critical sectors of the economy, especially in agriculture, forestry, fishing and health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Budget is a clear indication of the Government desperation to remain in power despite 
<br/>the fact that they are no longer wanted by the people because of their poor leadership for the past 16 
<br/>years.    Therefore,  this  Budget  is  not  different  from  all  other  previous  budgets  presented  in  this 
<br/>Parliament during this Government’s 16 years of dictatorship rule that they are being designed based 
<br/>on lies, dishonesty, misinformation, manipulation and distortion of information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is irresponsible and outrageous for the Minister for Economy to claim in his presentation 
<br/>the smiles on the children’s faces for every Fiji Airways plane that took off, meaning that everything is 
<br/>back to normal.  I wonder if this statement holds any truth considering the hardship everyone is facing 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>today, especially the children of the 800 Fiji Airways staff that were unfairly terminated during the crisis 
<br/>that were not even given a chance to re-employ when things go back to normal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Has he realised the hurt, the frustration and hardship of thousands of children from poor families 
<br/>that hardly have a decent meal a day; while some go without a lunch to school.  What about the hurt and 
<br/>feeling of neglect by the school children who are victims of your poor e-ticketing systems and are made 
<br/>to walk for miles to schools while others have chosen to miss school altogether?  Has he considered the 
<br/>plight of the thousands of University of the South Pacific students who suffered and has an uncertain 
<br/>future, due to the non-payment of this Government’s contribution of $68 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  doubt that any school children is smiling today because everyone is facing 
<br/>hardship due to this Government’s mismanagement.  Let us look at our debt.  Sir, our debt balance to 
<br/>GDP is at an unprecedented level at 90 percent and to include the Contingent Liabilities we are hitting 
<br/>more  than  100  percent.    Is  that  the  boom?    Yes,  a  boom  of  uncontrolled  and  unsustainable  debt 
<br/>management to a country of our size. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following economic indications prove that there was no boom, the poverty is hovering around 
<br/>40 percent and another 20 percent are facing difficulties.  Unemployment is high, our GDP per capita 
<br/></span><span>income has declined from 12,000 in 2018 to 9,900 in 2020.  Our total debt exposed is 102.2 percent, our 
<br/></span><span>debt to GDP ratio is 90 percent against a benchmark for developing countries of 40 percent.  Is this the 
<br/>nine years of sustained economic growth as continued to be repeatedly claimed by this government?  You 
<br/>be the judge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, or is it too hard for the honourable Minister for Economy just to speak the truth that we are 
<br/>currently in a very tight fiscal space and the very debt burden has continued to rise due to their poor 
<br/>governance, bias policies, selective justice system,  compromised  government institutions and  lack of 
<br/>internal control and standard procedures. It is unfortunate that again in his key message, he again repeated 
<br/>the lies, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Tonight,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  proud  to  report  that  recovery  is  underway.    All 
<br/>preliminary  debtor and partial indicators show that the economy is on track to record  the 
<br/>highest growth created in Fiji’s history of 12.4 percent.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a lie.  The only highest growth rate recorded from 1971 to 1975 was at 7.5 percent.  From 
<br/>1986 to 1990, it was only four percent.  From 2011 to 2015, it was 3.2 percent.  So, how can also this be 
<br/>possible?  When we know that the global economy is on crisis due to the war in Ukraine and the volatility 
<br/></span><span>of the international trade environment.  Even the International Monetary Fund, Sir, has projected that the 
<br/></span><span>economic growth for 2022 will slow significantly at 3.6 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the war has further exacerbated supply and demand disparities, we sanctioned trade and 
<br/>embedded shipping routes affecting global supplies of essential commodities.  Is the projected goal true?  
<br/>No,  yet on 6</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, this government paper the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> printed an article – “Food Prices Drop 
<br/>Expected as claimed by the Minister for Economy since freight cost will drop”.  Do you agree?  This is 
<br/>another calculated lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, it is unfortunate that the Minister for Economy only talks about the benefits of concessionary 
<br/>loans, interest-free loans.  He never talked about the risk associated with all these borrowings. We should 
<br/>understand that as national debt per capita increases, there is a strong possibility of default payments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Our debt obligation increases and Fiji will lose its social, economic and 
<br/>political power which will become a national security issue as experienced in Sri Lanka.  Increase in debt 
<br/>reduces the amount of tax revenue available to be spent on other government services because the first 
<br/>call on any government revenue is payment of the loan principal and interest.  That means poor standard 
<br/>of living as we are experiencing today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Minister for Economy should not be grandstanding about these concessionary loans.  He 
<br/>must understand that there is no such loan as smart loan or prudent borrowing.  A loan is a loan and it has 
<br/>to be repaid at a certain time.  My understanding, Sir, that we have been given concessionary loans by 
<br/>World  Bank,  ADB  and  other  financial  institutions  not  because  we  are  using  our  common-sense, 
<br/>responsible and discipline to our borrowing strategy as claimed by the Minister.  No!  We are given 
<br/>special loan condition because we are poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Nai!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Full stop.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- You are unable to manage our economy and we have no money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you can remember, Sir, last year, we all know that Australia and New Zealand gave us direct 
<br/>budget support totalling $120 million.  We are given this assistance because we are poor.  Full stop.  
<br/>Because we are poor.  It is not that we are good at our financial management. No, because we are poor 
<br/>and that is the responsibility of wealthy nations to look after their neighbours.  This is also applies to all 
<br/>the poor countries around the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to understand whether it is the responsibility of this world finances to ensure that all 
<br/>poor countries remain afloat and there are conditions attached.  Just like borrowing from the FDB, ANZ, 
<br/>and Westpac.  If you have been a customer with a bank and in this case where previous governments but 
<br/>we have debt due to some mismanagement and factors beyond your control, that is this Government, the 
<br/>bank will give you special conditions like low interest, extended grace period, extended terms to keep 
<br/>you afloat.  The same principle applies to this government borrowing, therefore nothing is prudent or 
<br/>smart borrowing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our economic problems are further aggravated by the fact that we borrow for consumption and 
<br/></span><span>not for investment like previous governments did.  Therefore, we will continue to borrow because revenue 
<br/></span><span>is not being generated from this loan to service the debt.  Sir, a good example is the $60 million of what 
<br/>he called “Inflation Mitigation Package”.  Sir, I do not agree that this is an Inflation Mitigation Package.  
<br/>It is a direct funds assistance just to buy votes.  The word “mitigation” is wrong.  I challenge him to prove 
<br/>how it will mitigate inflation.  How will it work?  This $60 million will only benefit the rich people such 
<br/>as bus companies, supermarkets, hardware companies, Vodafone, Digicel, …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Tell them! </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- …the service they are going to provide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- But they are still providing it now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes, they are going to provide.  All this money will go to them.  This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>money will only be spent in one day for every family.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1537 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-</span><span> Oilei!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- The bottom line is that, the poor will get poorer and the rich get richer.  
<br/>If they would have some sense, unfortunately they do not, this $60 million would have been better utilised 
<br/>for the construction of supporting infrastructure that is in my view, will mitigate inflation and support 
<br/>economic growth such as roads, jetties, look at all the jetties in the maritime islands.  How many jetties 
<br/>need to be repaired?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The improvement of hospitals, look at Navosa Hospital, it is still not fully operational until today.  
<br/>Pregnant  women  from  Navosa  have  to  come  all  the  way  from  Korolevu,  from  Noikoro  to  Sigatoka 
<br/>Hospital.    Look  at  Navua  Hospital,  it  still  not  fully  operational  today.  Women  have  to  travel  from 
<br/>Navutulevu  Village,  Naboutini,  Namaqumaqua  up  to  Serua  all  the  way  to  Suva.  They  just  need  to 
<br/>improve the facilities, and that will mitigate inflation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They need to establish collection centres in provinces for isolated farmers - cold storage facilities 
<br/>for farmers in rural areas.  Developed towns in remote areas such as Navatumali in Navosa, Vunidawa in 
<br/>Naitasiri, Vanuabalavu in Lau, Nabouwalu in Bua and, of course, not forgetting Vunisea in Kadavu. All 
<br/>these should be towns already.  This is my view will mitigate inflation provided sustain economic growth 
<br/></span><span>and improve living standard instead of freebies that will only create that dependency culture and enhance 
<br/></span><span>poverty.   What will you do to pay off this $60 million loan? We will have to loan again to pay off the 
<br/>loan and that is what is happening today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do you agree that the Honourable Minister for Economy has claimed that every dollar borrowed 
<br/>is used wisely? Mr. Speaker, I was surprised, as the Honourable Minister for Economy in his Budget 
<br/>Address  mentioned  that  why  we  did  not  condemn  two  Opposition  Members  who  broke  the  law  by 
<br/>obtaining  financial  advantage  through  fraudulent  conduct.  We  did  not  because  we  believe  that  the 
<br/>juridical system is not independent and fair and a very selective in the enforcement of the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  appears  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  is  suffering  from  the  disease  called 
<br/>“dementia”.    It  is  the  disability  of  the  brain  that  caused  memory  loss  and  confusion.    He  failed  to 
<br/>remember that there are many other serious crime of corruption committed by this Government and their 
<br/>cronies that has never faced justice today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What about the former Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) CEO, Mr. Mohammed Khan?  He is still 
<br/>under Police investigation.  The Veronica Malani case.  I stood  several times in this House to tell him to 
<br/>step down and step out because he has been alleged to have  created the bomb and exploded the bomb, 
<br/></span><span>detonated the bomb and yet he still sitting here today. What about the unfinished project, as mentioned 
<br/></span><span>by the Honourable Leader of the Opposition?  What about using FNPF to buy 30 percent of the shares in 
<br/>Fiji  Airways  without  consulting  the  owners  of  the  fund?  What  about  the  appointment  of  Board  of 
<br/>Membership? Some of these members represent two, three and four boards, isn’t that corruption?  Sir, I 
<br/>do not have time to list them all but all I can say is that they have the most corrupted Government in the 
<br/>history of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at the sugar industry, Mr. Speaker.  We all know that the sugar industry is on the brink 
<br/>of collapse and it is technically insolvent due to the mismanagement, lack of monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>over the last decade.  In the Budget, the Honourable Minister for Economy has confirmed that sufficient 
<br/>funds  have  been  allocated  to  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  to  ensure  that  guaranteed  cane  price  of  $85  will 
<br/>continue in this  financial  year.  Sir, this is  absurd  knowing that the cost  of  production has  increased 
<br/>significantly due to inflation and why this still remaining at $85. This rate is no longer feasible.  Recently, 
<br/>we saw in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> on 4</span><span>th</span><span> July the state of loans amounting to $550,000 for 600 sugarcane farmers 
<br/>in the North.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- That is the most reliable newspaper.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What does that tell you? Because sugarcane farming is not feasible anymore and yet they are 
<br/>going to use another $85, put it to $100 or $120.  What are they talking about?  Is this the reflection of 
<br/>the nine years sustained economic growth?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at agriculture.  Mr. Speaker, we have already said how many times in this House that 
<br/>our economy-base is too narrow, we rely too much on tourism.  We have been saying in this Parliament 
<br/>that our economic vulnerability was basically due to our narrow economic base, due to over-reliance on 
<br/>tourism.  We desperately need to expand the agriculture to broaden our economic base to give us that 
<br/>fiscal space to be able to absorb external economic shock, but unfortunately, this is not reflected in this 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy has claimed that our Fiji farms have never 
<br/>been as productive as of today - that is not the fact; that is a lie!  Our milk production is still around 2 
<br/>litres per cow per day against the projected yield of 7 litres to 8 litres per day.  We are still importing 
<br/></span><span>enormous amounts of beef since we do not have enough supply.  The Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) 
<br/></span><span>has been operating under capacity for the last decade due to insufficient supply of cattle.  Our average 
<br/>rice yield is around 2 tonnes to 3 tonnes per hectare against the 8 tonnes per hectare for recommended 
<br/>varieties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the overall agriculture production has increased as claimed by the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Economy,  this  is  very  insignificant  compared  to  the  enormous  amount  of 
<br/>Government intervention through budget allocations and programmes.  These are some of my areas of 
<br/>concern that do not reflect the claim by the honourable Minister for Economy about agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Beef Extension Programme has been reduced from $200,000 to $100,000.  This is absurd, 
<br/>the reduction in the Budget will also force the Yalavou Beef Scheme not to see the light of the day.  This 
<br/>is against the Ministry’s five year Strategic Plan that Yalavou Beef Scheme will push production by 10 
<br/>percent.  How is that possible without Yalavou Beef Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is quite surprising that the Sigatoka Valley Farming Programme has not been 
<br/>included in the Budget.  I wonder why?  And was the honourable Minister for Economy aware of this?   
<br/>The Cold Storage facilities to be constructed at Kavanagasau on the east bank of Sigatoka River to help 
<br/></span><span>more  than  900  isolated  farmers,  no  longer  exists  in  the  Budget.    Why?    Why  has  the  province  of 
<br/></span><span>Nadroga/Navosa been punished?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to our records, the Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/>has not been able to fully utilise its budget since 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I do not support this Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament; I rise this afternoon to 
<br/>contribute my wholehearted support to the 2022-2023 Budget.  Greetings and a very good afternoon to 
<br/>my fellow Fijians present here today, at home and those listening via other medium. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Nadi Rugby team for its hard fought battle against Suva 
<br/>and winning the semi-finals of the Skipper Cup; I know that the trophy will be travelling to the West this 
<br/>weekend when the jetsetters take on Naitasiri in the final.  All the best to Nadi Rugby!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1539 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the 2022-2023 Budget,  I need to start by announcing how proud 
<br/>I am to be part of a government that is successfully going through recovery mode after all the challenges 
<br/>and sacrifice made during the pandemic and floods.  Fijians just got a better Budget for a better future, as 
<br/>was announced by our Fijian Government last week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Federation  Party  (NFP)  has  always  been  criticising  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government and they were the first to come up with baseless criticisms.  Has NFP or any Opposition 
<br/>Member provided any alternative Budget?  And here the honourable Kuridrani is talking about sense - 
<br/>what  sense  has  he  got  when  talking  without  any  alternative  Budget  to  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  reading  an  article  by  the  General  Secretary  of  NFP  where  she  was 
<br/>comparing the FRU allocation from 2014 to 2022 and I can say by reading her statement that NFP has 
<br/>no idea.  I have recently travelled around Viti Levu and the rural areas and have seen major infrastructural 
<br/>works being completed and some are underway.  Sir, around Viti Levu, Queens and Kings Highways 
<br/>almost  all  the  bridges  that  were  neglected  by  the  previous  Governments  are  newly  built  or  under 
<br/>construction. These bridges should have been replaced and maintained during the Rabuka Government 
<br/>but rather than criticising them, they are bed partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, honourable Professor Prasad said on 8th September, 2020 that he never supported 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the </span><span>coup</span><span> leaders as he addressed values and principles. So what has happened now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this shows that NFP can go to any length just to try and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>win.  They know they cannot win the election on their own because they have no faith in themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijian people need a strong and dynamic leader like our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prime Minister - he has told everyone and with him no one is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition has been denouncing our own airline, Fiji Airways, during the 
<br/></span><span>pandemic when FijiFirst Government was trying its level best to keep our pride (Fiji’s pride) alive and 
<br/>we  are  optimistic  that  we  will  thrive  because  the  world  will  overcome  this  worst  situation.    But  the 
<br/>Opposition were full of criticism and caught in a time zone because they were unable to look beyond their 
<br/>nose and have no new ideas, in fact, no ideas.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways is our national carrier and 
<br/>it gives every Fijian the honour and smile when it lands in Los Angeles, Brisbane, Sydney and other 
<br/>destinations and of course soon, - Vancouver.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the same airline which took the  Opposition abroad for fundraising and radio 
<br/>talkback  shows where we saw honourable Professor Prasad running away from the Radio Tarana rather 
<br/>than giving some constructive answers.  The honourable Gavoka has always been praising Qantas rather 
<br/>than our own airline.  I hope he knows the current reality of Qantas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, going back to the 2022-2023 Budget, allow me to commend the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy and his team for a budget that embraces all Fijians of our nation post-pandemic.  
<br/>Furthermore, the Government’s vision for progressive developments and ensuring a safe and secure Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- which Government has been providing over the years to our people - is specifically addressed in this 
<br/>Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Budget that says “we are prepared to commit and take the action of 
<br/>$3.812 billion to get the recovery going”.  As the Minister for Economy said during the first reading of 
<br/>the Budget last week, the commentary is already changing.  There is already confidence returning to the 
<br/>economy, we still need this public investment infrastructure and income support and that is the step that 
<br/>we  are  doing.    The  tourism  industry  is  recovering  but  this  is  not  going  to  return  to  pre-COVID-19 
<br/>conditions at this stage but it will return to normal soon. We have got to support that industry because the 
<br/>borders are open and the travellers are returning to an economy that is robust and growing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the basic needs for every individual is affordable housing and in this 
<br/>Budget, the Government continues to provide long-term leases to informal residents and settlements and 
<br/>to provide cost sharing basis to social housing, assistance for rural and maritime regions.  Affordable 
<br/>housing  brings  sustainability,  economic  diversity  and  improves  the  physical  quality  of  the 
<br/>neighbourhood,  hence  the  FijiFirst  Government  is  working  on  this  a  lot  so  every  Fijian  has  decent 
<br/>housing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture is the backbone of our country and in this 2022-2023 Budget we 
<br/></span><span>have seen that the Government is supporting the agriculture sector with other crops and livestock together 
<br/>with the sugarcane farming to adapt to climate change.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agriculture sector was a 
<br/>success  during  the  pandemic  as  we  have  seen  plenty  people  attending  to  farms  and  producing  fresh 
<br/>produce - thanks to the Ministry of Agriculture for their support and guidance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen the number of rice farmers increasing due to the initiatives put in by the Ministry 
<br/>and  it  is  better  for  our  country.    The  late  George  Washington,  the  first  USA  President  had  said  that 
<br/>agriculture is the most helpful, most useful and most noble employment of man.  The country can prosper 
<br/>if it has a good agricultural budget with right thinking leaders who encourage the people of the nation.  
<br/>The budget for the agriculture sector during this recovery period of $64.14 million is commendable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the FijiFirst Government, every Fijian child is given equal opportunity to 
<br/>be educated, free education till Form 7, and after completing high school education, students can get their 
<br/>tertiary education through Toppers and TELS, which reduces the burden from poor parents.  The late 
<br/>Mahatma Gandhi said that if we are to reach real peace in the world, we should start educating children.   
<br/>This Fiji Government has been instrumental in the education of every child so that we have a literate 
<br/>society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 Budget is welcomed by a vast majority of stakeholders including our people, 
<br/>except for our political opponents who cannot see the progress of every Fijian.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they 
<br/>forget that the initiatives given in this 2022-2023 Budget by our Government is that no citizens are left 
<br/>behind.  Some of the initiatives are - the bus fare assistance; $1 per day to every child up to Year 13 whose 
<br/>parent’s household income is less than $50,000 - this is also extended to $180 for six months to all social 
<br/>welfare recipients, aftercare fund recipients, those on Government pension scheme and tertiary students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving  survey  and  development  process  by  the  establishment  of  an  interagency  working 
<br/>group with all relevant stakeholders involved with the help of a Land Development Vetting Committee 
<br/>portal, enables all parties to be able to monitor and track the status of surveys.  Vanua View GIS system 
<br/>will be free for all the users, as before, companies and individuals used to pay $2,572 per annum.  This is 
<br/>very important and valuable information for all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is whether the Opposition has read and gone through the Budget 
<br/>thoroughly or just picking few petty issues to save their political career because 2022-2023 Budget is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1541 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>largely supported by all Fijians.  Sugarcane farmers have been the ball-game in the Fijian political history.  
<br/>It is our leader honourable Prime Minister who has come out clean as a whistle for the plight of the poor 
<br/>farmers who have been suffering before 2006.  To remind honourable Kuridrani, the sugar industry has 
<br/>dropped  because  of  the  non-renewable  of  leases  and  at  that  time  it  was  SDL,  SVT  and  SODELPA 
<br/>Governments.  The 2022-2023 Budget is a well suited Budget for all the Ministries and with this Budget 
<br/>we will consolidate our recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, as I have said, this is a country that is on its journey to recovery.  It will take time, 
<br/>but this is a country that can look back at the last few months and say we had a hell of challenges, but we 
<br/>met those challenges and supported each other through the health crisis and now, it is time to support 
<br/>each other through this rebuild phase and we will do that - the Opposition fails to understand this.  FijiFirst 
<br/>has proven that when times are hard, we pull together collectively, we work together, we co-operate, we 
<br/>collaborate and we make the difference.  This is the time to celebrate what we have done, but not to rest 
<br/>on our glory.  We are thankful for the leadership that we have had, and we are thankful for the investment 
<br/>that has been put in through this Budget as we recover and get back on our feet again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I humbly urge the Opposition to support this and take our beloved nation to a 
<br/>greater height.  With these sentiments, once again I thank our honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Economy and his team for their efforts in putting together a wonderful budget which can be 
<br/></span><span>called the people’s budget.  I support the 2022-2023 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note, we will now suspend proceedings for a

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 4.51 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate 
<br/>on the 2022-2023 National Budget as presented by the honourable Minister for Economy on the eve 
<br/>of Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are still not out of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus keeps showing up 
<br/>repeatedly.  It seems that this will continue for a long time.  Now, it seems like we will have to live 
<br/>with the virus which demands change of our attitudes and habits.  We need to brace against much 
<br/>more disruptions, we need to adopt long-term policies in every sphere of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  our  current  reluctance  with  post-mobility  and  restrictions,  many 
<br/>things remain uncertain. Our people need to adopt a more frugal and healthier lifestyle, our healthcare 
<br/>facilities need to improve drastically.  Our people cannot all afford treatments in overseas, our people 
<br/>need healthcare facilities here in Fiji.  Our experience over the last two years has been dreadful with 
<br/>hundreds of people who lost their lives, thousands lost their jobs and thousands are still jobless.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all need to work hard to change the circumstances of our people.  Playing 
<br/></span><span>tricks with numbers and mesmerizing speeches will not do so much good for our people.  It is time 
<br/></span><span>to get real and deliver not a dollar a day for our future citizens but a bright future that people can 
<br/>embrace with confidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people who have no other hope continue looking to the Government for 
<br/>help and I am sorry to say that the Government has done a bad job in assisting the people despite the 
<br/>general  support  from  our  global  partners.  Our  friends  have  generously  provided  us  hundreds  of 
<br/>millions in assistance, some in grants and some as soft loans.  We are grateful to them for their great 
<br/>gesture in our bad times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji  has not  come out  of its dire economic conditions  yet,  the economic 
<br/>downturn risk beyond 22 percent by the end of 2021.  We have only started an upward journey due 
<br/>to the return of international tourists to our shores.  I am deeply concerned that this National Budget 
<br/>and those in 2021 have not provided much hope for the people of Fiji for long-term prosperity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provisions of the Budget are merely band-aid treatment of the problems we face now.  The 
<br/>Government continues to inflict crude joke on the people of this country by making silly statements 
<br/>like the “Bula Boom” and by handing out pittance to attract voters. Mr. Speaker, Sir, people are not 
<br/></span><span>fools that they will not succumb to cheap tricks played by the Government.  We find the “dollar a 
<br/></span><span>day” for dependents for six months very insulting.  First, this policy does not target the poor for help 
<br/>and secondly, it terminates in six months, clearly indicating that this is an election gimmick.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are thousands of people today who go without food and the necessities 
<br/>of life like medicine.  We support handout  for the poor to  survive but not  just dollar a day.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we suggest much greater assistance for poor children by using a well-targeted policy.  
<br/>The current policy of the Government is throwing money at the problem aimlessly.  We need to assist 
<br/>only those who need such assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I proceed any further, I wish to express my gratitude to all our people 
<br/>for their resilience, patience and fortitude and  I  wish to  express  my  gratitude to  all our  frontline 
<br/>workers  for  their  resolve,  dedication  and  hard  work.    The  nurses,  paramedics,  doctors,  hospital 
<br/>administrators, the police force and the volunteers for working hard to fight the pandemic.  They all 
<br/>deserve our gratitude.  Our gratitude also to those who have generously donated and helped people

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cope with their hardships, thousands of people have contributed and I wish to say to them – thank 
<br/>you very much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to talk on some of the details of the Budget that concerns us most.  
<br/>The Budget Address stated that the projected deficit will only be 7.4 percent net deficit as percentage 
<br/>of GDP.  Furthermore, the deficit for 2022-2023 will represent 22.8 percent of the expenditure.  That 
<br/>means that for every $100 that the country will spend, $23 will be borrowed.  This Government’s 
<br/>policies is mortgaging the country to pay its groceries.  Any family leader who would manage its 
<br/>household finance this way would be bankrupt in no time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The national debt has reached unimaginable heights at $9.1 billion in 2022, that is, 85 percent 
<br/>of GDP.  As percentage of GDP, the national debt has exploded in the last six years.  Even though 
<br/>we  have  had  three  years  of  very  subdued  economic  activity  with  the  pandemic,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has brought the national debt from $2.8 billion in 2006 to $5.7 billion in 2019 and an 
<br/>unimaginable $9.1 billion in 2022.  That is an increase of 325 percent in six years.  The national debt 
<br/>has more than tripled.  All this while the economic growth of the same period was stagnant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  uncertain  times  we  are  facing  with  tensions  between  China  and  the 
<br/></span><span>western  world,  the  war  in  Ukraine  and  a  COVID-19  disrupted  economy,  one  would  think  that 
<br/>prudence should prevail.  This Budget Estimates is simply irresponsible with increase for the PM’s 
<br/>Office - 55 percent; AG’s office - 24 percent; Ministry of Economy - 42 percent; Ministry of Trade 
<br/>- 18 percent; and an increase in the Communications Department - 47 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  allow  me  to  address  the  Budget  Estimates  for  the  Ministry  of  Health  and 
<br/>Medical Services.  I note with interest that this Ministry’s budget has been reduced by more than 11 
<br/>percent, equating to $395.1 million in allocation for operating and capital projects.  A reduction in 
<br/>the allocation can be seen mostly in capital works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services had mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some of the achievements in this august House in some previous sittings such as the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Opening of new nursing stations, health centres, subdivisional hospitals; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public-Private Partnership with Aspen; 
<br/>Rollout of the Government-funded GP partnership for public consultation and for public 
<br/>outpatient; and 
<br/></span><span>In this 2022-2023 Budget, the completion of the existing capital works for Lautoka Hospital 
<br/></span><span>Theatre and X-Ray Department, upgrade of the interior of Labasa Hospital, allocation for 
<br/>Savusavu Subdivisional Hospital capital works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also prior to COVID-19, our medical system and its services and infrastructure has been a 
<br/>topic of discussion as an ongoing issue.  It is an issue which I believe cannot be swept aside as it is 
<br/>clearly  visible,  you  hear  it  too  often.  At  times  you  experience  it  directly  or  indirectly  such  as 
<br/>dilapidated  infrastructure  of  our  nursing  stations,  health  centres,  subdivisional  hospitals  and 
<br/>divisional  hospitals,  continuing  shortage  of  medical  equipment,  beds  and  continuing  shortage  of 
<br/>essential medicine.  How will the reduction in allocation of capital works address the above chronic 
<br/>issues?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  seems  that  the  Government  of  the  day  has  not  prioritised  these  issues.    It  is  rather 
<br/>unfortunate,  Sir,  that  decrease  in  the  budget  for  this  Ministry  and  more  so  no  allocation  for  this 
<br/>purpose has basically shed cold water on the hopes and aspiration of our people in this respect. The 
<br/>absence of any activity in this sphere is going to keep us deprived of better up to-date healthcare and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>medical service.  I, therefore, urge the next government which will take office after the elections to 
<br/>seriously consider taking steps in this important direction in partnership with relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking of long term measures to improve the quality of our healthcare 
<br/>and  medical  services,  it  is  expected  by  our  people  that  Government  sets  up  and  puts  in  place 
<br/>mechanisms for science and technology exchange, research and development to update and upgrade 
<br/>our response to contemporary and future challenges in the health and medical sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now turn to healthcare and medical services infrastructure demanding 
<br/>an independent audit into the basic, clinical and surgical equipment. I make this demand given the 
<br/>number of complaints we are receiving throughout Fiji on the paucity of the same.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still  on  infrastructure,  our  healthcare  and  medical  services,  I  am  hopeful  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister will update Parliament on all the maintenance works and capital developments that they so 
<br/>far promised in budget after budget or were they part of the string of broken promises which has now 
<br/>become a staple trait of this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a fair  share of capital  budget  is under Requisition (R).   In the last three 
<br/></span><span>years, funds under “R” was never utilised or partially utilised. The reason why funds were not utilised 
<br/></span><span>or not realised may be due to Government not being to generate the estimated revenue to finance for 
<br/>the capital budget or for any other reason.  Whatever the case may be, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will only 
<br/>add to the burden and miseries of the sick and the diseased as well as the health of medical personnel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allocation for medicine and consumables has improved by $2 million while 
<br/>purchase for medical equipment (biomedical equipment for urban and subdivisional hospitals) has 
<br/>been reduced.  While shortages of medicine and consumables continue from pre-COVID-19 to the 
<br/>present, what will the change allocation deliver?  Our tertiary healthcare settings at times continue to 
<br/>not deliver full quality services as mentioned due to no or poorly maintained equipment and now 
<br/>with a reduced allocation, how will it upgrade our quality service delivery?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  COVID-19  brought  in  acute  challenges  and  though  also  contributing  to 
<br/>some current shortfalls, it is the chronic issues mentioned above that needs to be address as well. Our 
<br/>health system and service delivery is desperately struggling and made to struggle even more with 
<br/>COVID-19.  Most of our health workers are already improvising and working with means available 
<br/>to them to deliver a service that nears normality but it just makes work harder for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Health  budget  in  summary  is  that  though  it  has  been  reduced,  the  only 
<br/></span><span>positive  is  the  increase  in  operational  estimates.    Increase  in  operational  estimates  alone  if  not 
<br/>accommodated  with  all  other  relevant  parameters  to  produce  a  conducive  and  productive 
<br/>environment to work in is baseless.  Doctors and medical personnel should also be better equipped, 
<br/>better  resourced  to  work  in  better  hospitals,  subdivisional  hospitals,  health  centres  and  nursing 
<br/>stations and also pay their relevant allowances on time to empower them to carry out their duties with 
<br/>the best of their abilities because the people of Fiji only deserve the best.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning to some of the constituency issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Taveuni, especially the Natuvu 
<br/>Passage is one of the busiest with regular commuters travelling to and fro for personal, business, et 
<br/>cetera.  Currently there is no proper jetty on that Vanua Levu side and it is a health and OHS risk on 
<br/>the current Vatuyalewa Makeshift Jetty. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fail to see any allocation for this capital 
<br/>project and I urge the Government and the Ministry to look into this area as a top priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, allow me to thank the continuous work of the FRA through its contractors in maintaining 
<br/>the roads and erecting natural seawalls. The south of Taveuni, especially the coastal area along the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1545 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>school, urgently needs a natural seawall to protect its shoreline and in doing so protect the  South 
<br/>Taveuni primary and secondary schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water shortage is still an ongoing issue with the south of Taveuni and I urge the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to please once and for all put priority for a permanent source of clean drinking water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lifting of the ban on harvesting of </span><span>beche-de-mer</span><span> for only a few months is appreciated as 
<br/>it will bring much-needed income and economic activity in the province not only from Cakaudrove 
<br/>but Bua and Macuata as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I truly believe that this Budget is one of the worst Budgets 
<br/>by the FijiFirst Government for the simple reason that the Budget will hijack the future of our kids 
<br/>and grandkids by more than tripling our national debt.  This Government has decided to invest in 
<br/>slick communication campaign instead of buying hospital beds  and much-needed medicine.   The 
<br/>irresponsible  Government  has  decided  to  invest  in  more  policing  instead  of  more  teaching.    The 
<br/>FijiFirst Government is using the spending tools of the State to get re-elected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you for the opportunity to respond to the 2022-2023 Budget and I do not support the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion before this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  applaud  the 
<br/>Government for its visionary and decisive leadership and support to resource-based sectors.  I would 
<br/>like  to  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  and  his  hardworking  team  and  all 
<br/>permanent secretaries and civil servants for a very comprehensive, well-thought out and all-inclusive 
<br/>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is indeed an inclusive people’s Budget that ensures no one is 
<br/>left behind.  Through the social relief initiatives and assistance such as direct cash assistance, bus 
<br/>fare subsidy, Energy Fiji Limited and water subsidy, increase in social welfare assistance, to name a 
<br/>few, provided yet again in this Budget for vulnerable Fijian families that would be able to access 
<br/>these facilities to support their basic necessities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support existing and the creation of new business, the Government in its wisdom continues 
<br/>to strip away unnecessary requirements and fees, review and amend legislative provisions, support 
<br/>online digitalisation transition to ease the cost of doing business for local and foreign entrepreneurs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me begin by highlighting that the overall work done and announcement 
<br/></span><span>of the 2022- 2023 Annual Budget was done with great consideration and foresight by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.  While  extensive  consultation  was  made  with  our  public  and  private  sectors, 
<br/>consultation  was  also  done  with  rural  communities  to  allow  for  a  transparent  and  accountable 
<br/>approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, needless  to  say, we cannot  even try  and understand this Budget  without 
<br/>recognising the international economic trends and the progress of our global partners.  Global trends 
<br/>such as the lingering impacts of COVID-19 and the recent conflict between Russia and Ukraine have 
<br/>drastically affected oil prices and the progress of many global economies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in highlighting this, I must say that through the strong leadership of the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government, the 2022-2023 Annual Budget that has been tabled, not only address the needs 
<br/>of the Fijian people and economy but has been carefully allocated to mitigate the global trends that 
<br/>we all must consider as an inclusive Government.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the Budget provision for the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries.  It has been allocated $16 million, a provision of $10.5 million for Operations 
<br/>and $4.8 million for Capital Expenditure.  This is an increase of 3.2 percent in provision as compared 
<br/>to the Ministry’s 2021- 2022 Budget of $15.5 million.  This budget will be used by the Ministry to 
<br/>execute  its  mandate  of  Sustainable  Fisheries  Management  to  support  the  Fisheries  Sector  and 
<br/>Government in restoring economic growth and community livelihood.  As I understand, this Budget 
<br/>promotes stability and security as it takes into account the economic challenges faced by Fiji as a 
<br/>country and shows Government’s visionary leadership and commitment.  Therefore, the Ministry is 
<br/>required to be prudent in the execution of the budget in order to meet its mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a responsible Ministry our goal is to achieve this through an inclusive 
<br/>approach  of  close  collaboration  and  dialogue  with  our  diverse  stakeholders:  from  the  subsistence 
<br/>fishers in all remote islands, rural villages and informal settlements, inshore and coastal areas to the 
<br/>offshore  commercial  fishers  amongst  others.    The  underlying  principle  of  the  role  we  play  is  to 
<br/>sustainably manage Fiji’s marine resources to provide food security and economic growth whilst also 
<br/>ensuring its sustainability for prosperity. Given this setting, the Minister has taken bold and cautious 
<br/>measures which include a temporary lifting of the seasonal bans on sea cucumber or </span><span>beche-de-mer</span><span>
<br/>and Groupers or </span><span>Kawakawa</span><span> and </span><span>Donu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will develop a feed for purpose legislative framework, enforced  
<br/>compliance, implement the foreshore and coastal fisheries licensing system, provide advisory and 
<br/>support services and conduct appropriate research and marine conservation activities, all of which 
<br/>will  be  aligned  to  the  Government’s  national  priorities  and  to  Fiji’s  commitment  to  International 
<br/>Conventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry operates a nationwide service centre network ensuring quality 
<br/>and  excellence  which  is  embedded  in  the  processes,  service  delivery  and  its  people.  This  service 
<br/>centre network implements key programmes, projects and activities, connecting the industry to the 
<br/>community and its development partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  effort  to  achieve  a  sustainable  blue  economy  remains 
<br/>steadfast. It will continue to incorporate climate resilience and adaptation efforts through practical 
<br/>and  viable  adaptation  solutions  for  the  benefit  of  individual  fisheries  business,  the  sector  and  the 
<br/>communities it serve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to stress that the Ministry will continue to lay emphasis on 
<br/></span><span>employment creation, empowerment and economic inclusivity in the fisheries sector.  This focus is 
<br/></span><span>in line with the priorities of the 5 Year and 20-year National Development Plan and it is underpinned 
<br/>by the policy aspirations to enhance distribution of fisheries wealth to all Fijians.  Moreover, these 
<br/>objectives are aligned to our honourable Prime Minister’s announcement in the United Nations Social 
<br/>Conference  in  Lisbon  and  again  reinforced  by  the  Pacific  leaders  in  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum 
<br/>meeting held recently in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to touch briefly on the sectoral budget provisioning that exists 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>within the Ministry of Fisheries, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1547 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Government for its commitment in allocating the needed 
<br/>fiscal envelope and would like to reaffirm this august Parliament that we are determined to make 
<br/>every dollar count for the Fijian people and the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Offshore Fisheries Management Division (OFMD) is responsible for 
<br/>ensuring that the tuna sector is managed in a sustainable manner through an ongoing implementation 
<br/>of  measures  to  effectively  monitor  and  curb  Illegal,  Unreported  and  Unregulated  (IUU)  Fishing. 
<br/>These  roles  are  executed  through  a  serious  of  work  programmes  such  as  the  National  Observer 
<br/>Programme which is supported in its work by the electronic monitoring project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The enforcement and compliance programme holds a critical element in making sure that our 
<br/>tuna  resources  are  well-monitored  and  the  regulations  that  protect  these  resources  are  enforced 
<br/>effectively and efficiently, as well as dealing with  industry and trade issues,  ensuring all trade of 
<br/>fisheries commodities are done within standing regulations that protect our industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Offshore Fisheries Division has been allocated $2.65million in the 2022-
<br/>2023  Budget  to  assist  the  Ministry’s  National  Fisheries  Observer  Programme.    We  welcome  the 
<br/>budget allocation of $170,000 to assist in the sea going allowance of National Observer Programme 
<br/></span><span>and $200,000 to assist the Regional Observer Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the electronic monitoring system was first realised through the support of 
<br/>the Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO).   Out of all global  countries that have  an observer 
<br/>programme,  the  decision  to  have  Fiji  pilot  the  programme  signifies  the  tremendous  effort  by  our 
<br/>observers in achieving a high standard of quality data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We welcome the budget increase to $550,000 which will cater for the servicing of 50 on-
<br/>board units, provide payments to service providers and cater for allowances for observers who will 
<br/>review  and  analyse  the  electronic  footage.    The  analysis  provided  would  complement  the  work 
<br/>undertaken by physical sea going observers in the collection of scientific tuna catch data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the entire COVID-19 restriction period, the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>has learnt a lot.  The restriction to movement and gathering have prompted the Ministry to explore 
<br/>innovative  options  and  alternatives  to  improve  service  delivery.    We  welcome  the  Government’s 
<br/>announcement of a new budget item of $200,000 for e-services to support the Marine Stewardship 
<br/>Certification of offshore fisheries products and to facilitate industry issues to ease the cost of doing 
<br/>businesses.  The allocation of this budget will enable the Ministry to explore an e-permitting and e-
<br/></span><span>licensing platforms that are efficient and effective towards our private sector service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Division budget provision of $3.28 million will see to the 
<br/>implementation of a number of key initiatives to ensure rapid growth in the aquaculture sector.  These 
<br/>include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of an aquaculture testing facility to assist in testing of water and soil samples 
<br/>for aquaculture farmers; 
<br/>Basic testing of aquaculture species and monitoring of diseases; 
<br/>Re-stocking and pawned rearing of sea cucumbers; 
<br/>Boosting production of shellfish by improving water quality; 
<br/>Ongoing  staff  capacity  building  and  training  to  enhance  the  knowledge  available  in 
<br/>developed countries; 
<br/>Implement a feed machine set up to produce aquaculture feed used mainly in local produced 
<br/>raw materials;   
<br/>Undertake feed trials for beche-de-mer, shrimp and fresh water prawns; and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upgrading of aging infrastructure to boost production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  welcome  the  budget  provision  of  $600,000  for  the  food  security 
<br/>programme and $250,000 for assistance to commercial aquaculture farmer projects.  We are looking 
<br/>at  supporting  more  farmers  with  this  increased  allocation,  resulting  in  boosting  cultured  fish 
<br/>production for our Fijian people, creating new employment and reducing imports.  This is testament 
<br/>to the confidence and commitment the Ministry and the Fijian Government places in empowering 
<br/>youth and women through such programmes as this.  Under aquaculture, the Caboni Multi-Species 
<br/>Hatchery is allocated $400,000.  These funds have been earmarked to support hatchery operations 
<br/>and scientific research for high-value fish species.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further boost marine and more production and to focus on research and 
<br/>breeding of high value species, for example, </span><span>Kawakawa, Donu</span><span> and Rabbit Fish, the Ministry will 
<br/>continue to collaborate with development partners in the national, regional and international space.  
<br/>Costal fisheries and inshore fisheries development and management is an integral part of the Ministry 
<br/>sustainable management role and we acknowledge the total budget provision of $3.03 million to provide 
<br/>for initiatives and programmes to sustain and diversify our support to coastal inshore fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  we  recover  from the impact of COVID-19, our focus  in supporting 850 
<br/></span><span>coastal fishing communities has not waived and we welcome the increased provision of $900,000 for 
<br/>Coastal Fisheries Development.  This budget will further support the following initiatives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Construction of Fishing Aggregation Devices (FADs); 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Transforming diesel power generator to solar power; 
<br/>Technical training and capacity building and market access pathways 
<br/>Procurement  of  solar  freezes  to  support  preservation  of  catches  for  communities  not 
<br/>accessible to ice plant services; and  
<br/>community outreach and awareness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as such, the Ministry also welcomes the budgetary allocation of $100,000 for 
<br/>preparatory work for Wainigadru and Koro ice plants.  We also welcome the allocation of $300,000 for 
<br/>capital procurement of a new fisheries extension vessel that will service the Eastern Division, in  particular 
<br/>the Lau Group of islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this allocation, our footprints of service delivery through our extension, 
<br/>advisory, research, monitoring, control and surveillance work programme across the Lau Group will be 
<br/></span><span>exemplified, enabling us to strengthen the delivery of these essential services to isolated Fijian coastal 
<br/></span><span>and maritime communities.   Additionally, the overall  allocation of  funding  under this allocation will 
<br/>foster  the  Ministry’s  work  in  sustaining  and  diversifying  every  opportunity  to  our  850  coastal 
<br/>communities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must applaud the Government in the allocation of $180,000 for the 
<br/>feasibility work on compliance and enforcement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation of this budgetary provision will allow us to make constant checks 
<br/>and gap analysis to continuously strengthen and improve the compliance and enforcement work within 
<br/>Fiji’s inshore and coastal fisheries.  The implementation of this critical work cannot be undermined as it 
<br/>enables the Ministry to assess the robustness of our system and processes, propose policy and legislative 
<br/>amendments  and  allow  us  to  be  effective  and  efficient  in  monitoring,  control  and  surveillance 
<br/>practitioners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is renewing efforts to strengthen the research and science on how 
<br/>a value species that can be sustainably be farmed both in saltwater mediums.  The Ministry welcomed

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the budgetary provision of $1.5 million for research, resource assessment and development, to ensure 
<br/>scientific research finding support informal policy decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is actively seeking scientific qualified and experienced personnel 
<br/>to  complement  to  existing  staff  in  ensuring  that  we  take  advantage  of  Fiji’s  naturally  conducive 
<br/>environment for fish farming and partnering with a private sector and communities to support a vibrant, 
<br/>resilient and sustainable industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, therefore, plays a key role on other agencies in ensuring a sustainable blue economy 
<br/>and will, therefore, strengthen our partnership to establish the 30 percent Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) 
<br/>by 2030 and contribute to increase jobs within the fishing industry.  The budget will contribute towards 
<br/>these ultimate goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support coastal fisheries communities in ensuring a continuous operability of 
<br/>the 24 ice plants we manage across our national service network, the Ministry welcomes the budgetary 
<br/>allocation of $1.09 million under this programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  concluding,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  will  strengthen  its  commitment  in 
<br/></span><span>playing a leadership role towards building Fiji’s blue economy.  With the allocated fiscal envelope, we 
<br/></span><span>are determined to heighten our effort towards our goal of achieving more with less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the ultimate goal of not living anyone behind, the Ministry of Fisheries is 
<br/>determined to work closely with our partners and external donors to build the fisheries sectors and its 
<br/>contribution to the Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that we need to understand after all that has happened over the 
<br/>past three years, it is the importance of compromise, partnership and collaboration.  There will always be 
<br/>gaps within our system and budgeted activities will face shortage of funds, however, the important thing 
<br/>to understand is that, we all have a part to play.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have an exciting financial year ahead of us.  Let us work collectively to progress that 
<br/>excitement to high yields and production levels.  The Budget is tailored to help safeguard Fijian economy 
<br/>and the Fijian people.  For the Ministry of Fisheries, the allocation of $16 million will ensure our children, 
<br/>our grandchildren and their children who will come after them, those are the Fijians we are ultimately 
<br/>meant to serve.  Let us serve them well by building a future worthy of their greatest dream and aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, having said that, I wish to register my full support to the tabled 2022-2023 Budget.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;    I  rise  to 
<br/>contribute to the debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022.  At the outset, allow me to thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy and his staff, the Permanent Secretary and the sector managers for the 
<br/>composition of this Budget, as well as the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his response on the 
<br/>same.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a loyal Member of Opposition and representative of my people, I intend to highlight some 
<br/>issues that have been announced through this House on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July.  In the last one-and-a-half decade of 
<br/>Bainimarama-led  interim  and  then  FijiFirst  Government,  our  country  had  skyrocketing  public  debt 
<br/>burden, highest unemployment rate in the history of Fiji, unprecedented cost of living, worst healthcare 
<br/>and medical services, poor public infrastructure, poorest index on human development and democratic 
<br/>accountability, draconian labour laws and no pay rise for our civil servants, especially our nurses, our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>doctors  and  of  course,  our  police  officers.    And  they  trampled  upon  every  traditional  institution  and 
<br/>structure in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are civil service workers who need urgent pay rise, who I would like to 
<br/>reiterate, especially the Fiji Police Force whose budget has been slashed, our teachers and our doctors.   
<br/>Crime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with domestic violence, theft, law and order are much the work of police officers 
<br/>and they need to be remunerated accordingly.  We have a war on our hands caused by crime and it is the 
<br/>police who are at the forefront in battling them on our behalf and their budget being reduced does not 
<br/>augur well in terms of them carrying out their roles … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Capital expenditure! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- … as custodians of the law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this Parliament will note that when such a warning bell was raised here of these impending 
<br/>dangers that  come  to us  by the  poor  governance  of this  Government, turned into a corporate-funded 
<br/>political party, they did not listen to us.  Our visionary leaders and social workers of Fiji, the past members 
<br/>of  this  Parliament,  such  as  the  late  honourable  Laisenia  Qarase  and  Ratu  Isoa  Tikoca,  then  Niko 
<br/></span><span>Nawaikula, Mr. Parmod Chand, Dr. Ganesh Chand, Mr. Felix Anthony, Mr. Semesa Karavaki, who had 
<br/></span><span>warned us about the implications of the same, they did not listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to urge this Parliament and the people of Fiji to realise the 
<br/>danger of keeping such a Government in power for one more term.  Enough is enough but more than 
<br/>enough is not good enough.  I only pray and wish that you have the wisdom here to vote this Budget 
<br/>down and due to the huge debt both domestic and external that now stand at $9.1 billion as at July, 2022.  
<br/>I wish to register my heartfelt thanks and sincere appreciation to the following persons and organisations 
<br/>for coming to rescue our people: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) at home and abroad; 
<br/>Donor agencies and assistance from foreign governments, Australia, New Zealand, United 
<br/>States of America, India, China, Japan, Taiwan and many others;  
<br/>Local business houses and philanthropists; 
<br/>Our </span><span>vanua</span><span> and community-based organisations; 
<br/>religious and cultural bodies; 
<br/>Good hearted Samaritan from Fiji and overseas; and of course 
<br/>Frontline workers and the volunteers with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on USP.  Why  else would  the  Government want to  withhold  grants to our 
<br/>regional  universities,  endangering  the  studies  of  our  students  who  are  learning  there?  I  call  on  the 
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy not to inflict 
<br/>more sufferings on this institution, especially their actions are hurting our local and regional students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The support for tertiary students, regardless of whether or not they are TELS or Toppers recipients 
<br/>is commendable but who will pay for this.  Even the inflation mitigation measures to mitigate the effect 
<br/>of rising inflationary pressures, the payment of $180 per child under 18 years of age over the six months’ 
<br/></span><span>period will have to be paid back and who, may I ask pays for these?  It will be the taxpayers of this country 
<br/></span><span>who will carry this burden. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will only roll over to our children and grandchildren.  This is 
<br/>but just to appease the young voters, enticing them to vote for them again but let me caution the youth of 
<br/>Fiji today by quoting the former British Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill.  He says and I quote:  
<br/>“The youth is easy to deceive because they believe in hope.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1551 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say, not now and not tomorrow.  Noting that most of the successful and vote-catching policies 
<br/>and programmes of this Government were the ideas of our Opposition parties, adopted, modified and 
<br/>renamed by them, the youth of Fiji can expect a better package on education and youth development from 
<br/>us in Government, including transition from loans age to an era of scholarship once again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  given  that  broad  outline  and  general  remarks  on  the  debate  before  Parliament,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, allow me now to confine my observations to the issues related to my portfolios of Labour 
<br/>and Industrial Relations while I have a mouthful to say on the FNPF and Social Pension Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, trade unions are not the enemies of the State.  They are the friends of the State, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the representative of the workers, whose aim is to promote and protect the ideals and principles of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Meaningful employment; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Better wages and working conditions; 
<br/>Right to collective bargaining;  
<br/>Right to strike; and  
<br/>Freedom of expression.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>History is a testimony, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the advent of trade unionism in Fiji since 1904 and 
<br/>then given statutory recognition by struggles of the Fiji Industrial Workers Union, now Fiji Trades Union 
<br/>Congress.  This has resulted into professional development, increased productivity and better quality of 
<br/>life and standard of living, economic development, better social and public infrastructure, high index of 
<br/>democratic accountability and robust institutions of governance and justice, as in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade unionism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been one of the basis of our past success stories working 
<br/>in tandem with previous Governments amid our differences.  The other fact that I want to point out to 
<br/>this Government for its own benefit to grow up and learn to govern inclusively.  The fact is otherwise.  
<br/>Every time there was a standoff between the Government and the unions, the growth rate was low and 
<br/>every time there was a pact to work in the spirit of collective bargaining, our growth rates were high and 
<br/>you know why. That was because workers want to be appreciated, adequately paid, working with better 
<br/>conditions, have job security, safe work environment, recognised values, space to be heard, grievance 
<br/>redress  mechanism  free  of  oppression  and  victimisation,  given  training  for  further  development, 
<br/>promoted on merits and our local companies to be the basis of this success story retaining the cream of 
<br/>the national economy for the benefit of this nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a good example of this is the sugar industry. The industry recorded the highest 
<br/></span><span>sugar production in 1986 when industrial relations politics was at its peak in the sugar industry and today, 
<br/></span><span>has the Bainimarama led FijiFirst Government fulfilled its commitment to the ILO on labour reforms?  
<br/>Has it given the greenlight to the Fiji Trade Union Congress to stage peaceful march across all towns and 
<br/>cities around Fiji and have rallied to speak out on workers’ rights and aspirations, grudges, grievances 
<br/>and  demonstrate  to  the  world  that  indeed  democracy  is  alive  and  well  on  our  shores?    Otherwise,  it 
<br/>remains as a dead horse flogged by power hungry politicians with an equally dead conscience calling 
<br/>themselves the leaders of this nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I am thankful to veteran politician and trade unionist, Mr. Krishna Datt, for putting a number 
<br/></span><span>of these issues in a broader context in his recently published book, </span><span>The History of Fiji Teachers Union</span><span>, 
<br/></span><span>which I recommend the Government to read to learn about trade unionism and its relevance and future in 
<br/>Fiji.  You may have curtailed the group rights but you cannot stop individuals associating and linking up 
<br/>as groups to put your tactics under the microscope.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if only drama was life and propaganda was food - Fiji under the Bainimarama-
<br/></span><span>led FijiFirst Government would be one of the most prosperous and richest countries of the world today.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet  another of their latest antics  was to showcase the more than  $31million  Accident Compensation 
<br/>Commission of Fiji (ACCF) payout since its inception.  However, neither the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy nor the Chief Executive (CEO) of the Commission told the media the number of applications 
<br/>that were still pending, the status of processing the same and above all, the most serious concern out of 
<br/>this short experience with the work mode of the Commission which was the time taken for the processing 
<br/>of the applications in addition to the issues of backlog. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other thing this exorbitant $31 million compensation payout reveals is either 
<br/>the laxity by the workplace owners/facilitators with regard to Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) 
<br/>Compliance and the complacency on the part of the Ministry of Labour and Industrial Relations OHS 
<br/>Compliance Unit, to inspect, cause to update compliance and regularly monitor and review OHS status 
<br/>at our work places.  This calls for putting the work of the inspectors of this Unit under the microscope.  It 
<br/>is unfortunate the honourable Minister for Labour is not here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second last issue that  I  wish to  highlight in  my  speech is  the  affairs of the  Fiji  National 
<br/>Provident Fund (FNPF).  The FNPF was created for superannuation purposes for its members but the 
<br/>amendments made by this regime to the FNPF Act has deviated the Fund far away from its core founding 
<br/>values.  We, in the Opposition Mr. Speaker, Sir, have a number of reservations with regard to the abuse 
<br/></span><span>of the FNPF and let me highlight some of the major ones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, the amendments have resulted in the loss of veto power of the employee representatives 
<br/>to  withhold  any  transaction  of  the  funds  for  purposes  other  than  the  members  benefit.    Today,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the members of FNPF have to queue up, pay administration costs and patiently wait for the 
<br/>loan and withdrawals or pensions to be paid out to them, and yet here we have an uncaring Government 
<br/>using its two votes on the FNPF Board with the two votes of the employer representatives to outvote the 
<br/>two votes of the  employer representatives, to use the  workers money in the Fund  as it  wishes  - in  a 
<br/>nutshell, using it basically as a cash cow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while investment of the FNPF funds for membership benefits is not a bad idea, 
<br/>let us examine the legacy of those investments by the FNPF.  Were the members of the Fund consulted 
<br/>to  make  the  investments  or  lend  out  monies  on  Government  Guarantees?    Morally,  was  it  a  sound 
<br/>decision?  Financially, was it a viable venture?  Most important of all, what did the members of the Fund 
<br/>receive in turn, for their funds being used with no benefit for them at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fact  of  the  matter  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  this  Government  is,  by  a  string  of  draconian 
<br/>legislations, holding the FNPF to political ransom to fund its political extravaganza and keep itself and 
<br/></span><span>its many near bankrupt public enterprises afloat - the latest being Fiji Airways and then now the Airports 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism with its enabler the national airline link was established pre-independence.  Under the 
<br/>far sightedness of our long gone tourism and aviation experts, we have this industry as the main anchor 
<br/>of this budget.  All the big talks and hyped rebranding and the dressed financials, I ask the big question 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, has our national air link achieved anything above other than expected?  Why are we so 
<br/>fixated on this industry?  I call on the Government to open up the sky and allow in all entrants that can 
<br/>safely bring in and ferry out peoples and cargoes at our international airports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have no idea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  This  Government  has  already  surrendered  our  sovereignty  at  our 
<br/>international seaports of entries, why are we not doing the same with Fiji Airways?  One must seriously 
<br/>question our fixation on Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1553 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Government whose election is now certain will have to amend the FNPF Act to restore 
<br/>the  veto  powers  of  the  employee  representatives  on  the  FNPF  Board  and  institute  independent 
<br/>investigations on monies transacted by way of Government guarantees for the purposes of loans, bonds 
<br/>and other purposes including investments made under this Government to fact find where is our FNPF 
<br/>fund?  Is the cash cow still productive or has it exhausted itself? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last issue that I wish to speak upon Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Social Pension Scheme. While it 
<br/>is commendable that the social pension has been increased from $100 to $180 per month, this short-
<br/>sighted relief and poorly planned policy of the Government needs to be put under the microscope.  By 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first thing that this Parliament must take note of is the age for retirement which 
<br/>is fixed at 55 years by this Government.  It is after one decade of struggle when a person reaches 65 years 
<br/>of age that he or she qualifies for the social pension.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the average life expectancy rate of a common person in Fiji?  Now, let me quote from his 
<br/>statistics, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 67 years.  That skins the cat to the bone on this stately lip service to our 
<br/>senior citizens. As if that is not enough, let me question the honourable Minister for Economy, how many 
<br/>people over the age of 65 years are going to receive this $180 per month? How many will have their 
<br/>applications pending due to the red tape bureaucracy it has created in the process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while this Budget remains a joke at an exorbitant cost to the 
<br/>national purse, a more funny reaction by none other than the honourable Minister for Economy in his 
<br/>usual dramatic style, was calling the Opposition parties reaction to his Budget speech as nothing but 
<br/>grandstanding.  Truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has many ways of revealing and finding itself in public domain.  
<br/>And we do not expect much in the Minister’s right of reply because many a time, his passion for personal 
<br/>vilification overrides the importance of issues that we raise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  lacks  the  strategies  to  give  a  shot  in  the  arm  for  investment, 
<br/>economic development, revenue generation and falls far short of the expectations of the people of Fiji on 
<br/>expenditure discipline, good governance and above all, in addressing the pressing issues of controlling 
<br/>the price of basic food items.  It falls far short of improving our healthcare and medical services and not 
<br/>taking an overhaul approach to our ailing and out-of-date public infrastructure.  The Budget continues to 
<br/>negate  worker  rights  and  encourage  labour  exploitation,  and  exposes  our  women  and  children  more 
<br/>vulnerable than ever to more pain and suffering.  It is an insult to the resource owners, a curse on the 
<br/>farmers and a trap for small traders.  While Dracula guards the blood bank, the shark in the pool has been 
<br/>given the licence to have a fishing holiday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just lament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I have more time at my disposal, to speak on youth and sports 
<br/></span><span>issues but perhaps, after the next election.  Finally, when statistics speak the fact, you sack the statistician 
<br/>instead of facing up to the truth.  When strategies fail and strategists run away, projections remain distant 
<br/>dreams and signs of calamity are lingering at your face just like the story of the one-time king, reduced 
<br/>by his own antics to being a pauper because what he now touches, is not gold.  Since, the honourable 
<br/>Minister and his Government has failed to do that, the voters will now show them the door at the next 
<br/>elections due shortly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind the honourable Minister for Education, that teachers are passionate about their 
<br/>work and they do not drink grog all night and sleep the next day. This is an insult to the hardworking 
<br/>teachers  and  I  ask  the  honourable  Minister  to  refrain  from  issuing  divisive  statements.    Primary  or 
<br/>secondary school teachers have their work cut out for them and, please, do not throw them under the bus.  
<br/>Show a bit of sense and award them a pay rise which is long overdue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was clear enough from last Friday night that the FijiFirst Government thinks this Budget will 
<br/>be enough to get them through in the next election.  They are asking you to trust them - they are asking

<div><span>the voters to trust them that somehow, after all the waste and rot, can we imagine how arrogant and 
<br/>dismissive they will be if they are given another chance in office?  We will let the people decide.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians, thank you for this opportunity to 
<br/>contribute to this very important budget debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has weathered the most difficult storm in its history.  The pandemic struck 
<br/>Fiji when we were in the best space of our economic boom. The Fijian economy (we need to paint this 
<br/>picture, Mr. Speaker, Sir) was gaining momentum year-on-year.  We were strengthening our presence in 
<br/>the region and internationally, whether it was in terms of trade and economic relations or raising Small 
<br/>Island States' concerns on climate issues, we were at the forefront.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, it is absolutely shocking to hear the Opposition today.  I will say that again, it is 
<br/>shocking.   From the Leader, I will explain, to each and every speaker from the Opposition, they are 
<br/>completely bereft of any ideas, nothing remotely looking like a counter budget to what the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy presented to all of us.   It is quite simple, that the Opposition has no idea.  They 
<br/>have no understanding of how to deal with a country that was suffering and no vision of where the country 
<br/></span><span>needs to go.  That has been the case for the last eight years.  They are a directionless, rudderless, and 
<br/></span><span>captainless and group and they want to lead the country?  I doubt it.  Everyone is listening today, they 
<br/>have been waiting with bated breath, they are listening, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want the whole of Fiji to hear this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Opposition calling every Government 
<br/>support a freebie is absolute gross disrespect to our people.  What they are essentially saying is that, we 
<br/>should not have provided essentials and we should not have financial relief to businesses and families 
<br/>who had no source of income for months; we should not have provided stall fees for the thousands of 
<br/>vendors that we have in this country; we should not be subsidising bus fares for our children and the 
<br/>elderly;  we  should  not  continue  with  free  education  and  recognise  the  best  talents  by  providing 
<br/>scholarships.  Shame on them!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What they are saying is that we simply should not provide anything for our people and let them 
<br/>find the solutions for themselves.  This needs to be heard by the whole of Fiji because that is what you 
<br/>are going to get if they come on this side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I want every single citizen to 
<br/>realise what could be your future if the Opposition was to decide for you.  They, on the other side of 
<br/>Parliament, will let you suffer alone, since we are giving you a freebie, according to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like I have said, they are bereft over ideas - they just want to take us backwards.  
<br/></span><span>The Opposition is asking us to join the bandwagon of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.  We 
<br/>should not be aspiring to be Singapore.  Where are they living, in La La Land?   It will be a sad day in 
<br/>Fiji, if we started looking back rather than looking forward, rather than striving to be the best in the 
<br/>Region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our vision is for the future and the growth.  I sat here and I started thinking - what is going on, 
<br/>specifically from two Members on the other side of Parliament, one coming from Nadroga and the other 
<br/>one  from  Navosa.    And  then  I  thought,  hang  on  -  maybe,  just  maybe,  they  have  been  testing  the 
<br/>Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration in a particular plant to see whether it falls within the prescribed limit 
<br/>for plantation purposes - maybe that is what they have been smoking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the Opposition has stated so far is actually the opposite of any vision.  
<br/>Instead  of  unity,  they  have  preached  disunity,  case  in  point,  it  has  disappeared.    Instead  of 
<br/>togetherness, the Opposition has preferred divisiveness, exactly how they run their party. Yet again 
<br/>and they are still trying to split the people of Fiji on a base of racial lines, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1555 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The Opposition and their associates are using every tactic under the sun 
<br/>to discredit the budget and use it for their own political benefit.  The FijiFirst Government believes 
<br/>in providing for its people. It is not about winning votes, it is actually about winning hearts. It is 
<br/>about ensuring that our peoples’ suffering is lessened and they are confident to try and make a new 
<br/>way of life so it is economically safe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this really rubs me the wrong way, this really irks me and I know it irks 
<br/>every Member on this side of Parliament.  The utter rubbish, absolute rubbish that is coming from 
<br/>the other side is quite appalling.  A personalised attack on the honourable Minister for Economy this 
<br/>morning is absolutely disgusting.  In fact, it appears that it is bordering on the abuse of Parliamentary 
<br/>Privilege.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am a hundred percent sure they cannot produce an ounce of proof for what they are actually 
<br/>alleging.  It is nonsensical, gibberish and garbage and I, for a moment if he was here, I would tell this 
<br/>to  his  face,  “come  and  say  it  outside”  because  he  would  dare  not  do  that.    It  is  disgusting, 
<br/></span><span>dishonourable and it is not the kind of stuff we want to hear in this Parliament and God forbid those 
<br/></span><span>people that actually put him in Parliament, that they heard that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy stated, Fiji 
<br/>is out of its darkest times.  We have come out of our darkest times because of the decisive leadership 
<br/>of the honourable Prime Minister and it is because of his commitment to the Fijian people, every 
<br/>single Fijian person, not just one part of it.  With the support and understanding of the people of Fiji, 
<br/>that has helped us achieve our national vision of an inclusive cover where no Fijian is left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally, we still face challenges with the aftermath of the pandemic and 
<br/>other external shocks, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, and increasing fuel and food prices but they 
<br/>seem to forget that. They also seem to forget that we have gone through 14 cyclones and some of 
<br/>which has caused such irreparable damage to this country, and the fact that we had to use billions of 
<br/>dollars to do all the repair for it.  They simply forget that.  The 2022-2023 Budget gives us hope by 
<br/>providing a well-designed plan to maintain our course on the road to recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget is built on three strong pillars of infrastructure, education and 
<br/>health, together with  the long term  policies on business and investments.   It  continues the stable, 
<br/></span><span>consistent and the inclusive theme of all Fijian Government plans and strategies and that my friends 
<br/></span><span>is the answer to being on this side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  has  played  a 
<br/>critical role in our journey to economic recovery. With a budget of $97.2 million, we will see to a 
<br/>recovery that is inclusive and a recovery that builds resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  12.4  percent  economic  growth  that  we  are  expecting  is  fuelled  by 
<br/>tourism, contrary to what some other people may believe on the other side where they have got their 
<br/>figures all jumbled up. So is the triple digit (168.3 percent) increase in the demand for labour and 
<br/>increasing vacancies.   By  the way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji  is  the do word for everyone around the 
<br/>world.  They are looking to risk diversify and the one place that they want to come to is Fiji because 
<br/>all will be put in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  first  half  of  this  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  already  recovered  over  half  our 
<br/>tourism numbers for the same period in 2019.  June arrivals were 73 percent of the same month pre-
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pandemic.  These numbers show that we are on an accelerated path to recovery - recovery that will 
<br/>see to, at least, 500,000 visitors to our shores which brings us close to $1.3 billion in revenue this 
<br/>year.  This just did not happen with a flick of a thumb.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  took  a  lot  of  hard  work  from  this  Government  to  do  it  and  by  2024,  we  expect  a  full 
<br/>recovery.  We are where we are today because this Government has delivered on its commitment.  
<br/>We set  ourselves vaccination goals  to  open our  borders.  We achieved that. We worked with  the 
<br/>industry to develop COVID-19 safe protocols to welcome back tourists and open businesses.  We 
<br/>have achieved that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while our priority was to restore jobs, the Opposition was out convincing 
<br/>the public that COVID-19 was a conspiracy.  Like everything that they talk about, it stems from this 
<br/>conspiracy theory that they have.  Everything!  Then also, they came up with the idea that our national 
<br/>airline should not be supported.  Actually that is very unpatriotic.  Who were we going to rely on?  
<br/>Some other airline to bring all the tourists, perhaps some other airline to bring the half-a-million that 
<br/>is being projected already – no.  That is at the bottom of the rung when it comes to patriotism.  In 
<br/>fact, they went as far as saying that we should not open our borders.  But this was part of their plan, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last two years, we made historic tax reforms to afford the industry income and add 
<br/>our competitiveness.  We removed STT, we removed ECAL, we reduced departure taxes and we 
<br/>introduced a tax deduction for engaging local artists.  In this Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these remain 
<br/>because as we promised, we want to give the private sector continued confidence to invest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite what the industry has gone through, we still have honourable Gavoka demanding that 
<br/>taxes Government is owed be paid.  Not a single constructive contribution on his part.  The investors 
<br/>will fly out and never to be seen again, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is not true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- The way that he is looking at it, he has put every tax in the sun back on.  
<br/>It is not going to work, Mr. Speaker.  We are in a different space when it comes to our country.  These 
<br/>measures and this Budget was not designed for immediate relief alone.  It has been carefully designed 
<br/>to create certainty going into the future, a future that they cannot see.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of Tourism Fiji and its marketing grant, the last financial year, Mr. Speaker, Tourism 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  saw  to  our  market  re-entry.    It  also  saw  the  successful  launch  for  our  “Open  for  Happiness 
<br/></span><span>Campaign” but our so-called tourism expert on the other side of Parliament questioned Tourism Fiji’s 
<br/>allocation.  Why so much when the borders were closed?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 230,000 visitors did 
<br/>not just come on their own.  We took ourselves and our message that we are open and safe to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget, we are better resourcing our marketing arm.  We are going 
<br/>to make every marketing dollar count because unlike last year, a number of destinations have now 
<br/>opened up.  That means competition is much stronger and by the way, they all fly Fiji Airways.  In 
<br/>this  financial  year,  Tourism  Fiji  received  a  $1.1  million  increase  in  its  marketing  budget  with  a 
<br/>marketing budget of $22 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism Fiji is working to launch an evolution of the Fijian brand that puts our people, our 
<br/>culture and natural environment firmly at the heart of how we market ourself.  This is very much 
<br/>aligned to Tourism Fiji’s recently launched corporate plan.  We are also looking at new markets, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, having launched a direct route to Adelaide in July.  Fiji Airways will also, later this 
<br/>year, fly direct to Vancouver for the first time.  This is an opportunity to build our presence in the

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>North  American market.   As  you would know, Sir, we have a huge diaspora there which we can 
<br/>actually also tap into too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  aside  from  USA  and  Canada,  we  will  continue  strengthening  our  brand 
<br/>presence in Australia and New Zealand especially with the resumption of direct flights from Sydney 
<br/>and Auckland to Suva.  We will also maintain a conservative budget for the Asian markets such as 
<br/>China and Japan in anticipation of their full opening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  efforts  will  be  supported  by  an  operational  budget  allocation  of 
<br/>approximately $7.5 million.  We are also now embarking on a renewed sectoral framework that will 
<br/>set the course of not only recovery but sustainable growth for the Fijian tourism industry over the 
<br/>next 10 years.  We will do this with the support of International Finance Corporation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to MSMEs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Jale claimed that the support to the 
<br/>people is boomerang aid.  If the Fijian Government had not provided support to the MSMEs from 
<br/>2014, there would not have been a thriving middle-income society, something which they never think 
<br/>of and they fail to see and all MSME owners should listen to this.  At the heart of our recovery is 
<br/>MSMEs, whether it is the market juice seller, the neighbourhood tailor or a family-run garage, these 
<br/></span><span>businesses form the foundation of our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s priority is to raise the productivity of MSMEs and to do 
<br/>so by investing in capabilities that we need for the future. So whether it is a shorter term financial 
<br/>investment such as concessional loans or long-term programmes such as the Northern Development 
<br/>Programme (NDP) or Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES), our investment in MSMEs are here 
<br/>to stay.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  consistent  leadership,  policies  and  sustainable  programmes  are  what  we 
<br/>need. This is clearly not an election Budget or what some might term as a “</span><span>Saqamoli</span><span> Budget”. If it 
<br/>is anything, that particular person’s contribution at a later stage might be worth hearing because it 
<br/>might only be worth one </span><span>saqamoli</span><span> or two.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a clear definitive roadmap to expedite our recovery efforts. 
<br/>Our young innovative entrepreneurs can look forward to the YES programme which has a 95 percent 
<br/>success rate. Our exporters can look forward to the National Export Strategy to enhance exports.  Our 
<br/>grassroot  businesses  in  the  North,  Mr.  Speaker,  can  very  much  look  forward  to  the  Northern 
<br/>Development  Programme.  As  our  rural  and  peri-urban  entrepreneurs  can  continue  accessing  the 
<br/></span><span>Integrated Human Resources Development Programme. The combined project is worth about $1.2 
<br/></span><span>million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our trade specialists such as chefs, plumbers, mechanics, machinists and 
<br/>those  who  are  in  very  high  demand  overseas  also  will  continue  benefiting  from  our  Trade 
<br/>Enhancement Programme.  We introduced the Trade Enhancement Programme, close to about 70 
<br/>percent  of  those  Fijians  were  women.  So,  we  do  not  just  talk  about  women’s  empowerment,  we 
<br/>actually create an enabling environment for them to thrive.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to acknowledge the exciting new product between the Government and Fiji 
<br/>Development  Bank  (FDB)  specifically  dedicated  to  women-led  MSMEs.  This  allocation  of  $1 
<br/>million will complement our work. Our Standardised Road Side Stall Programmes will continue to 
<br/>provide  access.    Further  to  funding  programmes,  our  hand  holding  and  advisory  services  will 
<br/>continue with our training teams with respect to co-operatives.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of Opposition claims of 
<br/>reforms by the Government being imposed on people is very untrue.  We have listened carefully to 
<br/>the concerns of the business community and investors. We have made improvements in the business 
<br/>processes, by modernising old processes and providing information and online at a single point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Bank in a recent survey shows that by just removing the business 
<br/>licences, businesses have saved at least $3.5 million in direct cost savings in addition to the  time 
<br/>saved. This is a very conservative assessment and that too from a single process. There are many 
<br/>other improvements in just starting a business. Just by readily making information available, we are 
<br/>becoming greater catalysts for businesses and investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 1st August, 2022, investing in Fiji will become a significantly easier thing to do rather 
<br/>than in  our history. This  Government  is  making  that happen. The new  Investment  Act  will mean 
<br/>foreign investors no longer require a foreign investment registration certificate.  All investors need 
<br/>to do is legally register their businesses with the Registrar of Companies in line with the Companies 
<br/>Act 2015 and register for a tax number.  All of these can happen online.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Investment Act is developed on international best practice. It is quite a simple Act but 
<br/></span><span>yet again it is criticised by the Opposition.  We have increased transparency but this again also does 
<br/></span><span>not go down well with certain agents who have thrived on making money from delaying processes 
<br/>and blaming the Government on this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr .Speaker, Sir, in terms of transport which is critical to the economy, the Land and Maritime 
<br/>Transport  sector  plays  a  vital  role,  continued  budget  support  to  the  sector  underscores  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government’s commitment to ease accessibility and linkages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been allocated a budget of. $22.4 million to ensure 
<br/>efficiency and effective services.  We are actually also paying equal emphasis to our maritime sector 
<br/>with a budget of over $7 million and the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF) will strengthen 
<br/>its monitoring of all vessels registered in Fiji and regulate all seafearers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this year one of the main shipping operators in Fiji announced the downsizing of its 
<br/>fleets and operations because of the hike in fuel costs. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Jale, 
<br/>I hope you are listening, the Government has stepped in with our Government fleets and other private 
<br/>vessels to continue to operate and serve the maritime Fijians despite these particular constraints.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government continues to subsidise uneconomical sea routes to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that shipping services are provided on a regular basis.  With respect to Government Shipping Services 
<br/>(GSS)  we  have  also  been  providing  services  to  Rotuma,  Yasayasa  Moala,  Upper  Southern  Lau, 
<br/>Beqa/Yanuca/Vatulele, Yasawa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  investment  into  Town  &amp;  Country  Planning,  in  March  2022, 
<br/>approximately $109.2 million had been spent by the public and private sectors in the building and 
<br/>construction industry and that is an increase by 27.6 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is on course to bring those construction permit approvals online 
<br/>in the next 22 months. This will allow for a faster turnaround.  As a Ministry responsible for planning 
<br/>towns, also we will in the new financial year continue the design and build of the new Nabouwalu 
<br/>Passenger  Services  Facility  and  the  waiting  area,  et  cetera,  around  that  particular  area.    The 
<br/>construction proper is expected to commence next year.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  concurrently  the  civil  works  for  Nabouwalu  Town  Centre  will  also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commence with the Phase 1 consisting of the development of eight commercial lots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also just in closing, I am happy to announce that the civil works and the earth works tender 
<br/>have been advertised for the Keiyasi Town Centre development and the works have commenced in 
<br/>the new financial year with an allocation of $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the time, I would like to just remind the Opposition that we are 
<br/>constructing a better and resilient Fiji.  The aggregates for this country construction are the policies 
<br/>and strategies which are a fundamental part of the building of foundations.  The 2022-2023 Budget 
<br/>is back filling the trench and the holes that have been created by the pandemic that our foundation 
<br/>for the future is actually stronger.  The FijiFirst Government is the beams that will hold the main 
<br/>walls of the economy together by steadily implementing programmes for the betterment of our people 
<br/>today and also for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope the general public heard what I said today and I wholeheartedly support the 2022-2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget and look forward to the new financial year with a reinvigorated outlook.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M.T. NAULUMATUA.- I respond to the Budget Estimate for 2022-2023.  The 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>dear  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  it  gives  me  great  pleasure  to  reply  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service,  Communications,  Housing  and 
<br/>Community Development on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 as presented to Parliament a 
<br/>week ago on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hold  the  position  of  being  Opposition’s  spokesperson  for  Housing  and  Community 
<br/>Development and obviously this is one of the most crucial sectors of our economy.  I am, therefore, 
<br/>going to address my portfolio in two folds.  The first being the aspect of housing provision and the 
<br/>second being the progressive development of such a basic human right to ensure a safe, inclusive and 
<br/>fair community that looks after the interests of all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the right to housing and sanitation is enshrined in Fiji’s 2013 Constitution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the Bill of Rights Section 35 which states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1) The State must take reasonable measures within its available resources to achieve 
<br/>the progressive realisation of the right of every person to accessible and adequate 
<br/></span><span>housing and sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In applying any right under this section, if the State claims that it does not have 
<br/>the resources to implement the right, it is the responsibility of the State to show 
<br/>that the resources are not available.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  reviewing  the  2022-2023  Budget  Estimates  against  the  portfolio  of 
<br/>Housing  and  Community  Development,  I  must  say  that  this  Budget  generally  looks  like  a  good 
<br/>Budget and it should.  In  any  event,  budgets  are  generally  positive  plans  for  development  for  any 
<br/>government of the day.  They capture the plans, policies and aspirations a  government has for its 
<br/>people, and may therefore fully meet the expectations of our communities, or fall short of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can only say a budget was honest and correct a year from now and when 
<br/>we review this current Budget and see how much actually happened as was planned for and so whilst 
<br/>it looks good, I will be reserved with supporting it as we wait for the Government to do the necessary 
<br/>and ensure it delivers on its promises and plans and I am sure it will. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  to  understand  that  in  a  growing  economy  and  with  an 
<br/>increasing population, housing needs will always be a priority.   In recent years, the rural to urban 
<br/>drift has had a direct impact on infrastructural capabilities and the demand for decent and affordable 
<br/>housing  has  driven  many  to  desperate  measures  as  the  prices  for  rented  homes  or  for  permanent 
<br/>homes have become out-of-reach for so many of our people and continuing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result of the high demand and the inability of many to meet increasing housing market 
<br/>prices, squatter settlements continue to mushroom everywhere and people are now moving further 
<br/>away from the commercial business districts as they opt for more affordable houses, making people 
<br/>leave as early as 4.00 a.m. for their workplaces just to be able to get to work and school on time.  I 
<br/>know because I have many such workers who express to me their challenges with such demand on 
<br/>their time and health, having to try and battle with massive traffic jams during peak travelling hours.  
<br/>So, when we note the Budget allocated for the new financial year against that of last year, we record 
<br/>an increase from $13.525 million in the Actual 2020-2021 to an estimate of $30.3 million for the 
<br/>Year 2022-2023.  This is good but not good enough, however. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst I am pleased to read and know that Government intends to continue 
<br/>strengthening the policy, operational and legal frameworks for the  housing sector in Fiji with the 
<br/></span><span>intention of increasing the supply of affordable housing through engagement of the private sector to 
<br/></span><span>meet the increasing demand for home ownership, I feel that Government should be doing much more 
<br/>to provide such a basic need of having a roof over one’s head, so that people can be accorded their 
<br/>human dignity to call a home their own permanent and private space.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  State-owned  properties  should  be  built  to  assist  low  to  medium  income 
<br/>owners, and with the many Crown land and even native land available in plentiful supply around our 
<br/>country, Government must take the lead role to assist by building such homes for people to be able 
<br/>to afford, as an investment for their families now and into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Rental Board properties and Housing Authority residential homes 
<br/>are  a  good  example  of  what  the  State  should  be  providing.    I  implore  Government  to  find  good 
<br/>executives and workers for these two important entities and ensure they are provided with budgetary 
<br/>support to extend the services robustly and extensively around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is heart-breaking, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to see the people living in poor squatter settlements 
<br/>where sanitation issues are prevalent and the health and dignity of people are very depressed.  For 
<br/>example, there are 200 squatter settlements in Fiji with a population of approximately 140,000 people 
<br/></span><span>as  from  the  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics,  2017  or  approximately  20  percent  of  voter  population  (as 
<br/></span><span>140,000 over 670,000 is equal to 20 percent). This is a lot of people to help for a small developing 
<br/>island economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As someone from the private sector, I am of the strong view that Government can do a lot 
<br/>with the assistance and collaboration of the two entities.  I have just mentioned the Housing Authority 
<br/>and Public Rental Board must work together with local town councils who will be familiar with the 
<br/>development needs of their various localities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  must  say,  therefore,  that  in  this  respect  as  a  fundamental  part  of 
<br/>governance, I look forward to see changes in the decentralisation of power from Government to the 
<br/>town and city councils for the empowerment of ratepayers to sit on their own Councils for desired 
<br/>changes and reforms, modelled as belt and braces for balance from the bottom up, ensuring essential 
<br/>service  provision  as  well  as  to  keep  powerful,  honest  and  accountable  to  the  people  for  their 
<br/>democratic rights to be served.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1561 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having town and city councils elected by our people will provide them with 
<br/>a sense of ownership and responsibility to serve the communities well and diligently during their 
<br/>term in office.  So the Government can do further by encouraging and challenging such town and 
<br/>city  councils  to  take  the  lead  role  in  facilitating  housing  projects  to  meet  the  needs  of  our 
<br/>communities.  It is basic and common logic to entice the carrot and the stick approach to allow growth 
<br/>in  our  communities  and  Government  must  always  be  perceptive  and  strategic  for  its  targeted 
<br/>development such as housing provision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no way Government can continue to do a top down approach and expect the country 
<br/>to progress and for development to be sustainable.  There must be involvement of our people, and so 
<br/>bringing the voting of local councillors back to run the town and city councils will be part of that 
<br/>process  of  public  and  community  engagement  to  ensure  leadership  and  national  development  is 
<br/>inclusive and engaging.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we discuss the role of the State, it is important to draw from recent lessons 
<br/>learnt.  The  Lagilagi  Housing  project  should  not  have  ended  in  the  way  it  did,  and  whilst  the 
<br/>Government must be commended for stepping in to correct the shameful way the applicants for those 
<br/>homes were treated, it is very crucial that the State recognises the lead role it needs to play.  It is 
<br/></span><span>Government that has the systems and structure to monitor and provide such crucial services, such as 
<br/></span><span>providing housing to support communities.  Thus, it will be best that Government and its institutions 
<br/>manage these systems effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was the purpose of the 1996 Public Enterprises Act and Government must reflect and 
<br/>take decisive decisions now and by doing so, revolutionise our housing needs once and for all.  This 
<br/>will take strong political will to prioritise one of the most basic needs of human life.  In all honesty, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, for safety and human decency, we can survive with no electricity and some access to 
<br/>water, as long as they have a home that is safe for human occupation, many will be very blessed and 
<br/>at peace to raise a family in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  now  address  the  second  part  of  my  development  portfolio  that  says  housing  for 
<br/>community development.  As pointed out  earlier, as  a result of people  wishing to  look for better 
<br/>opportunities for their families, there has been massive rural to urban migration over the years in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am going to thank Government for extending educational opportunities out in the maritime 
<br/>and rural areas from primary school to Year 13 - thank you.  In almost all areas around Fiji, thank 
<br/>you again.  This is most commendable as previously attaining further studies was one of the principal 
<br/></span><span>reasons why families moved to the urban centres so that their children could further their studies and 
<br/></span><span>go into finding decent jobs.  With the assistance to extend educational provisions through schools in 
<br/>rural  and  maritime  areas,  Government  will  also  find  that  many  are  now  building  their  homes  in 
<br/>villages as the cost of living in urban centres escalate and people find it hard to continue to sustain 
<br/>themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During COVID-19, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be aware, that many who lost their jobs from 
<br/>the tourism industry and other sectors around Fiji made their way back to their villages, especially 
<br/>the indigenous people who could do so.  The solution for proper housing in rural areas must also be 
<br/>Government-focused.  It is noted that those living in villages can also use their FNPF to build homes 
<br/>for themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would rather that Government encourage the good use of funds kept in 
<br/>Fijian Holdings  Limited from the various  provinces to be used to assist villagers build homes for 
<br/>their people through affordable housing projects, rather than  encouraging people to  dig into their 
<br/>social pension savings which is supposed to look after them in their old age.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must be creative and the State with its control over institutions like the 
<br/>Fijian Holdings  as part owners, have to be encouraged  to take the lead role to make those shares 
<br/>worthwhile for those who must benefit from them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am aware of the First Home Owner Scheme established in 2018 to assist 
<br/>first time home owners in Fiji. That was a commendable policy which must be encouraged to be 
<br/>extended as much as possible for home owners.  Whilst I understand it is only provided to those who 
<br/>are applying for assistance from commercial banks for land with titles, or those on </span><span>mataqali</span><span> owned 
<br/>land of which they are a member, the $10,000 grant by Government must be increased to at least 
<br/>$20,000 to equate for the rising cost of building materials and transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  it  would  also  be  important  that  similar  financial  assistance  is  channelled  to 
<br/>address the squatting problems.  All Government needs to do is to progressively build State homes 
<br/>at a decent cost of $20,000 each, and settling such vulnerable people on State-owned land, or land 
<br/>that Government can lease from native landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must speak solutions and I am someone who has made a lot of effort to 
<br/></span><span>be part of the solution in this country by engaging in a business that supports workers and families, 
<br/></span><span>and  continues  to  do  so  by  entering  into  new  ventures  which  I  hope  will  encourage  the  further 
<br/>development of our people and communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to share that my company is working on extending a franchise scheme 
<br/>for the people of Uruone, Lomaloma in Vanuabalavu where these villages will run their own baking 
<br/>shop assisted by Hot Bread Kitchen.  Our company is meeting the costs of the building and machinery 
<br/>along  with  this  group  of  villagers  because  I  believe  in  capacity  building  for  our  people,  and 
<br/>encouraging them to do what they can do for themselves.  To give them fishing lines to fish, and to 
<br/>teach them to fish for a lifetime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under my company, we are pursuing farming in a land that we 
<br/>plan to transform into a bubbling agriculture and commercial centre in Naitasiri.  Whilst we recognise 
<br/>the need to grow the things we need to use in our shops like lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, garlic, herbs  
<br/>mint, basil, coriander, oregano, capsicum et cetera, we also have in mind furthering our commercial 
<br/>investment by entering into possibilities of exporting organic agriculture products such as turmeric, 
<br/>ginger,  </span><span>dalo</span><span>,  </span><span>saigen</span><span>, breadfruit, jackfruit and medicinal  cannabis,  et  cetera.  This, of course,  will 
<br/>allow  for  more  job  creation  and  ultimately  the  surrounding  community  can  benefit  with  other 
<br/></span><span>development plans in store. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, for four years my company began sponsoring a programme 
<br/>called the “Beacon Media Ministries”, an education programme with an Australian Director, Mrs 
<br/>Cheryl Reid and whose Chairperson is Mr. Patrick Bower, a renowned community leader of Fiji, 
<br/>principal,  teacher  and  Christian  by  education  and  practice.    What  we  have  done  is  to  provide 
<br/>sponsorship for numeracy and literacy programme to assist and teach literacy to Years 2, 3 and 4 
<br/>students who struggle with these two subjects through extra classes that have been approved by the 
<br/>Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts (MEHA). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we are limited to just a few schools in a year, where such classes are provided through 
<br/>trained  teaching  assistants  from  communities  and  retired  teachers,  we  believe  in  supporting 
<br/>programmes as such which can add value to our society and in particular, to the lives of our young 
<br/>people who really are the future.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1563 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  impact  of  this  teaching  programme  ensures  those  left  behind  in  the 
<br/>education system are assisted through teaching aids and phonics, to recognise sounds and words for 
<br/>example,  and  be  able  to  create  their  own  learning,  remembering  skills  and  write  questions  and 
<br/>answers as the beginning of their awareness and ability to understand and develop through education 
<br/>and training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to some, this assistance may be miniscule and to some, we should leave this 
<br/>sector to the Ministry of Education.  I disagree because I have opted to support such a programme that 
<br/>is  similar  to  what  some  school  parents  association  do  by  engaging  part-time  teachers  during  exam 
<br/>preparations to teach children through extra classes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is a well-known fact that a lot of children who do not learn to read and write well 
<br/>often  end  up  in  the  criminal  system  where  they  learn  to  lie  and  cheat  as  a  way  to  cope  with  life.  
<br/>Recidivism - what a high cost of wastage of human values in the criminal system because they were left 
<br/>behind.  But this is why, Mr. Speaker, I personally believe that as community members and leaders and 
<br/>as entrepreneurs, those of us who are in a position to assist and develop our people, must do so.  It is our 
<br/>collective role and not that of government alone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my personal vision as an entrepreneur has always been to be successful in what we 
<br/></span><span>do to allow my family and I to live reasonably decent lives and to use whatever wealth that has been 
<br/>accumulated to be channelled for the development of our people and communities.  This is why I engage 
<br/>in community projects of various kinds and  I have planned in world that even when  I am no longer 
<br/>around, my assets will continue to be used to develop those that need support in society through the 
<br/>development of their communities with what we can assist them with or to educational sponsorships to 
<br/>needy students that my company has provided over the years in whatever capacity we can.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I applaud TELS and Toppers of Government that has been able to assist students in 
<br/>this nation. There are, however, gaps that the private sector can fill.  For instance, there are students who 
<br/>did not sit Form Seven or Year 13 and do not wish to pursue Technical and Vocational Education and 
<br/>Training (TVET) funded course.  They have managed to further their studies in tertiary institutions and 
<br/>wish to go straight into degree programmes which Government has now tagged as a priority for funding 
<br/>support like medicine or law where only limited assistance is provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my company has assisted many such students and we have and continue to employ 
<br/>many who need such financial support over the years.  Just last Thursday, my company entered into a 
<br/>partnership with the Yatu Lau Board to provide funding to the Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara Education Trust 
<br/></span><span>Fund to go towards support for education and training in business, accounting and economics for the 
<br/></span><span>people of Lau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a lot of people do not know that the late former Prime Minister’s mother and my 
<br/>mother are biological sisters and thus, Ratu Mara and I are first cousins.  I say this briefly because I want 
<br/>to be able to acknowledge as well all that he has contributed to this great nation of ours and I believe it is 
<br/>through visionary leaders like him that Fiji has grown into an amazing multiracial country that must not 
<br/>be allowed to fall back into ruin because of politicians who have little or nothing to show for their words.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have shared quite a few things that my company and I do to support our economic 
<br/>and  social  development  and  networking  in  Fiji.    I  have  no  doubt  that  there  are  many  others  in  our 
<br/>communities who do the same.  I implore Government to thus provide support to entities like ours by 
<br/>way of good strong economic policies and subsidies that can assist moral capitalism, grow holistically 
<br/>and even further.  The world is round connected by interdependent biodiversity ecosystems and we must 
<br/>all be part of growing our world for added value and ensuring we do not become greedy people, only 
<br/>taking from our customers and not giving back.

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I will also encourage Government to ensure Fiji takes advantage of 
<br/>the digitalised world to improve and address a lot of gaps in our service provisions, especially linking 
<br/>government ministries and the private sector for instance.  This is an area that Government must capitalise 
<br/>and grow to be able to successfully manage and develop our long-term development goals that leave no 
<br/>one behind in poverty or gender inequality.  In the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2030) 
<br/>ratified by Fiji in 2017 plus the Blue, Green and Brown Pacific 2050, for the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century times and 
<br/>connectivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will end by encouraging us all as national leaders to be mindful of the upcoming 
<br/>national elections and what our roles need to be.  We must remember we are here because our people 
<br/>need leaders who will think of them and act ethnically and responsibly.  I, therefore, hope that political 
<br/>parties will be mindful of the calibre of people they choose as candidates and not allow just anyone to 
<br/>contest elections under their banner because they need candidates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This august Parliament needs people who have a moral compass and who will not be here because 
<br/>they want to fill their personal wallets.  We need principled people who have the resources that can be 
<br/>utilised for those in need.  We must not encourage those who think this is a place where they can come 
<br/>and earn some money after they retire. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is a beautiful nation with mostly loving and genuinely kind people.  This was evident during 
<br/>the  COVID-19  pandemic  when  we  gelled  as  a  community  to  assist  each  other.    We  must  always 
<br/>remember that politics aside we are one people with a common goal and this is to be a nation that we can 
<br/>all be proud of.  A nation that is economically viable and peaceful, accommodating of needs of all and 
<br/>one that learns from its many painful lessons of the past.  God Bless Fiji and God Bless Us All.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, 
<br/>the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  viewers  and  listeners; 
<br/>thank you for the opportunity to speak in support of the 2022-2023 National Budget.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 National Budget, once again, proves that the FijiFirst Government’s commitment 
<br/>to its people remain focussed.  This Budget puts Fiji and Fijians on the path of social and economic 
<br/>recovery and seeks to lessen the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in 
<br/>Ukraine that has pushed up the price of goods and services worldwide.  The honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy, the Permanent Secretary and his team must be commended for a responsible compassionate 
<br/>and forward looking budget drawn after a countrywide consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while everyday Fijians are very appreciative of the initiative contained in the 
<br/></span><span>Budget for children, students, women, youths, pensioners and social welfare recipients, businesses, health 
<br/>service providers, teachers, Civil Servants and so on, the Opposition looks more stress and desperate than 
<br/>ever.  Desperate because it becomes harder for them to convince the people of this country with their lies 
<br/>and misinformation and stressed because they do not have any alternative measures or policies, thus far 
<br/>going forward to the election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the Budget announcement, the Opposition and other failed politicians were busy fabricating 
<br/>misinformation and lies so that they can hoodwink the public and lead them away from the real intention 
<br/>of the Budget, which is to genuinely assist the ordinary Fijians to buffer the high cost of living.  In fact, 
<br/>they have been very disrespectful to everyday Fijians for whom the Government has been a pillar of 
<br/>support. Steering Fiji out of the troubled waters caused by 14 cyclones since 2016 and a once-in-a-century 
<br/>deadly pandemic affecting lives and livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government provided relief and support to the most vulnerable Fijians and continues 
<br/>to do so.  Relief measures which the Opposition termed as “freebies” or “handouts” is insulting Fijians 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are facing hardship.  Some of these people are your own relatives, your neighbours, or friends that 
<br/>you know of.  Whenever the Government provides assistance to our people, the Opposition panics and 
<br/>calls it freebies and handouts because posturing is more important to them than actually helping the people 
<br/>they pretend they are speaking for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, the term “freebies” or “handouts” and the insinuation is quite disgusting.  
<br/>The People’s Alliance Party (PAP), National Federation Party (NFP), Unity Party and SODELPA and 
<br/>other critics should honestly tell us now if they are going to remove all these things they call “freebies” - 
<br/>tell the nation and let the nation know.  Are they going to remove free education?  It seems like it because 
<br/>according to them it is a freebie.  Are they going to remove electricity and water subsidies?  Are they 
<br/>going to remove First Home Buyers Assistance which we have heard from honourable Dr. Mere T.S. 
<br/>Naulumatua.   Are they going to remove Sanitary Pads Assistance given to thousands of girls in our 
<br/>schools? Or are they going to remove Social Pension Scheme and Subsidised Fare for elderly and disabled 
<br/>persons and so on? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the announcement of the 2022-2023 National Budget and even before 
<br/>that,  the  Opposition  had  done  nothing  but  tried  to  suck  the  happiness,  joy  and  hope  out  of  ordinary 
<br/>citizens.  They have done the only thing that they are capable of doing – criticise, criticise and criticise 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Minister for Economy.  But their destructive criticism will not deter this Government to 
<br/></span><span>create a modern Fiji for all Fijians through various initiatives.  It is the hard work of this Government to 
<br/>give our fellow citizens safety, security, hope and opportunities which is the hallmark of this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget provides well thought out measures that puts the economy resolutely 
<br/>on the path of recovery, as well as builds on the foundation that the Government had laid since COVID-
<br/>19 affected us.  Sir, with Government’s sustainable policies and their decisive actions, we have persevered 
<br/>despite the gloom and doom picture painted by the Opposition and critics, where the learned Professor 
<br/>from compared Fiji’s situations similar to Sri Lanka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, comparing Fiji to Sri Lanka is 
<br/>like comparing the price of lamb chops to butter.  It just makes no sense.  This Sri Lanka example is being 
<br/>used to instil fear in the minds of Fijians that this Government will fail the same way as Sri Lanka.  He 
<br/>deliberately avoids telling our people what our foreign reserve is; liquidity in the domestic market and 
<br/>whether Fiji has ever defaulted its loan repayment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no matter how hard they try, it is very difficult to mislead our citizens who have 
<br/>seen the achievements of the FijiFirst Government under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/>We have supported our people before - throughout the pandemic and post pandemic - rolling out various 
<br/>initiatives through the 2020–2021 National Budget, Revised 2021–2022 National Budget and now the 
<br/></span><span>2022–2023  National  Budget  which  consolidates  and  strengthens  our  policies  and  strategies  further 
<br/></span><span>through supportive initiatives in all sectors of our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two and half years when Fiji faced major blow caused by the COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic, we all know how decisively the Government acted to address the challenges that befell our 
<br/>nation.  During that time, and if one goes through the Budget book, they will be able to see </span><span>Hansard</span><span>
<br/>records et cetera.  The other side of Parliament were, all the time, simply asking the Government to lock 
<br/>down.  That was their strategy - just lock the country whereas our Prime Minister stood firm and the 
<br/>decision was to vaccinate, vaccinate and vaccinate and that is how we succeeded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  all  these,  Fiji  has  managed  to  get  substantial  grants,  budget  support  and  highly 
<br/>concessional loans which the Opposition and critics term as begging without showing any empathy to 
<br/>the most vulnerable members  of our communities.  These funds were directed either as employment 
<br/>benefits, food distribution, connecting household to water, electricity and internet for education, pension 
<br/>and many more.  This just goes to show that they do not care about Fijians in need.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Australia also gave a one-off $250 to its citizens as cost of living payment.  This 
<br/>assistance was not criticised by the Opposition because it was for Australians at the time of need, but 
<br/>unfortunately that maturity is not here.  They just lack maturity to really understand that this assistance is 
<br/>really for the people.  They fail to realise that Fiji has an excellent relationship with the development 
<br/>partners who step in to assist.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, agencies such as World Bank, ADB, JICA, IMF and 
<br/>countries  like  Australia,  New  Zealand  and  Japan  have  publicly  praised  Fiji  for  its  transparent  and 
<br/>excellent management of finances and the resurgence of  the economy with employment almost back to 
<br/>normal and with tourist numbers rising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the budget allocation to the Ministry of Education, Heritage 
<br/>and  Arts  because  while  many  Governments  are  reducing  funding  for  education,  our  Government 
<br/>continues to give it the highest priority. For the next financial year, the Ministry has received the highest 
<br/>budget for various scholarships and loans to adjust teachers’ salary, pay rural allowances, support school 
<br/>infrastructure and increase transport cost amongst other things.  Overall the education sector received a 
<br/>budget of $713.4 million which includes $162.6 million for TELS Scholarships, loans and grants. This 
<br/>signifies the Government’s commitment to build a knowledge-based society and investing in education 
<br/>is the way to achieve it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure teachers are relieved to know that the anomalies in their salaries will 
<br/></span><span>be addressed while providing incentives for others to upgrade their qualification.  The Ministry is working 
<br/>with the Ministry of Civil Service to implement the processes so that the salaries of fully qualified teachers 
<br/>move to Band F, Step 3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  planned  to  make  several  changes  to  build  resilience  in 
<br/>education delivery using this budget.  The efforts of the Ministry will be to reach out to our students in 
<br/>the rural, remote and maritime areas.  Sir, as education transforms we cannot afford to increase the gap 
<br/>between students who have better access and those who do not.  The Ministry has already started working 
<br/>on developing e-Learning resources for students and is creating a model classroom for Year 1 students at 
<br/>Delainamasi Government School.  This will become the model for other schools to follow in future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  Ministry  is  utilising  ADB  funding  to  create  open  education  resources  for 
<br/>secondary school students in STEM subjects that is Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.   
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our rural, remote and maritime schools need assistance to improve infrastructure - an 
<br/>allocation of $12 million has been made to build or improve school infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the $60 million inflation mitigation package will see every child from birth up 
<br/></span><span>to Year 13 from families with a combined income of less than $50,000, receive a dollar a day over the 
<br/></span><span>next six months to help families cope with the rising food prices.  Sir, 30,000 tertiary students will also 
<br/>receive $180 in two instalments.  This is yet another assistance by the FijiFirst Government for the welfare 
<br/>of our children and the youths.  In addition to the existing allowance, free education, transport assistance, 
<br/>free textbooks and sanitary pads assistance are already in place.  Now you, may question why for six 
<br/>months?  It is expected that inflationary trends or pressures will stabilise and of course after six months, 
<br/>this will be reviewed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TSLS has become the funding investment and empowerment agency for Fiji’s 
<br/>future  enabling  our  students  to  accomplish  their  educational  dreams.  It  is  evident  through  TSLS 
<br/>sponsorship and funding of education from Certificate III to PhD level.  For the first time, the Government 
<br/>is providing 10 PhD and 20 Masters Research Scholarships.  In the new financial year, the Government 
<br/>has allocated 8,000 awards for TELS and doubled the scholarships from 600 to 1,200 awards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  rebranding  of  TVET  to  Skills  Qualification  is  a  positive  measure  of  equal  respect  and 
<br/>importance  to  change  the  mindsets  slowly  towards  the  study.    We  are  not  only  reinstating  overseas 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1567 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>scholarships, but also doubling the allocation from 20 to 40.  This also includes overseas scholarships for 
<br/>Skills Qualification.  This allocation is a commitment to empowering Fijians through qualifications that 
<br/>are not available locally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the provision of grants to achieve micro qualification in construction skill set 
<br/>will help provide the much needed boost to the construction industry workforce.  A total of 200 grants of 
<br/>up to $500 per student has been allocated for this purpose.  Apart from scholarships, students are provided 
<br/>with the opportunity for tertiary education through study loans with very low or zero interest rate.  Where 
<br/>else can you get a loan with 50 percent discount if you paid back within two years or three years, and 
<br/>where else can you get loans at a zero interest rate?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The initiative on sanitary pads for female students, continues.  It ensures that girls do not miss 
<br/>school, simply because they could not afford sanitary products.  In the current financial year, 64,340 girls 
<br/>were assisted.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will subsidise 10 percent towards bus fares in the new 
<br/>financial year.  This will assist families further.  This year, 93,114 students were assisted with bus fares 
<br/>and  over  34,000  students  used  more  than  500  RSL  service  providers.    These  are  primarily  small 
<br/>businesses in the rural-remote and maritime areas.  An additional $16.9million has been allocated to meet 
<br/>increase in bus fares and increased cost to RSL service providers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is a sector that has been severely affected globally by the pandemic.  
<br/>Consequently,  there  have  been  several  discussions  globally  about  transforming  education  to  build 
<br/>resilience  to  avoid  such  shocks  causing  devastating  impact  in  the  future.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  this 
<br/>transformation, the Secretary-General of the United Nations will hold the Education Summit during the 
<br/>UN General Assembly in September.  It will take global commitment, adequate financing and long term 
<br/>investment to transform education so that it is resilient and fit for purpose.  I am also proud to say that 
<br/>Fiji is co-chairing with Belgium the thematic area on financing education at the Transforming Education 
<br/>Summit in September.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Fiji  recently  became  a member  of the  Global Partnership in Education, the 
<br/>largest  multilateral  body  that  funds  education  initiatives.    We  have  received  over  US$0.5million  to 
<br/>develop Fiji’s 10-year education sector plan.  I know we have been talking a lot in this Parliament about 
<br/>setting up an Education Commission to review the education sector, but this 10-year education sector 
<br/>plan will just do that.  We anticipate that this plan will be ready by mid-2023 and it will be done through 
<br/>consultation.    This  plan  is  going  to  be  different  from  the  Education  Commission  Report,  which  had 
<br/>hundreds of recommendations.  This will analyse each sector clearly with the budget and implementation 
<br/>plan so that it can be monitored properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me respond to the honourable Leawere regarding the grog consumption.  We 
<br/>all know, not all teachers drink grog.  We also know that if teachers drink grog after school, it is not 
<br/>anyone’s concern.  Obviously, our concern or anyone’s concern should be when a teacher does not turn 
<br/>up to school or if he or she is in the school but disappears in the quarters to take a nap.  That is a concern.   
<br/>These  topics  were  discussed  at  the  Fiji  Principal’s  Association  Meeting  and  it  was  simply  an 
<br/>employer-employee  discussion  where  the  principals  were  told  to  be  vigilant  because  of  the 
<br/>complaints being received from the school management, committee members as well as the parents. 
<br/>It  simply  means  that  you  are  trying  to  disregard  this  discipline  issue.    Are  you  encouraging 
<br/>indiscipline in schools which will have an impact on our students?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Minister,  do  not  carry  out  a  conversation  with  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leawere, but address the  Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to the Ministry of Local Government.  Its 
<br/>budgetary allocation of $20.6 million is an increase by 95 percent.  The Local Government is at the 
<br/>heart of our communities providing essential and everyday services to our citizens to make our cities 
<br/>and towns a better place to live, visit and invest.  Funds have been allocated for capital projects to 
<br/>financially strengthen municipal councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taveuni  Satellite  Project  -  for  the  Taveuni  Satellite  market,  $75,000  from  Rural  Local 
<br/>Authority Grant will go towards the site preparation, survey works and land acquisition.  I take this 
<br/>opportunity to  thank the honourable  Leader of the Opposition  for  facilitating  a suitable site  for  a 
<br/>market in Naqara.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Navua Market built in the 1970s along the river bank has limited space which 
<br/>caters for vendors from Beqa, Raiwaqa, Serua and Namosi.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $200,000 is allocated 
<br/>to undertake preparatory work to relocate to the current Navua Police Station site.  The Navua Police 
<br/>Station will move to the old hospital site. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nakasi Market - Mr. Speaker, Sir, $750,000 is provided for the new Nakasi Market (behind 
<br/>RB Southpoint) to relocate roadside vendors.  Construction to begin by the end of this year, in other 
<br/>words, the tender was called and we are at the tender assessment stage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Savusavu Market - the awarding of tender to build the new and modern Savusavu Market 
<br/>based on the blue town concept is underway with ground breaking schedule for late August.  This 
<br/>Market will have a coffee shop, an information booth and boutique, a handicraft area, food kiosk and 
<br/>a 150-seat conference room. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka Market – Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Market is in the construction phase, a sum of $1.7 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million is allocated to complete this project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Local Government Act review, as mentioned earlier on in Parliament, considering the 
<br/>review of the Town and Country Planning Act and Subdivision Act is now complete, it is time to 
<br/>review the Local Government Act to meet the changing demands of the ratepayers and communities; 
<br/>$50,000 is allocated for the review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2022-2023  National  Budget  has  been  hailed  as  a  responsible, 
<br/></span><span>compassionate and creative budget by all sections of the community except the usual critics who are 
<br/>known to oppose everything that this Government does.  This Government will continue to do what 
<br/>is best for our people and we will continue providing opportunities for our people to prosper.  We 
<br/>will continue to build one nation for all Fijians rather than dividing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2022-2023 National Budget as presented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the 2022-2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Budget which was announced by the honourable Attorney-General on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, I will fail in my duty as a precious creation of God the supreme Creator of this 
<br/>universe if I do not convey my heart full thanks, gratitude and praise the Almighty for His divine 
<br/>guidance, life and inner strength to enable me to stand before you in this august Parliament.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1569 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been the behaviour of the FijiFirst Government to make Budget announcements at night 
<br/>for the last seven years.  I was wondering whether I will get an answer, finally, I have come to a 
<br/>conclusion that this is the style of leadership by this Government.  They have a dictatorial policy. 
<br/>They dictate power, they dictate law, they dictate the government system, they dictate religion, they 
<br/>dictate over the</span><span> vanua</span><span> and they dictate over the resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In simple terms, this Government is in control of every matter in the country.  They have 
<br/>orders or principles that must be obeyed.  If anyone disobeyed or goes against the Government, they 
<br/>are fired if they are in Government or face consequences illegally.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this style of 
<br/>leadership will never steer our nation to prosperity but to a deteriorating state of the economy which 
<br/>will lead to instability of our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted that the annual revenue is $2.9 million, expenditure of $3.9 
<br/>million plus the loan repayment of $370,489.30 will bring a deficit of $1.1 million.  This is the trend 
<br/>that had been used in the last several years of budgeting.  The 2021-2022 Budget has a deficit of $1.9 
<br/>million.  Sir, no wonder our nation incurs a debt close to $10 billion.  This is due to over expenditure 
<br/>that leads to excessive loans.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a government would seek loan only for the purpose of any 
<br/></span><span>major national project.  I understand Nabouwalu/Dreketi Highway was the only major project for the 
<br/>last  16  years.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  debt  of  $10  billion  is  a  result  of  the  FijiFirst  Government’s 
<br/>behaviour of leadership which is something unwelcomed and unpleasant.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to speak on various initiatives introduced by the Government.  I 
<br/>appreciate  that  those  initiatives  are  necessary  to  meet  the  social  needs  of  the  people  of  Fiji  - 
<br/>connectivity,  electricity  access  and  farm  roads,  affordable  homes,  welfare  fund,  free  water,  SME 
<br/>loans, et cetera.  These are issues that any Government would address in a sustainable approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in old age pension fund, free bus fares and support fund for children in schools 
<br/>are some of the initiatives that I feel are not necessary.  We are not against the initiative of supporting 
<br/>the  people  but  we  are  very  much  concerned  about  the  revenue  and  the  income  that  we  are 
<br/>overspending which causes a lot of debt to our country.  The type of support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel 
<br/>is not necessary because they are uneconomical.  The people need to contribute to the economy of 
<br/>our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is how I feel about the initiatives.  This spoon-fed policy motivated 
<br/></span><span>many Fijians to be lazy and reliant.  It would be better to grant the funds to farmers because they will 
<br/></span><span>generate income and contribute to the growth of our nation’s economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on to the iTaukei Affairs Board, their budget increased from $14.3 million 
<br/>to $15.4 million; I have an issue.  The Government provides funding to provincial offices for salaries 
<br/>and wages of staff only.  The issue is that the operating fund is provided by levies from provincial 
<br/>councils, provincial income, dividends from investment and the profit from provincial companies.  
<br/>Unlike government departments, the operating fund is provided.  Why not the provincial offices?  
<br/>They are performing similar services which other government offices do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request the honourable Prime Minister to relook and reconsider this issue; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Government to provide operating expenses for provincial offices to allow provincial business 
<br/>arms to expand their business entity.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue is the provincial clerk salaries. For many years their salary has been stagnant 
<br/>at $14,000 and has not been reviewed.  A request to the honourable Prime Minister for your directive 
<br/>to consider increasing to a reasonable recommended maximum salary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  an  issue  with  the  Fiji  Police  Force,  this  is  about  the  Dog  Unit.  
<br/>Currently  this  unit  has  nine  dogs  -  trackers  and  sniffers.  Considering  the  increase  of  criminal 
<br/>activities, there is a need to increase the number of police dogs.  I appreciate the initiative of sending 
<br/>six officers for training as this will provide additional six dogs and handlers for the Fiji Police Force. 
<br/>This will definitely boost the performance of the Dog Unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank this Unit, the dog handlers for the untiring effort both day and 
<br/>night.  Their  achievements  are  appreciated  which  has  contributed  to  the  recovery,  arrest  and 
<br/>conviction of offenders and their contribution towards the economy. Taking into consideration their 
<br/>achievement, I suggest that the honourable Minister look into the welfare of the dog handlers. I am 
<br/>told  they  are  paid  about  $24  a  fortnight,  the  current  dog  handlers’  allowances.  I  request  the 
<br/>honourable Minister to review the allowance of dog handlers and increase to a reasonable rate. The 
<br/>Unit is happy and awaiting the completion of the new building to provide dog canals.  I hope these 
<br/>dog canals will be professional ones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  (FRA)  has  allocated  $5.5  million  to  the 
<br/>reinstatement of non-FRA roads.  I hope the Nasasa/Nadogo/Valovoni Road in Saqani is included in 
<br/>this allocation. This  road needs to  be upgraded  and maintained to  FRA  standard to  provide  good 
<br/>access roads to the most vulnerable people in the interior of Saqani. Now, a new school has been 
<br/>established  at  Valovoni  that  accommodates  the  children  of  farmers  in  the  Nadogo,  Vagani  and 
<br/>Valovoni villages.  Their only means of transportation access in the interior is by road, unlike those 
<br/>living  along  the  coast,  even  without  the  road  they  can  travel  by  sea  using  boat  as  a  means  of 
<br/>transportation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The $5.5 million allocation for bus shelters, construction of footpath and streetlights should 
<br/>be converted to upgrading and maintenance of roads. The bus shelter, streetlights and footpath is not 
<br/>a priority as compared to the need for the road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people in various places where there is no connectivity like the interior of 
<br/>Dogotuki,  Udu  Point,  interior  of  Saqani,  Valovoni,  Nadogo  and  Vagani  Villages,  the  interior  of 
<br/>Vaturova,  Seavaci  and  Nayarabale  and  many  other  places  in  the  country  are  still  awaiting  the 
<br/>installation  of  communication  towers  as  was  budgeted  in  previous  budgets.  Looks  like  the 
<br/></span><span>Government is lying to its people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I thank the Government for the lifting of the ban on the 
<br/>harvesting and selling of sea cucumbers or </span><span>beche-de-mer</span><span>.  Harvesting and selling is in progress since 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> July and the people are enjoying what they are earning. </span><span>Turaga ni koro</span><span> in the province of Macuata 
<br/>have been requested to keep a record of their earnings and achievements so that we report back to 
<br/>the Government through the Provincial Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking  on  waterways  and  environment,  I  must  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/>construction of the seawall in Nabubu Village in Namuka and other villages in the Northern Division.  
<br/>I am looking forward to the construction of other seawalls in other villages in the North.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  an  issue  with  the  Department  of  Environment  concerning  the  Fiji  Pine  Wharf  at 
<br/>Namuka  which  has  been  stopped  when  work  was  half  way  to  complete.  This  wharf  was  to 
<br/>accommodate the cartage of pine logs from Namuka plantation to Wairiki and Lautoka Mill.  I request 
<br/>the honourable Minister to follow-up on this, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I would say that this Budget is irresponsible and rudderless and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I join my colleagues in opposing the 2022-2023 National Budget.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament,  viewers  and  ladies  and  gentlemen;  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy and his team for a well-balanced and a well-distributed Budget from a caring 
<br/>leadership.  I personally feel this Budget is prepared to alleviate hardships faced by our people.  The 
<br/>initiatives put more money into the pockets of our people plus they are designed to cushion the impact 
<br/>of  the  rising  cost  of  living.  There  are  also  incentives  across  businesses  especially  for  small  and 
<br/>medium-size operators to help stimulate economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  protecting  the  rights,  interests  and  wellbeing  of  current  and  future 
<br/>generations  is  vitally  and  morally  important,  it  is  not  optional.    Humanity  faces  unprecedented 
<br/>challenges  and  failure  to  address  these  will  undermine  inter-generational  well-being,  cause  grave 
<br/>injustice, increase physical risk and impose huge if not unmanageable cost on future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rapid economic transformation is essential globally to protect humanities’ long term interest 
<br/></span><span>and minimise fiscal risk and FijiFirst Government is moving ahead in this direction.  When politicians 
<br/></span><span>choose between the next Elections and the next generation, it is clear what usually happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people all across 
<br/>the globe.  This has put a fierce challenge on the sustainability and growth of the world’s economy.  
<br/>This pandemic has viciously brutalised our and all economies globally.  This pandemic has opened 
<br/>our eyes to the stark reality of survival in these worse times.  The pandemic caused our economy to 
<br/>shrink by 17.2 percent in 2020 which took our GDP back to the 2015 level.  However, given our 
<br/>expected rate of growth following the resumption of tourism last December through Government’s 
<br/>foresight  and  decisive  leadership  and  with  the  tremendous  support  and  participation  of  the  Fijian 
<br/>people, we should fully return to pre-COVID-19 levels by 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The result speaks for themselves, hundreds of SMEs are open and thriving throughout the 
<br/>country creating jobs and contributing to Fiji’s GDP every single day. None of these would have 
<br/>been possible without the Government working throughout the pandemic to strengthen that resilience 
<br/>of both our formal and informal sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an ancient Greek proverb says, and I quote:  “A society grows great when 
<br/></span><span>old men and women plant trees whose shade they know, they shall never sit in.”  Humanity faces 
<br/></span><span>multiple  risks,  many  creeping  problems  and  unprecedented  challenges,  economic,  demographic, 
<br/>technological,  ecological,  health-related,  geopolitical,  et  cetera.    The  long-term  economic  and 
<br/>physical  implications  of  these  risks  and  challenges  are  massive.    Failure  to  address  the  risk  and 
<br/>challenges  effectively  will  have  profound  consequences  potentially  undermining  the  capacity  for 
<br/>stable, democratic governance and imposing immense economic, physical and social cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  provide  more  certainty  to  businesses,  Government  is  extending  all 
<br/>licences to five years including licences for insurance agents, sand and gravel extractions as well 
<br/>as fishing permits and licences.  These longer term licences will help individuals and businesses 
<br/>to access additional financing which would not otherwise have been available under shorter term 
<br/>licences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk about the Employment Taxation Scheme.  The current Employment Taxation 
<br/>Scheme which expires on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2023 will be extended until 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2024.   It 
<br/>allows for the following: 300 percent tax deduction on the amount of any salaries or wages paid

<br/>student’s area of study for the period not exceeding three months in a 12 month period, 400 percent

<br/>three years.  The Employment Taxation Scheme will also be extended to include a 300 percent tax 
<br/>deduction for wages paid to persons employed for apprenticeships. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  tax  deduction  for  companies  sponsoring  tertiary  education  including 
<br/>vocational  studies,  a  100  percent  tax  deduction  will  be  available  to  companies  on  the  amount  of 
<br/>tuition and living expenses paid for students at a higher education institution specified in the Higher 
<br/>Education Act 2008.  The deduction applicable for the purpose of living expenses is limited to $7,000 
<br/>per calendar year and must be paid into a bank account held at a commercial trading bank under the 
<br/>name of the student. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has also allocated funds in this Budget to help mitigate the 
<br/></span><span>effects  of  rising  inflationary  prices,  on  household  disposable  incomes,  parents  with  a  combined 
<br/>income of less than $50,000 will receive a payment of $1 per child per day, for children under 18 
<br/>years  over  a  six  month  period.  All  applications  currently  receiving  Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL) 
<br/>subsidy, Water Authority of Fiji subsidy and students on transportation assistance will automatically 
<br/>qualify  as  they  are  already  assessed  to  be  earning  less  than  $50,000  annually.  Approximately, 
<br/>200,000 students will benefit from this initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All existing social welfare, government pension and Aftercare fund recipients will receive a 
<br/>payment of $180 over a six month period.  Around 100,000 Fijians are expected to benefit from this 
<br/>and all tertiary students regardless of whether or not they are TELS or Toppers recipients will receive 
<br/>a pay-out of $180 over a six month period.  About 30,000 students are expected to benefit from this 
<br/>scheme.  The  Government  will  also  introduce  200  awards  under  a  rebranded  skills  qualification 
<br/>scholarship  scheme  previously  known  as  TVET  at  the  Fiji  National  University.    In  addition  200 
<br/>grants  will be awarded for micro-qualifications to  develop  construction skills  inclusive of a $100 
<br/>monthly industrial attachment allowance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in the Budget from 1</span><span>st</span><span> of next month, bus fares will be reduced 
<br/></span><span>by 10 percent across the board for the next six months.  Government will pick up the 10 percent cost, 
<br/></span><span>so as not to place the burden on bus companies.   Commuters will pay discounted fares while the 
<br/>Government will pay the difference directly to the bus companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced earlier, the Valelevu Shuttle Bus Pilot Programme will serve the greater Nasinu 
<br/>area.  The shuttle services will cater for around 13 routes at a cost of around $4 million. We will have 
<br/>electric shuttle buses running on these routes, representing the first electric public transportation fleet 
<br/>in Fiji.  In the 2022-2023 Budget electric vehicles including bikes, passenger vehicles, goods vehicles 
<br/>and buses both new and used will continue to be imported at zero duty. Import VAT of 9 percent 
<br/>applicable  on  electric  vehicles  will  be  reduced  to  zero  percent.  A  cash  rebate  of  $10,000  will  be 
<br/>provided to individuals and businesses for every electric vehicle purchased.  Business purchasing 
<br/>electric vehicles will qualify for 100 percent excavator depreciation.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, duty on Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for power-generation and auto gas, duty on LPG 
<br/>will be reduced on 4  cents  per kilogramme to  2 cents  per kilogramme.  The reduced duty  will be 
<br/>applicable to LPG supplied for power-generation and auto gas only.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of current governance challenges faced by governments 
<br/>throughout the globe like COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases, future pandemics, anti-
<br/>microbial resistance, bio-physical limits and ecological degradation, like climate change mitigation 
<br/>and  adaptation,  biodiversity  loss,  pollution,  waste,  et  cetera,  major  natural  disasters,  geo-political 
<br/>conflicts, large scale involuntary migration, demographic issues, population size and aging.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  curb  these  challenges,  FijiFirst  Government  is  promoting  long-term 
<br/>thinking and sound anticipatory governance.  Our Government is embedding long-term interest in 
<br/>mainstream scrutiny functions by employing principles of inter-generational fairness and well-being.  
<br/>We  are  periodically  identifying  significant  societal  risk  and  creeping  problems  as  well  as 
<br/>opportunities,  for  example,  technological  innovation  and  assessing  their  economic  and  physical 
<br/>implications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can give some examples here.  For example, to further ease the burden, 
<br/>COVID-19 economic support measures announced in the 2021-2022 Budget such as electricity and 
<br/>water subsidies, Stronger Together Job Support Scheme and Jobs for Nature, Social Welfare support, 
<br/>access  to  GPs  and  medical  practitioners,  support  for  transportation,  payment  of  base  fees,  PSV 
<br/>drivers’ licence fees, stall fees for market vendors, inshore fishing fees, et cetera, will continue for 
<br/></span><span>the next 12 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, humanity faces multiple governance challenges, and failure to address these 
<br/>effectively  will  impose  huge  long-term  costs,  including  large  fiscal  risks  and  our  Government  is 
<br/>giving greater priority to inter-generational fairness and well-being.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stronger  incentives  are  there  to  enhance  anticipatory  governance  and  strengthen  future 
<br/>focused decision-making.  In spite of the challenges we faced, this Budget has allocated increased 
<br/>expenditure to all key ministries and statutory bodies.  Every person in Fiji would benefit from this 
<br/>Budget.  This is indeed a well-balanced Budget.  I support the 2022-2023 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  on  that  note,  we  will  suspend  proceedings  for 
<br/>dinner, which will be served in the Big Committee Room and we will resume in an hour’s time.  The

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 8.31 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I begin my address with a sense of relief.  All 
<br/>of us in Fiji share it because we know that the honourable Minister for Economy has now delivered his 
<br/>FijiFirst Government’s last budget.  This year’s Budget took two-and-a-half hours and, of course, we had 
<br/>the  usual  and  endless boasting,  grandstanding  and  politicking  and  I  see that has been  followed  quite 
<br/>religiously by Members on the other side and I can feel the false sense of exuberance on the part of some 
<br/>of them and in their zeal to support their two leaders, they of course, engage in nasty personal attacks as 
<br/>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when an Economy Minister or a Finance Minister stands before Parliament to 
<br/>talk about the budget, their job is to deliver the facts.  It is their job to tell the people what they need to 
<br/>know without hype and propaganda and this is what they are required to do.  This is what they are paid 
<br/>for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people need an honest appraisal of our economy and the issues we face, 
<br/>instead what we get from the other side is relentless, boasting and political attacks.  A good focused, 
<br/>relevant budget speech can be finished in an hour.  So, let me say to the people of Fiji, let us look forward 
<br/></span><span>to the next budget speech delivered by a new Economy Minister.  The first thing that new minister will 
<br/></span><span>know when it is time to stop talking and sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Minister  boasted  to  this  House  three  years  ago  about  the 
<br/>Bainimarama Boom and the word “boom” became a national joke.  Now he is talking about the Bula 
<br/>Boom but this is just another bad joke.  The honourable Minister talks about record breaking economic 
<br/>growth of 12.4 percent.  But he has forgotten that under his Government, another record was broken, 
<br/>regardless of whether we attribute it to the pandemic or any other thing.  In 2020, the economy went 
<br/>backwards by 17.2 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That too was a record.  When you say 12.4 percent is record, that too was a record.  Talk about 
<br/>that.  Then, Mr. Speaker, it went backwards by four percent in 2021 but let us not forget that long before 
<br/>the virus, the economy was already going backwards.  It contracted by 0.4 percent in 2019.  That is the 
<br/>reality of the FijiFirst Government’s so-called booms.  That is a fact a fact.  So the economy, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>is only three-quarters of its previous size.  It is that smaller economy, Mr. Speaker, that is growing by 12 
<br/>percent, so it is not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I mean you are bragging about that this is the unprecedented record growth in the history of Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>so the real boom, Mr. Speaker, is in government debt.  As of April 2022, we have $8.3 billion in debt.  
<br/></span><span>There is another $1.1 billion in Government guarantees.  These are the Government’s own figures, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  We know the Government will eventually have to pay these amounts for companies such as 
<br/>Fiji Airways, FSC and that takes us to about $9.4 billion in total and this year’s deficit of almost $800 
<br/>million will take us over $10 billion in debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before the end of this year, Mr. Speaker, including Government guarantees, that is where our 
<br/>government debt level will be - $10 billion.  So, Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely not honest to talk about 
<br/>record breaking growth.  It is not honest to talk about a Bula Boom.  In fact it is insulting to talk about 
<br/>these things when thousands of Fijian families are struggling to make ends meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us talk about inflation and food prices, Mr. Speaker.  What is the Government’s solution?  
<br/>Throw around $60 million on a mitigation package and how will they deliver it – through an online app.  
<br/>But we know that the poorest people in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, are not necessarily online.  I know they do not 
<br/>have access to a lot of these things that they talk about.

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We are doing other things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Perhaps if the Minister did not hide from reality, he should pick 
<br/>up a copy of the</span><span> Fiji Times </span><span>every so often, he would read there about real problems, Mr. Speaker.  The 
<br/>security  guard  who  must  keep  his  kids  at  home  because  he  cannot  pay  the  bus  fares,  the  children 
<br/>scavenging for scrap metal, the young children selling food in shopping centres at night, the elderly people 
<br/>who  depend  on  the  kindness  of  their  neighbours  and  volunteers  and  let  alone,  Mr.  Speaker,  during 
<br/>COVID-19, they have never talked about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In two years between 2021, we received about more than $1.5 billion in remittances.  The first 
<br/>quarter of this year, remittances were more than $300 million.  That, Mr. Speaker, helped many families 
<br/>and friends and others who needed it in this country. The honourable Minister stands in Parliament and 
<br/>says get cash through the app.  I mean, is that all we can say, Mr. Speaker, because these are the people 
<br/>that this Government cannot look in the face. The Government cannot face the welfare organisations and 
<br/>community bodies who support our poorest people. They just want to say, “Alright, we will give you 
<br/>some cash through the app and pretend that there is no poverty.”  In fact, some of them said that there is 
<br/></span><span>really no poverty in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all know what happened in the past. We remember the tens of millions of dollars 
<br/>spent on Help for Homes initiative.  I remember raising this in Parliament after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  Was there 
<br/>a boom?  Yes, for many of the hardware companies, it was a boom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We remember when the Government let people access their FNPF funds for floods and cyclones, 
<br/>even in towns and cities where there were no damages and we know what happened, Mr. Speaker.  But 
<br/>this has always been the way that this Government just borrow, spend money, it does not matter how you 
<br/>spend it, just spend it.  We can see, even the honourable Prime Minister goes to all Provincial Councils 
<br/>and the only thing he says is, “This is how much we spent in this province.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, you are not solving the real problem which is that incomes must rise.  Prices are not 
<br/>going to go down. People must earn more. That will only happen when the economy grows.  For example, 
<br/>if there was a Bainimarama Boom as they claim, why was the minimum wage kept low for so long - 
<br/>$2.32, $2.68.  We talked about minimum living wage in 2017 and 2018, Mr. Speaker, and they rubbished 
<br/>it.  Then suddenly it was increased in the election year.  The honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>talked about the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have already publically asked the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You lied about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I am coming to that.  You have cut the funding for the sugar 
<br/>industry from $83 million to $45 million?  You have put only $8 million into the Sugar Stabilisation 
<br/>Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So where is the money for the Budget for 2022 season guaranteed 
<br/>sugarcane price? They are saying, “We expect the world sugar price to go up”, but they are not saying 
<br/>that there is no allocation.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the biggest budget on a largest decrease in any Ministry 
<br/>in this Budget is for the sugar industry.  It was reduced by 46 percent. The honourable Prime Minister

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under his leadership, we now today have a pocket-sized industry and this morning he attacked me and 
<br/>said leaders must not lie.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister must look at himself in the mirror and remember, yes, I agreed 
<br/>leaders must not lie.  He should go back and realise that the biggest lie that the people of this country 
<br/>were told by him when he did the </span><span>coup</span><span> and formed the military interim government in 2007. What did 
<br/>he say, Mr. Speaker? He said no one from that interim government will ever contest the election, and 
<br/>look what they did today. They lied. They made their own Constitution. They made their laws and they 
<br/>are still doing that to remain in power.  That is what he should talk about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Before he says that I am lying, this is the fact about the sugar 
<br/>industry, Mr. Speaker.  The people of this country, despite all these false exuberance that is exhibited by 
<br/>all the people, they have to do that and they are required to do that. They know that the people of this 
<br/>country have realised their lies, their false sense of boast and they are just waiting for the date of the 
<br/>election and they will kick all of them out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I heard the honourable Minister talked about the education revolution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I could not believe my ears, Mr. Speaker. This has been the worst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government for education, in my view.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is no vision to shape a curriculum for the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century. Teachers have been put 
<br/>on insulting employment contracts.  I remember the day an Acting Minister for Education before the 2018 
<br/>Election, a week before the voting he sent an email to say that everyone will get a five-year contract.  
<br/>Many teachers still do not have the five-year contracts.  Now, before this election, he is again promising 
<br/>five-year contracts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>School  owners  and  managers,  those  who  have  built  and  maintained  the  schools  are  ordered 
<br/>around and treated disrespectfully.  School communities are bullied and restricted in what they do.  Then 
<br/>I heard the honourable Minister talk about Fiji as the “ICT hub of the Pacific”.  This sounds like another 
<br/>joke, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Government has been talking about this for 10 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first tax incentives for the outsourcing industry was created in 2009, 13 years later, we have 
<br/></span><span>fewer than probably 6,000 or 7,000 jobs in the industry.  And while we have been talking about ICT hubs, 
<br/>other  countries  (you  can  find  examples  in  countries  like  South  Africa,  Philippines  and  others)  have 
<br/>created tens of thousands of jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  critical  problems  with  growing  our  economy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  lack  of 
<br/>infrastructure, particularly power and water. Until we have reliable power and water supplies we cannot 
<br/>build new houses for our people.  We cannot build technology, parks and other developments to create 
<br/>jobs.  Why are tens of thousands of people without water every day?  Everyone knows about that.  Why 
<br/>are there constant power failures? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ministers on the other side still try and blame “past governments” - I still hear them 
<br/>blaming past governments. But they forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they have been the past government 
<br/>for the last 15 years. They have had 15 years to fix these problems, and in that time Mr. Speaker, Sir, if 
<br/>you look at the Budget, this Government has spent $50 billion of our money. I will say this again, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, $50 billion and they cannot even get the basics right after 15 years.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1577 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of a sudden, now, we hear the honourable Minister talking about how they are going to fix all 
<br/>the water problems in probably nine months?  He is hoping that people will vote them back into power 
<br/>on that promise, but people have the right to ask what you have been doing for 15 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I listened to the honourable Minister talk about housing.  He talked about 42 
<br/>development  leases  for  informal  housing.    Twelve  he  says,  are  at  tender  stage,  six,  he  says  are  at 
<br/>engineering stage. What he did not say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that none of those 42 projects have been 
<br/>delivered. This Government can talk, borrow money, spend it but it cannot deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know Mr. Speaker, Sir, during 2018 Election, they went around squatter settlements and started 
<br/>numbering the houses.  They promised the moon to the people in those settlements so Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>people are asking … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is about the budget, this is about the budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… what the next government will do differently. So let us talk about that.  Let us first understand 
<br/></span><span>the role of the Government in the development of the economy in a way that benefits everyone – big and 
<br/></span><span>small businesses, workers, farmers and our poorest people.  The Government is there to listen to investors 
<br/>and employers and help them create jobs and re-invest and create more jobs. It is there to help people 
<br/>improve their qualifications and skills and their standards of living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  all  know  the  story  about  technical  colleges,  one  of  the  reasons  why  employers  are 
<br/>complaining today as a result of failure by this Government.  All the money that they spent went down 
<br/>the drain and none of those technical colleges are working today.  Nothing will change and I say this to 
<br/>the people  of this  country, nothing  will change in Fiji until  our leadership  changes.   That  is the fact 
<br/>because leadership is the central role of Government and leadership means bringing people together.  This 
<br/>Government has done the opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a Government powered by the insecurity of people sitting on the other side.  I always 
<br/>say that it is a two-men Government and the silent 25, I know they do not like it, honourable Koya does 
<br/>not like it, but this is what they do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Because you are telling lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I just told you what are the biggest lies in this country that have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been told.  You should know that.  All they do is cheer from time to time and go on personal attacks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just like you go around. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Minister for Education once she probably gets a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>PR firm, I saw the tender, she might do better in what she says in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, cannot bring people together.  
<br/>It is afraid of the ideas that other people can bring to the country.  It cannot control the ideas and energy 
<br/>of our people particularly our young people, so it threatens and bullies anyone who criticises them. A 
<br/>good Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, must be honest with the people - we need to honestly tell them what

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the problems are and bring people together to find solutions. Some solutions will be successful, some will 
<br/>fail - it is the Government’s job to measure outcomes and also to report back on the failures and how we 
<br/>will fix them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but this Government I have noticed in the last seven and half years that I have 
<br/>been in Parliament, is actually afraid of admitting failure.  It is afraid of admitting it is wrong.  We just 
<br/>talked about USP in today’s </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> because the Government will not admit it is wrong. It is putting 
<br/>the education of its own young people at risk.  It is threatening the future of a most important university. 
<br/>Nothing  was  said  about  NCDs,  domestic  violence,  increasing  drug  abuse  -  these  are  things  that 
<br/>Government does not want to talk about and the next government, will have to talk about it and admit 
<br/>that as a nation, we failed on all of these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  will  be  the  style  of  Government,  a  different  style  of  Government  and 
<br/>management that we will offer.  For the first time in 15 years, we will be able to talk honestly, criticise 
<br/>the Government and come together to find solutions and work together to deliver it.  We want the business 
<br/>community, unions, welfare organisations, NGOs and everyone else out there who is working for the 
<br/>country, to work with us because economic policy is not a secret measure.  It is not a secret means - it is 
<br/>meant to be discussed, criticised and accepted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many issues within the education system and I heard the honourable 
<br/>Minister talk about it.  They have refused to set up an Education Commission for the last 15 years. All 
<br/>kinds of reforms haphazard - some here, some there have been undertaken in this country and nothing 
<br/>has been consolidated. Now, we hear that there will be another plan and what she is planning to do within 
<br/>the education system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important for us to build leadership. I heard her talking about local 
<br/>government  and  community  leadership.  The  failed  Lautoka  Swimming  Pool  project  says  everything 
<br/>about this Government - get rid of city and town councils, why because they could not win those elections.  
<br/>That is why they are not holding elections and they said that there was a lot of corruption, but there is 
<br/>more corruption now and there is more investigation in the administration of the town and city councils 
<br/>now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the loss of Local Government means that we have no local leaders who are 
<br/>accountable to ratepayers in towns and cities.  This is one thing that will change immediately under the 
<br/>new government. We need democratically elected town and city councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my message to our people today - once again, nothing can change until our 
<br/></span><span>Government  changes.  For  15  years,  we  have  been  bullied,  dictated  to,  talked  down,  we  have  a 
<br/>Government that has ruled through fear.  This must end and I know it is going to end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>it is time to bring everyone together and recover our lost opportunities.  Time is coming soon, as I have 
<br/>said - people are waiting for the date of the election.  People are fed up, people are actually having the 
<br/>bets on the wall and they are waiting for the date of the election to kick this Government out forever and 
<br/>that is what is going to happen. No amount of false exuberance, boasting, politicking, attack on me and 
<br/>the Opposition is going save them this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to end with this, the honourable Prime Minister said that people are naïve 
<br/>- people are not naïve, he is right.  People are not naïve, people are not fools, they can see through this 
<br/>Government what they have done in the last 15 years, what they have done in the last seven years and 
<br/>that is what the people are going to base their decisions on in the coming election.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1579 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament and all those watching from 
<br/>the comfort of their home, good evening to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise in this Chambers in full support of the 2022-2023 National Budget as delivered by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy and thank him for giving such a wonderful Bula Boom budget.  At the 
<br/>outset,  I  would like to, for the first time, differ  from  the  honourable  Minister  for Commerce,  Trade, 
<br/>tourism and Transport.  He at least said that honourable Professor Prasad was going to give a dollar worth 
<br/>of contribution.  I would say, his contribution was not even worth 20 cents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While listening to the Shadow Minister for Economy, why I am referring to honourable Ratu 
<br/>Naiqama Lalabalavu as the Shadow Minister is because I am not sure or was rather confused on whether 
<br/>he spoke as the Leader of the Opposition or was he speaking as a future candidate of the People’s Alliance 
<br/>Party.  I am also 100 precent sure that even some Opposition Members are confused with regards to this 
<br/>as well.  He should have been quoting honourable Gavoka, but instead he was quoting Rabuka.  Seriously, 
<br/>we do not know what is happening on the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On the other hand, what I heard from honourable Gavoka this afternoon on the tax reform that 
<br/></span><span>he is going to introduce to help </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, was just mind boggling.  What I would ask him, is he going to 
<br/></span><span>tax one </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> to help another </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>?  Or, since he has openly said that the tax reform is going to 
<br/>benefit one ethnic group, he is going to tax all other ethnic groups apart from </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> groups, to help 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community.  Listening to such tax reforms, I do understand why party members are running from 
<br/>SODELPA to other parties, and why the Leader of Opposition did not quote him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I do understand that the honourable Members from the Opposition no longer say, </span><span>Amen</span><span> Jesus 
<br/>during  Morning  Prayer.    With  the  fading  of  that,  I  believe  the  opposition  has  also  forgotten  that 
<br/>Christianity preaches that we are all human beings and everyone is a child of God.  But look at the dividing 
<br/>tactic used by the Opposition.  In the lust of power, you, the honourable Members are forgetting the moral 
<br/>preaching of your own religion.  What a shame!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  same  note,  I  urge  someone  from  Opposition  to  give  a  peace  of  mind  to  honourable 
<br/>Bulanauca.  He has totally lost his mind and does not realise what it means to be called honourable.  The 
<br/>way he spoke this morning only shows he has lost not only what is on top of his skull, but also what is 
<br/>inside that skull.  While also talking about Christian values, it would be very interesting to hear what 
<br/>honourable Lenora has to say in Parliament this evening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua during one of her campaign meetings brought up the 
<br/></span><span>name  of  the  honourable  Prime  Minister’s  father  when  she  uttered,  referring  to  him,  “This  is  not  his 
<br/>father’s money, but this is our money.”  The honourable Prime Minister’s dad passed on some years ago 
<br/>and  it  is  insulting  to  bring  his  name  into  her  campaign  speech.    Ratu  Inoke,  until  he  died,  worked 
<br/>extremely  hard  for  the  nation  and  it  is  a  great  insult  to  his  family  and  his  relatives.    Honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua is known to be a child curser and has cursed all our children and now she is moving to 
<br/>curse our parents.  She owes the honourable Prime Minister, his family and his relatives an apology and 
<br/>we would like to hear it this evening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to SODELPA - a Party that cannot manage the grant given to their caucus, a Party 
<br/>that only relies on the grant by Parliament to run their caucus and external party affairs, a Party that 
<br/>cannot pay its Office staff and a Party that cannot raise funds to run its Party.  The members of that 
<br/>same Party are talking about increasing Government revenue. Is this not really funny?  How can you 
<br/>increase Government revenue while your own party revenue is zero and in financial crisis. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  really  urge  the  Opposition  Members  to  learn  from  a  very  experienced  business  lady, 
<br/>honourable Dr. Mere Naulumatua (sitting on the Opposition side) and gain some financial knowledge 
<br/>so  that  SODELPA  will  be  out  of  financial  crisis.    The  party  has  used  the  funds  without  any 
<br/>accountability  to  its  MPs  and  here  they  are  talking  about  accountability  to  Fijians  and  trying  to 
<br/>criticise the spending of the Government.  
<br/>If you cannot manage such a small grant, how will you 
<br/>manage Fiji’s economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- We will. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kuridrani, first get your Party to pay 
<br/>the few staff working in your chamber then talk about giving $120 to 12,000 cane farmers.  Your 
<br/>Party cannot pay three or four workers, how will you pay 12,000 cane farmers?  Where will you get 
<br/></span><span>that money from?  Please, inform the staff in  your chamber to apply for government assistance if 
<br/></span><span>they have children because they would be having a hard time as SODELPA has not paid them for the 
<br/>past few weeks.  Do not worry, under the decisive leadership, we leave no one behind, we assist 
<br/>everyone and we do not discriminate.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the so-called economist aiding and abetting honourable Professor Biman 
<br/>Prasad went a step further to compare Fiji’s economy to what is happening in Sri Lanka.  Sri Lanka 
<br/>ran  out  of  foreign  reserves,  corruption  was  at  level  high.    Fiji  is  in  a  very  stable  position  having 
<br/>foreign reserves to import for more than eight months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While economists were criticising the Government for borrowing money during the COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic, the Fijian Government acted smartly and borrowed offshore in order to increase the 
<br/>foreign reserves.    Borrowing offshore bring  foreign currency into the country thus  increasing  the 
<br/>foreign reserve.  Sri Lanka was not in a position to service their debts.  Fiji on the other hand has not 
<br/>defaulted  a  single  repayment  during  the  pandemic,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    How  can  we  compare  Sri 
<br/>Lanka?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, with sugar guaranteed price, let us talk about if the farmers do not get $85 per tonne as 
<br/></span><span>promised by the FijiFirst Government.  We have noted that most of the concerns raised by the Fijians 
<br/></span><span>are associated with the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic and the global inflationary pressure.  
<br/>In response, the Government developed and implemented appropriate economic policies and rolled 
<br/>out the targeted programmes that will cushion the impacts on ordinary Fijians and businesses from 
<br/>the adverse effect of this impasse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building on the recent  progress,  this  Budget  has  actually outlined policies that are  geared 
<br/>towards returning the economy back to a more sustainable growth path and improved livelihoods.  
<br/>Overall the budget contains a series of direct measures for the people with some policy measures 
<br/>targeted to promote specific industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As highlighted in the budget presentation by the honourable Minister for Economy, hundreds 
<br/>of MSMEs are now open and thriving throughout the country creating jobs and contributing towards 
<br/>Fiji’s GDP every single day.  This is a clear indication of Government’s prudent policies and support 
<br/>towards strengthening the resilience of both formal and informal sector. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1581 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, conscious of the constraint financial space, this Budget intends to implement 
<br/>the policy  measures within  sustainable fiscal  framework.   Indeed our spending  level  targets  have 
<br/>been well moderated and ensure cautious revenue projection. The Budget has re-prioritised public 
<br/>spending towards pro-vulnerable expenditure in health and education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the degree of inflationary pressure experienced by the global economies has 
<br/>to some extent dependent on the difference starting points and experience heading into the pandemic.  
<br/>To  a  significant  extent,  the  recent  increase  in  Fiji’s  consumer  prices  has  been  driven  by  global 
<br/>disruption and have caused sharp prices increases for critical commodities including a broad range 
<br/>of imported goods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the widespread inflationary context, we anticipated some general cost 
<br/>of living strategies and this Budget sought to address those concerns with direct support to households 
<br/>through price control and social assistance.  It is unfortunate that some of the political opponents 
<br/>have mocked it as an election budget containing freebies for struggling families.  That shows the lack 
<br/>of concern they have for the people of our nation.  As rightfully said this morning by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, assisting Fijians is not freebies.  Investing in children’s education is not just investing 
<br/>in their future, it is also investing for the development of the nation.  A smart and educated society is 
<br/></span><span>the key foundation for any developed nation and Fiji is no different.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fiscal policy supporting budget for the financial year 2022-2023 in the 
<br/>medium-term is designed to accelerate the economic recovery and improve livelihoods for Fijians.  
<br/>A total of $60 million set aside under the inflation mitigation package will help cope with the rising 
<br/>prices.  The various direct assistance provided to households in this Budget will not only ease the 
<br/>burden on the struggling Fijians but assist them to prepare for the future.  The use of such human-
<br/>centric policies measures the influence or the behaviour of consumers and businesses are welcomed.  
<br/>To  create  an  enabling  environment  for  economic  recovery  and  employment  creation,  the  budget 
<br/>would enhance critical infrastructure in roads where the proposed Viti Levu interior highway will 
<br/>create  far  greater  social  mobility  and  a  huge  opportunity  for  commercial,  industrial  and  tourism 
<br/>expansion on the island of Viti Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the level of fiscal support in response to the pandemic and inflation has been 
<br/>considerably significant, both in scale and relevance.  This Government has acted quickly to buffer 
<br/>households  and  business  balance  sheets  during  the  stringent  period  of  social  and  economic 
<br/>restrictions.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  economy  demonstrated  remarkable  resilience  to  COVID-19 
<br/>shocks in 2020 and staged a strong recovery in the first half of 2022.  Following the ease of COVID-
<br/></span><span>19 restriction, reopening of the borders as well as targeted stimulus intervention by this Government, 
<br/></span><span>the  economy  is  estimated  to  expand  by  12.4  percent  this  year;  a  much  stronger  level  from  the 
<br/>contraction of 4.1 percent in 2021.  However, the economic outlook may be affected by the emerging 
<br/>domestic and external risks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the domestic front, re-emergence of COVID-19 variants  and possible adverse weather 
<br/>conditions can affect the projected economic recovery.  On the external front, the ongoing conflict in 
<br/>Eastern Europe is creating uncertainties and can further affect the global economic outlook through 
<br/>the disruption of supply chain, rising global oil prices, rise in food prices and increased inflationary 
<br/>pressures.  The FijiFirst Government is committed to monitor all the domestic and external risks and 
<br/>take appropriate policy actions to navigate the economy through emerging risks.  Furthermore Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, our sustained investment in recent years have significantly transformed our economy and 
<br/>strengthened our resilience.  Encouraged by this, our economy has bounced back, giving our people 
<br/>incredible optimism even in situations of extreme challenges.

<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering the revised development agenda highlighted in this Budget, this 
<br/>Government has carefully balanced the difficult choices in resource allocation in order to finance the 
<br/>highest priorities that will propel this country to greater heights of prosperity.  I am confident that we 
<br/>have made the right decision and will accelerate the pace of our economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  $3.8  billion  people-centred  </span><span>Bula</span><span>  Boom  Budget,  with  strong  social 
<br/>policies by the FijiFirst Government will ensure the people in our communities receive what they 
<br/>need and will open up great opportunities for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  take  this  time  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary for the Ministry of Economy, Mr. Shiri Gounder and his team.  Mr. Gounder was appointed 
<br/>as Permanent Secretary when we had the biggest contraction in Fiji’s economy.  Mr. Gounder, you 
<br/>have really showed your leadership for the past two years in assisting the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy that has allowed Fiji’s economy to bounce back stronger.  Fighting with the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic and reduced revenue but still keeping the economy afloat would not have been easy and 
<br/>we salute the team at Ministry of Economy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank this august Parliament for the 
<br/>privilege to speak and I fully support the motion to approve the 2022-2023 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Good evening everyone.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>observations on the Budget handed down on the evening of Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, here we are, just weeks or months away from the elections, what the people of 
<br/>Fiji and we as their representatives heard in the Budget Address brought us a little bit of shock and 
<br/>surprise.    Of  course,  the  Government  loves  to  say  that  we  are  just  worried  about  the  elections. 
<br/>Whether  elections  are  on  the  horizon  or  not,  Team  NFP  has  a  60-year  legacy  of  being  about  the 
<br/>people.  We are not fly by night operators, here today and gone tomorrow. We are about continuity 
<br/>and we are about the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we look at the Budget from end-to-end after that almost three-hour diatribe, we realised 
<br/>that FijiFirst has in fact lost the elections with this Budget. Despite the Government’s best attempts 
<br/>to  send party agents  and trolls after us, hoping to  shame us about  lack of solutions  or alternative 
<br/>budgets, the truth is laid bare in this Budget.  They need to distract the electorate from their lack of 
<br/>ideas and they needed our ideas as a distraction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be honest, Mr. Speaker, we at NFP were bracing ourselves for some ingenuity knowing 
<br/>that the Government’s public confidence ratings are plummeting and the budget was one chance to 
<br/></span><span>help redeem themselves.  Alas, Mr. Speaker, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from it being a </span><span>Saqamoli </span><span>Budget as rightly labelled by our Party Leader, the honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad, many of the social protections on offer are only for six months.  To add insult to 
<br/>injury, this </span><span>saqamoli</span><span> per day is less than the global definition of extreme poverty that is measured as 
<br/>people living on less than US$1.25 a day. So, if the Government is proud of one  </span><span>saqamoli</span><span> a day 
<br/>assistance to our own people, our people should know that what they are being given is less than 
<br/>even  what  the  world  has  measured  as  extreme  poverty  of  US$1.25  a  day.  That  is  shameful! 
<br/></span><span>Vakamadua</span><span>!  Why six-month Budget when it is supposed to run for 12 months?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FBC  posted  an  infographic  shortly  after  the  Budget  was  handed  down,  and  the 
<br/>infographic  said  and  I  quote:  “The  Budget  will  be  reviewed  due  to  the  volatility  of  the  world 
<br/>markets.”  Another budget possibility for the 2022-2023 financial year, why?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1583 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Page 6 of his Address, the honourable Minister said, and I quote: “That is what this special 
<br/>revised budget is all about. It is about what is next for Fiji.”  Is this not the annual budget given that 
<br/>we just had a mini-budget in March? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Page 14 of his Address, the honourable Minister said, and I quote:  “The answer lies in 
<br/>the promise of this mini-budget and its support for a bold, sustained and a broad economic recovery.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then on Page 21 of the same Address, the nation is told that, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It has allowed us to announce a mini-budget this evening that takes on the affordable  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> living challenge, continues our recovery momentum and creates opportunities.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, is it perhaps opportune that we ask the Government, is everything alright over there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> If  what  we  are  debating  this  week  is  not  the  substantive  budget  but  yet  another  mini  or 
<br/>supplementary budget as the honourable Minister for Economy’s own amendment to the Financial 
<br/>Management Act dictates, how many budgets in one year does an economy of less than a million 
<br/>people need or to para-phrase the rapper Eminem, will the real budget please stand up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We heard in the Minister’s Address that during the so-called budget consultations, taxpayers 
<br/>wanted to know, what is next?  I am afraid to be the bearer of bad news and confirm that the answer 
<br/>to that question is not a lot, if the actual numbers and words of their budget are anything to go by.  In 
<br/>fact you can sense the muted reactions to the budget in the media by industry and professional groups 
<br/>that they know that there is not much there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only ones crowing are those regular suspects of minions like the Fijian Competition and 
<br/>Consumer Commission (FCCC) with the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joel Abraham holding court 
<br/>as a pre-budget talking head on Fiji Televisions or Fiji One while two of his subordinates waxed on 
<br/>and on, on Fijian Broadcasting Corporation (FBC). Their attempts to set the scene while trying hard 
<br/>not to show how involved they were, were laughable at best.  And then of course, we see a drip-feed 
<br/>of the regular suspects of the minions club piping up to support the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Development Bank (FDB), Mr. Speaker, Sir, an energetic player that administered 
<br/>many thousand dollar grants before the 2018 Elections, seems quite intent on continuing this blitz 
<br/>prior to this year’s Budget, targeting agriculture, Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) 
<br/>and with the new product specifically for Women’s Entrepreneurs.  Of course this is welcomed, but 
<br/></span><span>why  did  we  not  see  all  this  frantic  movement  to  promote  MSMEs,  agriculture  and  women’s 
<br/></span><span>businesses earlier such as after the March Supplementary Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister claims that his Budget will grow our economy, that it will create the 
<br/>jobs and opportunities that every Fijian deserves to have in their lives.  But where, how and when?  
<br/>I struggled to see any indication of specific details of how this Government intends to do that, in the 
<br/>Estimates and Consequential Bills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy claimed, and I quote:  “As the nation’s 
<br/>largest employer, we maintained Civil Service salaries.” But very conveniently, that is just half the 
<br/>story, is it not?  Civil Service salaries are maintained but the actual numbers (headcount) of civil 
<br/>servants  have  very  likely  decreased  steadily  due  to  the  domino  effect  of  factors  like  forced 
<br/>vaccinations, forced retirements of those reaching 55 years of age, the brain drain, resignations due 
<br/>to a demoralising work environment, illnesses and deaths.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The extent of the true status of the totality of the human resource capital of the Government’s 
<br/>Ministries  and  Departments  we  will  never  know,  because  the  powers  of  the  Public  Service 
<br/>Commission have  been reduced to hiring and firing Permanent Secretaries.  No wonder taxpayers 
<br/>are often up in arms about poor public services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  not  the  fault  of  the  civil  servants  but  the  deplorable  standards  of  governance  and 
<br/>leadership that we all have been forced to endure since this Government’s 2006 takeover. What is 
<br/>very likely happening is that workloads per civil servant have doubled or tripled because of staffing 
<br/>shortages  and  thus  productivity  takes  a  nosedive?    The  Government’s  solution?  A  productivity 
<br/>Commission  with  what  sounds  like  a  wishy  washy  mandate,  and  with  only  $50,000  allocated  to 
<br/>establish it, I am not holding my breath.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget Address was riddled with references to debt and it was just a 
<br/>shameless salesman pitch about </span><span>dinau</span><span> as if it is something to aspire to. It was all a vain exercise in 
<br/>semantics. Debt is bondage, debt is slavery and debt is a yoke around all of our necks. Yet to hear 
<br/>statements like I quote:  "increase spending even if it means going into debt", or "we were able to 
<br/>negotiate low-cost debt", or "our debt burden was sustainable", or "because we borrowed prudently", 
<br/>is a joke.  As if to seal the deal on the </span><span>dinau</span><span> obsession, with what little details provided in this Budget, 
<br/></span><span>all the grand plans talked up about are supposed to all magically happen without the $1.46 billion 
<br/></span><span>that it needs?  Or is the idea that the Government Guarantee that we have not been told who for or 
<br/>why, but as agreed at the Business Committee for Thursday's agenda, intended to plug that $1.46 
<br/>billion dollar gap? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our money, our future is in their hands and I want to talk about trust and I 
<br/>want to quote a former friend of his Grubsheet author, Graham Davis and he said: “Your money”, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, “is in his hands, a nation’s fortunes depended on the role of the dice of one man 
<br/>who controls your future and the future of your children who will inherit the debt.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  quite  curious  how  Fiji  Care  Insurance,  primarily  a  public  listed 
<br/>insurance company, has steadily increased its footprint in Fiji, particularly over the recent years and 
<br/>in the health sectors specifically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we recall, Fiji Care Insurance was awarded the Insurance cover job for Government, for 
<br/>civil servants, pensioners and parametric insurers amongst others.  During the COVID-19 recovery, 
<br/>Fiji Care Insurance moved rapidly into travelling insurance cover for visitors to Fiji and even into 
<br/>health care. In this Budget, Fiji Care Insurance will further spread its tentacles by building a website 
<br/></span><span>to streamline the administration of an initiative for taxpayers who want to be treated by Government 
<br/></span><span>subsidised doctors through an online Patient Information System and doctors or GPs will have access 
<br/>to all those patients seen under this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question here is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how does one insurance company have a monopoly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over all Government insurance product needs?  Are other insurance companies not up to speed? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Were they even asked as a proper tender process should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- All the remaining replays in the Minister’s speech from 
<br/>free medicine, to first-home ownership, to digitisation, water, electricity, roads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can bet that there will be a good old ‘copy and paste’ from previous budget speeches, with slight 
<br/>tinkering  around  the  edges  to  the  rescue  but  minimal  movement,  if  any,  on  any  of  them  actually 
<br/>becoming a reality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are things visibly absent from the Budget.  No carbon budget as per 
<br/>the Climate Change Act despite climate change and blue ocean risks that this Government constantly 
<br/>talks about, yet and where is the Consequential Bill for the Climate Change Act to reinstate the 10 
<br/>year moratorium on deep sea mining, removed from a previous budget draft of the Bill, that the Prime 
<br/>Minister  has  been  chest-thumping  about  to  our  Pacific  neighbours  and  the  world  at  the  Oceans 
<br/>meeting in Portugal?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  where  is  Fiji’s  financial  commitment  to  our  fisheries  protection  like 
<br/>surveillance and enforcement so that the nation does not have a repeat of the horrific beheading of a 
<br/>Fiji  citizen,  while  on  a  fishing  vessel  in  Fiji  waters?    Where  is  the  duty  of  care  for  our  fisheries 
<br/>observers  and  proper  contracts  as  well  as  insurance  cover  and  extensive  death  and  injury 
<br/>compensation such as the conspiracy of silence over the death of a Fiji national and regional observer 
<br/>who died in 2016 while on board a fishing vessel in Pagopago? (I have spoken about this before in 
<br/>this Chamber). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why is the temporary lifting of the </span><span>beche-de-mer</span><span> fishing ban taking away 
<br/>licensing approvals from the communities and giving it to Divisional Commissioners when the local 
<br/>customary fishing ground custodians have been showing responsible management through locally-
<br/>managed marine areas and other community rules? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  is  there  so  much  more  bluster  in  the  Minister’s  speech  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commitment to young people? Yet he says, I quote: “We invested in your education for years” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, who? That ‘we’ is the nation of taxpayers, and that ‘we’ also includes 
<br/>young  people  who  are  recipients  of  scholarships  because  they  too  pay  VAT.  Where  is  this 
<br/>commitment to young people if the data from Page No. 56 of the 2016-2017 Annual Report from the 
<br/>Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts presents the alarming data that about 15,000 students per 
<br/>annum are dropping out of school every year when they fail Year 10, Year 11 and Year 13?  These 
<br/>students cannot go back to school to repeat and unless their parents can afford to put them through a 
<br/>Certificate or a Diploma Programme, they will drop out of the system altogether.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, where is this commitment to young people if thousands of students who 
<br/></span><span>have dropped out  of the schools are not  given any  assistance to  get  skills  training? Where is  this 
<br/></span><span>commitment to young people if the tertiary scholarship and loan services body is not to lowering the 
<br/>requirements to allow for these students to be trained in a trades or skills qualification?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Technical  Colleges  were  a  failed  initiative  by  this  Government,  begun  in  2015  and  then 
<br/>fobbed off very quickly to FNU in 2018, who did not do justice because there was no budget given 
<br/>to them to manage the Technical College bodies.  Now, it is looking like the FNU Technical and 
<br/>Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is also in swift decline.  Where is the report, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  on  the  forensic  audit  of  Elections  IT  system,  as  carried  out  by  KPMG  for  the  Fiji  Elections 
<br/>Office?    Why  is  the  use  of  public  funds  for  this  forensic  audit  not  reported  in  Parliament  if  the 
<br/>Elections Office is so concerned about the perception of its independence and impartiality?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer the question continuously posed throughout the Budget 
<br/>Address asking, what is next?  I can see it now, what is next for this Government will be a lot of tears 
<br/>and farewells and a lot of crushed spirits after a resounding loss.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I take 
<br/>this opportunity to make a brief statement in support of the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the fourth year of this parliamentary term is coming to an end.  When we take 
<br/>a moment and reflect on our journey and the challenges we faced as individuals, as family and as 
<br/>Fijians, we can only give back the glory and honour to God for His unwavering and unconditional 
<br/>love, for without Him, we will not be here today.  He was the God of Moses, Esther, Daniel, Joseph, 
<br/>Ruth, David and Rahab and He is still our God.  He will never fail us nor leave us and for that I am 
<br/>forever grateful and blessed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to convey my heartfelt gratitude to our honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister.  Thank you for all that you do for the betterment of Fiji and the region. You have 
<br/>been the beacon of hope in  time of crisis  because of  your trust in  God.   You are  full of  wisdom 
<br/>because you never failed to consult the great source of all wisdom.  As Ellen G. White stated in her 
<br/>book, “</span><span>The Prophets and Kings</span><span>”, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The path of men who are placed as leaders is not an easy one.  But they are to see 
<br/></span><span>in every difficulty a call to prayer.  Never are they to fail of consulting the great source 
<br/></span><span>of all wisdom. Strengthened and enlightened by the Master Worker, they will be enabled 
<br/>to stand firm against unholy influences and to discern right from wrong, good from evil.  
<br/>They  will  approve  that  which  God  approves  and  will  strive  earnestly  against  the 
<br/>introduction of wrong principles into His cause.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to commend and congratulate the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Economy, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Economy and their 
<br/>hardworking team for a faithful and forward-looking Budget: a Budget that proves that the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government is committed to being responsible, not just physically but socially and environmentally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  too  would  like  to  congratulate  the  Fijian  15s  Team  for  beating  Samoa  and  winning  the 
<br/>Oceania  Rugby  Women’s  Tournament  in  New  Zealand;  the  Fiji  Pearls  for  beating  Samoa  at  the 
<br/>Oceania Netball Qualifying in Suva and to qualify for the 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town 
<br/>South Africa; and to the Digicel Fiji Kulas for beating Cook Islands in the OFC Women’s Nations 
<br/>Cup  quarter  finals  and  we  wish  them  the  very  best  in  the  semi-final  match  against  the  Solomon 
<br/>Islands.  We also would like to wish all our athletes who will be taking part in the Birmingham 2022 
<br/>Commonwealth Games, the very best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023 Budget continues to lay the foundations for Fijians to have 
<br/>better lives.  This Budget will make sure that all Fijians continue to have access to the high quality 
<br/>public services they need and deserve, such as health, education, housing, et cetera.  The Government 
<br/>continues  to  introduce  new  initiatives  in  each  fiscal  year.    These  initiatives  do  not  benefit  one 
<br/>particular province, group or individual, it will continue to benefit every Fijian.  For so long, the </span><span>Colo 
<br/>kei Viti</span><span> have been under developed.  I must thank the FijiFirst Government for leaving no one behind.  
<br/>With the introduction of the rural electrification it has indeed improved the livelihoods of our fellow 
<br/>Fijians in the </span><span>Colo</span><span> regions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  change is inevitable and it has happened  and will only happen in  God’s 
<br/>timing.  I would like to commend the Government for allocating $145,000 in the 2022-2023 National 
<br/>Budget  to  enable  Fiji  Roads  Authority  to  commence  a  pre-feasibility  investigation  into  the 
<br/>construction of Viti Levu Cross Country Highway.  With the near completion of the construction of 
<br/>the new Matewale Bridge in Navosa, many have been wondering why such a bridge with that size 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1587 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would be constructed in the middle of nowhere.  This allocation has confirmed our suspicions that 
<br/>plans for the construction of new interland highway is underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  planned  Viti  Levu  Cross  Country  Highway  will  significantly  reduce 
<br/>travel  times  and  will  attract  more  job  opportunities  for  our  interior  communities  and  increase  the 
<br/>opportunity for commercial, industrial and tourism expansions throughout Viti Levu’s interior.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth and Sports is assigned with both promoting the holistic development 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  young  people  and  fostering  the  nation’s  athletic  potential.    Too  distinct,  yet  overlapping 
<br/>tasks.  The Government recognises this inextricable link rooted in the formative role that sports play in 
<br/>shaping Fijian youth, instilling them with values and promoting a healthy active lifestyle.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, as a Ministry, we thank the Government for the allocation and would like to state in this Parliament 
<br/>that we will ensure our mandated duties are carried out within our means and with that, we will rise above 
<br/>all expectations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023 Budget has, again, included new initiatives and areas that the 
<br/>allocation will allow our Ministry to continue and further the work that has impacted the lives of our 
<br/>young population.  This initiative and areas includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>supporting community-based capacity building; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>promoting youth leadership; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>promoting the development of sports at all level; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>expanding access to sporting infrastructure for the Fijian people to encourage a healthy living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be focusing on the three areas that have, again, been included in the 2022-
<br/>2023  Budget  initiatives.    Firstly,  supporting  community-based  capacity  building.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>recognising  the  impacts  of  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  socio-economic  status  of  young  people,  the 
<br/>Ministry will employ a targeted approach and recovery strategies that will ensure timely restoration and 
<br/>reform through formulation of  cohesive  youth  and sports plan and  services, enhance partnership and 
<br/>trade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2022-2023 Budget, the Ministry is allocated $500,000 for youth capacity 
<br/>building  and  training  including  ongoing  funding  for  our  youth  farming  initiative  projects,  income 
<br/>generating youth projects and climate change related projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Youth Development and Grants Programme is aimed at empowering and 
<br/></span><span>equipping young people with the knowledge and skills to enable them to become self-reliant and resilient 
<br/></span><span>through developing income generating opportunities that are innovative, viable and sustainable, enabling 
<br/>our youths the opportunity to contribute to economic development.  These initiatives are key pillars in 
<br/>the Ministry’s 5 Year Strategic Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, promoting youth leadership.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further support these key pillars, the 
<br/>Ministry operates  youth training  centres  around the country  along  with  rural and  urban mobile skills 
<br/>training in areas of skill shortage or reskilling  young people in new areas for income generation and 
<br/>sustainable employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enhance partnership and collaborations with relevant line Ministries and organisations is critical 
<br/>to ensure effective and programme implementation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2022-2023 Budget, the 
<br/>Government  will continue  to support  youth training programmes  with  a  funding of $160,000.  These 
<br/>programmes in the Ministry of Youth and Sports fill a vital gap and addresses youths who have not made 
<br/>it in the formal education sector.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>25</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, promoting the development of sports at all level.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the third key area 
<br/>that the Ministry of Youth and Sports continues to focus on is the promotion of the development of sports 
<br/>at all levels which involves the sports development amongst our youths and communities.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Youth and Sports use sports development as an integral component of developing and empowering 
<br/>young people and the country as a whole. This perception has been established from the fact that young 
<br/>people closely associate themselves with participation in sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the technical assistance offered by the Fiji National Sports Committee 
<br/>and other sporting bodies in terms of sports outreach programmes, we as a Ministry, are actively engaged 
<br/>in the communities and sports stakeholders around the country to promote sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023  Budget has  again allocated  $250,000,  especially  focused on 
<br/>community sports association development activities carried out by the Fiji National Sports Commission.  
<br/>Considering the power of sports, play community building, the Fiji National Sports Commission believes 
<br/>empowering communities to take ownership of sports rather than waiting for sporting bodies to come 
<br/>around is the best way to encourage people towards being active. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  through  Government  funding  have  helped  set  up  46 
<br/></span><span>community sports associations around the country.  The Community Sports Association is an association 
<br/></span><span>of  members  of  registered  youth  clubs,  single  or  multi-sports  clubs  who  work  together  to  facilitate 
<br/>community sports and physical activities.  Government is providing funding this year for this community 
<br/>association to grow and lead the revival of community-based competition with a multi-sports focus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry understands and appreciates the current position in this post-COVID-
<br/>19 era and acknowledges the work that has been carried out to allow us to access budget funding to 
<br/>support  the  reviewed  work  that  the  Ministry  has  been  tasked  to  carry  out  as  part  of  the  whole  of 
<br/>Government  effort  to  inject  economic  activity  by  supporting  our  Fijian  youths  who  make  up 
<br/>approximately 70 percent of the Fiji population and labour force through the youth development and 
<br/>sports  development  programmes  noted  thereof.    Through  active  participation,  young  people  are 
<br/>empowered to play a vital role in their own development, as well as that of their communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when youths are empowered, they feel confident and capable.  They become active 
<br/>contributors and collaborators, excited to explore the impact on the world around them.  Sir, with this 
<br/>continued focus, Government investments on youth development programmes, we are recognising that 
<br/>young people are a major human resource for development and key agents of social change, economic 
<br/>growth and technological innovation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with that being said, I fully support the 2022-2023 National Budget.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings to an end the batting list for today.  We will 
<br/>continue with the debate tomorrow.  The batting list for tomorrow is being sent to you online.  You will
