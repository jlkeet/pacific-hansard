<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE 2022-2023 APPROPRIATION BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the order of speakers listed on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Batting Order and I now call upon the first speaker, the Honourable Joseph Nand, to take the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>colleagues and honourable Members of Parliament, at the outset, I wish to express my sincere gratitude 
<br/>to the honourable Minister for Economy and his able team for innovative thinking and hard work in 
<br/>producing a Budget that has been welcomed by many Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 National Budget has been described as an outstanding budget which is fit for its
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
<div><span>1592 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>purpose and meets the expectation of every Fijian. To me, it has not come as a surprise because the 
<br/>FijiFrist Government is known to deliver what is best for Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while many critics tried all their best before the Budget and kept throwing their 
<br/>cards on the table to manipulate people that the 2022-2023 Budget will have nothing for Fijians, the same 
<br/>have been seen licking their wounds and found in the corners with their tails tucked between their legs.  
<br/>Those that attempted to deride the Budget, tried to no avail because Fijians breathed a sigh of relief with 
<br/>this Budget, in the midst of inflating prices for food items and fuel which, again, is not faced by Fiji alone 
<br/>but other nations around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was very evident that this Budget reflected the voice of Fijians which were 
<br/>raised during public consultations conducted by the honourable Minister for Economy - indeed a classic 
<br/>example of what the FijiFirst Government believes - putting people first.  The Budget was not designed 
<br/>by sitting in the room with papers, computers and calculators.  This Budget was driven by what Fijians 
<br/>needed - passion to strengthen the Fijian economy recovery after being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic 
<br/>and determination to support every Fijian in their daily living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon after the Budget, I met a group of Fijians in Nadroga who were cutting 
<br/></span><span>cane and they shared their feelings on how the Budget has components which will positively impact their 
<br/></span><span>family  life and they mentioned inflation, mitigation package,  transport  subsidy  and  guaranteed  sugar 
<br/>price. They are happy and they have extended their sincere gratitude to our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for his great leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has always been quick to respond when  it was needed 
<br/>the most, and this we not only did for one sector but various sectors, ensuring essential support to ordinary 
<br/>Fijians, organisations and institutions.  Let me share some examples when the Drua Team entered the 
<br/>Super Pacific Rugby - the Government came up with a Strategic Plan to support them. When COVID-19 
<br/>hit the country we knew what to do and came up with a revised budget to boost the economy and now 
<br/>that prices are hiking up, inflation and mitigation packages and transport subsidy have been introduced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not shoot in the dark and hope it reaches the target like some on the other side do.  The 
<br/>FijiFirst Government believes in targeted approach and that is why we consult people and then come with 
<br/>the  Budget  so  that  it  serves  its  purpose  and  provides  positive  impact.    Despite  facing  an  economic 
<br/>downturn due to COVID-19, the way our Fijian economy has bounced back is admirable by many nations 
<br/>and this is because of smart planning and delivery of a strategic result-oriented budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to pick a few of the many strong aspects of the Budget which 
<br/>especially brings joy and satisfaction to me, and one of them is the $6.9 million sports grant which has 
<br/>been allocated to support the development of sporting activities in our communities.  We all know what 
<br/>Fijians are capable of doing in the sporting arena - the only country to win gold in Sevens Rugby at the 
<br/>Olympics back to back.  So, the $1.9 million allocation to assist and enhance the performance of national 
<br/>teams through participation at regional and international tournaments, has come at the right time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through continued support, we have such grants.  The FijiFirst Government 
<br/>indicates its seriousness to development at community, national, regional and international level.  We 
<br/>have the capabilities to compete at all levels.  The Government is determined to leave no stones unturned 
<br/>when it comes to supporting our athletes and pledge to carry dreams to sign at global level and that is 
<br/>why $200,000 has been especially allocated to engage local and international experts to enhance sports 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very confident that at such level of focussed resource commitment, we can emphasise more 
<br/>and more of our players and athletes making their mark at international level.  In return, this nature of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1593 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment brings great return in terms of remittances to the country and we are all very much aware of 
<br/>the number of  our  rugby boys  playing in  France,  Japan  and England  and  earning  enough to support 
<br/>families back in Fiji, making their lives better than before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we say health is wealth and that is something which is very much cherished by 
<br/>the Government by adopting the Private and Public Partnership (PPP) model through the free General 
<br/>Practitioners (GPs) Scheme - a way of ensuring that no Fijian is denied basic medical access.  As we are 
<br/>becoming steadier and steadier in our commitments, the allocation of $1 to further boost free the free GPs 
<br/>Scheme is a clear sign of the Government ensuring its promises and becoming sustainable in its initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another aspect which I wish to emphasise is our steadiness in meeting the infrastructure demands, 
<br/>especially through roads and bridges.  While we cannot deny the fact that there are challenges faced in 
<br/>meeting expectations in this area, especially due to the negative impact of climate change, I am glad to 
<br/>say that we have maintained our approach.  It is clearly evident in the bridges being built around the 
<br/>nation which is built on the basis of building back better to ensure durability so that it can serve Fijians 
<br/>for  as  long  as  possible.    The  Fiji  Roads  Authority’s  (FRA)  undertaking  towards  the  Capital  Works 
<br/>Programme is serving what we can expect in future in terms of our roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget has once again shown to the nation, Fiji’s commitment to climate 
<br/></span><span>change.  This was something never undertaken until our honourable Prime Minister took it upon his 
<br/>shoulders for all Fijians during COP 23 and since then, he has continued his journey on this path.  Apart 
<br/>from funding the Nadi River, flood alleviation projects and retaining walls, the funds have also been 
<br/>allocated  towards  studies  in  climate  change  area,  such  as  through  the  three  awards  for  Masters 
<br/>scholarships  for  Monash  University,  Fiji  National  University  (FNU),  Pacific  Island  Countries  and 
<br/>Climate Change Research Centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am urging Fijians to be wise and make the best use of the initiative because 
<br/>the prime objective of the Government is to improve our daily living.  I must also call you to judge what 
<br/>people have to say about the Budget before misinforming people for their personal gains.  Once again, I 
<br/>congratulate the honourable Minister for Economy for a sound and realistic Budget for the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  said  that,  I  support  the  2022–2023  National  Budget  as  announced  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to 
<br/>contribute towards the Budget debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are well aware, I am not an economist nor do I 
<br/>have any business experience, but like most women in Fiji, I am reasonably good at multi-tasking because 
<br/>I  not only  have to  attend to my  parliamentary  responsibilities,  but  I  also have  to carry  out my  other 
<br/>traditional roles in the village as well as cater for my family and household needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like any other entity, managing a household involves watching our income and expenditures 
<br/>carefully to ensure that when catering for my family’s needs.  I first take care of our fixed commitments 
<br/>before our household needs both in Suva and in the village, and that it all adds up based on tight control 
<br/>of our household budget.  And due to my being a widow for many years now and for the sake of my 
<br/>independence, I have to keep very tight control of our finances so that at the end of the day, our needs are 
<br/>met and we have savings for a rainy day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As most housewives know, when it comes to purchasing for our family’s needs, we must remain 
<br/>within our budget and so we cannot afford to develop bad habits like that of the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy where he is unable to control the National Budget and we end up spending well beyond our 
<br/>means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>1594 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I see it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference between the honourable Minister’s Budget and 
<br/>the budget of the ordinary housewives is this, because we can only spend our own money, we have 
<br/>to watch every dollar, in fact, every cent as we cannot afford to let the dollars run away from us.  The 
<br/>funds that the honourable Minister has at his disposal is not his own personal funds, therefore, the 
<br/>responsibility is  greater  and that the fund belong  to  the taxpayers of Fiji  which include all of the 
<br/>housewives in Fiji, as well as all of the people of this country as it mainly comes from taxes and 
<br/>penalties imposed upon the people. So he has to have a more responsible, accountable and caring 
<br/>attitude where he cannot afford to be reckless and careless when it comes to spending which brings 
<br/>me to the budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  see  it,  the  basic  principles  of  managing  a  Government  is  not  much 
<br/>different from managing household expenses.  The difference being that the Government’s funding 
<br/>runs into billions of dollars whilst my household budget is in the thousands.  But the need for prudent 
<br/>management and common sense applies equally to both.  And here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we take heed 
<br/>from  very  wise  words  in  the  </span><span>Bible</span><span>  where  we  are  told  the  importance  of  the  little  things  by  the 
<br/>suggestion that if we are faithful in the little things, we will be faithful in much. If we are dishonest 
<br/>in  little things, we will  be dishonest  in  much and this is  in  regard to  a  wealthy man who hired  a 
<br/>manager to oversee his business enterprises where it was apparent that the manager was incompetent 
<br/></span><span>and wasteful like the wastefulness of the Government hired vehicles that cost $82,191 per day. Why 
<br/></span><span>does  the  Government  leasing  have  to  be  renewed  almost  every  year?  Why  do  some  Government 
<br/>Ministers have to have more than one ministerial vehicle at their beck and call?  Why such vanity, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happens if  you do not return to Parliament after the elections and you become once 
<br/>again just another citizen like so many ordinary housewives facing the reality check of everyday life? 
<br/>It is then that the little things, the dollars and cents that matter so much to the ordinary housewives 
<br/>will become more relevant to each one of us when we are back to square one living the life of ordinary 
<br/>citizens.    For  example,  when  presenting  the  2022-2023  Budget  in  Parliament,  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy referred to the Budget as the blueprint for his next financial year and a prudent 
<br/>responsible and visionary one which he said, “rested on the pillars of infrastructure, education and 
<br/>health.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly on infrastructure, I would like to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for the water situation in Rewa, in that most of the time water pressure is good.  On the landing at 
<br/>Nasali, we are grateful for the railings and the ramp, enabling persons with disabilities to access both 
<br/>sides of the river and also the ablution block at Burenivudi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on electricity because some areas like in my own village, we have 150  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>volts instead of the 240 volts, if you can have look at that, please, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now look at education, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that for the past 15 years, education has had 
<br/>no sense of direction.  Had the Cabinet paid attention to the honourable Minister for Education in 
<br/>2015 when he talked about an Education Commission and for once he made sense, millions of dollars 
<br/>would not have been squandered on hastily put together and hastily removed policies also known as 
<br/>Government  Initiatives  like  milk  for  Year  1  students  and  the  much  doubted  technical  colleges 
<br/>including to-ing from fro-ing from exams to classroom-based assessments back to exams. It is no 
<br/>wonder teachers and students and other stakeholders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, did not know whether they 
<br/>were coming and going. And as such where Fiji was once amongst the top in the Pacific, literacy and 
<br/>numeracy have suffered with so many students even up to Year 8 and you only have to ask any parent 
<br/>and they will confirm about the very poor reading and writing skills their children have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government could take a leaf out of the Education Commission Report of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1595 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2000 titled “</span><span>Learning Together - Directions for Education in the Fiji Islands</span><span>” which was to undertake 
<br/>a comprehensive review of Fiji’s education system.  Amongst other things, it was designed to look 
<br/>at developing our human and intellectual resources, inculcate in our children and young people the 
<br/>values of living and learning together, as they are crucial building blocks for our success as a multi-
<br/>ethnic and multi-cultural nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  six-member  Commission  consisted  of  the  Chairman,  Professor  Kazim  Bacchus  from 
<br/>Canada, Dr. Evelyn Coxon from New Zealand, Professor Royce Sadler from Australia and from Fiji 
<br/>-  Mrs.  Suliana  Siwatibau,  Professor  Subramani  and  Dr.  Esther  Williams.  A  member  of  that 
<br/>Commission currently still in the education sector, Sir, is Professor Subramani at the University of 
<br/>Fiji and Dr. Esther Williams may still be available.  Also mentioned in the Commission Report that 
<br/>assisted in the Commission’s work were professionals such as, Dr. Helen Tavola, Ms. Unaisi Nabobo, 
<br/>who is now a fully-fledged Professor at FNU and Mr. Filipe Jitoko of USP.  That could be the starting 
<br/>point for the work or the basis of a new Education Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In December 1999, with the approval of Cabinet at that time, honourable Pratap Chand, the 
<br/>Minister for Education required the Commission to submit a report on its findings within six months 
<br/>from the commencement of its work and also required it to have extensive consultations throughout 
<br/></span><span>the country.  Funding for this Commission was sourced from the Ministry of Education’s budget and 
<br/></span><span>supplemented by grant contributions from AusAID and NZODA and the Canada fund.  The SDL 
<br/>Government based many of its education policies on this Education Fiji 2020 Strategic Plan.  Had 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government continued with this very detailed and structured plan, the students of Fiji 
<br/>would have been the beneficiaries with a higher standard of literacy and numeracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would be an advantage for political parties running at the next general 
<br/>elections to have the setting up of an Education Commission included in their manifesto as it also 
<br/>deals with Student Loan Schemes, administration of scholarships and loans and directions for change.   
<br/>Failing that, education will continue to slide downhill on a slippery slope.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although,  the  University  of  the  South  Pacific  (USP)  is  mentioned  in  the  Education 
<br/>Commission  Report,  it is  disappointing  to  note  the  absence  of  its  grant  in  the  2022-2023  Budget 
<br/>Estimates.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, did I miss something?  The precedence of both, USP staff and USP staff 
<br/>unions, have highlighted that withholding of grant payments for 2020, 2021 and 2022 already passed 
<br/>in Parliament, I might add, totalling $78.4 million are not beneficial to the students, staff, University 
<br/>or anyone associated with the University, except maybe to someone’s pride and sense of great power.  
<br/>Anyone wielding such power even over Parliament has to be mindful that pride comes before fall, 
<br/>regardless of how long or how short you have had the power and the pride that comes with it, that 
<br/>the fall will come and to be prepared for it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So to the staff and students and to the many housewives associated with USP, the power is in 
<br/>your hands.  Very simply, claim that power and do not tick any FijiFirst candidate as they are all part 
<br/>of  the  colluding  and  conspiring  against  USP.    It  would  be  an  advantage  to  any  political  party  to 
<br/>promise to make good with USP, that that unpaid grant of $78.4 million including what should have 
<br/>been included in the 2022-2023 Budget, will be honoured.  After all, if the economy is in such good 
<br/>hands, the total unpaid grant should be parked at Head 50.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the indigenous people, which other honourable Members 
<br/>have already spoken on which I will not address, except to plead with the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>in terms of the so-called </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owners.  The honourable Prime Minimiser has repeatedly said that 
<br/>all payments have been made.  I beg to differ in that.  Previously, the </span><span>i qoliqoli </span><span>owners were paid 
<br/>fishing licence fees for those fishing in their </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span>.   In the past few years, no such payment has 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been made, no other </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owner of which there are over 400 is willing to say anything as they 
<br/>are too embarrassed and do not want to call the honourable Prime Minister a liar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No satisfactory response has come from the Ministry of Fisheries or the iTaukei Affairs which 
<br/>is supposed to be handling this payment.  We are being advised, however, that there is a trust fund 
<br/>for damage to the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span>.  How that works? No </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owner seems to know as there is no 
<br/>statement of accounts, what the balance is, no one knows.  Will it suffer the same fate as the payment 
<br/>of licence fees to </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owners?  Perhaps, only time will tell. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on another note, I would like to thank the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for giving Rewa the opportunity to showcase our  youth or </span><span>i sausau vou kei Rewa</span><span> at the 
<br/>traditional ceremonies of welcome at the opening of the Rewa Provincial Council at Lomanikoro, 
<br/>Rewa, on 18</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022.  Having the youth participate, Sir, was a challenge, in that, we had to arouse 
<br/>and maintain their interest to showcase their talent in age-old ceremonies with its related protocols 
<br/>which many people had written off as irrelevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had to incorporate modern technology, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to maintain this interest from 
<br/>the youth so we had to have livestreaming, a LED screen and a drone to confirm that tradition and 
<br/></span><span>culture are relevant and applicable to the modern rapidly-evolving world where our youth need to be 
<br/></span><span>grounded  in  that  reality  for  the  stability,  strength  and  durability  they  need  for  them  to  balance 
<br/>themselves, thrive, grow and contribute to the betterment of their people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the Vuniyavu Choir for their especially composed 
<br/>song about their </span><span>Naita, </span><span>the iTaukei Trust Fund for their showcasing of the </span><span>i yau vakamareqeti kei</span><span>
<br/>Rewa.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the chiefs and the people of Rewa for their 
<br/>visionary leadership, contribution, cooperation and collaboration at the two-day Provincial Council 
<br/>Meeting, the Rewa Day that was held over two days and the Thanksgiving Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  week,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  quite  an  eventful  one  and  to  the  beautiful  women,  the 
<br/>housewives of Rewa, what else can I say?  They outdid themselves, Sir, from the finely woven mats 
<br/>for the </span><span>vakamamaca</span><span> to the finely fired Lapita style pottery, the food and the delicacies of Tebara was 
<br/>outstanding.  I would like to thank the Lord for the beautiful cool, fine weather He blessed us with 
<br/>the whole of last week and my prayer is that the Lord will continue to bless us all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament, I rise to respond in support of the 2022-2023 National Budget that was delivered by the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy for delivering an excellent people’s budget that will enable Fiji to forge ahead and regain 
<br/>the growth that the country needs.  Of course, this well thought-out and well-articulated budget is 
<br/>hard to be digested by honourable Members on the other side, they have a habit of seeing the glass 
<br/>half  empty  rather  than  half  full.    What  the  Opposition  needs  to  do  is  to  get  out  of  that  political 
<br/>smokescreen and see what the FijiFirst Government has achieved since it has come into power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has become the regional economic hub.  Our infrastructure investment 
<br/>and investment in technology has put Fiji at an advantage and has benefited the nation. This has not 
<br/>happened just like that, it is the decisive leadership of our honourable Prime Minister that has enabled 
<br/>us to achieve that.  It is the stability that the FijiFirst Government has provided, it is the visionary 
<br/>leadership that this Government has given to Fiji and the ability to be part of the regional and global 
<br/>leadership on issues that concern the region and has global significance. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1597 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  Opposition  is  just  criticising  the  Government  and  its  initiatives,  others  like 
<br/>Australia in </span><span>Nine News </span><span>in July praised Fiji for embarking on a new direct service between Nadi and 
<br/>Adelaide.  While the Opposition criticises, Fiji, under the FijiFirst Government and the leadership of 
<br/>our honourable Prime Minister, moves ahead.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been calls by the honourable Lalabalavu for Fiji to compare itself 
<br/>with  countries  like  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon  Islands  and  Vanuatu.  Really!    Realistically,  we 
<br/>should compare with countries based on the Human Development Index (HDI) collated by UNDP.  
<br/>The HDI was created to emphasise that the people and their capabilities should be the ultimate criteria 
<br/>for assessing the development of a country, not their economic growth.  The 2020 HDI Report places 
<br/>Australia first, then Singapore, New Zealand, Fiji and then Samoa, Vanuatu, Solomon Islands with 
<br/>PNG being the last.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to improve, one must compare itself with the one that is performing better 
<br/>than itself rather than those who are lagging behind.  Calling for Fiji to be compared with Samoa, 
<br/>Vanuatu, Solomon Islands and PNG rather than Australia, Singapore and New Zealand shows the 
<br/>lack of understanding in the subject they are talking about, or probably it is the Opposition’s proposal 
<br/>to take Fiji backwards, should they, God forbid, ever come into power.  Sir, I humbly request the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition  to  either  write  their  own  speech  which  is  factually  correct  or,  at  least,  proofread  the 
<br/></span><span>speeches written by others to ensure that what is being said is factually correct and make sense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 Budget has continued to focus on the agriculture sector and MSMEs.  These 
<br/>are the two sectors that continue to contribute significantly to the GDP of the country and continues 
<br/>to be the biggest employers in the country.  The agriculture sector continues to be the backbone of 
<br/>Fiji and the FijiFirst Government continues to recognise this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be failing in my duty if I do not acknowledge the hardworking farmers 
<br/>who, during difficult times, continue to toil the soil to ensure that the nation was all well-fed.  Not 
<br/>all that we eat is important, it is the result of the hard work of our farmers which keeps us all fed.  
<br/>The  FijiFirst  Government  has  ensured  that  these  farmers  are  well-supported  either  technically  or 
<br/>materially, to enable them to produce for the nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 Budget continues to support these hardworking farmers so that they continue 
<br/>farming and continue feeding the nation.  This has only been possible under the strong leadership of 
<br/>the  honourable  Prime  Minister.    No  other  government,  apart  from  the  FijiFirst  Government,  has 
<br/>invested  the  kind  of  resources  to  stimulate  growth  and  accessibility  for  our  farmers,  yet  political 
<br/>opportunists continue to misinform our farmers in rural and remote communities.  The Opposition 
<br/>never has and never will be able to match the achievements of the FijiFirst Government in the rural 
<br/>and remote communities.

<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while others play by words, the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>puts money where the mouth is.  To this effect, the FijiFirst Government has allocated $2 million 
<br/>towards Commercial Farmers Equity Package and Farm Mechanisation.  Commercial farmers who 
<br/>wish to expand their business and need loans from commercial banks can get their equity contribution 
<br/>through this Package.  The Package also intends to increase farm efficiency through mechanisation.  
<br/>Intensive farming and increase in farm sizes require investment in machinery and equipment on the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farm.  This enables a farmer to maintain profitability and expand the portfolio on the farm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this well-articulated 2022-2023 Budget, gone are the days where the 
<br/>farmer had to book for a Ministry’s farm machinery and wait for its availability.  The allocation of 
<br/>$7  million  towards  the  outsourcing  of  machinery  hire  on  a  50/50  basis  will  ensure  that  farm 
<br/>machinery is readily available for hire.  The waiting time would significantly reduce and efficiency 
<br/>gained on the farm - feels proud to be part of a Government that continues to invest in agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $3.45 million has been allocated for </span><span>dalo</span><span>, ginger, </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and rice farming, 
<br/>with special emphasis on women in agriculture.  Is that not great?  Has anyone from the other side 
<br/>commended the Government on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  I do not think so.  No, they did not, because they will not get their brownie 
<br/>points for supporting or commending a Government programme.  Rural development and women 
<br/>capacity development are things they do not subscribe to.  If they had, they would have commended 
<br/>this allocation in the Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the livestock sector continues to see investment by the Government under 
<br/>this Budget.  The dairy industry has an allocation of $1.2 million which will go as direct assistance 
<br/>to  the  dairy  farmers  under  the  Dairy  Development  Programme.    The  FijiFirst  Government’s 
<br/>assistance to the dairy industry has far exceeded any other Government support to the dairy industry 
<br/>since independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, honourable Kuridrani said that cows are producing an average of 2 litres of milk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per day per cow.  Where did he get his figure from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  This is a direct insult to the hardworking dairy farmers of our country who, 
<br/>despite being faced with Bovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis, continue to forge ahead and improve 
<br/>the dairy industry.  There is a difference between a cow and a goat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suggest that honourable Kuridrani to go back to the farm and see the difference between a 
<br/>cow’s udder and a goat’s udder.  Please, when you go to the farm, you make sure that the big animal 
<br/>is a cow, not something else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs) 
<br/>continue to be a focus of the FijiFirst Government.  Our Government continues to encourage women 
<br/>participation  in  business  and to  support female  entrepreneurship in MSMEs, the Government  has 
<br/>allocated  in  the  2022-2023  Budget  $1.1  million  via  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  as  women 
<br/>entrepreneurs loan package.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  women  entrepreneurs’  loan  package  will  primarily  target  women  entrepreneurs  with 
<br/>registered businesses in operation for a maximum of six months, who require working capital or need 
<br/>to  expand  their  existing  business.    Sir,  10  percent  equity  required  for  the  loan  packages  will  be 
<br/>provided through this $1 million allocation and will greatly support female entrepreneurs’ access to 
<br/>financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst people’s Budget 2022-2023 is an important opportunity to enact 
<br/>policies  for  the  betterment  of  our  nation  however,  this  is  not  the  only  opportunity.    The  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government’s  ears  are  open  to  businesses  of  all sizes  – micro,  small,  medium  and  large,  as  they 
<br/>always have been. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst  Government  remains flexible to develop  joint  solutions on every serious and 
<br/>unforeseen challenges facing our nation’s recovery, especially in the business community.  We have 
<br/>been creating the most efficient and least bureaucratic environment possible for a business to thrive.  
<br/>Our golden rule is, every process must serve a purpose, other than just simply creating a bureaucratic 
<br/>role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the FijiFirst Government has invested $432.3 million in its people who have 
<br/></span><span>suffered  from  the  pandemic.    Apart  from  this,  the  FijiFirst  Government  continues  with  the  $200 
<br/></span><span>million  concessional  loan  via  the  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji  to  assist  businesses  with  working  capital 
<br/>needs.  This assistance continues to be active.  Has anyone from the Opposition side commended the 
<br/>Government for assisting businesses or the people?  No, they did not.  All they cried was ‘freebies’. 
<br/>Is  assisting  its  people  -  freebie?    Is  assisting  the  business  to  continue  operating  under  difficult 
<br/>situation and continuing to employ people - freebie? No, it is not a freebie. It is helping the people to 
<br/>live  the  economy  in  times  of  need.  The  Opposition  calling  this  a  freebie  shows  the  lack  of 
<br/>understanding of economic stimulation and yet they are asking the people to trust them in running 
<br/>the Government. Will they be able to trust them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday,  Honourable  Gavoka  proposed  a  tax  hike,  God  forbid,  but  if  they  ever  were  in 
<br/>power they will put our people in great economic crisis just to help a niche group of people. Everyone 
<br/>knows what effect the global pandemic and the Ukraine-Russian War has had on the global market - 
<br/>availability of resources had contracted, cost of crude oil and refined oil have gone up, freight charges 
<br/>has almost gone up by threefold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is an import-driven market and cost of imports have gone up. Most of 
<br/>our  basic  staples  are  imported  so  the  cost  of  these  imports  have  also  gone  up.  The  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government had no part to play in this increasing cost.  Yet, there are so-called Professors (I do not 
<br/>see him here), who go around the country saying they will decrease the cost of these imports.  How 
<br/>can they sell a product at a price lower than the cost of the price?  The people of Fiji are not fools. 
<br/>They know you are lying through your teeth. I hope he is here.  He always says his part and runs 
<br/>away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same individual has called the 2022-2023 National Budget a </span><span>saqamoli</span><span>
<br/>Budget. This shows his lack of understanding of the assistance provided to the people.  A dollar a 
<br/>day makes a lot of difference to a person who desperately needs this and this honourable Member is 
<br/>belittling this. Those who are in need of assistance only a person with a </span><span>saqamoli</span><span>-sized brain will 
<br/>make such a derogatory comment.  The same Leader of NFP, honourable Professor Prasad, has been 
<br/>going around telling the cane farmers that the guaranteed cane price has been slashed.  Really? Can 
<br/>you stoop that low?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The markets set its price and the Government pitches in the difference to make it $85 a tonne 
<br/>which is the Government-guaranteed price.  Where is the reduction in price?  I urge all the sugarcane

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers not to believe in his lies. He lies through his teeth. Has he told the farmers that the cost of a 
<br/>bag of fertilizer is $80.90? The farmer only pays $20.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $60.90 is paid by the Government. Did he tell this to the media?  No! This 
<br/>will not suit him because the Government is contributing here. He does not get his brownie points.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no limit to how much the NFP will lie and mislead the people just 
<br/>to be in power, let alone going back on his words of not supporting a </span><span>coup</span><span> leader.  The union between 
<br/>the  NFP  and  the  PAP  leader  must  be  really  rosy.  Both  of  them  have  excellent  skills  -  one  is  a 
<br/>professional at running away from the middle of an interview and the other is good at shaking at the 
<br/>Desi  Girls’  tune.    The  fact  is,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  feel  sorry  for  this  Professor  but  I  feel 
<br/>extremely sorry for the students he has taught. Thank God I was not one of his students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  the  Opposition  had  a  wee  bit  of  substance  in  them,  they  would  have  come  up  with  an 
<br/>alternative budget and not only with criticisms.  We should not disagree for the sake of disagreeing 
<br/>only.  Look at the reasons behind this excellent Budget.  I am sure if Honourable Members shared 
<br/>their political veil aside, they will clearly see the rationale and the greater good of the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji have chosen us to represent them in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span><span>Let us not desecrate their confidence in us.  Let us not mislead them. Let us speak the facts and not 
<br/>let our political opinion cloud this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad needs to be told the facts without being fabricated to suit  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>own personal agenda.  Denzel Washington once said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“You will never be criticized by someone who is doing more than you.  You’ll always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be criticized by someone doing less.  Remember that.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition in this Parliament is doing just that. They have not been able to even dream about 
<br/>what the FijiFirst Government has already delivered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy for delivering the 2022-2023 Budget (People’s Budget) which I support, and I am sure the 
<br/>whole nation supports.  Thank you and God Bless Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  the  fellow  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament  and  to  those  members  of  the  public  sitting  in  the  public  gallery  and  those  tuning  in  this 
<br/>morning from the comforts of their homes or offices, </span><span>drau bula nakwa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to join our fellow colleagues in also conveying my best wishes to our athletes 
<br/>participating in the Birmingham Commonwealth Games and I only wish them that they will do their best, 
<br/>that they are all winners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I also would like to convey my best wishes to the top two local provincial rugby teams; Naitasiri 
<br/>and Nadi playing in the finals of the Skipper Cup Competition this Saturday.  As the supporters of the 
<br/>Naitasiri usually say, “go black go” and that supporters of Nadi “</span><span>cevu</span><span> Nadi or must be Nadi”, may the 
<br/>best team win. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will begin by stating that it is quite unfortunate that in listening to the Budget 
<br/>responses over the  last  day,  it seems that  a  good  majority  of speakers are  focused  on the impending 
<br/></span><span>General Elections that will occur later this year, instead of considering the recovery plans Fiji needs to 
<br/></span><span>have in place to combat the unprecedented challenge of managing the consequences of the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic.  In  Fiji,  a  country  where  international  tourism  is  still  the  cornerstone  of  the  economy, 
<br/>implications of the crisis are massive and it is obvious that the road to full recovery will be steep, given 
<br/>the effects of the war in Ukraine and other global shocks mostly created by the drastic effects of climate 
<br/>change on countries around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Budget  Estimate  announced  by  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and 
<br/>Minister for Economy on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 is a stimulus package worth $2.939 billion for the 2022-2023 
<br/>financial year.  The question for us as legislators will be to review whether Fiji will be allocating the 
<br/>resources in a way that addresses the country’s needs and whether such resources will deliver short-term 
<br/>benefits with the focus to target the protection of our population against the continuing crisis, or achieves 
<br/>a more inclusive, prosperous and sustainable economy.  Sir, is there a way to achieve both goals in this 
<br/>Budget Estimates?  That is the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  not  every  stimulus  spending  has  long-term  benefits  and  not  all  long-term 
<br/>investments will be able to deliver a short-term stimulus.  For instance, infrastructure projects often take 
<br/>years to be designed and approved so they cannot create many jobs quickly, unless they are already ready 
<br/>to go.  In any event, Sir, as a shadow spokesperson for infrastructure, it is important that I remind this 
<br/>august Parliament that physical infrastructure has a critical role to play in supporting the post-pandemic 
<br/>recovery and in laying the longer term foundations for green, resilient and inclusive development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  growing  body  of  evidence  highlights  the  contribution  of  infrastructure 
<br/>development to a wide range of development indicators and this includes; employment, productivity, 
<br/>income, inequality, trade and human capital formation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, here in Fiji, infrastructure remains waffling inadequate.  A lot of our people, 
<br/>especially in the rural and maritime zones live more than a mile from an all-season road and many more 
<br/>lack access to electricity at home, whilst accessing the broadband signals is also a challenge for many.  
<br/>Even where these services are available, they are frequently erratic and unaffordable.  The disruptions 
<br/>caused by unreliable infrastructure caused individuals and businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars 
<br/>annually.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, investment in infrastructure was well below the levels  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needed to achieve Fiji’s development goals.  Since the pandemic, spending has been further squeezed, 
<br/>for  example,  in  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (WAF)  for  the  2019-2020  Budget,  there  was  a  budget 
<br/>provision of $258.7 million.  The Budget Estimates in 2020-2021 was $195.3 million, for 2021-2022, a 
<br/>budget of $195.2 million was set, and for this new 2022-2023 Budget, a budget of $204 million has been 
<br/>set.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), fortunately, there has been some growth, for 
<br/>instance, in 2020-2021, the actual budget expenditure was $277.1 million.  For 2021-2022, the revised 
<br/>Budget estimate of $338.1 million was set.  For 2022-2023, a Budget estimate of $376.7 million had been 
<br/>set. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  recent  report  study  of  developed  and  underdeveloped  nations,  it  was 
<br/>captured at whilst many developed economies have implemented stimulus packages to support economic 
<br/>recovery often with the infrastructure components, the world’s poorest States lack of fiscal space for such 
<br/>measures and calls have been made for enhanced efforts to fund infrastructure development in low and 
<br/>middle income countries for instances.  Given the crucial link that infrastructure provides for national 
<br/>development  and  substantially,  the  acknowledgement  that  infrastructure  cuts  across  the  successful 
<br/>implementation of all sustainable development goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  crucial  that  we  acknowledge  how  Government  has  tended  to  a  lot  of 
<br/>infrastructure upgrades, maintenance and new projects.  However, the delay in submission of Annual 
<br/>Reports to Parliament from entities, such as FRA and WAF where the last Annual Report was presented 
<br/>in Parliament for the year 2018 under the Ministry of Infrastructure, will not provide Parliament with the 
<br/>ability to gauge whether the programmes announced through budgetary provisions are actually being 
<br/>carried out on the ground.  This, Sir, must be corrected and such entities must be addressed upon to be 
<br/>diligent and timely in the submission of their Annual Reports which is tied to their audit accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, infrastructure development will always be susceptible to internal and external 
<br/>shocks.  And with the climate change occurring around the world, we have lessons that we must learn 
<br/>from and it becomes critical that there is readiness to address such recovery process when needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the aftermath of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, so many of our infrastructure was badly affected and it has taken 
<br/>years  for  some  of the infrastructural  damages to be  fully  restored.  For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in 
<br/>Nasavu Village in Naitasiri, the road slip along the main Sawani-Serea Road remains a one-lane road at 
<br/>present, and the risk of such road being further damaged in another severe storm is a high possibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will recall that for the Western Division, it took months for some areas to be 
<br/>fully  connected back to the  electricity  grid  and likewise, to  access internet.    I  am well  aware that  as 
<br/>massive rebuilding and recovery effort got underway after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> as captured by the World Bank 
<br/>Report, Fiji recognised that it would achieve resilience through stronger, faster and more inclusive post-
<br/>disaster reconstruction.  And I note that Government launched the Build Back Better Programme and as 
<br/>such, worked with the World Bank to develop the country’s first ever Climate Vulnerability Assessment 
<br/>(CVA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Underpinned by the live climate experience of the Fijian people, the CVA sought to quantify and 
<br/>better understand the threat posed by natural hazards and clime change in Fiji in order to help design 
<br/>Climate Adaptation and Risk Management Plans.  I note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that CVA identified five main 
<br/>areas that could significantly reduce the country’s vulnerabilities, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusive and resilient urban development;  
<br/>Enhanced and resilient infrastructure services;  
<br/>Sustainable agriculture and fisheries conserving ecosystems;

<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Building socio-economic resilience though actions and early warning and preparedness; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  
<br/>Social protection and healthcare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outcome of the CVA was a proposedly some 125 interventions across 10 sectors and these 
<br/>sectors include; housing and land use, hazard management, transport, water, energy, health, education, 
<br/>environment, agriculture, fisheries and social protections.  I understand that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>total estimated cost to do all the interventions was about FJ$9.3 billion, which is almost 100 percent of 
<br/>GDP over 10 years, plus additional maintenance and operational costs and social expenses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such investments are justified and Government must do all it can to bring this 
<br/>to pass.  Our future survival could very well depend on it when future superstorms are expected according 
<br/>to global meteorological experts.  In short, I am one that will critic Government policies where needed, 
<br/>but I will acknowledge progress where obligatory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we all know during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, Fiji was met 
<br/>with a secondary shock - </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, a Category 4 storm that hit the country and resulted in $44 million 
<br/>in damages with, at least, 635 houses totally destroyed and 2,100 homes damaged.  Sir, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span> was 
<br/></span><span>the first significant storm to test the more resilient standards used in the reconstruction of the 2016 </span><span>TC 
<br/></span><span>Winston</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very pleased, Mr. Speaker, to note that of the 181 schools and 25 public buildings that had 
<br/>been completed to-date under the Build Back Better Programme, none were damaged.  From a finance 
<br/>perspective, this progress delivered a twofold game for Fiji, primarily protecting the Fijian people during 
<br/>a crisis and the Government’s budget from a catastrophic costs of rebuilding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Opposition, our job is to encourage Government to be more robust in its 
<br/>role to champion sustainable development for our national infrastructure.  On that note, contrary to the 
<br/>positive report I have just highlighted, the QVS dormitories and school block rehabilitation was a disaster 
<br/>post-</span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>, as we all know.  Perhaps, that was due to poor administrative oversight where the 
<br/>buildings quickly deteriorated and has necessitated a rebuilding.  Lessons learnt from this will hopefully 
<br/>assist in other similar projects around the country, like that at Lekutu Secondary School in Bua, which 
<br/>was damaged following </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, experience from previous disasters in Fiji highlights the benefits from investing 
<br/>in resilience, and with increasing risks driven by the socio-economic development and urbanisation, the 
<br/>need to do more for resilience remains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, itt is important to understand that the world is interconnected and our challenges 
<br/>will not be isolated.  For example, in January this year, when the volcanic eruption and tsunami occurred 
<br/>in the Kingdom of Tonga, it damaged and disconnected severely the island’s submarine internet cable for 
<br/>months.  A lot of students studying in Fiji and businesses that have mutual interest in Tonga were severely 
<br/>affected and it was not an easy ordeal to get through.  Sir, we acknowledge, therefore, the proposed 
<br/>submarine cables targeted to be connected in Lautoka and trust that such infrastructure will be climate-
<br/>resilient and accommodate lessons learnt from those occurring around us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have just returned from Wellington in New Zealand in the weekend for 
<br/>which  I  thank  the  Parliament  of  Fiji  and  yourself,  Sir,  for  allowing  us  to  be  part  of  the  upskilling 
<br/>programme of the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committees (ACPAC).  We noted that the 
<br/>severe weather patterns been experienced was creating havoc for travellers and road-users, not to mention 
<br/>affecting flights into and out of New Zealand.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, globally, it has been noted that in times of crisis, dependency on infrastructure 
<br/>becomes crucial to offer solutions. Take for instance when the COVID-19 pandemic hit us, there were 
<br/>massive lockdowns for communities and air travel almost grounded to a standstill with the exception of 
<br/>cargo flights.  In those instances, much needed assistance was relied upon for struggling families and 
<br/>keeping in touch with families overseas not only meant people’s stability and mental status were assisted.  
<br/>But the much needed financial support came in by way of global remittances. The use of internet was so 
<br/>crucial during that period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, two years ago, we were not accustomed to virtual meetings, which was what 
<br/>we all turned to when physical meetings became unsafe because of possible transmissions of the COVID-
<br/>19  virus.  Sir,  it  is  an  eye  opener  to  note  that  during  the  peak  periods  of  the  pandemic  in  Fiji  and 
<br/>everywhere else around the world, digital applications that support online services delivery and remote 
<br/>work enabled firms, businesses, schools, courts and government to continue operating -  I guess this is 
<br/>the new norm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will still remember the pictures of teachers climbing mountains and crossing 
<br/>rivers, some on horseback to get to areas where there was internet connectivity and to be able to download 
<br/>teaching  materials  that  were  to  be  distributed  to  students  because  schools  were  closed.    We  must, 
<br/></span><span>therefore, keep those pictures vividly in our minds and thank the many brave teachers who rose over and 
<br/></span><span>above their call of duty, just as the health workers and those in defence forces did to be able to serve our 
<br/>children in our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst I congratulate Fiji for our ability to be resilient as a nation when COVID-19 drove our 
<br/>nation to a standstill, Government must be encouraged to continue to invest in the infrastructure that will 
<br/>enable  us  to  become  even  more  resilient  to  crisis.    Our  internet  cables  and  powers  must  be  able  to 
<br/>withstand such climate change and logistical arrangements that will now be inevitable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  many  of  us today  rely  on the internet to  make payments  and 
<br/>communication.  I raised in this august Parliament previously and through the relevant line Ministers that 
<br/>up in the hills of Naitasiri, a Vodafone tower in Taulevu remains under dispute and, therefore, affecting 
<br/>connectivity  to  those  villages  relying  on  the  tower,  like  the  villages  of  Naluwai,  Waidracia,  Serea, 
<br/>Waisere,  Naterumai,  Waisa  and  other  surrounding  communities.    Similar  incidents  are  most  likely 
<br/>occurring in other areas around Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, including the maritime islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the islands,  we use the internet  to purchase/top up  bus  cards, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as  well  as 
<br/>MPAiSA transactions to pay for cash power in order to access electricity. The same is critical to allow 
<br/>social welfare recipients to access the assistance. Due to the unavailability of this Vodafone connectivity, 
<br/>people  have  to  travel  right  down  to  Sawani,  Suva  and  Nausori  to  access  their  needs.    We  seek 
<br/>Government’s  intervention  accordingly  and  hope  this  brings  the  reality  of  the  crucial  role  such 
<br/>infrastructure provides for basic living in our communities that are far-flung from the main commercial 
<br/>business centres and districts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  investing  in  sustainable  infrastructure  that  promotes  social  inclusion  and 
<br/>addresses different dimensions of inequality is imperative.  Despite the surge in  </span><span>Digicel</span><span> connectivity 
<br/>during the pandemic in Fiji, people remained offline because of connectivity issues, limited by access to 
<br/>supporting infrastructure.  This digital divide has led to serious inequities in development outcomes.  Such 
<br/>limitations  in  Fiji’s  infrastructure,  Mr.  Speaker,  continues  to  promote  substantial  disparities  between 
<br/>urban and rural areas, the haves and the have nots and subsequently, disparities are exacerbated between 
<br/>men and women, girls and boys in some parts of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, according to UNICEF, lack of access to relevant technologies prevented, at least, 
<br/>463 million or 31 percent of school children worldwide from participating in digital and broadcast remote 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>learning during the pandemic.  We, therefore, must audit the One Laptop Per Child Programme, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  How does that work in Fiji’s geographical layout?  When can we expect each child in Fiji 
<br/>to be able to be connected to the internet?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall effect of physical infrastructure on development depends on 
<br/>how investments are coordinated with each other and complemented by supportive policy measures.  I 
<br/>wish, therefore, to acknowledge the planned Viti Levu cross-country highway which is to connect Suva 
<br/>to the Western Division, as revealed by the honourable Minister for Economy in his Budget Address.  My 
<br/>only issue here, Sir, is to encourage Government to enter into a joint venture by way of a PPP that can 
<br/>include  transport  providers  and  landowners,  and  primarily  the  infrastructure  needs  to  be  by  way  of 
<br/>tramlines that could better the time of travel and allow for mass cargo movement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  good  infrastructure  by  way  of  necessary  roads,  for  instance,  allows  for 
<br/>substantial economic benefits.  Infrastructure has much to contribute to the post-pandemic recovery, as 
<br/>well as to long-term green resilient and inclusive development, especially in outer rural and maritime 
<br/>areas where the need for investment is especially urgent.  Meeting that need will be a daunting challenge 
<br/>but also one that can be turned into an opportunity for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, it is evident that the Government Budget provided will have to be 
<br/></span><span>increased  further  in  the  near  future  as  we  move  to  ensure  resilience  and  effectiveness  of  such 
<br/>infrastructure.  We cannot be complacent and we will need all stakeholders to play our part to ensure Fiji 
<br/>is climate-changed and disaster-ready for whatever lies before us.  I will reserve any support for this 
<br/>Budget until I see that Government actually carries out its plan as captured in the 2022-2023 Budget.  
<br/>Until then, Mr. Speaker, this can all be pies in the skies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To end, Mr. Speaker, I wish to very briefly respond to honourable Maharaj for what he mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this Parlimanet yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Tell him!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Honourable  Maharaj  should  know  that  despite  all  the  cloak  and 
<br/>dagger activities happening, SODELPA is here to stay, and people like me will ensure our people are 
<br/>served by consistent abled politicians who do not change political ideologies and principles because they 
<br/>follow a specific leader.  Leaders come and go, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but our legacies will capture who we 
<br/>are and what we did.  Sir, SODELPA will continue to be the voice of reason and hope for many who 
<br/>believe in the rule of law and in a future that promotes peace and stability for all who call Fiji home.  
<br/></span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span> and God bless Fiji and our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>, good morning, 
<br/></span><span>ram ram </span><span>and </span><span>namaskar</span><span>.  I stand here today to support the motion by the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>and Minister for Economy on the 2022-2023 Budget Appropriation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the onset, please, allow me to congratulate our Pacific Leaders on the 
<br/>adoption of the 2050 Oceans Strategy for the Blue Pacific Commitment with a special focus on climate 
<br/>change and disaster.  The Strategy focuses on our faith, cultural values, traditional knowledge, resilience 
<br/>and a shared vision which will reflect as building blocks for the 2022-2023 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Global Assessment Report 2022 highlighted that extensive risks are growing 
<br/>at an unprecedented rate where the impact of disasters are cascading across all sectors, thus creating new 
<br/>challenges which need to be imminently  addressed.   From the  recent  flooding in New South Wales, 
<br/>Australia, to the volcanic eruption in Tonga and from the compounding impact of COVID-19 crisis to

<div><span>the current war in Ukraine, we must come together as a country to ensure that we achieve the commitment 
<br/>set in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement and Sendai Framework for 
<br/>Disaster Risk Reduction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year’s Budget is a budget that is prudent, responsible and visionary-focused, 
<br/>building the value of family, security, justice, true democracy and equal opportunity.  Because of the 
<br/>Government’s  consistent,  strong  and  innovative  leadership,  this  Budget  will  allow  our  economy  to 
<br/>recover smoothly over the worst economic crisis in history, providing the pathway to recovery of the 
<br/>national economy, as well as the pathway to recover right down to the family level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  2022-2023  financial  year,  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office 
<br/>(NDMO) has been allocated $1.4 million to ensure that we are not only building back better, but building 
<br/>forward  better  through  this  inclusive  and  resilient  Budget.    The  2022-2023  National  Budget  aims  to 
<br/>simultaneously facilitate Fiji’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigate (as best as possible) 
<br/>the impact of the Russian war with Ukraine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this war in Ukraine is significantly contributing to global inflation – the serious 
<br/>implication of global financial system.  People globally are facing the cost of living crisis not seen in 
<br/></span><span>generations, according to the latest finding by the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group on Food, 
<br/></span><span>Energy and Finance.  Here at home, we are not spared as we grapple with the impact of the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic and climate change.  This is the reason, Sir, the strong leadership and innovation that is present 
<br/>in this Budget will pave the way forward for the nation.  We cannot do this alone but together, all Fijians 
<br/>and with the timely assistance from our development partners, will bring us through this crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, I would like to acknowledge the Australian Government for its investment of $1.3 
<br/>million towards the renovation of our Western Division warehouse complex.  This new building will 
<br/>provide the state-of-the-art and conducive building, and environmental first responders working tirelessly 
<br/>in disaster response operations in the Western Division.  Further support was rendered to the construction 
<br/>of the NDMO Warehouse at the Back Rock facility in Nadi.  This will also greatly improve the capability 
<br/>of  NDMO  to  prepare  and  respond  to  disasters  both,  locally  and  regionally.    Earlier  this  month,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, over 90 pallets of non-food items was airlifted from Brisbane and it is now pre-positioned 
<br/>at the warehouse as we are now three months away from the start of the cyclone season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In partnership with the Japanese Government, a total of $8.9 million has been committed to the 
<br/>extension of tsunami sirens in strategic positions from Lami to Rakiraki.  An additional $25,000 has been 
<br/>committed  this  year  to  the  maintenance  of  emergency  equipment,  such  as  tsunami  sirens  and  high 
<br/>frequency telecommunication equipment installed across the four Divisions.  Another $9,000 has been 
<br/>committed to the maintenance of Flood Early Warning System in Nadi and Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  people-centred  disaster  risk  reduction  approach  is  our  way  forward.    In 
<br/>partnership with our Australian humanitarian partners, over $1.2 million has been invested on upskilling 
<br/>our communities to be disaster ready.  An additional of $10,000 has been allocated to ensure this work 
<br/>continues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, data is key to making informed decisions for all stages of 
<br/>the  disaster  cycle  ranging  from  baseline  information  on  the  availability  and  capacity  of  the  risk 
<br/>community to provide the basis for target interventions on relief during short and long term recovery.  
<br/>This has been alluded to in the comment made by Deputy General-Secretary of the United Nations, 
<br/>Ms. Amina Jane Mohammed, that we need to invest in stronger data capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this regard Government has committed $25,000 towards the maintenance 
<br/>and  management  of  the  National  Emergency  Operation  Centre  for  Disaster  Preparedness,

<div><span>Monitoring, Coordinating Disaster Response and Relief Operations. We are also working with the 
<br/>Pacific Disaster Centre in Hawaii in harmonising datasets to improve our operations.  The NDMO 
<br/>has also developed and will soon launch its revamped website that will be an online portal and one-
<br/>stop-shop for disaster risk and emergency information for the general public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  is  also  committed  to  ensuring  that  Disaster  Risk 
<br/>Management in Fiji is multi-structural inclusive of embracing cross-cutting issues including gender, 
<br/>disability, environment and other areas which informed the whole of Government approach towards 
<br/>disaster  management.  Thus,  this  allocation  by  Government  for  strengthened  and  integrated  data 
<br/>systems  will  decrease  silos  and  increase  interoperability  and  coordination  across  Government 
<br/>agencies and stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that Disaster Risk Reduction is not just a humanitarian issue 
<br/>but  a  development  one  and  this  Budget  provides  pathways  for  mainstreaming  of  disaster  risk 
<br/>reduction into the pillars of infrastructure, health and education.  Government recognises that just by 
<br/>investing $1 into disaster risk reduction, we are going to save $7 in disaster recovery when a disaster 
<br/>will hit us next. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has approved a budget of $50,000 for the mainstream of 122 action items 
<br/></span><span>under the National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy (NDRRP) across Government agencies and civil 
<br/>society  organisations  to  enable  a  continued  focus  on  priorities  and  plans  for  structural  and  non-
<br/>structural  measures  to  alleviate  the  impact  of  disasters.    Such  investments  will  help  us  navigate 
<br/>complex risks earlier, faster and in a more targeted and efficient manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even with the two years of COVID-19 impacts and lockdowns, the Fijian 
<br/>Government’s work on mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction across thematic areas has continued.  
<br/>I am proud to say that we have achieved the following milestones thus far: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic sector - 43 action items in progress; 
<br/>Administration sector - 36 action items in progress; 
<br/>Infrastructure sector - 23 action items in progress; and 
<br/>Social sector - 19 action items in progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure this august Chamber that we will continue this momentum and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are not going to make excuses that will prevent us from continuing to build forward better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  NDMO  is  also  developing  an  online  Risk  Training  Tool  that  will  equip 
<br/></span><span>Provincial Administrators and District Officers with the ability to safely determine the viability of 
<br/>proposed community development projects. This Risk Screening Tool will also help them determine 
<br/>risk reduction measures for these projects so that the Government and community investments are 
<br/>safeguarded from disaster, climate, health and social risks.  This is all part of the contribution towards 
<br/>minimising development risks and to ensure that our hard-earned development gains are protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all must work together and ensure to give a voice to the marginalised 
<br/>group who are often amongst the most vulnerable to natural hazards and ensure that their interests 
<br/>are adequately addressed and their rights are protected.  It is critical to consult the key implementers 
<br/>and  beneficiaries  in  the  policy  development  phase,  allowing  more  opportunities  for  a  bottom-up 
<br/>approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In partnership with the International Immigration Organization and KOICA, a total of $12 
<br/>million will see the construction of four evacuation centres and retrofitting a few more.  This initiative

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with our partners will enable the widespread dissemination of good practices in evacuation  centre 
<br/>design and construction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these evacuation centres are multi-purpose in nature and during peacetime 
<br/>will  serve  as  business  incubation  and  promotion  centres  for  rural  communities.    Furthermore,  to 
<br/>complement  this  initiative,  the  Government  has  committed  $20,000  for  the  development  of  the 
<br/>evacuation  centre  retrofitting  guidelines  to  standardise  the  construction  and  management  of 
<br/>evacuation centres around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank the management and the leadership of schools, 
<br/>community  halls  and  other  buildings  commonly  used  as  evacuation  centres  for  their  continued 
<br/>support  to  Government  in  the  use  of  their  facilities  as  we  are  grateful  for  these  vital  community 
<br/>service that is a key component of disaster relief and response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must reiterate in order to collectively manage complex disasters, we have 
<br/>to  work  together  and  forge  partnership  at  all  levels.    The  National  Disaster  Management  Office 
<br/>(NDMO)  is  working  closely  with  government  agencies  and  development  partners  to  combat  the 
<br/>impact of disasters and climate change and build resilience on all Fijians through Community Based 
<br/></span><span>Risk Disaster training and mainstreaming disaster risk reduction initiative at the national and sub-
<br/></span><span>national level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to demonstrate strong political wing on innovative financial solutions, the 
<br/>Fijian Government over the past six years has committed over $18 million towards disaster response 
<br/>operations.  This year, the Budget allocates $500,000 towards the Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation 
<br/>Fund that will enable NDMO to  act swiftly of any needed humanitarian response to any climatic 
<br/>event.   The Fijian  Government continues to  recognise that  despite all our best  efforts,  we cannot 
<br/>completely remove risks and disasters as they will somehow or the other impact us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  I  would  like  to  highlight  that  the  2021  Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate 
<br/>Change (IPCC) Report has warned us that we are almost reaching the tipping point of 1.5 degree 
<br/>Celsius.  Therefore, with less time on our hand, we require an all of society approach to fight this 
<br/>climate emergency together.  We also require flexible conditions to disaster and climate finance to 
<br/>bring about more sustainable outcomes including long-term, programmatic delivery.  Therefore Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I convey my congratulations to the honourable Minister for Economy and his Permanent 
<br/>Secretary, Mr. Shiri Gounder, and his dynamic team for this inclusive and forward-looking Budget 
<br/>that will steer us out of this unprecedented time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members; the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy has, again, come to Parliament with this Budget just like previous ones, and it is another 
<br/>smokes and mirrors trick - another attempt to continuously hoodwink the people of Fiji.  And for this 
<br/>one, it is simply a grandstanding electioneering Budget, targeting instant gratification and short-term 
<br/>benefits  rather  than  sustainable  economic  recovery.    Therefore,  I  hold  a  lot  of  reservation  in 
<br/>supporting this Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will recall that in 2015, the Budget theme was “</span><span>Turning Promises into Deeds</span><span>” which we, 
<br/>on this side of Parliament had called it turning promises into debts.  From then, our debt level has 
<br/>continued to grow and now it sits at almost $10 billion or 85 percent of our GDP.  And yes, the people 
<br/>of Fiji are alarmed because they know that our future generation will have to carry this debt burden.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even with the rise in debt level, these capital projects that were promised from 2015 are still 
<br/>empty promises until to-date.  The new Nausori Hospital, the new look CWM Hospital, the Nasinu

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2019-2020 Budget, there was the Bainimarama Boom but boom for 
<br/>whom? For in reality majority of our people have been left behind, our poverty level sits at more than 
<br/>30 percent right now or even maybe more because of the effect or the challenges brought forward by 
<br/>the COVID-19.  If, indeed, there was the Bainimarama Boom, why were majority of those who lost 
<br/>their jobs to COVID-19 had to resort to their FNPF retirement funds to sustain themselves according 
<br/>to the Bainimarama Government policy?  And to make matters worse, there has been no commitment 
<br/>by the Government to reimburse members’ FNPF contribution.  Majority of those people are still out 
<br/>of job, some are unable to get their jobs back like flight attendants and hotel workers but many thanks 
<br/>to human resilience who have turned to entrepreneurial activities to be able to sustain themselves and 
<br/>their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people only heard about the Bainimarama Boom but failed to experience 
<br/>it in their daily lives.  People only know about the “kaput” in the health service delivery and a good 
<br/>example in the CWM Hospital, just two weeks ago, a young boy was admitted and was scheduled 
<br/>for CT Scan which did not take place almost after one week because the CT Scan machine was facing 
<br/></span><span>problems and could only take a certain number of scans in a day because the machine gets heated up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one only has to go past the CWM Hospital to see the deplorable condition 
<br/>of our biggest hospital is in.  Every year we hear of a budgetary allocation for repair and maintenance 
<br/>works for CWM Hospital but nothing substantial has really changed.  The only obvious change we 
<br/>see is the change in the big sign board that shows the glamorous pictures of the projected new look 
<br/>CWM Hospital but being replaced due to fair wear and tear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the five-year and 20-year National Development Plan that was launched in 
<br/>Bonn by the honourable Prime Minister as Chair of COP 23 states that for urban areas, 100 percent 
<br/>access to clean and safe water will be realised by 2021 and for the rural and maritime communities 
<br/>by 2030.  Yet we continue to face water cuts and likewise, for the rural and maritime areas too.  For 
<br/>example, I had been continuously requesting in this Parliament to have the water system in Yacata 
<br/>Island and Nabouwalu in Bua checked and improved but it has fallen on the deaf ears.  In this 2022-
<br/>2023 Budget, we hear another version and it is the Bula Boom but does this match the reality on the 
<br/>ground or is it just another grandstanding electioneering budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard that all tertiary students will be paid a total of $180 in two 
<br/>instalments  of  $90  in  the  next  six  months.    It  seems  that  right  now  six  months  is  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government’s favourite timeframe and why? Is it because that the next six months ties in well with 
<br/>the upcoming election?  We must not forget that COVID-19 is still very much around and the effect 
<br/>of the Russia-Ukraine War will not go away after six months.  If the Government is really concerned 
<br/>about the future of our tertiary students, then they should revisit the failed policy that established the 
<br/>technical colleges, resulting in their closure and subsequently denied students in those areas access 
<br/>to those technical programmes and in some centres, buildings and other infrastructure are wasting 
<br/>away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government must also reconsider the release of grants to USP as approved in previous 
<br/>Budgets.  Unfortunately, the USP grant is being missed out in this year’s Budget.  In this regard, I 
<br/>urge the Government to graciously and sincerely persist in </span><span>talanoa,</span><span> regional dialogue and partnership 
<br/>to ensure that our USP students our future leaders are not left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  now  move  on  to  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation.  We acknowledge the additional benefits being given out to all categories of recipients 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Department of Social Welfare.  There are about 89,000 or even more recipients and numbers 
<br/>continue to increase every year, but on the flip side, we could be breathing dependency syndrome 
<br/>mentality on this Government handouts.  To holistically address this, the Government must look at 
<br/>work fair initiatives to win out those that could engage in some self-employment programmes.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our children, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we acknowledge the proposed Department of Children in 
<br/>this Budget and it is something that the Ministry and previous Governments have also considered in 
<br/>the past, and I am personally happy that it has come to fruition.  The United Nations Pacific Socio-
<br/>Economic  Impact  Assessment  of  COVID-19  Fiji  Report  highlighted  that  commercial  sexual 
<br/>exploitation  of  children  continues.  The  most  common  forms  of  child  sexual  exploitation  are 
<br/>prostitution, pornography and sex trafficking, and often children involved in any of these activities 
<br/>are involved in all of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report further stated that this mainly happens in urban centres and the main drivers of 
<br/>sexual exploitation were poverty, homelessness and living away from parents.  In this regard, we 
<br/>really hope that the new Department of Children will prioritise addressing this multi-led problem to 
<br/>ensure our children are not left behind and their interests are protected.  Furthermore, we continue to 
<br/>see a lot of children selling mostly food around shopping areas as families, especially, mothers try 
<br/></span><span>and deal with the rising cost of living and unemployment.  It is really concerning and sad to see these 
<br/></span><span>young children engaged in these activities even into the late afternoons and evenings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also noted that the Budget has allocated, as part of the mitigation package, the $1 per day 
<br/>per child for 18 years and below for the next six months to all families with combined income of 
<br/>$50,000 or less.  But people are asking why only for six months?  Yes, people have worked it out 
<br/>very well because the six months again jells in with the upcoming Elections.  The people know that 
<br/>this is not a constructive and sustainable approach to stop mothers from sending their children to sell 
<br/>food in very open and risky environment.  It sure looks like another deceptive strategy  where our 
<br/>children are being used to buy votes.  It is heartless and hypocritical, to say the least.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will recall the Free Milk Programme that was rolled out in schools for all Class 1 students, 
<br/>what has happened to that?  Why has it stopped?  Another nagging issue is the missing children, 
<br/>which we have also highlighted in this august Parliament.  According to a recent newspaper article, 
<br/>the Commissioner of Police said that the high number of missing children is because of the lack of 
<br/>communication  especially  at  home,  and  had  rejected  claims  that  children  missing  are  linked  to 
<br/>kidnapping racket.    But  has there been a report submitted in  this Parliament  to  substantiate these 
<br/>claims?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  noted  that  about  80.5  percent  of  Fijian  children  have  experienced  some  form  of 
<br/>violence and over 1,300 child protection cases have been reported to the Ministry.  It is our hope that 
<br/>the  new  proposed  Department  of  Children  will  look  at  harmonising  the  children’s  right  with  our 
<br/>cultural practices and context.  We look forward to the country report to the Committee on the rights 
<br/>of the child also presented in this august Parliament so that we are informed on the status of all these 
<br/>challenges and recommendations to addressing them accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on to the Department of Women, the write-up in the Government’s 
<br/>5-year and 20-year National Development Plan 2017 to 2036, paints a very good picture of women 
<br/>in development.  In that, it said the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>women will be empowered with opportunities for leadership and decision-making across 
<br/>all sectors; 
<br/></span><span>gender inequality and discrimination will be eliminated; and 
<br/></span><span>women will be included and consulted in all planning for future development projects and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1611 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their input will result in tangible project outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  also  said  that  response  to  gender-based  violence  continues  to  be  the  strong  focus  of 
<br/>government policy and programmes, but all that talk is to mislead the women who makes up almost 
<br/>half of Fiji’s population into believing that the Government really care about us women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reality is that the Department is allocated only $4.2 million in this Budget, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  So, how can all those targets in the National Development Plan (NDP) be achieved?  These are 
<br/>just empty words, empty promises.  Let us break down the Budget some more, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With a total budget of $4.2 million only about $1.4 million is for empowerment programmes 
<br/>and $1.1 million is for capital project that is, the Barefoot College which has been in the Budget for 
<br/>the last three years or so, $1.6 million for operational costs.  With that type of budgetary allocation, 
<br/>it reflects Government’s lack of commitment and a government that does not really understand the 
<br/>special place women hold in our communities because with adequate budgetary resources, we can 
<br/>have  stronger  programmes  soliciting  effective  responses  and  we  build  better  and  resilient 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  February  2020,  the  former  Minister  for  Women  gave  a  Ministerial  Statement  on  Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>National Action Plan to prevent violence against women and girls, and she highlighted that meeting 
<br/>and consultations had been undertaken but to-date we ask, what is the progress on this national action 
<br/>plan?  There  is  no  specific  allocation  for  the  implementation  of  this  plan  in  the  Budget.    The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister once stated that violence  against women and girls in Fiji is a national 
<br/>shame and, indeed, it is but if only he could put his money where his mouth is, then we would believe 
<br/>this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  budgetary  allocation  for  each  Ministry  and  Department  reflects  the  Government’s 
<br/>priority  so  for  a  very  insignificant  amount  of  $4.2  million,  what  does  that  tell  us  on  how  this 
<br/>Government places women in the development agenda?  Let us compare that, Sir, with the Military 
<br/>that  has  $94.1  million  in  this  Budget  with  an  increase  of  $8  million  and  yet,  the  Department  of 
<br/>Women’s budget is only $4.2 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Civil Service, we note that the budgetary allocation from 2013 was $50.7 million; 
<br/>2019, it was $51.4 million; then it went down in 2020 to $3.3 million and this one is sitting at $2.7 
<br/>million.  I recall in those Budgets where the budgetary allocation had gone up, it was something to 
<br/>do with a payment of doctors’ salaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Civil Service has only presented (if I remember 
<br/>correctly) one Annual Report and that was for 2014.  As the lead Ministry, it has not provided any 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation report on the Civil Service Reform agenda.  The removal of the Person to 
<br/>Post  (P2P) listing as an attachment to  the Budget  Estimates has raised a lot of questions  on each 
<br/>individual Ministry and Department’s staff ceiling and recruitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we acknowledge the resumption of the payment of allowances, especially with the 
<br/>rural allowances as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Economy in his Address.  However, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health staff have reached out and to say that their meal allowances 
<br/>have been ceased from 13</span><span>th</span><span> July this year and the rural allowances have also been left out for some 
<br/>and for overtime, only Band F which I believe are the nurses have been paid.  The rest, for example, 
<br/>Midwives, have not been paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, an issue that had been raised is that for those Sisters in hospital that do undertake the 
<br/>nurses work in addition to their work because the nurses are absent for some reason, like sickness or 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anything like that, they have not been paid any overtime allowance.  It has also been raised with me 
<br/>that the village health workers, their last payment was in March 2022.  But if the Government really 
<br/>cares  and  really  values  our  civil  servants,  then  I  would  urge  the  Government,  particularly  if  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health could consider relooking at the payment of those allowances.  Not 
<br/>only to the honourable Minister for Health but also to the honourable Minister for Education, those 
<br/>are the issues that our medical staff, particularly nurses and teachers have brought along to our side 
<br/>and have asked that we raise it in this Chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are other options that the Government could consider and if they really 
<br/>value and care about our civil servants, they could consider removing the contractual employment 
<br/>arrangements.  They could also consider flexible retirement age with voluntary retirement at 55 years 
<br/>and compulsory retirement at 60 years.  And I note the recent retirees from Parliament itself, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, they were really in good health and very young to retire.  This could also be a sustainable 
<br/>manner of managing scarce skills retention and institutional knowledge which are vital in the success 
<br/>of any reform agenda.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, this Budget, just like previous ones, come covered 
<br/>in a blanket of deception and fancy words and big figures, only to hoodwink and make the people 
<br/>feel good.  Their words and figures do not translate into action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation is their biggest problem and the biggest performance indicator of this Budget 
<br/>and  previous  budgets  is  the  high  level  of  poor  public  service  delivery,  increasing  poverty  and 
<br/>associated social problems which we can all see around us.  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/>urge all Fijians to open their spiritual eyes and open their spiritual ears and exercise wisdom and 
<br/>discernment and vote wisely in this upcoming Elections and vote this Government out.  Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The honourable Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery and those watching these 
<br/>proceedings from the comfort of their homes and offices – a very good day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the 2022-2023 National Budget delivered by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General and Minister for Economy on Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2022-2023 National Budget is an innovative and forward-looking Budget that is going to 
<br/>pave the way for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to re-establish itself and re-focus on the 
<br/>challenges  ahead  with  the  vision  to  consolidate  and  expand  its  service  with  appropriate  reach  and 
<br/>coverage.  Most importantly, it will enable the Ministry to assist and facilitate the nation’s objectives of 
<br/>building back stronger and better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The allocation of $395.1 million for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services’ budget provides 
<br/>the needed space that the Ministry requires to recuperate fully from the impact of the global COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic  which  has  not  spared  any  sector  in  this  nation,  and  set  in  motion  a  series  of  actions  and 
<br/>initiatives that will shape the future of health services in Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1613 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our experience from the last 28 months of the pandemic has clearly shown us 
<br/>the potential in the private health sector and the role it can play, working hand in hand with the public 
<br/>sector to deliver quality health service to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government’s  innovation  of  engaging  private  General  Practitioners  (GPs)  has  greatly 
<br/>increased the accessibility of health services to the ordinary Fijians and has allowed for people to be able 
<br/>to get free health consultation at their local participating GP, instead of having to travel great distances 
<br/>and expand a considerable amount of their time and money to access the health service they need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the success of this new approach, the Government has now increased the allocation under 
<br/>this budget to be able to engage more GPs in this scheme.  In addition, Government has also extended 
<br/>this engagement to include private Dental Practitioners, who will also be able to attend to members of the 
<br/>public, for which Government will foot the consultation bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this Government support, members of the public will be able to access six additional new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>free services selected by Government under the scheme, and those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Multi-urine dip stick to test for various chronic diseases; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electro Cardiogram (ECG) for those with chest pains; 
<br/>Nebulizer treatment of asthma; 
<br/>Oxygen treatment for those requiring oxygen; 
<br/>An ultrasound scan investigation for those needing this non-invasive test; and 
<br/>Blood sugar level pin prick test which are some of the most sought-after services in our 
<br/>hospitals and health centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Renal (kidney) and liver functional tests including full blood count tests will also be available through 
<br/>this Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the six common tests that people generally come to health facilities 
<br/>for, hence the greater availability of these tests means the timely availability of test results for better 
<br/>management of their health complaints and the reduction in time spent at the health facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government’s  allocations  towards  the  GP  Scheme  and  the  Dental  Practitioners  Scheme  will 
<br/>surely ease the burden on public medical facilities and most importantly, it means that our people do not 
<br/>have to wait in long lines at hospitals and health centres to access health services in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The scheme can only be described as a win-win arrangement for both patients and participating 
<br/></span><span>GPs and Dental Practitioners, as it also provides an excellent opportunity for the GPs and private Dental 
<br/>Practitioners to grow their patient base as they contribute towards the provision of necessary healthcare 
<br/>for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this new Budget, GPs and private Dental Practitioners will be able to prescribe 
<br/>and dispense 24 hours’ worth of medicines for their patients.  This will assist patients seen after normal 
<br/>working hours when pharmacies are closed and the medicines are needed to provide immediate relief for 
<br/>their illnesses. This arrangement will help people to get the treatment they need immediately within the 
<br/></span><span>24 hours and later get the rest of their medication when pharmacies open in the next day.  The penalties 
<br/></span><span>in place will be a deterrent for those who intentionally wish to exploit this provision beyond its intended 
<br/>scope.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to Government’s efforts to improve and expand its services, Government will continue 
<br/></span><span>to engage the approved seven private medical laboratories for laboratory analysis and blood samples 
<br/></span><span>referred by GPs engaged under the free General Practitioners Scheme.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Governments initiative to support GPs in setting up their clinics in rural areas, 
<br/>such  as  Nawaicoba,  Malolo,  Naidovi,  Drasa,  Sabeto,  Seaqaqa,  Dreketi,  Nasarawaqa,  Korolevu  and 
<br/>Pacific Harbour is a commendable one.  With the allocation of $200,000, GPs would be in a good position 
<br/>to  establish  themselves  in  these  rural  locations  and  deliver  much  needed  health  service  to  these 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initiative augurs well with the FijiFirst Governments dream of decentralizing and expanding 
<br/>its health services even to the rural remote corners of this country, so that no one is left behind in accessing 
<br/>essential healthcare.  We can only encourage GPs to take up this offer and assist in extending the scope 
<br/>of their specialist care into rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this era of sophisticated medical technological advancement, outsourcing of 
<br/>medical testing is a way  of ensuring better access to sophisticated technical investigation in a timely 
<br/>manner.  Outsourcing of testing modalities during emergencies such as X-Ray, MRI Scan, CT Scan tests 
<br/>and ultrasound scanning helps to build capacity in private health facilities, thereby building resilience into 
<br/>the testing capacity of the health system, in addition to sharing the load that the public health facilities 
<br/>face each day.   Overall, this initiative reduces the cost to the general public and improves the equipment 
<br/>performance and longevity and most importantly exponential increase service levels to the members of 
<br/></span><span>the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally, it has been shown that with outsourcing of health service can provide important benefits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to payers and consumers, and they include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving health results through the new programme offerings; 
<br/>Reduced medical costs brought about by reduced operational costs; 
<br/>Cost savings are re-invested to finance new products and services; 
<br/>Increasing customer base through consistent outreach services; 
<br/>Improving customer/consumer satisfaction; 
<br/>Positioning for growth or expansion activities aimed at improving services; and 
<br/>Overcoming barriers like time zones with a workforce that provides 24/7 service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  selection  of  the  participating  private  health  providers  will  be  determined  through  a  clear  and 
<br/>transparent process, including Standard Operating Procedures (SPOs). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is also committed to continue to deliver specialist healthcare 
<br/>for those who need them in the new financial year.  A total of $2.25 million has been allocated to the 
<br/>Ministry  and  distributed  to  the  three  main  referral  hospitals  -  CWM  Hospital,  Lautoka  Hospital  and 
<br/>Labasa Hospital, for the emergency evacuation of patients to those Hospitals.  This means that any patient 
<br/>from anywhere in Fiji can be evacuated to one of the three hospitals, if they need urgent high level medical 
<br/>care for their conditions.  This allocation ensures the equitable, availability of high level healthcare to all 
<br/>Fijians, irrespective of their social or geographical locations in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is allocating $1.5 million to subsidise kidney dialysis treatment, providing a subsidy 
<br/>of $150 per dialysis session for patients whose total household income is less than $30,000 per year.  
<br/>These sessions can be taken at the Dialysis Unit nearest to them and patients will be required to cater for 
<br/></span><span>the cost above the subsidy amount.  Since its inception, this scheme has proven to be very successful with 
<br/></span><span>those who could not afford treatment in the past, now able to access the treatment that they need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the high level specialist care provided in our health facilities, patients can also access 
<br/>specialist healthcare that we cannot offer in Fiji through the Ministry’s Overseas Treatment Scheme.  
<br/>Government  has  allocated  $1.5  million  that  will  ensure  that  definitive  treatment  for  those  who  need 
<br/>overseas treatment will be made more accessible now more than ever.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three major capital projects earmarked for the Ministry for the new financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year with the total of $5.2 million includes, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>refurbishment of the Savusavu Hospital; 
<br/>interior upgrade works for Labasa Hospital; and 
<br/>commencement  of  construction  of  the  new  Maternity  Hospital  at  the  Colonial  War 
<br/>Memorial (CWM) Hospital in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work on these projects have been hindered by the pandemic as these hospitals were also 
<br/>required for the COVID-19 Response.  The refurbishment work once completed, will help not to only 
<br/>provide a fresh look to these facilities, but also build resilience into this critical health infrastructure in 
<br/>times of disasters and health emergency responses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, human resources remains at the core of health services anywhere and Fiji is no 
<br/>different.  In Fiji, nurses represent the majority of healthcare workers by far in the Ministry.  However, 
<br/>the turnover of nurses continue to challenge the Ministry and we cannot deny the high demand that exists 
<br/>for  our  well-trained  and  highly  competent  nurses  from  overseas  countries,  such  as  Australia,  New 
<br/>Zealand, United Kingdom and United Arab Emirates.  We are continuing to train young and upcoming 
<br/>nurses at our nurses training institutions to meet these needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, our three nursing institutions have a total of 235 student nurses, who are expected to 
<br/>join the nursing profession by the end of this year.  Once engaged, this will bring the total number of 
<br/>nurses we employ in the Ministry to 3,267 giving us a ratio of one nurse for every 271 (1:271) Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addressing this need, the Ministry is working with the Fiji Nursing Council 
<br/>to identify the additional specialised areas of nursing to allow specialisation for nurses with the required 
<br/>skills and competencies who will be recognised and remunerated accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  allocation  of  overtime  allowance  and  rural  maritime  allowance  is  an  appropriate 
<br/>acknowledgement of the nurses’ dedication and passion and will also provide and added incentive for the 
<br/>nurses to continue to deliver quality health service to our people.  Government’s move in providing for a 
<br/>transport allowance for public healthcare nurses in the rural areas is highly commendable, considering 
<br/>the difficulties that they often face to reach out to Fijians in the rural and remote corners of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  scarcity  of  trained  and  qualified  midwives  remain  a  challenge  for  the  Ministry  and  the 
<br/>provision of more training opportunities and appropriate remunerations will help in addressing the need 
<br/>we have in this area of expertise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have stated earlier and wish to reiterate that the new Budget is an innovative 
<br/>one for the Ministry.  The Government is taking great steps in engaging the private health sector into the 
<br/>health services for all Fijians.  The new Budget has also provided allocations for the engagement of Non-
<br/>Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in providing services that support and complement the service that 
<br/>the Ministry is delivering to its people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that cooperation and collaboration is the key for any 
<br/></span><span>successful service or programme and health service provision is no exception.  We need to work together 
<br/></span><span>to build a Fiji back better and stronger; and I encourage all health stakeholders to take advantage of the 
<br/>opportunities that the Government is providing in the proposed new Budget 2022-2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, I fully support the proposed Budget before the House.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  </span><span>Ni  sa  bula  vinaka</span><span>,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bula vinaka</span><span> to everyone listening or watching from the comforts of your home - urban, rural and 
<br/>maritime islands in the group of Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau, Rotuma, Fiji and overseas.  I would like to 
<br/>acknowledge our </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> from Kadavu, Mr. Sailasa Mateya, who is sitting here with us who has 
<br/>helped in many of the things that happened in Kadavu especially the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> of Tavuki and also the nine 
<br/></span><span>tikina</span><span> of Kadavu. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Mateya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to  debate  on  the  motion  before  this  august 
<br/>Parliament.  I wish to start with an Old Testament verse because of some aversion which brought horrific 
<br/>memories  of  our  past  which  may  be  acceptable  to  some  hundreds  of  thousands  and  unacceptable  to 
<br/>hundreds of thousands.  I hope Exodus 20: 2–17 brings comfort and forgiveness to Fiji and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“2 </span><span>I am the Lord thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house 
<br/>of bondage. 
<br/></span><span>3 </span><span>Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
<br/></span><span>4 </span><span>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in 
<br/></span><span>heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 
<br/></span><span>5 </span><span>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a 
<br/>jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth 
<br/>generation of them that hate me; 
<br/></span><span>6 </span><span>And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments. 
<br/></span><span>7 </span><span>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him 
<br/>guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
<br/></span><span>8 </span><span>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
<br/></span><span>9 </span><span>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
<br/></span><span>10 </span><span>But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, 
<br/>thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor 
<br/>thy stranger that is within thy gates: 
<br/></span><span>11 </span><span>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested 
<br/>the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it. 
<br/></span><span>12  </span><span>Honour  thy  father  and  thy  mother:  that  thy  days  may  be  long  upon  the  land  which 
<br/>the Lord thy God giveth thee. 
<br/></span><span>13 </span><span>Thou shalt not kill. 
<br/></span><span>14 </span><span>Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
<br/></span><span>15 </span><span>Thou shalt not steal. 
<br/></span><span>16 </span><span>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
<br/></span><span>17 </span><span>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor 
<br/>his  manservant,  nor  his  maidservant,  nor  his  ox,  nor  his  ass,  nor  any  thing  that  is  thy 
<br/>neighbour.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and his 
<br/>team from the Ministry of Economy for the Budget Address on Friday evening on the 15th July, 2022 - 
<br/>his sixth since my being sworn into Parliament on 26th November, 2018.  Sir, I will take Fiji through His 
<br/>Excellency’s speech at the Opening of Parliament last year and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As we open this session of Parliament, each of you must answer the questions: are you 
<br/>a partisan or are you stateswoman or statesman? Are you here to better the lives of all people, 
<br/>or are you here because you see politics as a means to a pay check or a way to gain power. 
<br/>Words can’t tell us the answer to those challenges –– only your actions can show us.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1617 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, political life in a nascent democracy likes ours should not be seen 
<br/>as career, it must be a calling; one suited only to those who aim to serve the nation with dignity, 
<br/>decorum,  poise  and  a  consistent  national  focus.  The  people  look  to  you  for  that,  and  they 
<br/>depend on your foresight to understand what we can achieve together.  Do not fail them.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was the message from His Excellency the President for you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go into the nitty gritty of this 2022-2023 Budget Estimate, I wish to 
<br/>reflect my observations and the little experience gained from the past four Budget Addresses, plus the 
<br/>two Revised Budget Addresses by the honourable Sayed-Khaiyum.  I will go back to the first term and 
<br/>session of Parliament Budget Estimate after the Military regime from 2014, which had estimate revenue 
<br/>of Two Billion Seven Hundred and Twenty One Thousand and Eight Hundred Million, which with the 
<br/>actual revenue that was collected was $2370.8 billion with a variance of $351million, uncollected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the revenue estimate was about $3,122.4 billion. The actual revenue collected was $2.9 
<br/>billion with a variance of $214 million uncollected revenue.  In 2016, the revenue estimate was about 
<br/>$1.2 billion, the actual revenue collected was only $2.9 million with a variance of $200.4 million.  In 
<br/>2017, the revenue estimate was $3.175 billion but the actual revenue collected was $2.8 billion, a variance 
<br/></span><span>of $307.9 million.   In 2017-2018, the revenue estimate was $3.8 billion with the actual collected was 
<br/></span><span>$3.244 billion, with a variance of $162 billion uncollected.   In 2018-2019, the revenue estimate was 
<br/>$4.236  billion  and  actual  revenue  collected  was  $3.18  billion,  a  variance  of  $1.55  billion  that  was 
<br/>uncollected.  In 2019 -2020, the revenue estimate was $3.4 billion and the actual collected was $2.1 billion 
<br/>with a variance of $775 million.  In 2020-2021, the revenue estimate was $2.1 million and actual collected 
<br/>was $2.4 million, and the variance was minus - we overspent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We collected more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Yes.  The variance on expenditure in 2014 was $106.2 million; in 2015 
<br/>was $44.1 million; in 2016, the variance was $122.3 million; in 2016-2017, the variance was $583.1 
<br/>million; in 2017-2018, the variance was $614.6 million; in 2018-2019, the variance was $1.05 billion; in 
<br/>2020-2021, the variance was $487 million (unutilised); in 2020-2022, the variance was $26.4 million, 
<br/>which totals to about $3.87 billion unutilised.  This is since 2014.  There is no savings in Government 
<br/>budgeting,  they  did  not  spend  and  they  did  not  collect.    To  reflect  -  these  figures  were  given  by 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am saying, I can go on with the figures collected revenues, expenditures.  I can talk about 
<br/>debt as a percentage of GDP.  I can talk about GDP at market prices, net deficit as a percentage to GDP 
<br/>estimates and actual. Total government exposure, debt plus contingency liabilities from 2014-2015 we 
<br/>can talk about that whole day, government debt portfolio and total contingency liabilities from 2017-
<br/>2022; the real GDP versus nominal GDP, our natural resource based sector contribution to GDP, our 
<br/>agricultural sector GDP growth, trends and total agriculture versus sugar and non-sugar GDP growth rate, 
<br/>forestry  and  logging  GDP  growth,  trends  and  fishing  and  aquaculture  GDP  growth,  trends  and 
<br/>manufacturing  GDP.      Education  versus  health  and  social  work  activities,  GDP  growth  rate.    Sugar 
<br/>crushed and sugar produced versus TCT ratios, tourist arrivals to Fiji since 2005-2022.  The question is 
<br/>are we going to reach the 500,000 visitors mark as announced in the Budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Highly likely, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you compare the arrivals in Bali, Mauritius and Maldives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the year 2022.  There is too much grandstanding speeches on this bullish budget all… 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- … by the Government side trying so smartly to convince the citizens of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, they cannot be fooled any longer, 16 years is too long FijiFirst, </span><span>cegu mada</span><span>!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government evidence since 2014 confirms our revenue has always been overstated and we 
<br/>have always been under expenditure.  There is always a shortfall in revenue, there is always an increase 
<br/>in deficit and increase in our debt level making it none other than an election budget.  More funds are 
<br/>allocated for freebies in the guise of inflationary mitigation measures which will lead to increase in debt 
<br/>with  an  over  ambitious  commitment  without  the  capacity  for  implementation.  All  must  know  that 
<br/>receiving monies for six months makes one wonder whether they should vote for these people because 
<br/>of financial benefits encountered. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span> FijiFirst Government - </span><span>vesu mona</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2022-2023 Key Budget Allocations - FRA increased by $38.5 million; WAF 
<br/>increased by $9.1 million; LTA increased by $1.8 million; EFL increased by $3.5 million; RFMF an 
<br/>increase  by  $8.0  million,  Police  has  a  decrease  where  it  was  supposed  to  be  increased,  Health  was 
<br/>supposed  to  increase  but  it  decreased  by  $11.5  million;  Education  increased  by  $42  million  and 
<br/>scholarships is about $162.6 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.-  Mr. Speaker Sir,  I will take  us back to the 2018-2019  Budget  where 
<br/>millions of taxpayers’ dollars was spent on most of the famous farm care and home care giveaway and 
<br/>not limited to other Ministries before the 2018 November Elections where every Opposition Political 
<br/>Party struggled to maintain free and fair levels of service to the public, and to their individual loyalist 
<br/>supporters Fiji-wide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- So, what are you suggesting? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You listen,  you already stood down but we could learn from yours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir, these kinds of things that they do, we should engage FICAC as we are seeing 
<br/>similar and familiar deceptive political mileage in the guise of government business in 2018 now coming 
<br/>back alive before us and after the Writ of Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I am proud that Fijian citizens have continued to declare their right to vote since 
<br/>2014 where 93,922 did not vote likewise the 168,221 for 2018 (I got these figures from the Elections 
<br/>Office) that did not vote for so many unknown reasons, but the public still disputes the 50.02 percent win 
<br/>of the FijiFirst Party to govern for the second time after a period of 12 years and now completed 16 years 
<br/>of failed deceptive leadership and non-bipartisan Government mismanagement.  Are they going to regain 
<br/>their 50.02 percent win four years later?  I do not think so - Fiji is ready for a change.  We need our Fiji 
<br/>to regain its greatness once again. Change for the better is paramount. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget estimate for 2022-2023 should have been the highest, biggest or 
<br/>unprecedented ever, superseding the 2018-2019 Election freebies budget.  Nonetheless, we accept 
<br/>the effects of COVID-19 pandemic since 2</span><span>nd</span><span> March, 2020 until 11</span><span>th</span><span> November when we were free 
<br/>to move around Fiji and the opening of borders in December 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I understand that you have been repeatedly reminded of the 2023 Elections and 
<br/>I am the 34th speaker since yesterday.  But for the nine </span><span>tikina,</span><span> 75 villages and 23 settlements voters 
<br/>in Kadavu, the question is, what is in the Budget Estimates that resonates to them in their everyday 
<br/>lives and same goes for the other 13 </span><span>yasana</span><span> Fiji-wide inclusive of all indigenous people or </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>? 
<br/>They are landowners of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, their unique culture, customs, traditions and language.  The 
<br/>indigenous people or Rotumans from the island of Rotuma, the ownership of Rotuman lands, their

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unique  culture,  customs,  traditions  and  language.    The  descendants  of  indentured  labourers  from 
<br/>British  India  and  the  Pacific  Islanders,  their  culture,  customs,  traditions,  language  and  the 
<br/>descendants of settlers and immigrants to Fiji and their culture, customs, traditions and language, all 
<br/>ethnicities, political parties, religious denominations, employees and employers, keyboard warriors, 
<br/>poverty-stricken areas,  wheelbarrow boys, shoeshine boys, golden oldies – rugby, soccer, athletics, 
<br/>basketball, retirees - the beggars and this is by all means necessary that all Budget Estimates, the 
<br/>revised ones has to be debated transparently in detail inclusive of the 11 Consequential Bills under 
<br/>Standing Order 51 to pass its amendment before the end of this week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Evidently  and  hopefully  everyone  in  Fiji  should  understand  the  secrecy  and  the  kind  of 
<br/>conditions that apply or comes with the changes and amendments.  I try to resonate every budget 
<br/>address when the Consequential Bills are tabled under Standing Order 51.  Laws are being amended 
<br/>without realising it.  If 20 Consequential Bills were amended and passed during the last six Budget 
<br/>Addresses, you got to be thinking twice.  I thank our party leader, honourable Gavoka for standing 
<br/>up every time for his right to debate according to law when anyone or everyone feels that there has 
<br/>been an abuse of process, the innocent people who voted us in here, God forbid! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget comes on the eve of one of the most 
<br/>critical general elections to the indigenous Fijians.  While we look forward to the budget policies and 
<br/>compliments,  this  Budget  comes  nowhere  near  what  it  aspires  to.    Again,  the  Government  has 
<br/>vouched for another expansionary fiscal policy on the Budget by pushing another 7.4 percent net 
<br/>deficit of GDP, adding further to the already soaring national debt that is believed to be over 100 
<br/>percent of GDP.  This is expected to expand the size of our economy into $11.7 billion by nominal 
<br/>terms largely driven by expenditures.  This is very much contradicting all rules of economic theories 
<br/>and despite IMF annual recommendations, our economy cannot continue this way.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy continues to portray his arrogance and deliberate way of making this country 
<br/>more of an impoverished State.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA notes the insincere and overconfident revenue projection … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Listen so you can learn! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- … noting the recession period faced by our economy contrary to the 
<br/>statement made by the honourable Minister for Economy. We cannot afford this behaviour unless we 
<br/>see  sustained  commitments  to  capital  formation  of  our  infrastructure  to  attract  investors  who  are 
<br/>boosting our agriculture sector to generate jobs, more income and encourage food security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increasing influence of VAT on our revenue collection confirms the notion of indirect 
<br/>taxes on our total revenue collection.  It also begs the question of prices on the commodities most 
<br/>regularly accessed by our people.  Direct taxes and other forms of revenue continue to decline and 
<br/>tax policies continue to dishearten investors to come to our shores or domestic one’s going elsewhere 
<br/>to do the same.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The total projected revenue to be collected is almost $3 billion.  Judging from the revenue 
<br/>collections over the last five years, it just hovers near $2 billion. This will surely push more debt 
<br/>higher from increasing net deficit levels of GDP.  While the indirect taxes are heavily impacting our 
<br/>vulnerable groups on the rising cost of goods, we should also ensure that the elites are also paying 
<br/>taxes, not rebates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019, the stamp duty was removed together with the $60 million annual revenue mostly 
<br/>paid  by  businesses.    Why  was  this  tax  removed?    It  was  removed  to  favour  businesses  who  are 
<br/>sponsoring the FijiFirst Party.  It also removed the staff who worked under this Unit at Fiji Revenue 
<br/>Customs Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  the  ineffectiveness  or  monitoring  of  ECAL.    Visitation  to  the  remote  and  rural  areas 
<br/>where logging has been practised, we note the enormous impact of these projects adversely affecting 
<br/>the environment.  Our streams and rivers are continually affected by these operations, including river 
<br/>gravel extractions that are done without licence.  This is so as operators continually fund customary 
<br/>owners without the knowledge of the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- It seems like Government initiatives nowadays are targeting a few.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent sea cucumber (</span><span>bech-de-mer</span><span>) trade was opened but very few people knew that it 
<br/>was allowed with temporary conditions.  Its strictness has not fully reaped its benefits as the two 
<br/>main species are not tradeable.  Not everyone knew about its ceased or be traded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Activities  that  negatively  affect  our  environment  must  be  fully  dealt  with  and  seen  to  be 
<br/>complying  with  our  commitments  to  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  Biological  Diversity 
<br/>(UNCBD). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Fisheries for his statement 
<br/>yesterday.    I  thank  that  his  budget  has  increased  to  $16  million,  given  that  when  I  came  into 
<br/>Parliament it was about $21 million.  But it decreased and now this is the first time it has increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Your time is up.

<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Yes, I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to thank all those families who remitted funds from overseas - $548 million 
<br/>in 2016, $542 million in 2017, $577 million in 2018, $600 million in 2019, $774 million in 2020 and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, will all that was said from your loyal Opposition, this is part of our contribution 
<br/>to the Budget Address debate before you, it is our sincere trust that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and the honourable Minister for Economy will accept that our contribution from these past two days 
<br/>is the alternative budget in a bipartisan manner.  Like the rest of us from your loyal Opposition, we 
<br/>reserve  our  support  for  this  Budget  until  they  are  implemented  from  where  we  see  fit.  </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, and happy belated birthday.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 1.50 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I  rise to contribute to the debate on the Appropriation 
<br/>Bill 2022. Before I make my contribution to the Bill, I wish to congratulate the </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the chiefs 
<br/>in the Ba Province for coming together in solidarity during Council Meeting and the </span><span>Siga kei Ba</span><span> that 
<br/>was held on the 20</span><span>th</span><span> to 22</span><span>nd</span><span> July, 2022.  I thank the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Koronubu, Sue Levu i Ba, Momo na 
<br/>Tui Ba for hosting the events and a special thanks to the Soqosoqo Vakaramama ni Yasana o Ba for 
<br/>opening the </span><span>Siga kei Ba</span><span> fundraising.  </span><span>Vina du riki vakalevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  this  Government  is  showing  symptoms  of  pseudologia  fantastica.  I  had  a  lot  of 
<br/>expectation from the honourable Minister for Economy and this Government to provide the necessary 
<br/>remedy  to  our  ailing  national  economy  but  that  was  not  to  be  as  for  them  they  have  become  so 
<br/>obsessed with power and winning the election by whatever means is utmost important.  For more 
<br/>than 16 years in power, it was a pity, poor show and shame to sit here for more than three hours out 
<br/>of which the honourable Minister for Economy took a quarter of that time demonising and blaming 
<br/>the past governments, their  leadership, policies and programmes for our current economic crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A person having symptoms of pseudologia fantastica is very combative, arrogant, grandiose, 
<br/></span><span>condescending and definitely narcissistic.  It was always about them. Everyone else is beneath them, 
<br/></span><span>wrong, stupid and at fault. They are perfect in their own eyes.  You can say to such a person, let us 
<br/>agree  to  disagree  but  they  will  start  fighting  again  and  then  the  name  calling,  does  that  sounds 
<br/>familiar?  This is what has been happening in this Parliament. These people are outright belligerent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At least, the honourable Attorney-General needs to be reminded of few things which are as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The military </span><span>coup</span><span> of 2006 qualified them to be where they are today; 
<br/>They cannot hide their sins and omissions, now having been in power for over a decade; 
<br/>Their time to deploy politics of diversion and excel in politics of convenience is over;  
<br/>The people of Fiji can see the true colours of this Government through its transparent rules; 
<br/>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>No matter the grandstanding for the benefit of television cameras in public, you cannot fool 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all the people all the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Who is doing that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Tell her, tell her! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- You have been weighed, you have been measured and you have been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>found wanting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is an insult to the intelligence of the people of Fiji and an act of 
<br/>betrayal by this Government upon its own voters.  This Budget makes a mockery of the new albeit 
<br/>truncated mandate secured by this Government and is paving the way forward to an unprecedented 
<br/>socio-economic and geo-political disaster in the making which will render this nation and its people 
<br/>bankrupt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy was very selective to talk about the 
<br/>National Bank of Fiji (NBF) crisis which past leadership properly mitigated by first owning up on 
<br/>the  failures  and  mitigating  by  recovery  which  provided  the  then  budding  politicians  and  now 
<br/>trumpeters of this dictatorship their employment in Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1623 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister should have also talked about how and why did Fiji 
<br/>lose on the €350 million from the European Union for the Alternative Livelihood Programme and 
<br/>another close to $200 million from New Zealand to resettle our squatter dwellers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people who live in glasshouse should not throw stones.  Never, ever give 
<br/>the FijiFirst leadership take any ownership of the downfall to the Sugar Industry.  The carnage of 
<br/>democracy in 2006 left the glasshouse muddy and messy after its attempted clean up, following that 
<br/>a white wash or a hogwash are other relevant terminologies that one can use to hang this Budget up 
<br/>for public probity and skin the cat to the bone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to make a few comments, please, and suggestions on the 2022 – 
<br/>2023 Budget Address as presented by the honourable Attorney-General. He said and I quote, “This 
<br/>Budget creates the certainty that our businesses need to plan, invest and hire and as prices for food, 
<br/>fuel,  freight  and  fertiliser  remain  extremely  unpredictable,  this  Budget  provides  a  relief  for  the 
<br/>families who need it most.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was expecting the initiatives announced to aid those most vulnerable in 
<br/>Fiji would be extended to one year rather than to six months only.  Little did I know that the lollies 
<br/></span><span>were prepared only to be consumed before the end of the Elections period.  The allowances that he 
<br/></span><span>promised are temporary and will disappear after six months or even earlier.  After that, the recipients 
<br/>will return to where they were while prices will continue to rise.  For sure poverty, will again increase 
<br/>and our people will continue to struggle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  my  Revised  Budget  response  on  25</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2022,  I  pointed  out,  and  I  quote;  “the 
<br/>SODELPA Government would have taken back our port of entries operation in order for Government 
<br/>to absorb any fluctuations in freight charges at our ports”.  In his reply, the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General responded and I quote, “Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Saukuru said that the State should pay 
<br/>for all the freight costs.  What is he saying? So when Vinod Patel is going to now import hardware 
<br/>to sell in their shop, we should pay Vinod Patel’s freight.  That is what he is saying and they talk 
<br/>about giving money to private businesses so when Meghji wants to bring in his liquor for the freight 
<br/>cost, we should pay.  What an absolutely silly proposition!  The Government does not buy those 
<br/>things, the Government does not go and buy wheat, the private companies that buy it”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought the honourable Attorney-General would be smart enough to read 
<br/>between  the  lines  and  understand  that  I  was  asking  Government  to  provide  freight  subsidy  on 
<br/>essential goods and on basic food items in order to control price.  Now, that would have been a better 
<br/>long-term solution for the most vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On unproductive foreign reserves, as at the end of June, 2022 our foreign reserves was at $3.6 
<br/>billion equivalent to 8.4 months of retained imports.  I call this unproductive because we never earn 
<br/>this foreign reserve to boast about it.  Most of these are related to borrowing and remittances, while 
<br/>our export remains very low that it is something to be ashamed of with an increasing trade deficit.  
<br/>Anyway,  I wish to offer suggestion to the honourable Attorney-General to encourage our foreign 
<br/>reserves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On incentivising remittances, in talking about remittances, I take this time to thank our people 
<br/>who  are  living  overseas  for  their  financial  support  to  their  relatives  here  in  Fiji.    Thank  you  for 
<br/>supporting our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  skilful  invention  by  a  master,  politician,  and  a  manipulator  of  symbolic  meanings,  the 
<br/>Balikbayan  Programme  was  started  by  then  the  President  Ferdinand  Marcos  to  attract  Filipino-
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>American tourists back to the Philippines. It has since become the most important source of foreign 
<br/>exchange, skills and income for the Philippines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Balikbayans are generally allowed to buy and register land bought in the 
<br/>Philippines under their own name.  Under the same individuals are allowed to import used motor 
<br/>vehicles  that  have  a  gross  vehicle  weight  not  exceeding  3  tonnes  under  the  ‘No-Dollar  Import 
<br/>Programme’.  Then you have the Balikbayan boxes, the Filipino way of saying, “You cannot go home 
<br/>without a box.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to complement the Fijian Made Initiative, Government should explore this 
<br/>opportunity  with  the  Fijian  version  of  Balikbayan.    I  wonder  what  ‘victory’  was  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General referring to when he said, and I quote:  “We served the people by delivering historic 
<br/>economic victory after historic economic victory.”  Sir, the:

<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s economic freedom score is 56.4 percent, making our economy rank 23rd amongst 39 
<br/>countries in the Asia Pacific region and its overall score is below the regional and world 
<br/>averages. 
<br/>The people of Lautoka are still waiting for the completion of their $12.6 million swimming 
<br/>pool.

<div><span>institutions? 
<br/>Stop making splash about the increase in FNPF contributions which you reduced it yourself 
<br/>but reimbursed members that had withdrawn their FNPF money during the pandemic. 
<br/>You call it a ‘victory’ when the allocation to health services which is critical and a priority 
<br/>reduced by $12 million. 
<br/>The allocation to agriculture is increased by only $3 million compared to the increase in $8 
<br/>million  to  the  Military.  This  clearly  reflects  the  lack  of  support  of  this  Government  to 
<br/>resource-based sectors that we have been talking about. 
<br/></span><span>The $6 million increase in allocation to forestry and fisheries will never arrest the decline 
<br/></span><span>in this important growth sectors.  
<br/>The allocation to education has been raised by $42 million due to one-off allowances to 
<br/>school children that will cease after the Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are all pies in the sky.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  increasing  debt,  debt  stock  is  at  unsustainable  level.    It  is  the  same 
<br/>Commodore Bainimarama that illegally took over a legitimate Government that had a debt of only 
<br/>$2.5 billion that is now changing its tune saying that it is alright for our future generation to inherit a 
<br/></span><span>debt level that is already forecasted to be reaching $10 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with a debt of $9.9 billion our total exposure is 102.2 percent which include 
<br/>a Government debt of 85.2 percent and contingency liabilities of 17 percent. A strong fiscal outlook 
<br/>is an essential foundation for a growing, thriving economy. Putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal 
<br/>path  on  a  sustainable  fiscal  path  creates  a  positive  environment  for  growth,  opportunity  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity.  With a strong fiscal foundation, the nation will have increased access to capital, more 
<br/>resources for future public and private investments, improved consumer and business confidence and 
<br/>a stronger social protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, if we fail to act, the opposite is also true.  If our long-term fiscal challenges remain 
<br/>unaddressed, our economic environment weakens as confidence suffers, access to capital is reduced, 
<br/>interest costs crowd out key investments in our future, the conditions for growth deteriorate and our 
<br/>nation is put at a greater risk of economic crisis.  If our long-term fiscal imbalance is not addressed, 
<br/>our  future  economy  will  be  diminished  with  fewer  economic  opportunities  for  individuals  and 
<br/>families and less fiscal flexibility to respond to future crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rising debt threatens Fiji’s future in a number of critical ways, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reduced public investment:  As our national debt mounts, the Government will spend more 
<br/>of its budget  on  interest  costs, increasingly  crowding out public investments.   As more 
<br/>resources are diverted to interest payments, there will be less available to invest in areas 
<br/>that are important for economic growth.  Although interest rates have been low for more 
<br/>than a decade relative to historical averages, we can already see that other factors can drive 
<br/></span><span>those rates up.  As the interest rates rise, the Government’s borrowing cost will increase 
<br/></span><span>markedly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reduced private investment:  Government’s borrowing competes for funds in the nation’s 
<br/>capital markets, thereby raising interest rates and crowding out new investment in business 
<br/>equipment and structures. Entrepreneurs face a higher cost of capital, potentially stifling 
<br/>innovation  and slowing the  advancement of new  breakthroughs that  could  improve our 
<br/>lives.  At some point, investors might begin to doubt the Government’s ability to repay debt 
<br/>and  could  demand  even  higher  interest  rates,  further  raising  the  cost  of  borrowing  for 
<br/>businesses and households.  Over time, lower confidence and reduced investment would 
<br/>slow the growth of productivity and wages of our workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fewer economic opportunities for Fijians:  Growing debt also has a direct effect on the 
<br/>economic opportunities available to every Fijian.  If high levels of debt crowd out private 
<br/>investments in capital goods, workers would have less to use in their jobs, which would 
<br/>translate to lower productivity and, therefore, lower wages.  In addition, high levels of debt 
<br/>would affect many other aspects of the economy in the future.  For example, higher interest 
<br/>rates resulting from increased borrowing would make it harder for families to buy homes, 
<br/>finance  car  repayments  or  pay  for  college.    Fewer  education  and  training  opportunities 
<br/>stemming from lower investment would leave workers without skills to keep up with the 
<br/>demands  of  a  more  technology-based  global  economy.    Furthermore,  slower  economic 
<br/>growth generally would also make our fiscal challenges even worse as lower incomes lead 
<br/>to smaller tax collections and put our budget further out of balance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>A greater risk of a fiscal crisis:  If investors lose confidence in the nation’s fiscal position, 
<br/>interest rates on our borrowing could rise as higher yields would be demanded to purchase 
<br/>such securities.  A rapid increase in rates could also lead to higher rates of inflation which 
<br/>would  reduce  the  value  of  outstanding  Government’s  securities  and  result  in  losses  by 
<br/>holders  of  those  securities  which  could  further  destabilise  our  economy  and  erode 
<br/>confidence in our Fijian dollar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Challenges to national security:  Our fiscal security is also closely-linked to our national 
<br/>security and ability to maintain a leading role in the Pacific.  As the national debt grows, 
<br/>not only are we more beholden to creditors around the globe, but we have fewer resources 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to invest in building resilience and strength at home.   In the words of Admiral Mullen, 
<br/>former Chairman of the US Joint Chief of Staff, I quote:  “The most significant threat to 
<br/>our national security is our debt.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Endangering Social Protection:  Fiji’s high debt jeopardizes social protection and the 
<br/>most  vulnerable  in  our  society.  If  our  Government  does  not  have  the  resources  and 
<br/>stability of a sustainable budget, those essential programmes, and the individuals who 
<br/>need them most, are put in jeopardy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, there is a decrease of capital 
<br/>expenditure from $5.1 million to $4.6 million.  I wonder with concern what the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister has been telling the Provincial Council Meetings around Fiji in terms of rural developments.  
<br/>You only have to sit in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Council Meetings to witness firsthand the struggles of our people 
<br/>in  the  rural  areas  when  the  resolutions  of  these  meetings  are  never  resolved  while  out  of  their 
<br/>generosity are still able to host </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Meetings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our people in the rural and maritime areas do not need all that pie in the sky, 
<br/>shallow promises of state-of-the-art road or shipping services. They simply need good roads, free 
<br/></span><span>from potholes and shipping services which are safe, regular and affordable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Travel and communications is an important part of national development and human progress.  
<br/>It  is  rather  unfortunate  that  despite  exorbitant  sum  of  monies  poured  in  communications  and 
<br/>infrastructure, these basic services continue to be of poor quality and depleting standards each passing 
<br/>day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will end my response to the Appropriation Bill 2022-2023 with climate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>change.  In his own words, the honourable Attorney-General said, and I quote:                                                                 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Amidst  all of these, as I have mentioned,  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span> and the 13 cyclones that 
<br/>followed, the devastation we suffered required higher levels of borrowing to build back 
<br/>better.  It was an injustice that Fiji had to borrow to rebuild from climate-driven disasters 
<br/>that we did not cause, and that was a point we made relentlessly to the world’s financial 
<br/>institutions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I invite every Member of Parliament to listen to what God has to say about our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>situation through Amos 4: 6-12, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town, yet you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent 
<br/>rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and 
<br/>dried up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink, yet 
<br/>you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.  Many times I struck your gardens and 
<br/>vineyards, destroying them with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured your fig and olive 
<br/>trees, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I sent plagues among you as I did to Egypt. I killed your young men with the sword, 
<br/>along with your captured horses. I filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps, yet 
<br/>you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.

<div><span>I overthrew some of  you as I overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You were like a 
<br/>burning stick snatched from the fire, yet you have not returned to me,” declares the Lord.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore this is what  I will do to you, Israel, and because I will do this to  you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Israel, prepare to meet your God.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in all these natural calamities, God was speaking to Fiji and its leadership, 
<br/>through </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and the COVID-19 Pandemic.  We have actually met our Creator and it came at 
<br/>a cost.  My question is; are we prepared to lose more? Sir, it is never too late to humble ourselves 
<br/>before God? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2 Chronicles 7:14, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek 
<br/>my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive 
<br/>their sin and heal their land.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1 Corinthians 1: 18-19 says, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who 
<br/>are being saved, it is the power of God.  For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the 
<br/>wise, the intelligence of the intelligent, I will frustrate.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank all the religious organisations and prayer groups in Fiji and abroad 
<br/>that have been praying for our nation and our leadership.  May the Lord’s will prevail in our beloved 
<br/>nation.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for your indulgence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Wow! That is the quality of budget response we get. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise in support of the 
<br/>2022-2023 National Budget, as tabled and read by our honourable Minister for Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget is a very bold programme and is forward-looking.  The Budget has 
<br/>been tabled at a time when everyone was anxious as how it can be formulated, given our state of the 
<br/>economy following COVID-19 crisis here in Fiji but our honourable Minister for Economy has once 
<br/>again outsmarted everyone by delivering a masterpiece of expenditure mix.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite concerns from some quarters, the Ministry of Agriculture has also been 
<br/>given a rise in their budget to capitalise on two critical objectives of food security of households and 
<br/>expanding commercial agriculture and exports of fresh and chilled produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a strong and prosperous agriculture sector is essential to the wellbeing of Fiji’s 
<br/>economy.  The Ministry of Agriculture’s objectives remain a key part of the Fiji Government strategy to 
<br/>revitalise our nation, create jobs and build a more resilient Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agricultural sector maintains its critical role in boosting the contribution of 
<br/>agriculture to Fiji’s economic growth.  Fiji’s agriculture sector has been positively developing in the last 
<br/>decade, following which the value of non-sugarcane agriculture, GDP grew at an average growth of 6.6 
<br/>percent per annum.  This marked increase is from the FJ$343.6 million in 2010 to FJ$630.2 million in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019, achieving a massive growth of 83.4 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021 alone, crop production increased from 296,579 to 320,806 metric tonnes which is also an 
<br/>increase of 8.1 percent.  In addition, the volume of agriculture production also grew at an average growth 
<br/>rate of 6.6 percent.  Export earnings of fresh chilled agriculture produce, crop and livestock recorded 
<br/>FJ$121 million in 2021 compared to $106 million in 2022, showing a 13.7 percent growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our farmers, Mr.  Speaker, Sir, during the 2020 census period, the total number of the farming 
<br/>households recorded was 70,991, following which 11.9 percent of those were female-headed households.  
<br/>The total population of farming household members were 300,861, however, given that some households 
<br/>consisted of more than one farmer, the total number of farmers in Fiji was 83,395.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture’s budget has increased from $61 million to $64 
<br/>million for the next financial year.  Using the above budget, the Ministry will continue to push for food 
<br/>security and expansion of commercial agriculture, as well as push for continued export growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On reducing imports in the rice sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is mindful of our reliance 
<br/>on rice as one of the staple crops and our dependency on imports with an annual import bill hovering 
<br/></span><span>above $44 million.  On this note, the Ministry’s objective is to expand rice production locally to reduce 
<br/></span><span>our vulnerability, whilst at the same time, save our foreign currency reserves by importing less.  Work on 
<br/>this has begun a few years back and we are now noting an increase in rice production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Production of rice grew from 6,500 metric tonnes in 2019 to 10,300 metric tonnes in 2021, a 
<br/>growth rate of 58 percent over the last decade.  This is the first time that the sector has achieved over 
<br/>10,000 metric tonnes in production of local rice.  However, despite the increase in local production, Fiji’s 
<br/>self-sufficiency level on rice is still very low – 17.5 percent in 2021.  However, the Ministry is working 
<br/>closely with the farmers by introducing mechanisation and supporting the harvesting of rice, and we are 
<br/>noting a surge in new land brought under cultivation.  While data collection of this year’s production is 
<br/>currently ongoing, it is quite likely it has jumped over 20 percent self-sufficiency by July this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  last  financial  year,  we  provided  three  rice  harvesters  to  farmer  co-
<br/>operatives  and  this  year,  we  are  planning  to  provide  12  more  harvesters  under  the  Ministry’s  one-
<br/>third/two-thirds machinery grant scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on women in agriculture, in the Ministry of Agriculture’s 2022-2023 budget, 
<br/>Government continues to invest in women in agriculture initiatives worth $300,000 per year.  Again, the 
<br/>2020  Fiji  Agriculture  Census  recorded  a  total  of  11,971  females  who  are  engaged  in  either  crop  or 
<br/>livestock farming as their primary or secondary occupation.  The 2020 Fiji Agriculture Census records 
<br/>further indicated that 46.6 percent of women participated in, at least, one crop activity during the Census 
<br/>period  (12  months).    This  consequently  means  that  88,034  of  the  total  188,768  farming  household 
<br/>members are women, who participated in, at least, one crop activity during the Census period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  assisted  more  than  6,000  under  the  Women  in 
<br/>Agriculture  Programme  from  2006  to  last  year  (2021).    This  assistance  provided  included;  training, 
<br/>provision of planting materials, infrastructure and small farming equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  is  currently  working  towards  implementing  the 
<br/>Gender in Agriculture Policy in the agriculture subsectors, following which the intent of the Policy is to 
<br/>provide  access  to  agricultural  services  and  goods  to  women,  capacitate  women  in  order  to  reduce 
<br/>inequality in the agriculture sector,  equality of access to finance, insurance, modern inputs, equipment 
<br/>and tools, as well as set a platform that will allow for equal participation of women in decision-making.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  reaching  out  to  farmers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  reaching  out  to  the  least  developing  rural 
<br/>communities has been one of the Ministry’s critical roles.  Our Ministry staff recently visited the island 
<br/>of Koro in the Lomaiviti Group to handover small farming equipment, </span><span>dalo</span><span> suckers and improved pig 
<br/>breeding stock, as well as chicks and feed to farmers on the island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  improve  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture’s  service  delivery  in  the  rural  and  maritime  areas, 
<br/>outreach programme </span><span>talanoa</span><span> sessions were conducted all over Fiji scheduled at different venues, dates 
<br/>and time that fits rural village and community settings.  The Ministry of Agriculture wants to further 
<br/>accelerate the growth of the agricultural sector in Fiji.  The  Ministry  noted  good  participation  at  these 
<br/>venues and farmers greatly appreciated face to face meetings with them to discuss farming issues well, 
<br/>the various incentives for which they can apply for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture is extremely appreciative for the allocation of $64 
<br/>million  which  is  adequate  to  cover  both,  our  operational  and  capital  programmes.  Through  this,  the 
<br/>Ministry will further its delivery to provide effective and efficient support to farmers and stakeholders.  
<br/>The  budgetary  allocation  will be distributed accordingly  whereby  $19.2 million is allocated  for  crop 
<br/>extension  services  and  a  further  $6.8  million  for  agriculture  crop  research,  enabling  commodity 
<br/>development and improving provision of extension services to all farmers, including releasing of new 
<br/></span><span>resilient crop varieties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Animal Health and Livestock Division is allocated $13.2 million to support 
<br/>both  its  extension  and  research  services.  This  funding  will  facilitate  provision  of  fencing  materials, 
<br/>infrastructure support and stock development.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry’s Operational Funding includes wages and salaries of staff and funding grants to 
<br/>immediate stakeholders such as Agro-marketing Authority of Fiji, agriculture schools like Navuso and 
<br/>Tutu, Fiji Crop and Livestock Council and Committee for Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years, the Ministry of Agriculture is committed to improving food and 
<br/>nutritional security for all Fijians through programme that will deliver improved production and excess 
<br/>to safe and nutritious food.  Amidst the pandemic, the agricultural sector has stood tall amongst others to 
<br/>be the backbone of the economy, as well as being the stronghold of sustainable alternative livelihood for 
<br/>rural and urban households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On food security, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture remains focused on ensuring food 
<br/>and nutritional security for all Fijians whilst expanding agriculture to address our economic challenges.  
<br/>The growth trajectory has been a positive one in these trying times and we will continue to deliver the 
<br/>vision of ‘grow beyond’ to enable agriculture standing tall in support of the Government in meeting its 
<br/>objectives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ongoing  Home  Gardening  Initiative  has  provided  more  than  470,000 
<br/>individual seed packs to households in the four geographical divisions since the pandemic began in 2020.  
<br/>This activity was ramped up in April this year where in three months alone, we managed to achieve a 
<br/>distribution of 27,000 seed packs,  amounting to around 164,000 individual seed packs.  In this latest 
<br/>operation run by Ministry of Agriculture 61 percent of the distribution was for the Central Division - the 
<br/>region that was hit the hardest with the current pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The success of our Home Gardening Initiative improved urban and peri-urban home gardens.  As 
<br/>a result, positive progress has been identified with some households in the Central Division.  The Budget 
<br/>includes other programmes to further all crops and livestock. The Ministry is coordinating with other 
<br/>Government agencies to support a strategy that will provide a pathway to resilient food security.

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now wish to turn to the Ministry of Waterways which is also supporting and 
<br/>protecting farmers and vulnerable households in Fiji for the onslaught of climate change.  Waterways, 
<br/>Climate Change and Disaster Risk Reduction are matters of great national importance that the Ministry 
<br/>deals with.  The Ministry carries out most of the disaster risk reduction and mitigation activities through 
<br/>its capital project implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such for fiscal year 2022-2023, $14,314,800 million is allocated for the Ministry of Waterways 
<br/>to deliver these services.  Approximately 77 percent of the allocation or $11,010,000 million will be spent 
<br/>on numerous capital projects. The allocation is distributed as follows.  An allocation of $600,000 has 
<br/>been allocated for the maintenance of irrigation schemes with locations in the Central and   
<br/>Northern Divisions and $3 million has been allocated for Drainage and Flood Protection Programme.  
<br/>The activities undertaken by the programme consists of river dredging, river bank protection, brick 
<br/>improvement and river training works.  This allocation will be utilised for the roll-over of Nakaile 
<br/>River Bank Protection works in Tailevu, Bua river bank protection and Waidamu  River Dredging 
<br/>works in Tailevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address watershed problems and help us mitigate floods, the Watershed 
<br/>Management Programme has been allocated $1 million for the 2022-2023 Fiscal Year.  The total 
<br/></span><span>allocation will be utilised for the construction of Qalinabulu River Flood Retention Dam and roll 
<br/></span><span>over  of  Environmental  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  study.    Through  the  maintenance  of  drainage 
<br/>system  for  non-municipal  areas  programme,  $800,000  has  been  allocated  for  the  maintenance  of 
<br/>existing drains and schemes to the following Divisions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Western Division $320,000; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Central Division $320,000; and 
<br/>Northern Division $160,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coastal inundations and coastal erosions are an enormous undertaking of the 
<br/>Ministry.  To address such needs, $1.5 million has been allocated for the Coastal Erosion Protection 
<br/>Works Programme in the 2022-2023 Fiscal Year.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, the allocation will be utilised 
<br/>for the rollover of the Bau Island Coastal Protection and the Ovea Village Coastal Protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drainage for farmlands has a total allocation of $500,000.  The allocation 
<br/>for each of the divisions (Central, Western and Northern) is $166,666.  For the fiscal  year 2022–
<br/>2023, the drainage for rural residential areas programme has an allocation of $500,000 with the three 
<br/>Divisions being allocated $166,666 each. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  irrigation  spot  for  farm  development  is  a  programme  designed  to 
<br/>increase the resilience of farmers from drought through the provision of micro-irrigation supplements 
<br/>to  allow  them  to  better  manage  water  and  increase  their  resilience  to  drought.    Sir,  $110,000  is 
<br/>allocated for this programme in the 2022–2023 Financial Year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the total allocation, $72,500 will be utilised to purchase 30 full sets of irrigation kits to 
<br/>be distributed to the farmers selected by the Ministry of Agriculture.  These farmers will receive a 
<br/>full  irrigation  kit  that  will  consist  of  water  pumps,  drip  irrigation  hoses  and  other  fittings.  
<br/></span><span>Additionally,  $37,500  will  be  utilised  to  construct  multi-purpose  gravity  third  irrigation  water 
<br/></span><span>sources.  This  will support a group of farmers with their daily farming practices  in  the following 
<br/>Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  outsourcing,  dredging  of  major  rivers  and  creeks  is  a  programme 
<br/></span><span>designed to conduct dredging in rivers and creeks that are critical, with an allocation of $3 million.  
<br/></span><span>Additional donor funding project, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently on the planning phase of the

<div><span>Nature Base Coastal Protection with FJD$1.5 million grant provided by Asian Development Bank 
<br/>(ADB). This grant will stabilise approximately 4.3 kilometres in our four Divisions.  In the Northern 
<br/>Division,  it  is  Lakeba  Village  and  Kanakana  Village.    In  the  Western  Division,  it  is  Navutu 
<br/>Settlement, Tagaqe Village and Saioko Village.  In the Central Division, it is Veivatuloa Village, 
<br/>Toguru  Village,  Suvavou  Village  and  in  the  maritime  area,  it  is  Qarani  Village  and  Somosomo 
<br/>Village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Waterways in partnership with European Union 
<br/>(EU) has started the upscaling of the Soasoa Drainage System work in March 2022.  This project will 
<br/>oversee the construction of a new two double barrel flood gate structure, raising the existing level by 
<br/>0.2 metres along the most vulnerable areas.  This project is given a grant of €349,900 and in addition 
<br/>to this, we have received €39,770 which will be used to upscale the existing structures within the Soasoa 
<br/>Drainage Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  be  signing  the  contract  with  Kira  Initiative  this  month  to 
<br/>receive a grant of $730,000 for nature-based coastal protection.  The projects will provide protection and 
<br/>enhance coastal communities for climate resilience with 1,500 direct beneficiaries and 10,000 indirect 
<br/>beneficiaries.    This  is  for  Mali  Island,  Nakawa  Village  in  the  Province  of  Macuata  in  the  Northern 
<br/></span><span>Division, Navesi Village, Ligaulevu Village, Somosomo Village in the Province of Cakaudrove, Navala 
<br/></span><span>Village and Navolau No. 1 Village in the Western Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our tremendous effort in the current budget year has improved the situation to 
<br/>some extent. We, however, need to continue the same dedication improving to the next financial year. 
<br/>The  Ministry  daily  receives  enormous  requests  for  coastal,  river  bank  protection  and  provision  of 
<br/>drainage. We will prioritise appropriately and attend to the most vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will implement waterways capital works through nine programmes 
<br/>that are designed to support the Government in the implementation of the National Adaptation Plan, the 
<br/>5  year  and  20  year  National  Development  Plan  and  the  Green  Growth  Framework  for  Fiji  through 
<br/>recognising the need to have resilient infrastructures to improve livelihoods and in doing so, reducing the 
<br/>vulnerability and the risk of climate change impacts.  Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above programmes 
<br/>are in line with the International and the Regional Development Agenda and framework including the 
<br/>Sustainable  Development  Goals  Framework  for  resilient  development  in  the  Pacific  and  the  Blue 
<br/>Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by congratulating the honourable Minister for Economy and 
<br/>his team once again for a very bold and forward looking budget which in my view augurs well for our 
<br/>future economic growth.  I join other honourable Members of the House that have commended the 2022-
<br/>2023 Budget presented by the honourable Minister for Economy by offering my own commendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.A.R. SENILOLI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my response on the proposed 
<br/>National Budget for the 2022-2023 Financial Year, as presented by the honourable Attorney-General and 
<br/>Minister for Economy, Civil Service, Communications, Housing and Community Development on the 
<br/>evening of Friday, 15th July, 2022.  From the outset, for me, Sir, the Budget contains a lot of election 
<br/>announcements and less deliverables.  It has just been the norm for this Government in the last seven 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no doubt that this Budget will surely increase our debt portfolio.  It has 
<br/>now reached $9.1 billion - an unprecedented 39.4 percent of GDP. This is a far cry from only two years 
<br/>ago when our debt portfolio in July 2018 was $5.2 billion, which is 45.9 percent of GDP.  It is unfortunate 
<br/>that we do not have the necessary endowments to cushion our outstanding debt such as oil reserves and 
<br/>gold reserves which bigger nations with broader-based economies have.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From July 2018 to today, our debt has increased by $3.9 billion.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, 
<br/>we borrowed heavily about $2 billion of which $500 million was earmarked for unemployment benefits. 
<br/>The Government has borrowed because it tried to stimulate business.  However Government, over the 
<br/>years, has always allocated a lot of funding to the tourism industry at the expense of the resource-based 
<br/>sector, particularly agriculture, forestry and the fisheries sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those resource-based sectors will certainly make us self-sufficient and build a much broader-
<br/>based economy.  Heavy investment being made into our tourism industry has led us to be solely reliant 
<br/>on external factors which are totally  outside of our control.  We simply  cannot  build a stable and 
<br/>viable economy on such a fragile industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government also borrowed to support unemployment by giving away free money. To support 
<br/>unemployment, Government should review its polices and laws to make it easier for people to do 
<br/>business,  particularly  in  the  private  sector.  We  must  grow  the  private  sector  to  provide  the 
<br/>employment opportunity for sustainable growth.  Money must be spent in a productive way rather 
<br/>than giving it away as freebies or election gimmick.  If we just continue to be giving money away 
<br/>for spending, we will just increase inflation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this current financial year, the Government is looking at borrowing a further 
<br/></span><span>$1.179 billion.  This is to help in funding an over-estimated expenditure of $3.8 billion and a shortfall 
<br/>in  revenue  of  $2.9  billion,  resulting  in  an  estimated  gross  deficit  of  $1.179  billion.  It  seems  that 
<br/>Government’s answer to all structural challenges is to borrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debt is a debt.  It has to be paid back and at the rate it is going, the Government is placing a 
<br/>bigger burden to our future generation to pay off its debts.  Basically, they will not be able to borrow, 
<br/>but continue to pay for the debt accumulated by the Bainimarama Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, previous Governments were always very cautious in the way they borrowed 
<br/>money.  They always ensured that the debt to GDP ratio always remained around the recommended 
<br/>40 percent debt to GDP ratio for small vulnerable developing countries.  At times, they do borrow 
<br/>exceeding the 50 percent of GDP ratio by borrowing for capital investment purposes to fund much 
<br/>needed  capital  projects.    They  were  always  prudent  in  the  way  they  made  informed  financial 
<br/>decisions.  We must acknowledge past Governments for being sensible and prudent about financial 
<br/>management decisions and, thus, allow future government the space to be able to borrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  revenue  from  direct  taxes  is  estimated  at  $573.8  million.    Our  debt 
<br/>repayment for the financial year is $307.5 million.  Sir, 53.5 percent of our direct taxes revenue go 
<br/>straight  into our debt  repayment.   This  is  a fair  portion of Government  revenue  and thus,  a  great 
<br/>opportunity is lost, which could be better utilised to invest and revamp our resource-based sectors 
<br/>through this effective participation of resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy, in his Budget presentation, reported 
<br/>that the economy is projected to grow by 12.4 percent this year - its highest rate of growth ever.  How 
<br/>realistic and practical is this estimate or forecast?  The estimated 12.4 percent economic growth is 
<br/>for 2022, and the claim that it is unprecedented is a fallacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1979, the Government had an actual growth of 12 percent and in 1989, the Government, 
<br/>again, had an actual growth of 12.9 percent.  These are the highest growth rate achievements ever, 
<br/>based on actual growth and not forecast growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a comment on the First Home Buyers Grant.  In 2014, the Government 
<br/>introduced the First Home Buyers Grant Programme with a grant of $10,000 with those households

<div><span>earning below $50,000.  In 2020-2021, the First Home Grant was further increased to $30,000 from 
<br/>$10,000,  and  this  assistance  was  divided  into  two  categories  -  those  with  a  household  income  of 
<br/>$50,000 or less and those with a household income between $50,000 and $100,000.  This year, the 
<br/>Government has allocated $7 million to the first category of those earning less than $50,000 and $2 
<br/>million  for  those  earning  between  $50,000  and  $100,000.    The  Government  should  consider 
<br/>reviewing this programme so it can allow Fijians who want to build their first home in their village 
<br/>or landowning units can qualify for this grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Water Authority of Fiji, we look forward to the Rewa River Water 
<br/>Supply Scheme Project which will be completed in May 2023 as it will include communities between 
<br/>Nausori  and  Korovou.    The  District  of  Namara  which  currently  has  no  proper  water  reticulation 
<br/>system will benefit greatly from this project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would like to highlight that the Villages of Ovea, Cautata, Waikete and Nabitu 
<br/>continue to have no water in their village.  Normally, water comes in certain times during the day 
<br/>and night, other times the pressure is so low, thus water flow is slow but recently, the Villages have 
<br/>no water at all. Carting of water is almost daily and this is a temporary solution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Ovea, there is a reservoir that sits up the hills and WAF should consider 
<br/></span><span>putting it into service again.  Although there is a lot of money being allocated to providing water in 
<br/>the future, a lot of effort will also be placed to have water in the taps for now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now turn to my shadow portfolio, that is, on Communications and 
<br/>Information.  The Ministry of Communications is responsible for keeping Fijians connected to each 
<br/>other and to the outside world by ensuring the provision of efficient, competitive, cost-effective and 
<br/>accessible  telecommunication.    Today,  a  lot  of  work  and  services  are  rapidly  moving  to  online 
<br/>services, automation and digitisation.  This will be the new normal, and we must continue to keep up 
<br/>with the rate of changing technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the urgency to stay connected 
<br/>and to work remotely from home.  The uncertainty that we face nowadays has shown how critical it 
<br/>is for us to be connected and communication flowing even during lockdowns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government should, therefore, continue to provide internet connectivity to 
<br/>unconnected areas around the country through the Connectivity Rollout Programme.  It is vital that 
<br/>Government continues to invest in building towers in areas of poor internet connectivity.  Assessment 
<br/>work  being  done  has  identified  240  unconnected  and  poorly  connected  sites  which  have  been 
<br/>gazetted for phone connectivity to be implemented in phases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $11 million has been allocated for the construction of 15 towers and this will provide 
<br/>coverage  to  96  areas  identified  with  poor  internet  connectivity.    Can  the  Government  provide  a 
<br/>timeline as to when the remaining 144 areas with poor internet connectivity can expect better internet 
<br/>coverage?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Connectivity Rollout Programme last November, Government was 
<br/>able to connect 26 Schools and 14 Health Centres in the Northern Division.  This year, there is an 
<br/>allocation  of  $2.5  million  earmarked  for  49  Schools  around  Fiji.    Why  is  there  no  allocation  for 
<br/>connectivity to any Health Centres for the year?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been invested to </span><span>Walesi</span><span> and a further $14.6 million has been 
<br/>allocated for the Digital Switch-Over Awareness Project. The whole of Viti Levu switch-over has 
<br/>been completed, how long will it take to complete the switch-over project for the rest of Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, an additional 50 villages have been identified to receive free installation to have 
<br/>access to the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> connected network.  How are these villages being identified?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span> claimed that they have over 700,000 subscribers to </span><span>Walesi App</span><span> and that 700,000 people watch 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span>  on  their  phones.    Sir,  700,000  subscribers  is  commendable  but  how  many  of  them  are 
<br/>connected to both their phones and television at home?  How many households have no connections 
<br/>at all? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I tried to install the </span><span>Walesi App </span><span>with a login from the </span><span>Facebook</span><span> account 
<br/>option on my phone and it does not work. This is a bit lax as this App is now being made available 
<br/>to the public, it makes the whole App seem like it has been rushed upon release without proper user 
<br/>acceptance and testing.  In addition and sadly, the reviews have only one star rating out of five stars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>Walesi </span><span>is not even listed under State-Owned Entities in Table 14, on page 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>46 of the Budget Supplement Booklet. How is this </span><span>Walesi</span><span> being registered?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ease of Doing Business has increased its allocation from $4.9 million 
<br/>to  $9  million  and  most  of  this  will  go  towards  Project  bizFIJI  2.0  to  create  a  centralised  online 
<br/>application and approval system for starting a business and obtaining construction permits process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  improving  the  survey  and  development  process,  Government  has 
<br/>approved access to the VanuaGIS and Vanua View Platform.  Has land data being made available 
<br/>real-time or non-real-time?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government should be commended for investing in much-needed funds to 
<br/>improve communications in Fiji to be in line with the National Development Plan and the SDGs.  
<br/>The major challenge of digital technology is the rising threat of cybercrime.  As more data is being 
<br/>made  readily  available,  more  Government  services  are  being  processed  online  and  people  are 
<br/>becoming  more  comfortable  in  the  digital  economy.    Therefore,  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure 
<br/>increased  awareness  of  cybercrime  protected  network  with  solid  security  systems.    My  concern, 
<br/>however, is that digital developments are going too fast whereby communications infrastructure in 
<br/>the rural areas still lag behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my maiden speech, I did highlight that my inspiration to stand in the 2018 
<br/>Election was the opportunity to serve the communities and villages whereby I can make a difference 
<br/>in trying to bridge the disparity between urban and rural development.  Urban bias exist and the rural 
<br/>communities are at times deprived of much needed development as it is being focused in the urban 
<br/>centres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  also  applies  in  this  digital  divide.    Most  rural  areas  still  lack  the  basic 
<br/>communications infrastructure  –  no power, irregular power supply, no internet  connectivity, poor 
<br/>internet connectivity and difficulty to access smart phones and computers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is best that Government considers to place more emphasis on developing a 
<br/>robust and reliable communications infrastructure so that people of Fiji can realise the full potential 
<br/>of digital technology available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  address  some  constituency  issues.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Waterways  and  Environment  has  been  allocated  $1.5  million  for  the  construction  of  seawall  for 
<br/>villages and communities faced with the threat of coastal inundation and erosion.  I would like to 
<br/>thank Government for the seawall currently being constructed on Bau Island and work that is to start 
<br/>in Ovea.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1635 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight that there are neighbouring villages that are in dire need 
<br/>of a seawall, that is, Waicoka and Namuka.  This is due to the fact that the sea has claimed a lot of 
<br/>villages’ shorelines and the villages are waterlogged with seawater during high tide.  They have been 
<br/>promised assistance in 2017, and are still waiting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nakoroivau has been requesting for a footbridge for its primary school students who attend 
<br/>school  on  Bau  Island.    They  travel  by  boat  everyday.    At  low  tide,  they  walk  along  the  muddy 
<br/>waterfront,  laced  with  limestone  and  rocks  which  can  be  really  painful.    Sir,  they  have  been 
<br/>requesting for a footbridge to allow primary school students to walk safely and going to and back 
<br/>from school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the village of Nakorolevu in Namara which hosts both, the Namara District 
<br/>School and Namara Health Centre, villagers of Natila, </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Bau find it easier to attend both, the 
<br/>School and Health Centre in Namara due to its close proximity.  Can the Government consider an 
<br/>old road that connects Natila to Naisausau to be upgraded and maintained by FRA?  This will allow 
<br/>primary  school  students  and  villagers  to  access  proper  road  to  School  and  the  Health  Centre  in 
<br/>Namara.  Reaching Namara too gives the villagers access to public transport services through buses, 
<br/>taxis and vans.  The new road through Logani/Sebi Road, unfortunately, does not have this service 
<br/></span><span>available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, on Korovou Town Market, market vendors from Kumi Village want to 
<br/>sell </span><span>ivi</span><span> and seasonal fruits and are being denied tables inside the market since it is our seasonal fruit, 
<br/>Sir. They are then allocated a special place in front of the market whereby they have to bring their 
<br/>own seats and when it rains they are wet. Can arrangement be made to allocate proper tables for the 
<br/>villagers of Kumi in Korovou? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard in this Budget a lot of announcements and also heard how 
<br/>we have continued to borrow sparingly, we are simply living beyond our means. It is, therefore, for 
<br/>those reasons that I will not be able to support this motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H.R. POLITINI.-  I was surprised yesterday at the gutter response coming from that 
<br/>side of the House and that was yesterday. Today we have been bashed again by the </span><span>Bible</span><span>. We must 
<br/>be reminded when Jesus was put before Pontius Pilate in front of the Israelites He was with Barabbas 
<br/>the murderer. Pontius Pilate asked the people, “‘who do you want to be set free?” Instead of picking 
<br/>Jesus who came to set everyone free, they chose Barabbas the murderer and that was his response to 
<br/>the guys from the other end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the two terms FijiFirst has been the Government all the initiatives, grants you 
<br/>name it across the board it is all about the people.  There is no self-indulgency in there. As the aim 
<br/>and prerogative of the FijiFirst Government is to continually progress Fiji into a modern nation and 
<br/>we are on that path right now. We are improving road infrastructures, bridges, jetties, education so 
<br/>we are getting there.  Rome was not built overnight, Mr. Speaker, it took time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.R.  POLITINI.-    Thank  you  Honourable  Speaker.    The  fragile  global  economic 
<br/>recovery has been affected by lingering pandemic related supply disruption, the ripple effects of the 
<br/>Russian Ukraine War and the ever present threat of climate change and natural disaster.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  fellow  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; first and foremost, I must acknowledge and say a big </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to the Ministry of

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economy, its Permanent Secretary and team and the Honourable Minister for Economy for their time 
<br/>and effort in preparing the Budget Estimates for Year 2022-2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On infrastructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) has been allocated a sum of 
<br/>$376.7 million in the Financial Year 2022-2023. Of this, $13.8 million will cater for FRA’s operating 
<br/>costs  and  $362.9  million  is  to  carry  out  a  comprehensive  capital  works  programme  to  meet  our 
<br/>country’s growing need for new infrastructure and to maintain our existing road network.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must acknowledge the World Bank, ADB through the 
<br/>Ministry of Infrastructure and Higgins as the main contractor for the Kings Road Upgrading Project 
<br/>being carried out from Ba, Tavua, Rakiraki and as far as Wailotua in Wainibuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project, Mr. Speaker, is a rip and remake of the Kings Highway between Ba to Wailotua 
<br/>in Wainibuka and also includes new footpaths, curbs and bus bays for villages from Ba to Wailotua. 
<br/>All these infrastructural developments are in line with our Government’s Plan in modernising our 
<br/>nation’s infrastructure that was left neglect by previous Governments in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the budgetary allocation for FRA is in conformation of our commitment and 
<br/></span><span>intends to serve, improve and provide better service to the general public in terms of quality roads, 
<br/></span><span>bridges, footpaths, with safety in mind and resilience to the test of nature with the ever prevalence of 
<br/>climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The challenges, Mr. Speaker, because of weather and other calamities will be mitigated and the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  will  maintain  a  transparent  and  accountable  commitment  to  the  public  service 
<br/>delivery.  We will endeavour to facilitate the process and be mindful of the timeframe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the ongoing projects, whether it be a bridge or bridges, foot crossings, 
<br/>major or minor road works, our honourable Prime Minister and honourable Attorney-General  are 
<br/>committed in leaving no Fijians behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 2022-2023 National Budget.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023 Budget is the product 
<br/>of  an  arrogant,  out  of  touch  and  deceptive  Government  that  has  based  its  more  than  15  years  of 
<br/>military and parliamentary democracy rule on dictatorship and lies.  And why am I saying this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker?    Because  this  is  possibly  the  last  Budget  to  be  brought  to  Parliament  whether  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government before it is dissolved for the Elections.  And this, in all likelihood, is the last time that I 
<br/>will be speaking on a Budget from the Opposition benches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Parliament draws towards the end of its current term, I want 
<br/>to reflect on my journey of more than 3½  years since November 2018, that will show why this is a 
<br/>Budget by an arrogant, out of touch and dictatorial Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>How  can  I  forget  the  dictatorial  two-men  rule  that  has  trampled  upon  Parliamentary 
<br/>democracy, totally rejected bipartisanship and governed this nation by getting Parliament 
<br/>to enact legislation brought under Standing Order 51? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>How can  I forget the assault on me by the  honourable Prime Minister in August 2019, 
<br/>concocting by Government of my statement as an attack on the Prime Minister’s family 
<br/>and my suspension for six months because I refused to apologise for something I did not 
<br/>say or even mean?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>How can I forget that another victim of that sordid act was the brave Parliamentary staff 
<br/>member  who  was  terminated  from  his  employment  and  left  to  fend  for  himself  for  his 
<br/>survival for shooting the video capturing my assault? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>How can  I forget my arrest by  Police from my village home after midnight and during 
<br/>curfew hours in April 2020 for highlighting serious assault and human rights violation of a 
<br/>youth of Naqia Village by Police and remanded in custody for 36 hours at Totogo Police 
<br/>Station? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>How can I forget the arrest of the honourable NFP Leader and I, as well as other honourable 
<br/>Members of the Opposition, again, during curfew in July last year for simply questioning 
<br/>why Government did not consult with landowners before introducing the then Bill No. 17? 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>How can I forget being almost locked inside a CWM washroom, whose broken door was 
<br/>held by an IV tube and a wooden block - a door that this Government took over 16</span><span> </span><span>months 
<br/>to repair? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>How can I forget the deaths of over 1,300 Fijians from COVID-19 and COVID-19 related 
<br/>causes at the height of the pandemic and the deadly sight of three  40-foot containers used 
<br/>as temporary morgues? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S KOYA.- Slip of the tongue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can keep on counting and naming 
<br/>examples of false promises, deceit, political connivance, lies, of course, instances of the two-men 
<br/>rule trampling national interest just because it did not or does not suit them.  But it would take hours, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, so I will focus on two things - the 2022-2023 Budget and the address by the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  when  he  opened  the  meeting  of  the  Ba  Provincial  Council  six  days  ago  on 
<br/>Wednesday, 20th July, 2022, because that address was all about the Budget and featured lies and 
<br/>thoroughly incorrect statements deliberately designed to hoodwink delegates at that meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No prizes for guessing, why, Mr Speaker.  As the saying goes, “It’s the full-moon season - 
<br/>election campaign mode” and many, especially in Government, will tell the people that even the pigs 
<br/>can fly or they themselves can walk on water.  Fortunately, Sir, our people are able to differentiate 
<br/>truth from lies and this is precisely what is happening, despite the honourable Prime Minister’s grave 
<br/>dislike for the truth.   The same  goes  for his  right-hand man and the  </span><span>de facto</span><span> Prime Minister, the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy.  Sometimes, I do wonder who is clinging 
<br/>to whom, like the proverbial </span><span>bakewa</span><span>, Mr. Speaker!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That aside, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reality of the matter is that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>regurgitated  the  Budget  in  his  address  to  the  Ba  Provincial  Council,    just  as  this  unaccountable 
<br/>FijiFirst Government has been regurgitating promises in every budget without fluttering an eyelid, 
<br/>obviously, thinking Fijians are fools and blinded by freebies. They are certainly not, Mr. Speaker!  
<br/>They know that it is not a dose of medicine with repeats labelled on them to cure their sickness - far 
<br/>from it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the people want is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A genuine reduction of their cost of living to be able to purchase quality basic food and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>essential items at affordable prices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Timely, efficient, equipped and effective public health and medical delivery with fully 
<br/>functional diagnostics, surgical treatment and aftercare services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Quality education where no student is discriminated and teachers impart knowledge and 
<br/>instil legally-allowed discipline without the fear of recrimination or fear of job losses.

<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Opportunities for meaningful employment paying decent salaries and wages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sound  and  sensible  incentives  to  ensure  creation  of  investment  through  formulation  of 
<br/>policies through enactment of legislation that has a trickle-down effect to even benefit the 
<br/>grassroots and resulting in achieving milestones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>A fully-revived and profitable agricultural sector, including the sugar industry, dairy and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quality cash produce like vegetables, </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and rootcrops. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prevention  of  climate  degradation  by  re-afforestation,  ocean  and  freshwater  source

<div><span>8.</span><span> </span><span>Above  all,  a  kind,  compassionate,  accountable,  transparent  and  genuinely  democratic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government of, by and for the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet,  again,  unfortunately  but  unsurprisingly,  none  of  the  eight  core  objectives  which  are 
<br/>catalysts to genuine economic growth and making Fiji a land of hope and opportunity is successfully 
<br/></span><span>able to  alleviate poverty  and  give  a leg-up, as this  Government  likes to say, to  the thousands of 
<br/></span><span>struggling families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why,  Mr.  Speaker?    Because  this  Government  lacks  political  morality  and  political 
<br/>credibility, and this has resulted in the creation of an “Animal Farm” where the Government thinks 
<br/>it, together with its business cabal, who are bank-rolling the ruling FijiFirst Party, are far superior to 
<br/>those who entrusted them with looking after them with empathy and compassion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Who are the business cabal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- You know them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has resulted in “State Capture” 
<br/>where legislation is rushed through the floor of Parliament under Standing Order 51 to fulfil the needs 
<br/>of certain members of this cabal, which is clear as daylight in the financial donations list from 2014 
<br/>to 2019 of FijiFirst, are enacted to benefit only a chosen few.  Otherwise, which Government would, 
<br/>as an example of what I am saying, want to lose revenue and get Parliament to legislate, backdating to 
<br/>pre-2011, exemption of Capital Gains Tax for sales of shares?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Section 173 of the Constitution prohibits making changes retrospectively to Decrees (now 
<br/>Acts  without  ratification  by  Parliament)  that  impinge  on  the  fundamental  rights  of  our  people.    For 
<br/>example,  trashing  of  the  contractual  obligation  of  pensions  being  received  from  FNPF  from  being 
<br/>challenged in any Court of Law or Tribunal or giving a Certificate of Termination of Proceedings to those 
<br/>forcibly and illegally removed from their positions after the December 2006 </span><span>coup</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, some so-called Consequential Bills tabled on Monday, like the Pharmacy Profession 
<br/>(Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 are designed for all intents and purposes to benefit big pharmaceutical 
<br/>chains.  We know who they are, Mr. Speaker, and this is a matter best left for during the debate this 
<br/>Friday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, the Code of Conduct legislation first introduced in Parliament in 
<br/>April 2016, reintroduced during the last day of the first sitting of this Parliament in November 2018, has 
<br/>been gathering dust for more than six years.  Without its enactment, the creation of Accountability and 
<br/>Transparency Commission is dead and buried.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1639 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Bill No.17 later enacted by Parliament around this time last year was done so 
<br/>without consulting indigenous landowners.  That also resulted in quite a few of us being arrested, as I 
<br/>have said earlier, by police for publicly opposing the then Bill simply because it did not give a damn 
<br/>about the need to consult the landowners.  If the above is not a case of double standards, then what is it, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  told  the  Ba  Provincial  Council  that  iTLTB  was 
<br/>holding in trust $40 million for 45,000 members below the age of 18 years under equal distribution of 
<br/>lease moneys, and that there would be several young millionaires when they turn 18, because they would 
<br/>be able to own a home, start a business or own a car.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nothing can be further from the truth, Mr. Speaker.  For argument’s sake, if one divides $40 
<br/>million by 45,000 under 18 years </span><span>i Taukei</span><span>, this would only equate to a miserly $888.88 per person, far 
<br/>from a millionaire from every stretch of imagination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we all know, Mr. Speaker, that it is wrong to average lease money.  Young members of a 
<br/>bigger landowning unit like in Nadi, will get far, far more than the rest, which means that the rest of them 
<br/></span><span>will not even make the average threshold of $888.88.  They will have pittance in their pockets when they 
<br/></span><span>turn  18  years.    So  why  did  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  claim  they  would  be  millionaires?    Is  he 
<br/>hoodwinking the </span><span>i Taukei</span><span>?  Is he deliberately or otherwise lying, or is he just reading what is written for 
<br/>him, Mr. Speaker?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  has  destroyed  the  dairy  industry.    Despite  its  exclusive 
<br/>preferential treatment for 10 years given to a local corporate giant, Fiji still imports over 88 percent of 
<br/>milk and 100 percent of butter.  Imported milk powder is reconstituted into liquid milk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pastures in dairy areas are covered by grass and weed, deteriorating quality of the pastures, 
<br/>resulting in declining milk production.  The destruction of the dairy industry has been replaced by grass 
<br/>growing on the walls of CWM Hospital, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, the high valuable and profitable mahogany industry is in a state of neglect.  In one case, 
<br/>a  land  dispute  ownership  issue  between  landowners,  a  dairy  farmer  and  Fiji  Hardwood  Corporation 
<br/>Limited (FHCL) have resulted in landowners incurring income losses because harvested logs are now 
<br/>rotting.  I am raising this particularly, Mr. Speaker, for the Mataqali</span><span> </span><span>Ravouvou of Nasau Village, who 
<br/>have lost income because FHCL cannot resolve the dispute with a dairy farmer in Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The outcome of that dispute is that, there have been rotting logs in the field and in the plantation.  
<br/>As a consequence, the farmers have not benefited financially from what they should be getting from the 
<br/>logs  that  have  been  fallen.    So  this  is  Mataqali  Ravouvou  in  Waito,  Tailevu,  and  I  would  ask  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  concerned  to  look  into  this,  particularly  the  Minister  responsible  for  Public 
<br/>Enterprises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That brings me, Mr. Speaker, to the honourable Prime Minister labelling honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad as telling lies about the lack of allocation for guaranteed price of $85 per tonne of sugar in the 
<br/>2022-2023  Budget  for  the  2022  harvesting  season.    He  followed  his  </span><span>de  facto</span><span>  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, who told the State Broadcaster - FBC last week that the NFP Leader was 
<br/>lying and should withdraw his statement as a sum of $8 million has been allocated, and this would be 
<br/>enough to cover the guaranteed price.  Again, Sir, nothing can be further from the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The inherent problem with the honourable Prime Minister is that, he believes every word that the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General utters. Obviously, he has not read what his right-hand man churned out in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Pre-Election Fiscal and Economic Update released on 9th May, 2022.  So, who needs to return to 
<br/>school and learn mathematics, Mr. Speaker?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same applies to the </span><span>de facto</span><span> Prime Minister.  For him, reason and logic is out of the window 
<br/>if he is caught with his pants on fire because he is the one who first accused the honourable NFP Leader 
<br/>of lying about the guaranteed price.  This is what the Pre-election Fiscal and Economic Update, released 
<br/>on 9th May, 2022, states in respect of guaranteed price allocation, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Further allocation of around $8 million dependant on the cane harvest will be provided 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the 2022-2023 Budget to meet the final payment for the 2021 season”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is precisely what has been allocated – only $8 million to cover for the guaranteed price for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 2021 season. Where is the allocation for the 2022 season in this Budget?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what honourable Professor Prasad was asking. A legitimate question, turned into a lie by 
<br/>the  FijiFirst  Government  because  it  thinks  the  price  of  cane  will  rise  to  $82  per  tonne  due  to  the 
<br/>supposedly rise of sugar prices. Try telling this to the growers, honourable Prime Minister and honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General, because your lies are becoming moronic!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is not correct, you are assuming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, but translate it into price here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, worse, we are told to base our manifesto 
<br/>costings on the Pre-Election Fiscal and Economic Update.  No, Mr .Speaker, we would not do so. We do 
<br/>not want to base something on warped logic and cooked up statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the NFP and its honourable Leader, have been branded as lying by the Silent 25 for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>labelling this as a </span><span>Saqamoli </span><span>Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is a lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- We have done so because $1 is a </span><span>saqamoli</span><span>. That is what 
<br/>is allocated for every child up to 18 years old and tertiary students – provided they are from families with 
<br/>combined incomes of less than $50,000 per annum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A $1 a day, $180 for 6 months, while the honourable Prime Minister’s overseas travel allowance 
<br/>averages $3,000 a day, Mr. Speaker.  Cabinet Ministers are entitled to free meals and accommodation for 
<br/>local travel, and one wonders what is Parliament’s budget for our meals, morning and afternoon tea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a </span><span>saqamoli </span><span>per day when the cost of living has skyrocketed to unbelievable 
<br/>levels with cost of living adjustment in salaries and wages in both, public and private sectors, to ensure 
<br/>our people have buying power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, unknown to the people of Fiji, the salary and benefits of the honourable people was boosted 
<br/>in his role as RFMF Commander because he was performing the role of the Prime Minister.  This was in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1641 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>January  2010,  approved  by  the  Office  of  the  President,  following  a  letter  by  the  Attorney-General.  
<br/>That resulted in him earning as RFMF Commander, a total salary of $316,250 per annum, comprising of 
<br/>the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Base salary  
<br/>-   $230,000 per annum. 
<br/>Extra Duty Allowance   -  $28,750 per annum (12.5 percent of base salary). 
<br/>Gratuity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>-  $57,500 per annum (25 percent Gratuity for every 12 
<br/>  month’s of service).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total salary per annum   -  $316,250.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  massive  hike  was  seen  as  compensating  the  RFMF  Commander  for 
<br/>performing the role of Prime Minister and six other ministerial portfolios.  And it resulted in payment of 
<br/>salaries for Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers being outsourced for payment to accounting firm - Aliz 
<br/>Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point is, if the RFMF Commander was being compensated for performing 
<br/>the role of the Prime Minister and extra duties, why is the very same Government providing $1 per day 
<br/>to its citizens and thinks it is good enough to meet the cost of basic food and essentials? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Where’s your budget?  You can’t do it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government has created Fiji into an Animal Farm, where the chosen few and a 
<br/>business of cabal get the pie while the people get fed on crumbs.  This will be the legacy behind by this 
<br/>cruel and heartless FijiFirst Government when it is booted out by the people at the polling booths during 
<br/>the Elections.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; greetings to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise today to commend the honourable  Attorney-General and  Minister for 
<br/>Economy and Minister responsible for climate change for delivering a very comprehensive, responsible, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prudent and well thought-out National Budget for the financial year 2022-2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  and  his  team  has  provided  us  with  a  far-sighted  and 
<br/></span><span>transformative recovery, growth and development Budget that will not only protect our households, the 
<br/></span><span>youth and students and the vulnerable, but will also stimulate private sector activity, empower women 
<br/>and youth and create green jobs that will maintain Fiji’s macroeconomic fiscal sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Budget  was  developed  with  extensive  consultation  with  different  cross-sections  of  the 
<br/>community.  Unfortunately, some on the other side cannot see that the Budget process should be inclusive 
<br/>and should evolve out of the people.  Instead, they labelled it as an electioneering process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It reflects the wisdom and leadership of our honourable Prime Minister and his commitment to 
<br/>ensure that we all grow together and, therefore, any Budget must reflect the concerns and aspirations of 
<br/>all the people, be it in the urban area, peri-urban, deep-rural and maritime areas and that they are not 
<br/>forgotten; the dreams of the young students are not affected; and the welfare of the elderly are not affected 
<br/>by the adverse economic situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can, indeed, say that this Budget has not left anyone behind during one of 
<br/>the most difficult times in the history of this country.  Unfortunately, those on the Opposition bench, who

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spoke yesterday, continue to name-call this Budget without any merit.  They are hell-bent in misleading 
<br/>the public that this Budget is not the best and, therefore, they must not vote for this Government.  They 
<br/>have failed miserably to inform the people about their alternative plan and alternative budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the only correct thing they said yesterday was that, our people are indeed smart.  
<br/>They know the truth and they fully understand how our Government protected their welfare during the 
<br/>COVID-19 crisis against their calls for a complete shutdown of the country.  Instead of supporting our 
<br/>calls for vaccination, some, with the likes of honourable Bulanauca, campaigned against it.  Instead of 
<br/>protecting our national carrier which is the only airline to carry our agriculture produce out of the country, 
<br/>they wanted to throw it under the bus. God knows what the situation and state of affairs we would have 
<br/>been in, had they been leading the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was the decisive leadership by our honourable Prime Minister that we are now 
<br/>operating in a near normal state.  This visionary leadership of this Government will go down the history 
<br/>books.  Our grandchildren will read about this pandemic and realise how our Government used all its 
<br/>resources to minimise fatalities and protect people’s welfare throughout Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  make  matters  worse,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Qereqeretabua  has  still  not  made  an 
<br/></span><span>apology  to  our  honourable Prime Minister for making  uncalled comment  on  his  father.   Honourable 
<br/></span><span>Professor Prasad, is she guilty or not?  Is she guilty or not, honourable Professor Prasad?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will read it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Just say it.     Just admit it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Just admit it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Do not carry out a conversation between you two. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I expect honourable Reddy… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, do not carry out a conversation between you two.  We 
<br/>have too much of this. If you are going to make a comment do so, but do not carry out a conversation.  
<br/>Include me all the time.  I will come and converse with you two.  You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point of order is this, Mr. Speaker, we heard yesterday and today, and honourable Reddy 
<br/>should understand the English language better, I do not think honourable Qereqeretabua at any point in 
<br/>time meant the honourable Prime Minister’s family. She did not because what she said was not referring 
<br/>to the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- She said, “his father’s money.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  It is like making a statement - it does not mean that she was 
<br/>referring to the honourable Prime Minister.  I mean, it is quite unethical and stupid, Mr. Speaker, for these 
<br/>Members to lie.  They are misleading Parliament and it is irrelevant to the discussion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Point of Order is irrelevance.  It is a lie that she said anything about the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister’s family, she did not.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand by my comment. There are a lot of hollow-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>logs on the other side making a lot of noise. It is loud, but nothing inside.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- On the same Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we need a ruling on this because as I have said, the honourable Minister is lying.  He is 
<br/>misleading Parliament. He is misleading the people of this country and what he is saying is irrelevant to 
<br/>the debate that we are having right now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do not carry out a conversation.  Honourable Members, everyone is referring to this statement, 
<br/>but I have not heard the statement.  If you want me to make a ruling, I have to see the statement. I have 
<br/></span><span>neither seen nor heard any statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They should refer the statement to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are talking about non-relevance, but they have 
<br/>been reading the </span><span>Bible</span><span> in Parliament during their budgetary speech and he never stood up and said this is 
<br/>not relevant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Tikoduadua was talking about corruption.  He should be the last 
<br/>person to talk about corruption. He forced the Military and PWD to repair his house when he was on this 
<br/>side of the House.  He should not talk about corruption. They are very quiet now, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact of the pandemic and the war on production and supply chains have 
<br/>sparked inflation worldwide and we cannot be complacent. We need to be proactive to ensure that our 
<br/>households are insulated against any food insecurity.  Therefore, it is imperative upon us to brace up and 
<br/>do what needs to be done to ensure our food security is not compromised at any cost.  At the same time, 
<br/>we need to grab this opportunity to expand primary production, reduce our imports and increase exports 
<br/>to premium markets to bring in the much needed foreign currency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, the Ministry of Agriculture acknowledges with gratitude the appropriation of $64.1 
<br/>million for the upcoming financial year.  This is an increase of $3.1 million from the Revised 2021–2022 
<br/>Budget that was used to assist in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through 
<br/>a competitive, resilient agriculture sector for the growth and development of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to in detail by the honourable Pillay, the performance of Agriculture 
<br/>Sector over the last three years has been exemplary - production has increased in real terms and so has 
<br/>our exports.  I am pleased to announce today in Parliament that for the upcoming financial year, from this 
<br/>Budget of $64 million, we will be making a direct assistance package to the farmers worth $29.2 million.  
<br/>Now, I want to see what the honourable Members from the other side have to say to this.  We need to 
<br/>continue this momentum, albeit, smartly based on a sustainable agriculture model.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this $29.2 million package will ensure more idle resources will be utilised, more 
<br/>people will participate and, therefore, they will all be rewarded with the surplus generated, imports will 
<br/>be reduced, exports will be increased to bring in more foreign currency into the country, more jobs will 
<br/>be created directly and indirectly, and our economy will grow.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the assistance is divided into two groups; firstly, about 14 of these packages will 
<br/>be for farmers who have never received any  assistance, and the rest will be given to all the farmers, 
<br/>particularly the successful farmers, to give them leverage to another level.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>y</span><span>aqona </span><span>commercial farmers to purchase small equipment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, borehole support - $109,000 has been allocated to assist 21 farmers with one-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>third contribution of $5,000 to establish a borehole on their farm.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Draft Animal Power Initiative - $60,000 has been allocated to assist those farmers in the remote 
<br/>areas who are using draft horse, to buy basic equipment such as chains, et cetera. We are looking at 
<br/>assisting 30 such farmers who are using horse power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sheep Shed Package - $175,000 has been allocated to assist 29 farmers who will be provided with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sheep shed material worth $6,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Goat Shed Package - $160,000 has been allocated to assist 26 farmers to construct goat sheds 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with materials worth $6,000 from the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commercial  Farmers’ Equity Package - $500,000  has been allocated to  support  farmers  who 
<br/>would want to establish a processing shed, who want to purchase a large equipment like an excavator, 
<br/>bulldozer or tractor. They will acquire a loan from the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) and the Ministry 
<br/>will pay as a grant the 20 percent equity contribution for these farmers to FDB so that they can acquire a 
<br/>loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Home Biogas Digester Equipment - $88,000 has been allocated so that we can assist 22 piggery 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>farmers with utilisation of the waste material that they have to generate biogas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pig  Farrowing  Crate  Support  -  $32,000  has  been  allocated  to  assist  six  farmers  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>establishment of pig farrowing crates for their farm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farm Mechanisation - $1.16 million has been allocated to assist farmers buy machinery.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, 25 tractors and five diggers will be purchased for co-operatives with one-third contribution by 
<br/>these groups and two-thirds by Government out of this $1.16 million under programme.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $340,000 have been allocated to assist 10 co-operatives to purchase or procure 
<br/>rice  harvesters.    Rice  is  becoming  a  big  industry  now,  we  have  witnessed  a  massive  growth  in  rice 
<br/>production this year and we want to ensure that harvesting is not a binding constraint.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Organic Manure Development - $40,000 has been allocated to establish organic manure at 10

<br/>concurrently, such as provision of planting material, stray animal campaign, Mushroom Industry Support 
<br/>and  Rotuma  Island  Development  Programme.  These  with  other  28  initiatives  will  provide  direct 
<br/>assistance to the farmers worth $29 million is now unveiled, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It will be advertised and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we  are  looking  forward  to  farmers,  co-operatives  and  agro  processing  and  exporters  to  apply  for 
<br/>assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above demonstrates that those on the other side, including Mr. Chaudhry, 
<br/>who was saying that there was nothing much for the agriculture sector, they either do not know how to 
<br/>read the Budget Estimates or the Budget document, or they are getting into that normal bandwagon of 
<br/>just opposing anything that Government will say.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as they have rightly said, the people are smart.  They know what we have 
<br/>done and they will make the decision based on our track record.  Let us all mobilise our resources, 
<br/>use Government support and make our agricultural sector an example for all the other developing 
<br/>countries.  Other countries in our agriculture forum are writing to us and asking how we have we 
<br/>done  that,  how  we  have  mobilised  the  entire  country  into  agriculture.    They  are  copying  us  but 
<br/>unfortunately,  honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  just  do  not  know  and  cannot  see  what  is 
<br/>happening on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on my other portfolio of environment, Section 40(1) of the Constitution of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Republic of Fiji states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “Every person has the right to a clean and healthy environment, which includes 
<br/>the  right  to  have  the  natural  world  protected  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future 
<br/>generations through legislative and other measures.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  bearing  this  mandate  is  a  huge  honour,  with  it  comes  a  huge  responsibility  and 
<br/>mammoth  opportunities  as  well.    The  Ministry  of  Environment,  in  the  next  financial  year,  will 
<br/>continue to ensure that Fiji’s natural environment is protected, resources are sustainably utilised, all 
<br/>developments  are  sustainable,  the  ozone  layer  is  protected  and  waste  is  properly  managed  and 
<br/>pollution controlled. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our pursuit for a cleaner environment, the Ministry of Environment will 
<br/>continue  to  enforce  the  Environment  Management  Act  2005  and  amendments  thereof,  the  Ozone 
<br/>Depleting Substances Act 1998, the Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002 and the Litter Act 
<br/>2008.    This  Budget  is  weighed  against  Government’s  commitment  into  safeguarding  our  natural 
<br/>environment through an integrated expedient approach, ensuring that development does not come at 
<br/>the cost of our environment, even during this trying time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, environmental conservation initiatives keep us on track towards achieving 
<br/>our environmental commitments we have set out in the National Development Plan strategies such 
<br/>as the National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan 2020-2025 and global obligations under the various 
<br/>multilateral environmental treaties that we are party to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the total budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Environment is $3.4 million 
<br/>for the fiscal year 2022-2023 of which, $3 million is for operating expenditure.  Sir, $297,000 has 
<br/>been rolled over for the payment of the Naboro Landfill Stage 2, Cell 3 construction to cater for the 
<br/>waste generated in the Lami, Suva and Nausori corridor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  completion  of  construction  of  Stage  2,  Cell  3  of  the  Naboro  Landfill  will  provide  an 
<br/>additional space of 200,000 cubic metres and is expected to last for approximately three years.  This 
<br/>will also  depend on the amount of waste generated and received in  the  Landfill.  The Ministry is 
<br/>working with the private sector and the communities across Fiji on a number of recycling initiatives 
<br/>to reduce the amount of waste ending up in the Landfill and the environment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1647 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  cognisant  of  the  fact  that  preventing  pollution  reduces  our  financial 
<br/>environment  cost  overlays.    Hence,  curbing  pollution,  conserving  and  protecting  Fiji’s  natural 
<br/>resources, including the oceans and coastal ecosystems such as coral reef, our forests, rivers, lakes 
<br/>and wild life, as always will be our top priority.  The Ministry will continue its enforcement work in 
<br/>these areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Environment  has  implemented  several  environmental 
<br/>initiatives in the 2021-2022 financial year and this will continue in the 2022-2023 financial year.  Sir, 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Environment  merits  and  appreciates  all  its  partnerships  and  will  continue  to 
<br/>collaborate  with  all  likeminded  agencies  in  meeting  our  environmental  protection,  conservation 
<br/>biodiversity goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, there cannot be any better time than this to get into commercial agriculture, but 
<br/>production and supply should be in response to market signals rather than grants and subsidies.  The 
<br/>support that we have announced are to provide the initial leverage to win the new entrepreneurs to 
<br/>start walking and running.  Only then will our agriculture sector be sustainable.  The agriculture sector 
<br/>is an economic sector not a welfare sector, so its growth and surplus creation process will look after 
<br/>all those who will participate in this process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all honourable Members in Parliament to join me in 
<br/>endorsing and supporting this Budget.  It is a Budget with a vision for all Fijians, led by the exemplary 
<br/>and decisive leadership of our honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Budget  Address  of  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Economy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for some of us this would be our last Budget 
<br/>Address especially with nine political parties all contesting the elections making it hard for all parties 
<br/>to meet the five percent threshold. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure whether our Budget speeches this week will convince our voters to vote for us.  
<br/>We can plan, strategise campaign and give out handouts but it still does not guarantee a return for 
<br/>anyone  back  in  Parliament.    The  appointment  and  removal  of  any  authority  including  this 
<br/>Government,  pass  governments  and  the  new  incoming  government,  that  appointment  alone,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, belongs to our heavenly Father.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  voters  are  more  politically  matured  and  I  have  no  doubt  that  they  will  vote  for  a 
<br/>government that will better serve and empower them.  I urge everyone to vote in this year’s General 
<br/>Elections.  In 2018 we had a total of 637,000 registered voters but on polling day only 458,000 voted.  
<br/>A total  of 178,995 had registered but  did  not  vote and the majority comprised of  youth,  age was 
<br/>between 21 years and 30 years and that was 58,776.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what this “Bula Budget Boom” is all about as our Government 
<br/>debt  stands at  $9.1  billion, a  debt  that our people today  and those  yet  to  be born will bear.  This 
<br/>Budget offers a continuing entrenched dependency on government and any creativity, innovation and 
<br/>individualism is forfeited.  While this Budget brings its usual promises for the next five months, the 
<br/>implementation will be another altogether and the nation will be watching.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the financial year 2019-2020 Budget, this Government announced that they will mandate 
<br/>all political parties contesting the election, cost their budgets in relation to manifestos to grant full 
<br/>transparency to the Fijian people in assessing the viability of political promises.  Rest assured had 
<br/>this requirement be mandated back in 2014, this Government would have hung itself like Haman 
<br/>from the </span><span>Bible</span><span> many times over.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have heard of the rhetoric unprecedented economic growth and yet this 
<br/>Government is so proud of facilitating opportunities for our citizens to pick fruits in Australia when 
<br/>the Australian citizens themselves do not partake in this work.  For the past 16 years, why have we 
<br/>not developed groves of our own so that we employ our people to work in Fiji and at the same time 
<br/>strengthen our food security?  I would like to highlight key issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Budget of public consumption:  I reiterate what I said in my contribution in the budget for 
<br/>the  last  financial  year.    We  are  simply  maintaining  a  regime  of  operations  that  is 
<br/>unsustainable and which is clearly not conducive with the realities of our small economy.  
<br/>This Government is borrowing for consumption. We have already heard it, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  Our military budget alone is $94.1 million, I question the timing of this increase as it 
<br/>can be seen as vote buying incentive to the military, no matter the rationale behind the 
<br/>increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investors, with the removal of restrictions… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Talk to the hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… under the Investment Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, more investors will be coming to Fiji.  
<br/>We welcome investments but it needs to be quality investments.  This is elections year 
<br/>and  investors  will  be  cautious  with  their  investments,  and  given  the  state  of  our 
<br/>economy, we must not be quick to approve any investment that does not add value to 
<br/>our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Dependency  syndrome,  this  Government  has  brought  about  a  dependency  mentality 
<br/>syndrome  and this has  enslaved  our people.  A legacy  that no  government wants to  be 
<br/>known for except this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I quote from Thomas Sowell, “The welfare state is the oldest con game in 
<br/>the world.  First, you take the people’s money away quietly and then you give some of it back to 
<br/>them flamboyantly.” This is exactly what this Government is doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  is  giving  out  $180  per  child  below  18  years  of  age  to 
<br/>parents with a combined income of less than $50,000.  Mind you, the PAYE is exempted for those 
<br/>earning $30,000 and below. So, is this Government alluding that the new poverty threshold is now 
<br/>$50,000?  The  irony,  all  backbenchers  from  the  Government  side  including  those  of  us  in  the 
<br/>Opposition, excluding the LOP, our annual salary of $50,000 and this has been reduced by 20 percent.  
<br/>Does this mean that we are potential beneficiaries of this assistance as being below the new poverty 
<br/>line  as  alluded  to?    I  am  not  sure  that  this  is  the  intention  as  this  type  of  assistance  should  be 
<br/>specifically targeted to the poorest of the poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there has been a lot of hype about these handouts, the details are hazy, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/>Will this Budget only benefit children who are still at school or only children whose parents are both 
<br/>vaccinated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- These handouts, Mr. Speaker, are equivalent to the inflammatory 
<br/>statements made by Marie-Antoinette shouting during the French Revolution, I quote: “Let them eat 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cake.”  Her response to the starving peasants and her lack of awareness of the daily struggle of the 
<br/>ordinary people and this is what this Government is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On work scheme, we have seen hundreds of our people depart for Australia under the Pacific 
<br/>Labour Scheme. I support an individual’s choice to choose what is best for their family especially 
<br/>when employment opportunities are not available for them in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, all our </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> MPs 
<br/>should be concerned that our villages are becoming empty under this Scheme.  Who will attend to 
<br/>the village activities, duties, </span><span>teitei</span><span> and look after their families who are left behind? The Australian 
<br/>Government mentioned about permanent residency for our Pacific labourers and this includes their 
<br/>families as  well.   If this does eventuate,  I have  no doubt  that the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  population  will sharply 
<br/>decline under this Scheme as they are the ones that I am seeing on the mainstream media leaving our 
<br/>shores.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  I came across  a presentation  and the heading of one of the tables was  – Fiji 
<br/>Population Dynamics.  This data carries a 10-year census population from 1986, 1996 and 2007 for 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, the Indians and General population.  The General population would include our fellow 
<br/>Fijian ethnicities from the Solomon Islanders, Vanuatu, Rotumans, Rabi, local Chinese and mixed 
<br/>race communities and the 10-year interval saw a gradual … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- … 5,000 population increase …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Member said “Indians”.  Is  she talking about 
<br/>Indian nationals?  What is she talking about because no Indian national in Fiji can come through the 
<br/>Pacific Labour Scheme.  They are Fijian citizens only, so what was she referring to?  I will need a 
<br/>clarification, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  had  the  honourable  Member    listened  well  to  my 
<br/>speech, this is  what  I said.   I did  not  make any reference.   I did  not  state anything about  Indians 
<br/>leaving.  All I said was this, “I have no doubt that the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> population will sharply decline.”  I did 
<br/>not say anything about Indians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, I will be guided by you.  You have not said anything, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will continue, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, she just lied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- The Census for period 2007 to 2017, the general population saw an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase from 47,000 to 115,000; an increase of 67,000 people, 56 percent within 10 years … 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Honourable Professor Prasad even heard her too and he shook his head when she said it.  Everyone 
<br/>heard it.  Honourable Koya was outside the Chamber, he heard it too.  She just lied, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have the floor.  But there is a Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I appreciate that, Mr. Speaker.   I am coming to a very important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>point, Mr. Speaker, and I can see why the distraction.  The Census for the period 2007 and …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable, just hold it for a while.  There has been a Point of Order here 
<br/>regarding you saying the word “Indians”.  Now it is either you said it or not.  If you said it, what was 
<br/>the reason for it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- She said it. Please, do not lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Indian or Indians?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Sir,  what  I  did  say  in  regards  to  the  general  population,  I  made 
<br/>reference to the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and Indians.  If this is the one that they are referring to. This is the one I am 
<br/>referring to and this is the data that has come before me and I am talking about the other ethnicities

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney, you have the floor.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  under  the  Pacific  Labour  Scheme,  Fijian  citizens  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowed to go to Australia not Indians, and she has said iTaukei and Indians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Legally speaking, Sir, under the Constitution, all citizens of this country are called Fijians and 
<br/>she said ‘Indians’. So legally speaking (and she is a lawyer) if she is saying Indians that means she 
<br/>means people who are citizens of India.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am saying, Sir, if she means ‘citizens of India’ they cannot go under the Pacific Labour 
<br/>Scheme. If she means ‘Indo-Fijians’, then she should say it.  They are not Indians they are citizens 
<br/>of this country. When the Australians come and recruit people, Sir, they do not look at us as Indians, 
<br/>Fijians and Others as she always says.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they see us all as Fijian citizens and we are all Fijians.   The honourable 
<br/>Member for the record again  initially lied. She said  she did  not  say ‘Indians’ and not  after much 
<br/>persistence she is now admitted she used the word ‘Indian’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify that.   
<br/>MR. SPEAKER.- You have heard that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1651 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I continue then, Mr. Speaker.  Now the population show an increase 
<br/>from 47,000 to 150,000, an increase of 67,000 people or 56 percent within 10 years whilst  in the 
<br/>same period, there is a slight decline of Fijians of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and </span><span>Indian </span><span>ethnicity - the two dominant 
<br/>ethnicities in Fiji and this will decline further with the Pacific Labour Scheme and migration of our 
<br/>people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 56 percent increase of our general population from 2007 to 2017 surely would not have 
<br/>come from this minority ethnicity group that I have mentioned above. My question, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>who are these people? Where did they come from? Where are they staying and whose jobs are they 
<br/>taking  up?  Why  is  this  information  not  disclosed  to  the  public?  It  would  be  fair  to  say  that  this 
<br/>increase came from new citizens and new ethnicities to our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all know the removal of the Chief Institution.  As he released the 2019-2020 
<br/>Household Income and Expenditure Survey, it showed that three-quarter of Fiji’s poorest people are 
<br/>the Fijians of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> ethnicity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, a Point of Order. Sir, it has been mentioned on the floor 
<br/>of this Parliament so many times that that is an incorrect statement because the survey that was done 
<br/></span><span>was incorrect. We pointed this out so many times, it has been elucidated both outside and inside of 
<br/></span><span>this Chamber and she continues to harp on about that and she is misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Take note of that, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Now, to add insult to injury, the World Bank corrected the Bureau 
<br/>of Statistics’ HIES Report that the National Poverty Rate for 2019-2020 is now estimated at 24.1 
<br/>percent,  compared  to  the  29.9  percent  previously  recorded.    It  is  quite  odd  that  the  World  Bank 
<br/>corrected this but when I see how they have given out money to our Government, perhaps it is in the 
<br/>interest that any restriction on investments should be removed, especially when their money is being 
<br/>used. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have heard it so many times when I came in to Parliament that we are being 
<br/>labelled as racists. When we called for any ethnic data, I am certainly not racist. However, when I 
<br/>see an ethnicity being marginalised and discriminated, rest-assured, Mr. Speaker, I will call it out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All nations including Fiji are working towards the 17</span><span>th</span><span> Sustainable Development Goals. If the 
<br/>data is telling us that the indigenous people of this country are the poorest in our nation, it is all the 
<br/>more  reason  to  bring  back  the  affirmative  action  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei.    </span><span>This  is  not  racism,  we  are  an 
<br/>ethnicity of less than 500,000 people in the world.  Affirmative action for indigenous people, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, in other parts of the world has been done and is still going on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  when  it  comes  to  Social  Welfare  Assistance,  we  need  to  have  a  holistic 
<br/>understanding of those that actually need it.  Breaking it down to ethnicity, age, income brackets so 
<br/>when assistance is given it is targeted to those that really need it.  The track record of the $360 and 
<br/>$180 handouts last year saw liquor shops benefitting the most. In fact the handout was discriminatory 
<br/>as it only benefitted the vaccinated and if this next one of handout has the same vaccination criteria 
<br/>then some families that truly need this assistance will not benefit at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No vaccination requirement …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Well, I am glad I am hearing that, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, we all know about this USP saga but what we did not know until we saw it on 
<br/>mainstream media was that, there were five inquiries carried out by respective organisations and an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>1652 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>independent  person  that  cleared  the  USP  Vice-Chancellor  (VC)  for  any  alleged  mismanagement.  
<br/>How many inquiries will be done to satisfy this Government?  In the event, an independent inquiry 
<br/>was sanctioned  and chosen by the Fiji Government still clears the VC, this Government will still be 
<br/>displeased of the outcome as it does not fit into their narrative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2021, no grant has been released to USP and it may come a time that the USP Council 
<br/>makes the decision to increase student fees.  I have no doubt that this Government will be the first 
<br/>one to jump and condemn the increase as majority of our USP students are Fijians.  Withholding the 
<br/>USP Grant contradicts this Government slogan of “they leave no one behind”.  The locals are the 
<br/>largest number of employees at USP and majority of the students are Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now address my shadow portfolio, first, the Local Government.  The 
<br/>honourable Minister mentioned that there will be a review of the Local Government Act and I support 
<br/>it wholeheartedly.  In fact, when I left Suva City Council in 2006, the review of the Act was always 
<br/>in the pipeline but for the Ministry it was never implemented.  This Budget is Government Budget it 
<br/>is  allocated  $145,000  for  a  pre-feasibility  investigation  of  a  construction  of  the  Viti  Levu  Cross 
<br/>Country Highway.  This money would be best allocated  to the review of the Act as the priorities 
<br/>surely override the feasibility highway study. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On city rates, the biggest challenge for all Municipalities is the non-payment of city rates as 
<br/>most ratepayers do not see it as a priority.  In March this year, the honourable Minister for Local 
<br/>Government reported that we had a total of $62.8 million in unpaid debts.  The loss of jobs during 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic would have seen a lot of ratepayers falling behind in their city rates.  To reduce 
<br/>this financial hardship, Government should consider ratepayers accessing their FNPF to clear their 
<br/>arrears  as  this  scheme  is  currently  not  in  place.    To  get  a  loan  or  the  discipline  of  a  compulsory 
<br/>monthly  deduction  towards  the  clearance  of  arrears  would  be  a  challenge  for  many,  hence  the 
<br/>proposal of accessing one’s FNPF to secure their homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other option, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to consider our young ratepayers to access their FNPF 
<br/>to pay for the rates on their family properties, despite their names not registered on the title.  This is 
<br/>a way of securing their family properties and ensuring that it is not so low.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  better,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  a  discussion  yesterday  with  the  honourable  Minister.  
<br/>Look at removing the interest component as Municipalities are not financial institutions and give a 
<br/>discount on the principal amount only.  This should reduce the arrears and get money for all municipal 
<br/>authorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the increase of squatters within the municipal boundaries.  
<br/>This  has  put  pressure  on  all  Local  Authorities  but  a  majority  of  our  unskilled  force  comes  from 
<br/>squatter settlements.  We simply cannot push them out to the periphery as this would have an adverse 
<br/>impact in terms of access to education and to employment.  We need to accommodate and build more 
<br/>Public Rental Board (PRB) flats within Municipalities and make housing affordable and accessible 
<br/>to our low income earners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Housing Authority concept does not work for our low income earners.  It works for our 
<br/>middle class, hence the push for more PRB flats.  The demand for affordable housing will continue 
<br/>to rise but whether our people can afford it is another issue.  We now have civil servants stay in 
<br/>squatter settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the 2014 Budget announcements till today, this Government has been 
<br/>saying that they will continue to help resettle and upgrade housing of those Fijians living in squatter 
<br/>settlements.  While I acknowledge the newly-built affordable housing projects, this is not enough as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1653 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the demand for more affordable housing rise.  We now have the Informal Settlement Act and this 
<br/>Government imposes a harsh penalty on a squatter settler when they refuse to move away from an 
<br/>area which they have no title to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The penalty to the squatters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is so ridiculous.  They are already the poorest 
<br/>of the poor and yet, they are penalised with the $20,000 penalty or a term not exceeding 10 years or 
<br/>both.  Why are the squatters treated like common criminals with these harsh penalties?  Such penalties 
<br/>are dished out for severe criminal offences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have 83 percent of Fijians of iTaukei ethnicity who reside in PRB flats 
<br/>and the high demand for PRB flats continues as the rental ranges from $15 per week to $25 per week.  
<br/>Then you have the new Raiwai PRB flats and that, I believe, is from $99 per week for one bedroom 
<br/>to $100 per week for two bedrooms.  With such price range and the locations of PRB flats, we need 
<br/>to build more to accommodate our very low income earners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we are hearing of squatters getting evicted from Nanuku Settlement, Khalsa Road and 
<br/>many more will follow suit as the legal lessee has the legal right to remove a squatter from their land.  
<br/>I am concerned for the squatter settlers of Fiji, especially our minority ethnic groups as they reside 
<br/></span><span>on land that do not belong to them.  These are the Solomon Islanders, the Vanuatuans, the Rabians, 
<br/></span><span>Wallis and Futuna. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same as well for our Indian ethnicities. In fact, they are the 
<br/>poorest of the poorest because we, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>can always go back.  This group of ethnicities needs 
<br/>security for tenure, land that they can call their own.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government  budgeted  $9  million  for  the  Fiji  International  Golf  Tournament  in  their 
<br/>2017-2018 Budget.  If they can support such an incentive, surely they can set aside money to buy 
<br/>land for this group of people and give them ownership to land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now  with  restrictions,  we  move  from  the  Investment  Act,  we  will  be  having  all  sorts  of 
<br/>investors coming to Fiji and they will want a return of their investment and our squatters are staying 
<br/>on land investors will find lucrative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen unprecedented laws passed in this august Parliament from 
<br/>2014 till to date.  Standing Order 51 is a weapon used by this Government to pass laws through a 
<br/>majority vote and this Bill does not go through a thorough consultative process. We are not giving 
<br/>enough time, our voters expect better from us and rushing a Bill through this Parliament questions 
<br/>the  transparency  that  this  Government  harps  on.    The  irony  of  Standing  Order  51  when  the  new 
<br/>Government comes in, they will use the same provision to bring in quickly new laws and repeal some 
<br/>of the laws that they have already implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a point on justice, Resident Magistrates have contracts up to three years.  
<br/>This is totally unacceptable. The Director of Public Prosecutions is a constitutional appointment and 
<br/>under  the  Constitution,  it  is  seven  years.  The  same  tenure  should  apply  to  all  our  Resident 
<br/>Magistrates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we appreciate the presence of foreign Judicial Officers we have capable and competent 
<br/>Fijians  that  can  take  up  these  positions.  We  need  to  look  after  our  people  first.    Overall,  the 
<br/>appointment  of  the  Judiciary  must  be  totally  independent  from  the  Executive  and  remove  the 
<br/>consultation provision with the Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, my party - SODELPA has two key values that guide us: our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Christian faith and the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>.  In 1835, the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and our chiefs accepted and embraced Christianity.  
<br/>We open our Parliament sittings with a Prayer and the first time the Name of Jesus was mentioned 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the late Speaker in her Prayer, it was objected to by the honourable Attorney-General because we 
<br/>are a secular State (that is under the Constitution).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot comprehend how the Christians who supported the FijiFirst Government accepted 
<br/>that.  I guess they fear this Government more than the God of Abraham,  Isaac and Jacob.  I look 
<br/>forward to the days sooner rather than later when the name of Jesus Christ is mentioned again in the 
<br/>Speaker’s Prayer.  Only Christians of this nation can vote a God-fearing Party that will bring back 
<br/>the Name of Jesus in our Parliamentary Prayer and this is what SODELPA stands for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problems of our nation including this deficit budget, it can be resolved 
<br/>when we put Christ first starting first from our homes.  When we remove Christ as the head of our 
<br/>nation, we remove His blessings and His coverings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Vanua</span><span>, the Surfing law legalises access to any surfing area and this includes water sports 
<br/>activities as well from the sea to the rivers and streams right up to the highlands.  It gives absolute 
<br/>vesting of all interest in any surfing area to the Director of Lands. This surfing law was introduced 
<br/>by the Government in 2010, however, their initial support and idea was mooted by Rabuka back in 
<br/>2nd September, 2006 where he said that “all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land and </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> should be nationalised”.  On 
<br/></span><span>the  same  statement  in  2006,  Rabuka  said  “to  remove  the  GCC”  the  same  GCC  that  granted  and 
<br/></span><span>supported him immunity in  his  1987  </span><span>coup,</span><span>  it was  done, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It  seems  that whatever 
<br/>Rabuka says, FijiFirst implements it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reserve my support for this deficit budget as we have not seen whether the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promises made will be implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, there is a famous English proverb, 
<br/>“No job is big  or small,  only  thinking makes it so.”   Through performance of  any  odd job if  one is 
<br/>respectfully able to earn a living, then it should not be considered too small or undignified.  I say this 
<br/>because  it  is  an  insult  to  our  people,  the  seasonal  workers.    I  am  sorry  to  say  this,  but  honourable 
<br/>Waqanika, when you suddenly laughed and said that they went for fruit picking even when Australians 
<br/>are not doing that, I felt that it was an insult to our seasonal workers.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, our guests in the gallery and our fellow Fijians; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka, salaam wale akum,</span><span>
<br/></span><span>namaste</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  humbly  rise to  address this  august Parliament on the  2022-2023 National 
<br/>Budget, announced by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy on Friday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2022.  I applaud the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and his very hardworking 
<br/>team at the Ministry of Economy for once again formulating a Budget that echoes the principles of our 
<br/>Government through fiscal policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last few years have been nothing short of a horror movie which stuns the whole world and 
<br/>the plot just gets coming from living through a pandemic to facing the effects of war, fear and instability 
<br/>affected many countries, and Fiji was no exception.  However, exceptional governance and the gallant 
<br/>leadership of our Government led by our honourable Prime Minister has given every Fijian a sense of 
<br/>security in the most darkest days of uncertainty that loomed over our people and our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our ship has sailed through dangerous waters but we all remained safe from the 
<br/>havoc.  This was merely possible because our captain had only one interest at heart and it was the safety 
<br/>and security of our people, our Fijians.  At this juncture, I whole heartedly thank our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister for his decisive leadership and his vision for all Fijians.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  economic  recovery  and  our  tremendous  economic  comeback  is  all  to  the  foresight,  the 
<br/>confidence and the decisiveness of our leaders and to the patience and belief of our people, our Fijians.  
<br/>With this together, I join the honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Prime Minister in thanking 
<br/>our people for their patience and support.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span> to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation has been allocated a 
<br/>total budget of $147.7 million and we are indeed pleased with this allocation as we continue to serve 
<br/>vulnerable Fijians.  Overall, there is a 6.7 percent increase in the Ministry’s budget from the fiscal year 
<br/>2021-2022.    Operating  budget  for  the  Ministry  has  increased  by  9.1  percent  and  we  wholeheartedly 
<br/>welcome this increase.  The COVID-19 and the current situations around the world continue to impact 
<br/>and shape the future economy and the financial landscape.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, with the budgetary allocation will 
<br/>continue  to  administer  programmes  that  protect  and  serve  the  most  vulnerable  and  contribute  to  the 
<br/>country’s poverty alleviation strategies.  The Ministry’s focus remains, which is to ensure families and 
<br/>communities are supported through  social welfare  programmes,  gender  empowerment initiatives that 
<br/>enabled the protection of children and vulnerable persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the World Bank states, social protection programmes are at the hard work 
<br/></span><span>boosting  human  capital  for  the  worst  most  vulnerable.    They  empower  people  to  be  healthy,  pursue 
<br/>education and seek opportunity to lift themselves and their families out of poverty.  This National Budget 
<br/>reflects compassion and care for every Fijian, especially to the most vulnerable Fijians through the various 
<br/>social protection platform within the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  begin  with,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  under  the  Ministry  is 
<br/>responsible for the administration of Government’s social protection programmes which provide support 
<br/>to vulnerable families, children and persons living with disabilities and our senior citizens.  I thank the 
<br/>budget for the continuation of funding for the following programmes administered by us: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty Benefit Scheme with an allocation of $34 million,  whereby 22,622 households 
<br/>benefit from this assistance with an increase of $1 million, we can now target 2,000 more 
<br/>households in the new fiscal year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Child Protection Allowance with an allocation of $13.7 million which supports over 
<br/>9,000 households with children under 18 years of age with a $2.7 million increase we aim 
<br/>to assist 1,000 more households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food Voucher Programme for Rural Pregnant Mothers with an allocation of $0.8 million, 
<br/>assist nearly 2,000 women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Social Pension Scheme with an allocation of $55 million is the largest social welfare 
<br/>programme budget with 47,461 recipients, this is for honourable Leawere’s information.  
<br/>With an increase of $2 million, we aim to assist 3,000 more elderly persons.  So, a total of 
<br/>over  50,000  Fijians  and  very  shocking  that  Members  of  the  Opposition  consider  these 
<br/>programmes as Freebies when access to social protection in all its form is a basic right for 
<br/>our people.  Do they not want aging with dignity to be a reality?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Disability Scheme with an allocation of $10.7 million, an increase of $0.7 million assist 
<br/>over  10,000  persons  with  disabilities  and  I  would  like  to  thank  honourable  Kepa  for 
<br/>acknowledging the work done by our disability sector in Rewa.  Thank you, honourable 
<br/>Kepa, we provide services not only to Rewa but throughout Fiji without any discrimination.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bus Fare Subsidy Scheme for older persons and Persons living with Disabilities with 
<br/>an allocation of $10 million, currently a total of 51,700 recipients are benefiting from this 
<br/>Scheme and we acknowledge a budgetary increase of $4 million to continue this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an estimated allocation of $124.2 million and accounts for over 90 percent 
<br/>of the Ministry’s total allocated budget.  Our Social Welfare Assistance Allowances in most cases are the 
<br/>main  source  of  income  for  destitute  families  and  individuals  and  the  Fijian  Government  has  paid 
<br/>particular attention to ensuring that this sole source of income was not taken away or reduced for those 
<br/>dependent on it, even when the country suffered the greatest economic blow amidst the crisis, in fact top-
<br/>ups were provided and another has been allocated in this year’s budget to help our most vulnerable Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wholeheartedly welcome the additional payment of $30 a month 
<br/>for the next six months to all existing social welfare recipients, government pensions and aftercare fund 
<br/>recipients.  These recipients will receive a total of $180 over a period of six months, this relief top-up is 
<br/>expected to benefit over 100,000 Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  budget  pragmatically  offers  relief  to  those  who  need  it  the  most.    For 
<br/>instance,  the  Cash  Support  Programme  for  vulnerable  families  under  this  Initiative,  Fijian  families 
<br/></span><span>earning below an annual income of $50,000 will be eligible for cash assistance for up to $30 per month 
<br/></span><span>per child in each family which amounts to $180 over a period of six months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the official opponents from the other side of Parliament continue to disregard 
<br/>and condemn every effort by the FijiFirst Government to assist ordinary Fijians.  They call it handouts, 
<br/>they call it freebies and breeding a culture of dependency, et cetera.  All I have to say to my fellow Fijians 
<br/>is beware, it will be all snatched away.  God forbid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the impact of child abuse and neglect can be profound. Research shows that 
<br/>child abuse and neglect is often associated with adverse health and mental health outcomes of children 
<br/>and those negative effects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the honourable Assistant Minister is creating fear, lying 
<br/>and they do it outside of Parliament, they do it inside of Parliament.  They go out there and say, “Oh, the 
<br/>next government comes in and take away your social welfare,” that is what she is saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  Point  of  Order  is  that,  she  is  misleading  Parliament  and 
<br/>misleading the people of this country.  That is the fear, they go and talk in the community, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- You are a joke! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are lying! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Honourable Member, you have the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The impact of child abuse and neglect 
<br/>can be profound.  Research shows that child abuse and neglect is often associated with adverse health 
<br/>and mental health outcomes in children and those negative effects can last a lifetime.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1657 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the impact on child, child abuse and neglect also has profound, broad implications 
<br/>on communities.  Our children are the foundation and the future of this country and the Fijian Government 
<br/>has made commitments at local and international levels to ensure that Fiji is able to prioritise the safety 
<br/>and  protection  of  our  children.    In  recognising  the  Fijian  Government’s  strong  commitment  to  child 
<br/>protection, the Ministry has been mandated by various legislations to uphold the rights of Fijian children.  
<br/>Our aim to these mandates are recognising the importance of the ongoing work of the Child Services 
<br/>Unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Department of Social Welfare, the Ministry has been allocated $100,000 to start the 
<br/>process  in  establishing  the  Department  of  Children.    This  Department  will  be  specialised  to  deliver 
<br/>services that are in line with legislative commitments and will indeed strengthen child protection and 
<br/>child welfare service across the country.  Additionally, the Ministry has been allocated $100,000 towards 
<br/>the refurbishment works required for the Fiji Juvenile Rehabilitation and Development Centre, showing 
<br/>Government’s commitment to invest in our youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry strongly believes in close working partnerships with organisations 
<br/>whose activities and output support the Ministry’s strategic objectives and those who provide services in 
<br/>the area of child protection and child safeguarding, older persons, persons with disability, gender equality, 
<br/></span><span>women  empowerment  and  ending  violence  against  women  and  girls  and  in  recognising  the  need  to 
<br/></span><span>strengthen existing partnerships and to build on a new partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government has provided the Ministry with $588,000 for the Fiji National Council for 
<br/>Disabled Persons, $300,000 for grants to organisations for persons with disability, $300,000 for grant to 
<br/>voluntary organisations which is an increase from the previous financial year, as this year the Government 
<br/>has  included  $100,000  to  support  organisations  assisting  vulnerable  women  and  men  that  are 
<br/>psychologically challenged and who find themselves homeless and living on the streets.  We care!  The 
<br/>Government cares!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- This grant will provide shelter and care for this vulnerable group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  $120,000  for  the  National  Council  for  Older  Persons  and  $90,000  as  grants  to 
<br/>organisations for older persons.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we as a State, continue to include our senior citizens 
<br/>in all phases of development.  The Ministry continues to oversee the responsibilities for both existing and 
<br/>potential platforms of enhancing service improvements for older persons in the community settings, as 
<br/>well as those in institutional aged-care settings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s  commitments  to  aged  care  settings  is  strengthened  and  projected  in  local,  regional  and 
<br/>global analysis towards progress on aging within different national context.  It is in this regard that the 
<br/>Ministry has been allocated a new budget activity of $45,000 titled as Aging with Dignity to achieve 
<br/>Government’s mandate of leaving no older person behind.  My humble respect to all our senior citizens 
<br/>of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government through the Department of Women is committed to promoting 
<br/>gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.  Before I highlight the programmes under 
<br/>the Department, I would like to highlight that our efforts in response to gender-based violence has been 
<br/>globally recognised which is the result of a coordinated response and targeted efforts by all stakeholders, 
<br/>including  civil society  partners  and  I  believe  everyone in  Fiji needs to  be proud  of this achievement 
<br/>captured in the UN Tracker Report.  Noting this, the Government will continue to provide budgetary 
<br/>support to ensure that the Department continues to provide an advisory  role  to Government to ensure

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  integration  of  all  women  and  girls’  needs,  interest,  consoles,  contributions  and  prospective  into 
<br/>policies, strategies, programmes and budgets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2022-2023  Budget  reaffirms  this  Government’s  commitment  to  gender 
<br/>equality and the empowerment of women with an allocation of $300,000 for the Department of Women, 
<br/>an increase of 63 percent. I wish honourable Salote Radrodro was here, from the previous fiscal year to 
<br/>implement  its  core  programmes  under  the  Women’s  Plan  of  Action  (WPA).    Under  the  WPA  key 
<br/>thematic areas, the National Women Machinery will be focusing on ending violence against all women 
<br/>and girls, promoting women’s economic empowerment and improving protection from their resilience to 
<br/>climate change and disaster for all women and girls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These priorities and are complemented with four cutting areas including Gender Transformative 
<br/>Institutional  Capacity  Development;  Women  and  Girls  Leadership;  Sexual  Reproductive  Health  and 
<br/>Rights; and Gender Statistics. Major initiatives have secured donor funding for the design, development 
<br/>and implementation and the WPA will support this mainly for the participation of the National Women’s 
<br/>Machinery and coordination advocacy role of the Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An additional $100,000 has been allocated for NGO grants and $400,000 for women institutions 
<br/></span><span>also an allocation of $25,000 to the Fiji Women Federation will see a robust towards strengthening its 
<br/></span><span>role in safeguarding women human rights and interest.  The Barefoot College Construction has been 
<br/>allocated $1.1 million for the continuation and completion of the project. The challenges we face are 
<br/>interconnected and cannot be addressed in isolation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, leadership, collective and coordinated efforts are needed now more than ever to 
<br/>transform structures of inequality and discrimination and put us firmly on a path towards substantive 
<br/>equality  for  all  women  and  girls  in  Fiji.    It  is  a  process  that  requires  partnerships,  transformative 
<br/>approaches, new ways of working and solutions, improve data, sufficient technical resources, effective 
<br/>coordination mechanisms and structures and commitments to foster an enabling policy, and budgetary 
<br/>institutional environment that adequately ensures the rights of women and girls and tackles the barriers 
<br/>they face and meets their particular needs and interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly the Ministry has invested in and leads a whole of Government Initiative such as the 
<br/>Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development (GTICD) along with the Gender Responsive 
<br/>Budget (GRB)  which  are crucial to  ensure delivery  for  all  Fijian  women  and  girls.    I  am  pleased to 
<br/>highlight that  within the  2020-2022  fiscal  years, the  Ministry successfully  rolled  out the  Institutional 
<br/>Capacity Development across nine agencies as pilots, engaging up to 80 Government Officials.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an outcome of Institutional Capacity Development selected programmes from the nine pilot 
<br/>agencies were allocated Gender Responsive Budget to increase the participation and inclusion of women 
<br/>such as $100,000 for Spice Farming Programme, $50,000 for Vanilla Farming Programme, $150,000 for 
<br/>poultry and $300,000 for Women in Agriculture Programmes and Fisheries Food Security Programmes 
<br/>$600,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Women’s Expo has been a signature event for women economic empowerment in 
<br/>Fiji.  This coming fiscal year Government will re-introduce the programme at the divisional level with 
<br/>the aim of recognising women’s talents, skills and moreso valuing authentic art and crafts, and linking 
<br/>women to markets domestically, regionally and globally.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $300,000 has been allocated 
<br/>for this initiative.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, I am pleased to say that with the new Women Economic Empowerment Programme 
<br/>- $100,000, the Ministry will provide grants to women entrepreneurs across the country, specifically those 
<br/>who operate their income-generating activities in the informal sector and single mothers working from 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1659 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>home.  The grant targets women entrepreneurs who have already started their small businesses or are 
<br/>trying to build up, and for those who have already invested their own resources in one way or another 
<br/>and have potential, we will support them to become successful entrepreneurs.  Sir, $1 million has been 
<br/>allocated in Head 50 to assist women entrepreneurs who wish to loan funds from the Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank. The billions will be used as 10 percent equity contribution on the loan component specifically to 
<br/>women entrepreneurs, so I urge all my fellow women to go for it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government strongly believes in accountability and transparency and 
<br/>one of the tools for promoting this strong monitoring and evaluation system.  Just in mind Poverty and 
<br/>Monitoring Unit with allocation of $625,800 to continue to monitor and report on poverty alleviation 
<br/>programmes implemented by respective Government agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore the Unit is tasked to review and develop a five-year integrated National Alleviation 
<br/>Programme Framework.  Additionally the Unit will play an active role in the formulation of a national 
<br/>poverty  advisory  arm  of  Government,  the  National  Coordinating  Body  for  Poverty  Alleviation 
<br/>Programmes  (NCBPAP)  which  emanated  critical  pathways  in  fostering  partnerships  and  addressing 
<br/>poverty  through  an  integrated  and  coordinated  effort.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  also  glad  about  the 
<br/>increment and the allocation to our Rights, Empowerment and Cohesion (REACH) project whereby we 
<br/></span><span>have been allocated $110,000, allowing us to take services of the essential service providers right to the 
<br/></span><span>doors of our people in remote areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since yesterday, I have repeatedly been hearing my colleagues from the other 
<br/>side of Parliament saying that this Budget is an Election Budget.  Basically Mr. Speaker, Sir, they wanted 
<br/>a Budget that provided no support to our ordinary Fijians – did they want that Budget?  Some people are 
<br/>dealing with the soaring cost of living?  Do they want us to discontinue our Social Protection Programs?   
<br/>Do they want us to cut civil service pays?  Maybe instead of opposing our prudent National Budget, the 
<br/>Opposition Members should have put their heads together and come up with an alternative Budget rather 
<br/>than attending dinner parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, we are pleased with this allocation and I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Economy  for  considering  our  needs  and  service  oriented  ministry  assessing  the  most 
<br/>vulnerable groups in Fiji.  We are also very happy with the overall Budget as it has been thoughtfully and 
<br/>compassionately crafted to support the ordinary Fijians in various forms.  The Budget is in line with what 
<br/>that Government believes which is a better Fiji for everyone and ensuring no one is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully support this Budget because this is indeed a people’s Budget.  I thank you. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu </span><span>and God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 5.06 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, </span><span>ni 
<br/>sa bula vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today in this august Parliament to lend my full support to the 2022-2023 
<br/>National Budget. I would like to begin by congratulating the honourable Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>for  Economy  and  his  team  for  safely  steering  our  economy  in  the  last  two  years  under  the  most 
<br/>challenging  of  circumstances.  Despite,  our  worst  economic  crisis  in  history,  driven  by  the  global 
<br/>pandemic and the all-time high global inflation this Government has taken the economy from the depth 
<br/>of its worst crisis to its greatest year ever of record growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately many of the politicians on the other side (I am using the word 
<br/>“politicians”) of this august Chamber have continued to distort facts and reality without offering and 
<br/>alternatives to move the country forward.  In my last Parliament contribution to the Budget debate, I 
<br/>talked about the difference between politicians and true leaders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because true leaders 
<br/>are focused on the good of the people and the future generation, whereas for politicians it is all about 
<br/></span><span>winning the elections.  They must appreciate the fact that our journey towards economic recovery is 
<br/></span><span>progressing  well  as  clearly  manifested  in  this  new  budget.  Through  their  cynical  observation  and 
<br/>comments,  they  missed  the  enormous  evidence  of  progress  amidst  the  smokescreen  of  extremist 
<br/>propaganda and the confinement of short-term perspective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the accomplishment of the FijiFirst Government under the visionary, strong and 
<br/>decisive leadership of Prime Minister Bainimarama will last, despite efforts by his critics and political 
<br/>opponents to extinguish them.  We had promised the people of Fiji during the darkest days of the crisis 
<br/>that  our  economy  would  recover  from  the  pandemic.  It  is  through  Government’s  foresight  and  the 
<br/>decisive leadership by the honourable Prime Minister that we are able to stabilise our economy through 
<br/>this period of economic challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  despite  the  many  uncertainties  grappling  our  global  economies  today, 
<br/>Government couched a compassionate, sensible and disciplined budget that provides the economic and 
<br/>environment to support recovery and stability. This Budget is projecting a future that can safeguard 
<br/>Fiji’s economy despite the circumstances.  However, our collective national efforts to rise above the 
<br/>impacts of the pandemic and the global inflation is continuously being challenged by the increasing 
<br/>misinformation to discredit our genuine efforts to support those in need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  this  Budget,  the  Government  has  rolled  out  some  powerful  and 
<br/>necessary stimulus to support individuals and families suffering from this global inflation.  These 
<br/>includes;  the  removal  of  the  VAT  from  21  essential  items,  inflation  mitigation  package,  which 
<br/>includes payout of about $180 per child in a six-month period; $180 pay out for all pensioners; $180 
<br/>for all tertiary students and a bus fare subsidy of 10 percent across the board.  The Budget before this 
<br/>Chamber is one that helps us all and steers us to recovery and stability.  The Government has yet 
<br/>again put Fiji first in our 2022-2023 National Budget by putting the needs of all Fijians first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution on the Bill before 
<br/>Parliament will be twofold. Speaking briefly on my portfolio responsibility as the Minister for Rural 
<br/>and Maritime Development and Disaster Management and later on as my portfolio responsibility as 
<br/>Minister responsible for Defence, National Security and Policing.  Before I focus on the Budget itself, 
<br/>let me just make a few comments.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1661 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2022-2023  Budget  is  a  good  one  -  a  Budget  for  all  Fijians.    Unfortunately,  partition 
<br/>politics  overtakes  the  greater  good  for  most  honourable  Members  of  the  Opposition.    I  wish  to 
<br/>acknowledge the contribution by honourable Aseri Radrodro and honourable Naulumatua - very well 
<br/>balanced and it is delivered out of sincerity and honesty.  I wish to thank them and acknowledge them 
<br/>for their contribution.  Unfortunately, for the Leader of the National Federation Party, it is his worst 
<br/>budget address in the seven years that I have heard him in this Parliament.  It is the worst address by 
<br/>the honourable Leader of NFP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also concerned about some of the statements in this Parliament and I need to mention 
<br/>this  as  Minister  responsible  for  national  security.    Let  us  not  forget  the  fact  that  one  of  the  most 
<br/>powerful  and  worrying  forces  which  drives  indigenous  ethnonationalism  in  Fiji  is  Christian 
<br/>fundamentalism.    We  need  to  be  reminded  in  this  august  Parliament  because  some  are  seeing 
<br/>themselves as spiritual guardians of indigenous rights.  The </span><span>Bible</span><span> is clear in Mathew 5:16 and I quote: 
<br/>“Let your light shine before men, so that they see your god deeds and glorify your father in heaven.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go onto, it says smokescreen, it is an election budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government 
<br/>has been consistent all these  years.  As  I have stated, we are not  worried about  elections, we are 
<br/>worried about delivering for the people.  Let me give you a few examples.  The Monasavu Dam was 
<br/></span><span>constructed way back in the 1980s.  We have had elections after elections, we have had government 
<br/></span><span>after government, but electricity was not provided to the people of Naitasiri.  Under the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and under the Bainimarama and FijiFirst Government, electricity is now in Naitasiri.  
<br/>We have electricity in upper Namosi, we have electricity in Ba, we have electricity in Ra and we 
<br/>have electricity all over Fiji.  It is not because of elections, but because people deserve it.  They have 
<br/>been overlooked over the years.  They deserve it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Radrodro  mentioned  and  emphasised  on  the  importance  of  infrastructure 
<br/>because this is linked to economic development  and progress, and this is something that we look 
<br/>forward to hear from the honourable Professor.  Unfortunately, he is talking about the two-men rule.   
<br/>Infrastructure is so important.  We tarsealed the Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road, not because of elections, 
<br/>because it is  needed  and it is  important  for the economy and development.  That  is  a  Look North 
<br/>Policy  but  investors  would  not  want  to  go  to  the  North,  they  are  talking  about  investment  in  the 
<br/>private sector but there is lack of infrastructure in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Nadroga, we tarsealed the West Bank because of agriculture that is within the Sigatoka 
<br/>Valley.  There are so many others.  We have built about 63 bridges out of the 53 that were identified 
<br/>during honourable Tikoduadua’s days as Minister for Infrastructure.  We have constructed 63 out of 
<br/>those bridges that have been identified and that will continue.  Yet they talk about the debt, logic and 
<br/>common sense will tell us that we will just do maintenance on the Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road and we 
<br/>will also look at maintaining all the other bridges that we have constructed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is  now  saying  that  there  is  lesser  allocation  for 
<br/>capital expenses, that is logical because we are doing most of the work now.  When you top that and 
<br/>relate that to the debt level, in years to come, there will be less of our commitment into the capital 
<br/>expenses because we are now investing in infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, if we look at previous budgets by previous Governments, when you look at the 
<br/>ratio between capital expenses and operational expenses, it was on 80:20 percent ratio - 80 percent 
<br/>on  operational  expenses  and  20  percent  on  capital  expenses.    We  changed  that  -  60  percent 
<br/>operational  and  40  percent  capital  and  that  is  why  you  will  see  most  of  the  investments  are  now 
<br/>happening throughout Fiji.

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are continuing to build Community Access Roads.  Honourable Rasova, you go now to 
<br/>Kadavu, we are linking Kavala to Vunisea, something that has never been done before.  Now, the 
<br/>road is in Naqalotu and we will take it to Tawava and then to Lomati and link it up from Daviqele.  
<br/>We have cut the road now to the last village in Namosi; Wainilotulevu.  Right now we are linking 
<br/>Ra Province with Naitasiri, cutting the road to Roma.  We are also planning to link the road between 
<br/>Namosi  and  Naitasiri  from  Wainimakutu  to  Nasava.    There  are  plans.    I  do  not  know  whether 
<br/>honourable Saukuru has been visiting rural Fiji and the one next to him as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Where are they getting their information from?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Fiji now is thriving because the Government has invested heavily in infrastructure in 
<br/>the  rural  areas.  When  it  talks  about  decentralisation  of  services,  let  me  highlight  this,  this 
<br/>Government, not driven by elections have constructed a Government station in Kavala in Kadavu.  
<br/>We  have  also  constructed  a  District  Office  station  in  Nasau,  Koro.    We  have  also  constructed  a 
<br/>District  Office  station  in  Qarani,  Gau;  Dada  in  Namosi,  Wainikoro  in  Macuata,  Kubulau  in  Bua, 
<br/>Lekutu in Bua and Namarai in Ra.  You name it!  Not because of elections, that is part of the civil 
<br/>service reform, decentralisation and empowerment of our people because they deserve it.  It is not 
<br/>about  elections  and  that  is  why  the  honourable  Leader  of  NFP  is  so  worried.    He  is  strategically 
<br/>paralysed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is just dusting cobwebs and sleeping with the Leader of People’s Alliance Party but let us 
<br/>kill the spider, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let me tell the honourable Leader of NFP, the people know the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister. The people know the honourable Leader of SODELPA, they also know 
<br/>the honourable Leader of NFP, we do not have to talk a lot to them because our deeds and actions 
<br/>speak for itself and have proven record as well.  I can go on with a list but let me go to my Ministries 
<br/>very quickly and then I will come back to some of the issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Rural  Development  and  Disaster  Management,  this  Budget  supports  Government’s 
<br/>aspirations to build stronger and more vibrant rural and maritime communities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>they keep quoting about the HIES Report.  I, for one, follow rural development very closely and am 
<br/>surprised but not surprised because things have changed but it is because of the return in investment 
<br/>that  Government  has  done  over  the  years.    Honourable  Waqanika  probably  talked  about  the  29 
<br/>percent reduction to 21 percent poverty.  Did she realise what the incidence of poverty in Fiji was 
<br/>few years back?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was Commissioner Northern, incidence of poverty in Vanua Levu was 53 percent.  In 
<br/>that HIES Report that they are quoting, Mr. Speaker, what is surprising compared to the previous 
<br/>report,  I  know  this  very  well,  before  the  2019-2020,  rural  poverty  increased  except  Vanua  Levu, 
<br/>urban  poverty  decreased.    In  this  recent  HIES  Report,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  urban  poverty  in  all  the 
<br/>regions (east, west, central and north), they all decreased.  That is because of the level of investment, 
<br/>not because of politics, not because of elections but the people deserve it and we will reap the rewards 
<br/>in years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Government through this Budget has allocated $15 million to FRA towards connecting 
<br/>our rural inaccessible communities to economic centres and key public services.  It is encouraging to 
<br/>note that funding has been set aside to upgrade the Lagi to Tawake Village Road and to construct a 
<br/>new road from Tawake to Wainika near Udu Point in Vanua Levu.  I wish to remind the honourable 
<br/>Navurelevu as well that we have already started the road to Valovoni that he has been telling us.  We 
<br/>are also, for your information, considering cutting a road from Naiyarabale to Valovoni which is a 
<br/>better option rather than going through Nasasa in Macuata.  So, it is all in place, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1663 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to lend my support and appreciation on the plan to commence a pre-feasibility study 
<br/>in the construction of Viti Levu Cross Country Highway, as of course supported by the honourable 
<br/>Radrodro as well.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the Government as well for the provision of 
<br/>$19.3  million  to  EFL  towards  the  rural  grid  extension  and  housing  wiring  works.  Of  course,  the 
<br/>honourable Minister has talked about the solar systems.  Let me also say that this Budget funding 
<br/>will provide $4.9 million, allocated for rural water supply.  I was in Sawa Village, Tailevu last week 
<br/>and next week, the Minister will also be travelling to Nasaibitu in Wainibuka.  These are some of the 
<br/>projects that will improve rural water and rural sanitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Government Shipping Services (GSS), the allocation of $3.4 million which will subsidise 
<br/>and continue to cushion the impacts of rising fuel costs and ensure business continuity for vessel 
<br/>operators  that  service  the  uneconomical  routes  under  the  franchise  scheme.    The  honourable 
<br/>Naulumatua  talked  about  digital  infrastructure  in  Fiji  and  I  wish  to  commend  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy  again  for  allocating  funds  for  the  construction  of  the  240  unconnected  and  poorly 
<br/>connected areas.  The proposal for the financial year is to construct the first 15 towers to connect at 
<br/>least  96  out  of  the  unconnected  or  poorly  connected  areas  which  will  be  a  big  boost  to  the  rural 
<br/>economies in connecting Fijians locally and abroad.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to ensure that the rate 
<br/>of return on Government investment in rural infrastructure is realised, the Government through this 
<br/></span><span>Budget  will  continue  to  invest  in  the  agriculture  sector  through  the  farm  mechanisation  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Minister has already talked about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go to the Ministry of Defence very quickly.  I wish to focus my address on the Ministry 
<br/>of Defence, National Security and Policing.  The Ministry provides leadership over Fiji’s national 
<br/>security  efforts  through  the  formulation  and  effective  implementation  of  policies,  legislations, 
<br/>programmes  and initiatives related to  maintaining  and enhancing  Fiji’s security and defence, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, the strategic threat environment through comprehensive 
<br/>analysis by Regional Defence Coordinating Groups has been viewed to evolve rapidly and intensify 
<br/>the complex regional security dynamics.  The diverse threats faced in the region inclusively captures 
<br/>both traditional and non-traditional security threats which position the region to be more vulnerable 
<br/>and susceptible to both traditional and non-traditional security threats, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to again acknowledge the allocation given to the Ministry which, in fact, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, increased by 3.23 percent with the total allocation of $14.9 million and I am also thankful because 
<br/>as the honourable Minister responsible for Veteran Affairs, I do acknowledge the allocation of $12.4 
<br/>million to the After Care Fund Office.  Again, this is not about Elections, honourable Members, but 
<br/>this is the Government that remembered our veterans who went to Christmas Islands. Government 
<br/>after  Government,  Elections  after  Elections,  no  one  addressed  that  issue.    This  is  the  same 
<br/>Government that increased the allocation to the </span><span>turaga-ni-koro</span><span> and the </span><span>mata-ni-tikina</span><span>, the advisory 
<br/>councillors, village nurses and of course increased the allowance for our peacekeeping troops.  That 
<br/>is what this Government is doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Republic of Fiji Military Forces, there has been some comments on it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Again, they deserve the increase, particularly for the $5 million increase in the Operating Budget and 
<br/>the $1.9 million increase in Capital Budget, resulting in the increase of $0.2 million.  Of course, again 
<br/>the allocation that has been given for their capital works and most importantly, to subsidise the pay 
<br/>rates as from 2013 involving lodging allowance and service allowance, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not go into the details but I do acknowledge the work of the Commissioner of Police in 
<br/>his restructure as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that will see that the police reform will continue and 
<br/>that will mean better security for our people.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  I  do  support  the  2022-2023  National  Budget,  a  budget  for  the  people  by  a 
<br/>Government that cares for all Fijians, and I have no hesitation and, again, reiterate my support for 
<br/>the 2022-2023 Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.W.  VOSANIBOLA.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  members  of  the 
<br/>public sitting in the gallery and to all Fijians watching and listening within the comfort of their homes;  
<br/>I rise to respond to the motion before the House and thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to 
<br/>do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, the 2022-2023 Budget which was delivered on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July carries a backdrop of 
<br/>increasing  global  commodity  prices  which  include  foods  and  oil,  the  supply  chain  disruption 
<br/>emanating from the Russian-Ukraine War and continuous increase in debt which results in high cost 
<br/>of living in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has survived and moved on from the COVID-19 pandemic which forced 
<br/>the  closure  of  international  borders,  resulting  in  two  years  of  stagnation  and  negative  growth 
<br/>experienced not only in Fiji but throughout the world.  Fiji’s COVID-19 cases recently increased to 
<br/></span><span>67,191and  deaths  reached  870.    Sir,  over  125,000  people  lost  their  jobs  and  mainly  those  in  the 
<br/></span><span>tourism  sector.    Some  have  returned  to  work  while  others  are  still  in  the  process  of  securing  an 
<br/>employment.  The honourable Minister for Economy claims that this is the Budget for the welfare 
<br/>of all the people of Fiji but let us bear in mind that this Budget was delivered on a General Elections 
<br/>year and it is out to buy votes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji are not so naïve and cannot be fooled anymore as they 
<br/>know the truth about the state of affairs of our country.  Although we have gone through three waves 
<br/>of COVID-19 with  different  intensities, we have to  live with  the pandemic and must  continue to 
<br/>make necessary adjustments to live with the new norm.  Again, we are now facing an uncertain future 
<br/>because of the crisis in Europe which has led to the increase in price of petroleum products and supply 
<br/>chains for goods and services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the latest economic review released in June suggests a growth forecast.  In 
<br/>the 2022-2023 Budget, it has been revised from 11 percent to 12.4 percent, despite the fact that global 
<br/>trends have been revised downward from 4.1 percent to 2.9 percent in 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the honourable Minister for Economy’s address, he declared very proudly that the “Bula 
<br/>Boom” is back, but we should keep in mind that the forecast is being derived from a lower economic 
<br/>base.  Therefore, it is misleading that we will experience a Bula Boom as we are still on the journey 
<br/>towards economic and social recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, necessary structural adjustments need to be made to 
<br/>ensure the survival of our nation, particularly important is the need to be very innovative and develop 
<br/>better measures and implement relevant and practical policies to cushion and address the challenges 
<br/>facing our small vulnerable homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is one of the most developed island nations in the Pacific region, still 
<br/>more than 31 percent of the population lives under poverty and the country is heavily dependent on 
<br/>foreign aid and remittances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget, as alluded to by the honourable Minister for Economy is being 
<br/>termed  as  prudent,  responsible,  visionary  and  focussed  on  economic  recovery  and  reducing  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>impact of inflation affecting the people of Fiji and also this will be the last National Budget developed 
<br/>by the Government prior to the General Elections late this year or even early January next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bainimarama Government having power for the last 16 years and yet 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  continues  to  blame  previous  Governments  or  other 
<br/>extraordinary events such as pandemic or natural disaster for Government’s failure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is so much on boasting and claim about the boom or the unprecedented 
<br/>growth, therefore, may I remind the honourable Members of Parliament of a Bible verse from the 
<br/>Book of Jeremiah Chapter 9:23-24 and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The Lord says, do not boast about your wisdom or strength or wealth, if you feel 
<br/>you must boast, then have enough sense to boast about worshipping me, the Lord.  What I 
<br/>like best is showing kindness, justice and mercy to everyone on earth.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the proposed 2022-2023 National Budget, total expenditure is $3.8 billion, 
<br/>estimated revenue will be at $2.9 billion.  The net deficit of $872 million which is 7.4 percent of GDP.  
<br/>This Budget is too ambitious.  The honourable Minister for Economy knows very well that our current 
<br/></span><span>pace for recovery will be much lower than anticipated due to the uncertainty in the global trading 
<br/></span><span>environment.  Sir, it goes to show that the real intention of such convincing presentation is to make 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government look good in the public domain as we move towards General Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, taking into account the shortfall of $872million to the debt repayment of 
<br/>$307million and with the rising national debt at almost $9.97 million or 85.2 percent of GDP and the 
<br/>inflation rate just sitting over 5 percent.  Therefore, the true impact of this Budget would be known 
<br/>in the next 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a rule of thumb on debt benchmark in developed countries, a debt of GDP 
<br/>ratio is  around 60 percent  and developing countries such as  Fiji, the debt  of GDP  ratio  would be 
<br/>around 40 percent.  Nevertheless, our current debt GDP ratio is 85 percent.  Therefore, national debt 
<br/>affects everyone and the risks associated with unsustainable debt.  Sir, it is unfortunate that today, we 
<br/>do not have that fiscal space to be able to manoeuvre but the only option available for us is to continue 
<br/>borrowing when our debt is already unsustainable at over 85.2 percent of our annual GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Economy talks about the benefit of concessionary loans and 
<br/>interest free loans but not on the risk associated with. Therefore, as national debt per capita increases, 
<br/>there is a strong possibility of default.  Therefore, finance have to raise the yield of newly issued 
<br/>treasury  securities  to  attract  new  investors.      Increase  in  debt  reduces  the  amount  of  tax  revenue 
<br/>available  to  be  spent  on  other  Government  services  and  the  priority  on  Government  revenue  is 
<br/>payment of principal and interest of debt. This means that we should be experiencing a lower standard 
<br/>and high cost of living.  Once the rate of treasury security increases, investors will increase their 
<br/>purchase of these new securities, therefore, they have to raise the price of their goods and services to 
<br/>meet the increased cost of their debt service obligation. Over time, this will cause people to pay more 
<br/>for good and services resulting in inflation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unprecedented ever-increasing growth by the FijiFirst Government is 
<br/>debt and it is the hallmark of their regime and its leadership and the impact will severely affect our 
<br/>children and our grandchildren in years to come.  Sir, economic recovery, as stated in the Budget 
<br/>Address,  should work on the failures in  our economy  and  centred  around the restructuring of the 
<br/>economy  to  make  it  more  resilient  to  feature  global  shocks  or  natural  disaster  and  to  generate 
<br/>meaningful growth that creates wealth for all.  Fiji is now ever relying on foreign tourists, foreign 
<br/>investment and foreign currency. This has made the economy defenceless against global shocks.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in a desperate state whereby the cost of living is high and poverty is 
<br/>on the rise, graduates cannot get jobs, decent and affordable housing is scarce, health is declining, 
<br/>personal debt levels are unprecedented and  crime escalated. Therefore, the Government attempt at 
<br/>import  consumption  and  inflation-based  economic  growth  has  benefitted  the  wealthy  while  the 
<br/>majority has suffered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need for a balance between global integration and a level of self-
<br/>reliance through local production and local finance.  Sir, diversification and building buffers should 
<br/>be  the  buzz  words  these  days.  All  these  have  failed  to  acknowledge  the  potential  comparative 
<br/>advantages in other sectors such as fisheries, forestry, mining, agriculture and others. We need to be 
<br/>more serious on developing these economic sectors and during the recovery period it is an opportune 
<br/>time to recalibrate the development agenda and work towards the sectors to bring about stability and 
<br/>sustainability economically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget basically shows the Government is in a tight fiscal space and the 
<br/>debt  burden  has  continued  to  rise.  Sir,  one  of  the  key  takeaways  in  this  budget  is  the  inflation 
<br/>mitigation initiative that is for Fijian families with a combined annual income of $50,000 or less to 
<br/>be provided with $180 per child over the next six months and also the 10 percent subsidy in bus fares 
<br/></span><span>during the same period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I wish to highlight the timing of the two initiatives gels well with our preparation towards 
<br/>the  General  Elections.    As  the  Shadow  Minister  for  Lands  and  Mineral  resources,  the  Ministry 
<br/>responsible for the effective and efficient administration, development and management of all State 
<br/>land initiatives including the facilitation of country’s mineral sector and ground water resources. The 
<br/>Ministry of Land administers a total of 18,000 State land leases covering about 4 percent of the total 
<br/>land mass.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the budgetary allocation for the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources for 2022-2023 
<br/>is  $25.8  million  which  is  an  increase  of  $0.6  million  from  the  2021-2022  allocation  of  which 
<br/>Operating  amounts  to  $20.1  million  and  Capital  $4.5  million  with  VAT  at  $1.09  million.  The 
<br/>summary of the total expenditure by the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources from the years 2013 
<br/>to 2022 are as follows: Estimate amounts to $207 million, the actual amounts to $230.2 million and the 
<br/>variance amounting to $57.4 million.  The figures show substantial variation annually.  Thus, may be it 
<br/>is an underutilised situation and being termed by the Government as savings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I request, when funds are allocated, Ministries are expected to utilise those funds 
<br/>in accordance to the operations and capital allocation of the approved ministerial budget.  This situation 
<br/>occurs every year and perhaps, over-budgeting annually or even non-implementation of capital works as 
<br/>outlined in the approved budget warrants an explanation as it also occurs in most Government Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, nothing is more important than land.  Land is the full cream around in which Fiji evolves.   
<br/>Majority of Fijians rely on land for their livelihood and it is a source of indigenous power, culture and 
<br/>identity.  Some key critical issues on land in Fiji include; vast amount of land in Fiji currently lying idle 
<br/>or are greatly under-utilised and a major national challenge is not only to increase the supply of land 
<br/>under  acceptable  leasing  arrangements  for  agricultural,  commercial  or  social  purposes,  but  also  to 
<br/>transform the capital inherent on land that can be used either to develop the land or as collateral in the 
<br/>financial market or for other economic and social purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the budgetary commitment on operating and capital in this Budget for the 
<br/>Ministry, I hope it will also take into account some of the challenges and issues highlighted in the 2018-
<br/>2019 Annual Report and the Ministry’s costed operational plan which have not been addressed, which 
<br/>could be implemented in this financial year.  It is also noted that the latest Annual Report produced by

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry for the year 2018-2019, questions the Minister’s adherence and compliance to the Financial 
<br/>Management Act of 2004, section 45(2), of which the Minister must table in Parliament the annual report 
<br/>for the financial year within nine months after the end of that year or within a longer period approved for 
<br/>that year by resolution of House of Representatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are nearing towards our fourth year in Parliament, I wish to acknowledge 
<br/>and thank the Government for taking action to some of the issues for the Lomaiviti Province which I 
<br/>raised in this august Parliament.  It includes,  electricity and generators repair and maintenance in the 
<br/>villages; construction of sea walls and coastline rock barriers to prevent coastline erosion and sea water 
<br/>intrusion  into  the  villages  of  Natokalau,  Tokou,  Vuma,  Toki  and  Vatukalo  on  Ovalau  Island;  road 
<br/>upgrading in Ovalau and Koro Islands, water supply; river crossings, and solar power projects on Gau 
<br/>Island.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I also remind the Government on the implementation and completion of 
<br/>some of the ongoing and other projects which includes the construction of the Levuka Town Market, 
<br/>reconstruction of damaged Levuka Wharf, completion works on the Moturiki Island water supply project 
<br/>and  also  the  solar  farm  project  at  the  Bureta  District  and  the  construction  of  the  communication 
<br/>connectivity towers to the identified areas in the Lomaiviti Province, as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Economy in his Budget Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are now be able to have a better feel of the FijiFirst Budget in 
<br/>the last couple of years and it is anticipated that if they continue to govern this country, they will continue 
<br/>to have grandstanding and bullish budgeting, revenue overstated and under-utilisation of expenditure.  
<br/>There is always a short fall in revenue, increase in deficit and increase in our debt level.  This is an election 
<br/>budget in the guise of inflationary mitigation measures which may lead to increase in debt and last but 
<br/>not the least, it is time for a change and Fiji needs a new Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  VEGNATHAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; before I specifically 
<br/>respond on the Budget, I wish to take this opportunity to salute and commend the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy and his team for coming up with a prolific and prudent 2022-2023 National Budget, which 
<br/>has already been commended by the Fijians, as they see the real benefit every Fijian can get from this 
<br/>budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted the health, 
<br/>economic and social status of Fijians. Several aspects of life were adversely impacted, though evidence 
<br/>shows resilience and we should congratulate ourselves as a country.  After two years of struggling with 
<br/>the pandemic and as just as we were getting back on our feet, the Ukraine and Russia conflict struck 
<br/>another devastating blow to the world and Fiji is no exception. The rising fuel prices as a result has caused 
<br/>hike in price of imported goods and services worldwide. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving the  quality  of life of  Fijians is central to our  growth  strategy.  A 
<br/>healthy  population  and  skilled  workforce  is  a  fundamental  requirement  for  socio-economic 
<br/>transformation.  Key  interventions  in  education,  health,  water  and  sanitation  are  necessary  to  ensure 
<br/>effective human capital development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the economic growth strategy and budget priorities that have been presented  in 
<br/>the 2022-2023 National Budget seeks to speed up economic recovery and drive more inclusive growth 
<br/>by creating an environment for increased socio-economic empowerment of the ordinary Fijians.  I am 
<br/>very  blessed  to  be  part  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  which  puts  Fijians  first  when  it  comes  to  the 
<br/>fundamental services and support that a Government needs to provide for its citizens.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, who would have thought that Fiji would be on a convincing recovery economic 
<br/>path, especially after what we experienced in the last two years.  However, let me inform you, Sir, THAT 
<br/>we, from this side of the House, are confident that life is getting better as people return to work, schools 
<br/>reopened and tourists are coming back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Time  and  again,  the  FijiFirst  Government  under  the  decisive  and  prudent  leadership  of  our 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  has  steadily  got  things  back  towards  normalcy  –  be  it  after  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, floods or devastating cyclones. We work hard, think outside the box and listen to our fellow 
<br/>Fijians to provide practical and long term solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Budget  is  one  classical  example  of  this.  The  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy with his team came up with a budget which many, especially on the other side, would not have 
<br/>even thought of, a budget which provides timely assistance and relief as we face inflation with food and 
<br/>fuel prices soaring all-time high.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Minister for Economy derived this Budget by consulting people and organizations around 
<br/>the  nation.  This  Budget  was  not  done  by  sitting  in  his  office.  I  thank  the  honouurable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy for reflecting the Fijians’ views and solutions for issues in the 2022-2023 National Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me now to briefly touch on the Ministry of Sugar, which has been 
<br/>working closely with its stakeholders to improve productivity and efficiency both at the farm level and at 
<br/>the mills.  In the next financial year, the Ministry has been allocated $45.3 million.  This also ensures the 
<br/>guaranteed price of $85.00 per tonne, though many critics thought that we would not be able to maintain 
<br/>this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has continued to provide high levels of support to cane 
<br/>growers than any other government at any point in time in Fijian history.  When the going has been tough 
<br/>for cane growers, the FijiFirst Government has extended its firm hand of support.  Post-pandemic, the 
<br/>price  of  fertilizer  almost  doubled.    Russia’s  invasion  of  Ukraine  has  since  exacerbated  the  situation.  
<br/>International sanctions on Belarus which is a supplier of GMOP fertilizer, muriate of potash and the 
<br/>fertilizer export restrictions imposed by China, the largest exporter of di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) 
<br/>fertiliser have both substantially increased prices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  South  Pacific  Fertilizer  Limited  is  procuring  fertilizer  materials  from 
<br/>alternative markets at a cost that has increased by two to three folds.  For this reason, the Government has 
<br/>again allocated $25 million in the budget to ensure that our growers continue to pay $20 per every 50 kg 
<br/>bag Blend A, B and C fertilizer, they procure.  Had this Government not increased the allocation of budget 
<br/>by  more  than  $10  million  for  fertilizer,  it  would  have  impacted  the  pockets  of  hardworking  farmers 
<br/>drastically.  In addition to this, Government will continue to provide assistance for the planting of cane, 
<br/>upgrading of roads, meet cartage cost from Penang to Rarawai Mill and provides subsidy for weedicides.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I can clearly recall the loud noise made by the Opposition about the closure of 
<br/>Penang Mill and that farmers will exit the industry in no time.  The reality is before us, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Allow me to inform this august Parliament that production in Penang Mill area was 118,231 tonnes in 
<br/>2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Still a bad idea.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  VEGNATHAN.-  It  increased  to  239,939  tonnes  in  2018  and  further  increased  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>152,984 tonnes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is not working, honourable Prasad.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1669 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- In 2020, it was slightly decreased to 133,683 tonnes due to impact of 
<br/></span><span>TC Yasa. </span><span> This year, again, it is anticipated that the production of Penang Mill area would be around 
<br/>150,000 tonnes.  That is a remarkable achievement.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the results speak for itself.  The 
<br/>strategic decision was the correct one and is the correct one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is the only one in history to introduce a guaranteed sugar price 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of $85 per tonne, irrespective of the world market price.  No other government has done anything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- You never did anything to the farmers, why you want to complain? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN This has given security and certainty to farmers …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- … by supporting the bottom-line.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Not a lie.  It is a fact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  G.  VEGNATHAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  is  also  working  with  other 
<br/>counterparts to ensure that the export of sugar to foreign destinations attract low or zero-rated duties to 
<br/>give Fiji a competitive advantage over other sugar exporting countries.  The recent price review of sugar 
<br/>in the domestic market conducted by the FCCC has further consolidated the pricing for farmers.  These 
<br/>together with world market price ensures FSC gets the right price for its product and generates revenue.  
<br/>As a result, it will require far less Government contribution from $46.9 million to $8 million towards the 
<br/>guaranteed price and channel funds into targeted investments to increase crop yield. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has plans in place to continue initiatives to ensure our farmers benefit and the sugar 
<br/>industry continues to grow despite challenges which are at times beyond our control.  Sir, the amount 
<br/>allocated in the next financial year will also enable the Ministry to continue with the subsidy programme 
<br/>for  fertiliser  and  weedicide,  including  cane  cartage  support  to  farmers  planting  sugarcane  around 
<br/>Rakiraki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased funding support of $1.13 million to Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) will 
<br/>promote quality in planting, improve research and development and technology transfer.  This increase 
<br/>in Budget will enable SRIF to meets its basic requirements to carry out research in extension activities, 
<br/>classified in five broad categories which are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of high yielding cane varieties that are cultivated by canegrowers beside other 
<br/>cultivation management practices; 
<br/>analytical services; 
<br/>soil  and  plant  testing  free  of  cost  to  growers  anywhere  and  advice  on  fertiliser 
<br/>recommendations; 
<br/>field information days for the benefit of growers regularly; and  
<br/>demonstrate the benefits of best management practices for achieving high cane yield. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of our technology transfer programme, SRIF conducted demonstration trials and training 
<br/>programmes on various aspects of sugarcane farming for extension personnel which is also benefitting 
<br/>growers in all 38 sectors across the cane belt.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, SRIF regularly monitors sugarcane fields 
<br/>for pests and diseases and helps in the control measures and also helps FSC in providing seed cane to the 
<br/>growers.  Apart from this, the Ministry will also improve road infrastructure through cane access roads

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to provide access to farmers, where more than 3,800 kilometres of road are upgraded annually free of 
<br/>cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji being the Chair of the International Sugar Organisation (ISO) will host the 
<br/>60</span><span>th</span><span> Council Meeting this year, providing an appropriate platform for capacity building and showcasing 
<br/>what  we  have.    It  will  also  contribute  to  our  hospitality  sector.  Through  Government’s  innovative 
<br/>strategies and timely interventions, the sugar industry has been benefitting from this 2022-2023 National 
<br/>Budget.  Iit will further support and complement its pathway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, I am calling on the farmers to take advantage of the 
<br/>support offered by the Government in continuing their hard work.  I am also urging farmers to be wary 
<br/>of the Opposition who are misinforming them about the Budget as their political gimmick. They were 
<br/>not around in 2018, 2019 and 2020 but they are slowly creeping in and misleading our farmers and people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to sum up great strides have been achieved on both the economic and social 
<br/>front. This progress is a route of sustained effort by the Government to remove barriers to production and 
<br/>human  capital  development,  as  well  as  peace  and  security.  We  have  provided  a  solid  basis  for  the 
<br/>economy to grow, despite the setbacks we all know.  The associate transformation in Fiji is unstoppable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  said  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  strongly  support  the  2022-2023  National  Budget  as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announced by the honourable Minister for Economy on 15</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution to the 2022–2023 
<br/>Appropriation Bill 2022  which is before the House.   First, I would like acknowledge the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament for their contributions on the Bill so far, also those at the Ministry of Economy 
<br/>for compiling the Budget Estimates and the Budget, as well as the people who had participated in the 
<br/>Budget consultations around the country.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  background  of  this  Budget  is  very  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  understand  that  all 
<br/>economies in the world are on a recovery path post-COVID-19 and now have to deal with the global hike 
<br/>of food and fuel prices due to global supply disruptions and the impact of the Russian-Ukraine war.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The world over is affected by the global inflation and affected the economic growth at recovery 
<br/>stage to move beyond the pandemic.  No doubt the Fijian economy has contracted in the last two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our national response, the last two Budgets has seen policies directed to assist our economic 
<br/>recovery path post-COVID-19.  I had supported the last two Budgets because I saw it as a patriotic stance 
<br/>to unite as leaders in a crisis and to see how to recover from it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our economic recovery path as we are on right now, I would like to take this opportunity to 
<br/>acknowledge  my  fellow  Opposition  MP,  honourable  Mere  Naulumatua,  for  her  contributions  this 
<br/>morning on the positive outlook of some benefits of the Budget from her perspective as a businesswoman 
<br/>and also my fellow colleague, honourable Aseri Radrodro, in his deliberation this morning for a much 
<br/>balanced contribution in terms of infrastructure development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You might recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I was the only Opposition Member voicing my support 
<br/>for the Fiji Airways Guarantee motion last March and was subject to public criticism as to why keep our 
<br/>national carrier when our borders were closed.  My reasons then were very simple, that we needed to 
<br/>keep our planes to help us in our economic recovery process.  Now, the tourism sector has recorded 205 
<br/>plus thousand tourist arrivals since the borders opened.  I think that was a bold decision that we made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1671 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tourism industry has played a vital role in the projected economic recovery for 2022 which will be 
<br/>almost 12.4 percent.  We have made a great rebound as a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support the recovery and enhance prospects for diversification, continued emphasis on macro 
<br/>structural reforms was needed.  As you will recall, I had participated in a Parliament Standing Committee 
<br/>public  consultations  to  pass  amendments  to  the  Investment  Act  2022,  to  enable  a  more  investment 
<br/>confidence  environment  with  Investment  Fiji  which  is  tasked  to  promote  Fiji’s  competitive  and 
<br/>comparative advantages.  This was part of the IMF 2021 Article IV Mission to Fiji recommendation, 
<br/>which was taken on board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amendment  to  the  Investment  Act  was  aimed  at  supporting  the  recovery  and  enhance 
<br/>prospects for diversification, especially the National Budget focus on agro-tourism, medical tourism and 
<br/>also now, the introduction of the hemp industry through the amendments to the Act, to allow value adding 
<br/>purposes in the textile industry in this industry, where seeds will be coming from Canada.  We thank the 
<br/>recent ANZ CEO’s announcement to assist in the vertical partnership, to assist local business ventures 
<br/>into the lucrative market.  This will also greatly assist landowners who will offer their land to be leased 
<br/>and be also part of the farming cluster as part of the suppliers of raw materials for the manufacturers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On support measures, what one needs to see in the Budget is the availability of strong  policy 
<br/></span><span>responses  that  support  measures  post-pandemic,  to  enable  economic  activities  to  accelerate.    In  that 
<br/>regard, I would like to acknowledge the lifting of the </span><span>beche-de-mer </span><span>ban or </span><span>sasalu</span><span> for the province of 
<br/>Macuata, Bua and Cakaudrove.  The ban has directly affected many in the past few weeks, especially in 
<br/>the buying of their household items and also the economy in the Northern Division.  I also acknowledge 
<br/>those investors in the North who have provided the market to our local people selling </span><span>sasalu</span><span> in Vanua 
<br/>Levu, especially Mr. Richard Du. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the other measures in place in any budget to show our post-COVID-19 response included 
<br/>the social welfare support and water and electricity subsidies which are very important.  A very important 
<br/>one too from the Budget last year was that, it allowed the removal of consent that was through iTLTB 
<br/>and the fees that allowed many who are not on legal title to access electricity.  This is very important for 
<br/>the alleviation of poverty in our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, have access to GPs and Medical Practitioners, no fees for market vendors stall which is 
<br/>something  that  has  really  assisted,  no  inshore  fishing  fees  and  PSV  driver’s  licence  and  10  percent 
<br/>reduction in bus fare which has really helped and will help assist the removal of poverty at the grassroots 
<br/>level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, there is the education assistance and also the allocation of $60 million to mitigate 
<br/>the effects of rising inflationary pressures on household disposable incomes.  Parents with a combined 
<br/>annual income of less than $50,000 will receive a payment of $180 per child over the next six months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  there  is  the  removal  of  VAT  on  21  household  items  and  the  removal  of  police 
<br/>clearance  fees  to  assist  people  find  employment.  Those  who  are  going  overseas  through  the  Pacific 
<br/>Labour  Scheme  are  also  assisted  through  that.  In  return,  through  our  Vuvale  Partnership,  they  have 
<br/>remitted money back to their families in Fiji and that has also assisted in the collection of revenue for our 
<br/>country.  I think this has empowered many in the rural communities who are going in groups through this 
<br/>labour scheme to assist community projects in their various villages and also improving livelihood in our 
<br/>villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The open ranking taxi system is something that has really helped those in the rural community 
<br/>and out-based drivers have more income to take home to their families.  Also the 300 percent tax reduction 
<br/>for hoteliers in hiring singers and </span><span>meke</span><span> groups will benefit our villagers and also other groups in the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities who are into this.  So those are the many opportunities available through the Budget that 
<br/>will assist our people in bringing more money to their household income and also put more food on the 
<br/>table.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the current financial status that we have, overall Fiji’s macroeconomic fundamentals 
<br/>are strong. Our financial sector is strong and our foreign reserves is currently sitting at $3.6 billion as at 
<br/>July this year. This has assisted in the stability of our liquidity levels and our banks in maintaining a low 
<br/>interest rate environment.  This has assisted many businesses and individuals in their loan repayment 
<br/>plans, plus new lending.  I think this is very important where Government has loaned to keep liquidity 
<br/>levels low for our loan interest rate which has allowed many Fijians with their business and also other 
<br/>individuals.  If you just go into the bank, you will see a big line at the loans section for those who are 
<br/>going for soft loans and other loans, given that the rates and our liquidity levels are being maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I move on to land development and how the budget targets land development. The budget will 
<br/>also cater for landowners in supporting development in terms of home or land buying, and opening up 
<br/>investment opportunities as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is great to see the $9 million allocation for the First Home Buyers Grant Programme and 
<br/>$500,000  for  the  First  Land  Grant  Programme.    Not  only  does  it  assist  people  to  own 
<br/>properties for the first time, more importantly it develops </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners in offering 
<br/>their land to be subdivided.  They will earn more money leases for which they venture into 
<br/>other investments and projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Landowners partnership with Housing Authority Fiji and probably just last month a new 
<br/>subdivision in Tutua, Labasa where the Mataqali Navurevure of Nasekula benefitted.  I 
<br/>thank  the  honourable  Attorney-General  for  that  land  breaking  ceremony  and  also 
<br/>development  that  has  created  employment  for  contractors  who  are  involved  in  the 
<br/>development and more investors for landowners. These are some areas in the Budget on 
<br/>how it affects and empowers indigenous landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land development project under the iTaukei Land Development Grant which has allowed 
<br/>the landowners in the Western Division to become developers.  I think this has been an area 
<br/>that has been lying there for a while but it has picked up now where landowners have moved 
<br/>away  from  only  becoming  passive  land  providers  in  receiving  lease  but  also  become 
<br/>developers  and  owning  development  lease.    This  empowers  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  landowners  in 
<br/>improving their economic status and accelerating them into the business sector.  That is 
<br/>something that is very important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, iTLTB awareness programme for landowners to draw plans to develop their 
<br/>land is something that iTLTB is currently doing.  They are moving around to all landowning 
<br/>units for them to draw up plans to develop their land, et cetera, and to identify potentials on 
<br/>their land on what they can do - housing development, quarry and rock extraction, resource 
<br/>development and other investments.  These are some of the programmes that will empower 
<br/>and create more information to our landowners to make economic decisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  on  the  Committee  for  Better  Utilisation  of  Land  (CBUL)  with  an  allocation  of  $6.9 
<br/>million, it really benefits landowners in terms of lease moneys to cater for their traditional obligations 
<br/>like funerals, weddings, church levies, buying of household items and investment.  This initiative 
<br/>from CBUL which many landowning units look forward to whenever payment is coming up, one 
<br/>will  probably  be  coming  soon  and  many  landowners  are  expecting  that,  has  improved  the  living 
<br/>standards of many </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, especially those in villages, in the construction of their homes and their 
<br/>everyday living.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1673 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On land use, the utilisation of land for economic benefits is another positive aspect of the 
<br/>Budget that I will touch on which needs to be given due recognition.  One of the key measures in 
<br/>scrutinising the Budget and I am grateful to be given the opportunity is the benefits through land use, 
<br/>especially  for  rural  farmers,  the  $7  million  for  machinery  outsourcing,  $1.5  million  for  farm 
<br/>mechanisation,  $600,000  for  ginger  farming,  $400,000  for  </span><span>yaqona  </span><span>farming,  $200,000  for  </span><span>dalo 
<br/></span><span>farming and $300,000 for rice farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  also  to  inform  Parliament  that  Vunivutu  Village  in  Macuata  has  formed 
<br/>clusters, moving into rice farming clusters and participating under this grant.  Those are some of the 
<br/>areas  on  how  indigenous  people  and  landowning  units  are  benefiting  through  Government 
<br/>programmes and allocations, wanting to move forward and they are assisted through the assistance 
<br/>that are in the policy lines and allocations in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Livestock projects are in terms of poultry extension, beef extension, piggery extension and 
<br/>goat extension.  Farmers have benefited a lot in the rural areas in terms of seedlings, </span><span>dalo, yaqona</span><span>
<br/>suckers and livestock breed.  The policies are targeting those in the rural areas and villages, especially 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> who have land to move into livestock projects, owning poultries and piggeries which also 
<br/>help  in  their  various  traditional  obligations  and  empowering  small  rural  businesses  in  the 
<br/></span><span>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, climate change is also catered for in this particular Budget which one of the key 
<br/>issues which poses a risk to Fiji’s survival.  This Parliament should be proud in the passing of the 
<br/>Climate Change Bill, a much needed piece of legislation which provides all that is necessary to help 
<br/>Fiji play its role in reducing national emissions towards a net zero by 2050.  At the same time, it 
<br/>allows initiatives to be put in place which accelerate to access our … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Point of Order!  He is being irrelevant.  We are here as an Opposition, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to criticise the Budget.  That is the Opposition’s stand. Otherwise, Sir, just tell him to cross over.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, this is a debate on the Budget and he is doing exactly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that, just like you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I think as national leaders, we are 
<br/>here to express our views on the Budget and this is one of our roles as Members of Parliament.  We 
<br/>give our views overall on what the Budget Estimates look like and how it affects those who will be 
<br/>governed by it - that is our role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change will help  and assist  landowners.  There are a lot of economic benefits  for 
<br/>landowners  in  terms  of  the  climate  change  programmes  that  are  there,  especially  landowner 
<br/>participation in carbon trading projects.  I think this is something that landowners are moving into - 
<br/>forest conservation and registration of carbon sinks and how they will benefit from carbon trading 
<br/>projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building resilient structures in rural communities such as seawalls and also roads, planting of 
<br/>natural  trees  and  fruit  tree  projects  in  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  project  which  really  helps  our 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> in our various catchments. We are moving away from the Ridge to Reef Project (R2R) and 
<br/>our  aim  of  50  million  trees  and  I  think  these  are  directly  benefiting  our  communities.    Also 
<br/>communities participating in planting of trees and fruit trees are also getting some allowances that 
<br/>helps with their various community projects.  Protecting our marine areas, </span><span>lumi</span><span> project, pearl, coral 
<br/>planting and mangrove planting.  These are some of the benefits of climate change.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  infrastructure  development,  there  is  $600  million  for  the  essential  maintenance  of  our 
<br/>roads and assets, $50 million on ongoing programme renewal and rehabilitation of roads and remake 
<br/>programme  and  special  thanks  from  Vanua  Levu  contractors  who  have  now  signed  directly  with 
<br/>FRA.  Before,  there used to  be sub-contractors  with  Fair Deal  but  now  they have directly signed 
<br/>contracts with FRA especially for the RIP Programme and we thank FRA for allowing that tender. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $15 million for Rural Road Programmes, we need to maintain our roads and 
<br/>also new ones in our rural communities. Special thanks on the announcement of the Lagi to Tawake 
<br/>Road, closer to where we are in Dogotuki and from Tawake to Wainika.  This is an area which has 
<br/>been connected only by sea but these are some of the things that are benefiting our rural community 
<br/>and also the Nayarabale crossover to Valevoni, as alluded by the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  participation  of  our  public  infrastructure  projects  with  contractors  like  Higgins, 
<br/>Flame  Tree  Development,  Gold  Rock  Investments  Limited,  Fair  Deal  Earthmoving  Contractors 
<br/>Limited  and  basic  industries  like  Fijian  Holdings  Limited,  Kashmir  Civil  Construction,  Bula 
<br/>Earthworks Limited, Valebasoga Construction, NGCL Limited and others do much needed business 
<br/>to keep our economy rolling through much needed revenue projections for the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government has provide employment for many Fijians who are truck drivers, machine 
<br/></span><span>operators, labours, dynamite rock explosives specialists who support their families and communities.  
<br/>On the other hand, the FRA contractors assist the landowners who consent to lease out of quarry 
<br/>through  metal  royalties.    Landowning  units  are  earning  through  arrangements  as  high  as  $13  per 
<br/>cubic.  The contractor pays $3.31 to iTLTB as royalties, on the other hand pays a separate $10 per 
<br/>cubic  claimed  by  the  </span><span>mataqali</span><span>  for  their  development  and  investment.    These  are  how  those 
<br/>developments trickle down to how landowners benefit from the policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Landowners  have  built  better  cyclone  resistant  homes,  built  farm  roads,  moved  into 
<br/>commercial farming, bought vehicles and trucks for hire business, bought houses in urban areas on 
<br/>rent income and have invested for their future generation’s  education at Unit Trust of Fiji and also 
<br/>Fijian Holdings Unit Trust. So, far during the debate and plus the other campaign materials that are 
<br/>going around which are trying to portray current policies and initiatives has not benefitted the iTaukei 
<br/>nd  trying  to  politicise  indigenous  economic  imbalances.  I  have  just  outlined  how  Government’s 
<br/>policies has empowered indigenous people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a patriotic Fijian and a national leader, we must ensure 
<br/>stability of our nation and a full fit recovery of our economy. Our economy is re-growing under our 
<br/>recovery path. Our national agenda is to guard our fragile economic recovery process.  We need to 
<br/>guard the economy recovery from global disruption of supply and inflation, the trickle-down effect 
<br/>of the war in Ukraine on the increase of international food prices and fuel and also the effects of 
<br/>climate change, given our vulnerability to cyclones and floods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  2022-2023  Budget  is  prepared  as  the  economy  is  regaining  strength  post-COVID-19.  
<br/>Through the tourism numbers that are coming in from January to June 2022 is almost the same as the 
<br/>period of 2019.  We are now at the peak period (July to August) of tourist arrivals.  The budget has 
<br/>no major tax changes and this is important in providing policy consistency to the private sector and 
<br/>the  tourism  industry.    It  is  critical  to  maintain  policy  consistency  given  more  spaces  for  more 
<br/>economic  activities.    This  builds  private  sector  confidence  and  it  assists  in  our  post-economic 
<br/>recovery. The Budget has a very simple and logical strategy by providing tax concessions to business 
<br/>to operate and in return the Government earns through revenue from personal and income tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The expenditure strategy is very clear through its key principles to guide expenditure policy 
<br/>in the medium-term.  For example, the Budget is encouraging more in the private sector in public 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure projects and delivery of other services in the PPP and other innovative arrangements, 
<br/>for example, the Aspen Medical PPP by choosing hospital services as we move into medical tourism 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the recent FNPF buying of shares with Fiji Airways to capture the travel component of 
<br/>tourism at its fleet of hotels is part of FNPF members’ investment.  I think that is very important and 
<br/>that will be more returns to our individual FNPF accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  view  of  those  factors,  we  have  a  very  critical  role  as  national  leaders  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament.    We  have  to  always  put  our  country  first.    The  survival  of  our  economy  is  priority, 
<br/>therefore, the 2022-2023 Budget maintains a strong consistency of policies to maintain our stability 
<br/>towards a full economic recovery.  Therefore, wholeheartedly with great patriotism, I support the 
<br/>motion that is before Parliament and the wellbeing of all Fijians.</span><span>

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it seems it is getting a bit hot in this Chambers today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, honourable Ministers and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament and the people of Fiji; I fully support this Budget.  It is a Budget for the times 
<br/>- it is appropriate and it not only addresses the issues of today, but also sets Fiji on a course that will 
<br/>lead to our full recovery.  I think today in this Parliament, we have seen that some people are seeing 
<br/>the light.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We invite everyone else, see the light and get into the light!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of distinct hallmarks of this Budget that need to be 
<br/>highlighted.    First  of  all,  the  Budget  addresses  the  short-term  immediate  needs  through  inflation 
<br/>mitigation.  It provides relief to the most vulnerable in Fiji.  Sir, sitting here this week and listening 
<br/>to  some  of  the  comments  made  by  honourable  Members  of  the  Opposition  and  talking  about  the 
<br/>Budget, it has been astounding. Their comments have shown their true colours. They just rubbish 
<br/>everything in this Budget. They referred to our past policies of helping to lift up and looking after 
<br/>our most vulnerable as freebies. They referred to them as freebies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They say over and over again that the Government needs to look at the plight of the most 
<br/>vulnerable in our country, and then they said the Government does not understand the plight of our 
<br/>needy citizens.  And in the same instant, they belittled what we are proposing in this Budget to address 
<br/>that exact issue.  The thing that they complained about, we address and they belittle that too. I will 
<br/>not call them ‘idiots’, I will just say that that is incredibly idiotic.  That is two-faced forked-tongue 
<br/>speaking and it would be hilarious if it was not such a serious matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They belittled what Government had been doing in these past few years - to address the plight 
<br/>of our most challenged citizens.  Over the past few years, we have witnessed never before seen the 
<br/>assistance through social welfare for those who really need it.  These are the provisions for the most 
<br/>vulnerable in our society.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communities  used  to  pay  a  deposit  in  order  to  get  EFL  grid  extension,  no  more!  Is  the 
<br/>Opposition saying that all above the age of 65 years who are getting a social pension should not get 
<br/>that social pension - our uncles and our aunts in the villages, is that what they are saying?  Are they 
<br/>saying that we should not have paid the $360 and the $50 and the unemployment benefits to those 
<br/>who  lost  their  jobs  during  COVID-19?    Are  they  saying  that  they  should  be  left  to  fend  for 
<br/>themselves? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those Members of the Opposition are saying that they want to remove that assistance from 
<br/>those  who  need  it.  They  are  saying  that  the  assistance  should  never  have  been  given.  They  are 
<br/>implying that if they come into power, God forbid, that they would remove all those assistance. That 
<br/>is what the people of this country must listen to and this is what they are saying.  That is what they 
<br/>are telling the vulnerable people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are saying that the $1 per day or the $30 per month per child should not be given to our 
<br/>most vulnerable children - that is what they are saying.  If you call it a freebie, that is what you are 
<br/>saying.  They are saying that we should not assist our most vulnerable children.  That is what they 
<br/>mean when they call inflation mitigation measures, freebies.  They are saying, “Do away with it.  Let 
<br/>them sink or swim.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I raise a Point of Order regarding the misleading statement that 
<br/>the honourable Member made that we said that social welfare should not be paid. No  one said that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The statement is misleading, it is false. That is the Point of Order, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it should be withdrawn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, you have heard what has been said, take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir. When you say something, you have to 
<br/>think about the implication of what you say.  If you say that support to vulnerable people is a freebie, 
<br/>you are saying that it is something that should not be given, and that is precisely what I am saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carefully-formulated policies to assist our most vulnerable, they are saying,  “Do away with 
<br/>it. Let them sink or swim.” They are saying, “Let them suffer.” This is the quality of this Opposition, 
<br/>this is their true colour, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Forked tongue, Sir, two-faced, shameless!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same breath, they said Government does not care and then that they rubbished what we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proposed in this Budget to address the issues that they have highlighted such as:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Means-tested subsidies for electricity and water; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>school bus fares which children do not have to pay; 
<br/></span><span>Not having to pay for school fees, textbooks, free medicine, unemployment assistance of 
<br/>hundreds of millions of dollars; 
<br/>Free General Practitioners’ services; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Market vendors not having to pay the stall fees; and 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Payment of licence fees by Government.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1677 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  called all of these  things as  freebies, and  are implying that all these things should be taken 
<br/>away, that our most vulnerable should fend for themselves.  They do not care what happens to the 
<br/>vulnerable people of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Shame, shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  The  second  hallmark,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  this  Budget  is  that,  it 
<br/>maintains  continuity  and  consistency  with  past  policy  and  direction.    It  continues  our  focus  of 
<br/>encouraging  investment.    It  gives  investors  assurance  that  our  past  policies  will  continue,  thus 
<br/>building confidence, which is very critical in these global difficult times when investment is hard to 
<br/>come by and when global investors are very choosy about where to invest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third hallmark of this Budget is that, it chooses to invest in areas that will lead to growth 
<br/>and returns in the future.  There is a very strong focus on infrastructure on building a stronger, more 
<br/>amendable climate for investment which leads to better jobs, income and, therefore, better quality of 
<br/>life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services will receive a 
<br/>budget of $37.6 million, an increase of 58 percent.  This will help the different Departments of the 
<br/>Ministry - Energy Department, Water Department, Works Department, the Directorate of Building 
<br/>and Government Architect and the Fiji Meteorological Services to be able to deliver its work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change is having a massive impact in our infrastructure and Government is focused 
<br/>on resilient infrastructure.  Over the last nine years, Government has invested an amount of $21.3 
<br/>million to improve, secure and ensure safe and healthy living facilities for our public building tenants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  budget,  there  is  a  fund  of  $1  million  that  is  allocated  to  improve  the  Nabouwalu 
<br/>powerhouse  and  also  to  upgrade  maritime  government  buildings.    The  Ministry  will  ensure  that 
<br/>buildings are constructed to standards that are resilient and can withstand climatic changes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our national energy targets of getting 100 percent access to electricity by 
<br/>the year 2026.  By 2017, we had achieved access to electricity of 96 percent of our population, up 
<br/>from 89 percent in 2007.  Getting all of our electricity from renewable energy by the year 2036 and 
<br/>achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision of electricity has a lot of major challenges, especially after the restrictions that 
<br/>were put in place during COVID-19.  Our contractors were not able to mobilise to the project sites 
<br/>to complete the projects, there was shortage of materials in the market due to the closing down of 
<br/>suppliers mostly from China and delays in the shipment of materials to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Energy and Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) were not able to travel to project 
<br/>sites to carry out inspections and verify the work that had been undertaken.  Despite this, we still 
<br/>managed to deliver and provide quality services to our people and we have remained committed to 
<br/>meeting the total cost of all rural electrification projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past  10  years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government  has  allocated around $237 million  for 
<br/>rural electrification for grid extension, house wiring projects and for solar home systems.  This is a 
<br/>massive investment.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For 2022-2023, the Department of Energy has been allocated a budget of $13.8 million.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, $5.7 million of this has been allocated for house wiring projects where the grid projects 
<br/>have already been completed.  This will electrify a total of 4,200 homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $4 million is provided for the installation of solar home systems, benefitting 1,000 homes 
<br/>in rural areas and maritime islands that do not have access to the EFL grid.  We are working on ways 
<br/>of  introducing  and  implementing  programmes  for  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  to  reduce 
<br/>carbon emissions.  A total of $20,000 has been allocated for this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A further $19.28 million will be provided to EFL via Head 50 for grid extension and house 
<br/>wiring.    The  benefits  of  this  investment  are  far  reaching  for  daily  living  and  also  for  generating 
<br/>income, creating sustainable livelihoods and increasing the productive capacity of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Meteorological Services has been given a budget of $4.09 million and of that, $0.5 
<br/>million is allocated for Disaster Recovery Infrastructure Systems to reduce disruptions, recover as 
<br/>quickly as possible and ensure business continuity in the event of a disaster.  The $2 million upgrade 
<br/>of  the  Nausori  Radar  will  improve  forecasting  and  highlight  areas  of  likely  extreme  rainfall  and 
<br/>thunderstorms that will impact us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving  weather  forecasts  is  very  important.    It  helps  all  of  us  -  farmers,  citizens  and 
<br/>everyone.    The  $240,000  Water  Level  and  Rainfall  Equipment  Project  is  crucial  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Services as water level monitoring allows them to deliver early and advance warning 
<br/>of  any  likely  flood  situation  and  provides  valuable  time  to  protect  assets,  to  move  valuables  and 
<br/>protect property. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has been given a budget of $204 million, an increase of $9 
<br/>million.  All this will assist WAF in moving towards the targets that we have in our 5-20 Year National 
<br/>Development Plan and also Sustainable Development Goal No. 6 which is all about access to water and 
<br/>sanitation.  Currently, just over 80 percent of the total population has access to clean drinking water, 
<br/>whilst 28 percent of the population has access to WAF wastewater services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $11  million  is  allocated  to  address  intermittent  water  supply  areas 
<br/>nationwide and this, of course, is something that has been in the news over the past few months.  This 
<br/>will eliminate nine intermittent supply areas, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the Central Division –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Wrong Turn Road in Sakoca;  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Burebasaga Village;  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Caubati koro;  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Cunningham Stage 4; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Tovata areas; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>elevated areas of the southern end of Nadi and Sonaisali; and 
<br/>Uciwai to Yako Village in the Western Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those intermittent supply areas projects will enable more than 7,000 people to receive normal water 
<br/>pressure 24/7 in the comfort of their homes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $5.5 million is allocated to address leakages through pressure management, 
<br/></span><span>service pipe replacements, air and boundary valve replacements and demand management with the 
<br/></span><span>aim to reduce non-revenue water by 5 percent nationwide.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $4.9  million  is  allocated  to  provide  access  to  clean  water  to  rural 
<br/>communities, benefitting more than 20,000 people. These include the Burewai District School and 
<br/>Nawairuku  Village  in  Ra,  Nauluvatu  Village  in  Naitasiri,  Driti  Village  in  Tailevu  and  Bucalevu 
<br/>Combine Scheme also in Macuata.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $3.5  million  is  allocated  for  water  carting  to  rural  communities  in  non-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>metered areas during periods of water disruptions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  $5.5  million</span><span> </span><span>is</span><span> </span><span>allocated  for  electrical  works  at  WAF’s  water  pump  and  wastewater 
<br/>stations to  ensure that backup  Gensets  are installed at  critical  sites to  ensure water is  supplied to 
<br/>customers during periods of power shutdowns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $300,000 will be utilised to continue the improvement of catchment areas 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ensure our water sources are protected and secured for water sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  $1  million</span><span> </span><span>is  allocated  for</span><span> </span><span>rainwater  harvesting  programme.  This  will  include  the 
<br/>provision of 2,500 litre water tanks and WAF will also make arrangements for the base used for these 
<br/>water tanks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $4.5 million</span><span> </span><span>is for integrated meter management aimed at replacing 15,000 
<br/>residential meters nationwide to bring about billing accuracy and $60.3</span><span> </span><span>million is allocated for the 
<br/>completion  of  Phase  1  of  the  new  Rewa  River  Water  Supply  Scheme  Project  to  address  water 
<br/>challenges and to support sustainable growth and development in the greater Suva area. This Scheme 
<br/>will provide an additional 40 million litres of water in the Lami to Nausori corridor, benefiting over 
<br/>360,000 people. It is scheduled to come online next year (2023). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  $5</span><span> </span><span>million  is  allocated  for  the  installation  of  pipelines  from  Sawani  to  Navatuvula  to 
<br/>Waitolu to ensure that those communities living along these areas have access to this clean drinking 
<br/>water when the new Rewa River Water Scheme is commissioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $3.15  million  is  allocated  for  wastewater  system  improvements  and 
<br/>upgrades which include sewer network extensions for Waidamudamu in Koronivia and Yalaha Pump 
<br/>Station  construction  in  Sigatoka.  This  includes  major  wastewater  critical  pipes  replacement  at 
<br/>crossings on roads and bridges in the Central Division that will address the aged infrastructure that 
<br/>we still have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, for the next financial year, a key WAF focus area will be non-revenue water reduction 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through revamping pressure management and leak detection activities. This will: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further  reduce  the  non-revenue  water  levels  by  5  percent,  increasing  water  supply 
<br/>production capacity by 10 percent to cater for increasing demand; and  
<br/>increase  wastewater  treatment  capacity  and  automation  of  the  water  and  wastewater 
<br/>systems to increase efficiency and optimize operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF is now developing its Water Sector Strategy 2050</span><span>. </span><span>This</span><span> </span><span>will outline Fiji’s water 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector priority projects and programmes over the next three decades. This is aimed at:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these activities will complement the things that we have already done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Attorney-General has talked about, WAF has acquired the Momi pipeline 
<br/>that will now provide water to people of around 4,000 households in that area, which complements 
<br/>all the other work that have been going on.  At the moment, as I speak, we are completing the new 
<br/>20 mega litre package plant being built at Nagado.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have new water treatment plants about to be commissioned, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>20 mega litre Waiwai Plant in Ba; 
<br/>5 mega litre Savusavu plant; 
<br/> 3 mega litre plant for Nabouwalu; and  
<br/>1 mega litre plant for Vunidawa.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also doing work on the islands.  Right now, there is water in Moturiki that is sourced from 
<br/>Navuloa in Ovalau, it comes under the sea and now all the villages in Moturiki are getting this water.  
<br/>That project is about to be commissioned in the not too distant future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $376.7 million is provided to Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), an increase of $38.5 
<br/>million.  The main effort is on the sealed roads where $60 million has been allocated to ensure essential 
<br/>maintenance of FRA road assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budget will allow FRA to execute the second phase of road improvements through its rip and 
<br/>remake programme.  The second phase will give resilience to the roads.  The second coat of the seal will 
<br/>protect the road pavement from rainfall intensity that is brought about by climate change and provide 
<br/>resilience for three to six years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A budgetary provision of $162 million will also allow FRA to continue with its critical bridge 
<br/>replacement programme, which is to replace all bridges that are coming to the end of their serviceable 
<br/>life.  There are 10 bridges under construction: one in the tender stage, 40 in design stage and 60 in the 
<br/>prefeasibility stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To improve the inter-island services by sea, FRA is designing improvements and replacements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for nine jetties through this budget and these will come into construction for the next financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FRA is also putting a lot more effort in preparing the Transport Infrastructure Investment 
<br/></span><span>Sector Project so that during construction, there are no unwarranted disruptions.  To facilitate this, the 
<br/></span><span>Government has inserted $145,000 to allow provisions of prefeasibility studies, feasibility studies and 
<br/>design in this budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has been allocated a total budget 
<br/>of $25.9 million, an increase of $1.87 million, and this budget will be used to further the Ministry’s drive 
<br/>to ensure that State land is used productively and made available for housing needs, for business and 
<br/>tourism development, conducting of surveys and consumption of safe and clean drinking groundwater.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the initiatives the Ministry is pursuing include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The development of a lease digital platform that is supported by the digitisation of lease 
<br/>records.  The first phase will be launched at the end of this calendar year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The development of streamlined process of survey plan examination and approvals.  The 
<br/>Ministry  will  also  enable  chartered  approved  survey  plans  to  be  viewed  online  via  the

<div><span>Boost development and fast track land survey, the Ministry will be purchasing the latest 
<br/>upgraded survey equipment that it needs.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, two weeks ago, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources handed over an 
<br/>extension of the Special Mining Licence (SML) to Lion One Limited for the Tuvatu Gold Mine.  This is 
<br/>a company that has already invested $140 million into this venture.  Before it sells an ounce on gold, it 
<br/>has already invested $140 million.  There are about 200 people being employed by the company.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this SML, they will inject between $50 million to $100 million into this venture.  This is a 
<br/>sign of investor confidence in investing in Fiji which will aid the country’s economic recovery and boost 
<br/>the impact of the mining sector to Fiji’s GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have a provision for the Digitisation of Fiji’s Geological Information.  This will cater for 
<br/>the digitalisation and updating of Geological Maps that were published between the 1960s to the 1980s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Use Master Plan that is being developed in the Ministry will support the vision of 
<br/>Government in ‘Building a Better and Resilient Fiji for all Fijians.’  The plan will assist the Department 
<br/>of  Lands  to  properly  identify  and  plan  the  usage  of  prime  State  land,  monitor  and  control  illegal 
<br/>developments such as squatting on State land.  It includes identifying of vacant State land for investment 
<br/>by both, local and foreign investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Land Bank</span><span> </span><span>is a land reform initiative to complement iTLTB in making land more accessible 
<br/>to the people.  It allows attractive lease terms to encourage more investment in such land, all of which is 
<br/>done  with  the  best  interest  of  the  landowners,  the  tenants  and  for  optimal  returns  to  both,  Fiji  and 
<br/>landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Land  also  contributes  to  improving  water  distribution  network  through  the 
<br/>reticulation of groundwater resources in the maritime islands and the remote drought-stricken rural areas 
<br/>of  Fiji.    This  initiative  is  supported  through  the  provision  of  $2.76  million  for  the  Groundwater 
<br/>Assessment and Development for Large and Small Islands project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mineral Resources Department has upgraded all seismic stations. Under the 
<br/>2022-2023 Budget, a sum of $300,000 is provided for a back-up system and spare parts for our seismic 
<br/>network.  This  strengthens  and  builds  resilience  in  our  earthquake  and  tsunami  detection  capability,

<div><span>seismic data management and the timely dissemination of earthquake information to the public.  The 
<br/>Budget also allows us to co-share satellite services through ITELSAT based in Washington to monitor 
<br/>seismic activities and its operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is allocated $80,000 for the provision of geo-tech work through assessments of geo-
<br/>hazards, landslides and relocation sites, to make sure that we build in the right place. The Ministry has 
<br/>been collating data on landslides in Fiji, and this budget will allow us to put together a landslide inventory 
<br/>for Fiji. It will help us develop landslide susceptibility maps which, in turn, allows better decision-making 
<br/>to minimise as much as possible the economic and human losses that we can face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the past few days, there have been a lot of things that have been said in 
<br/>Parliament,  so  I  would  like  to  turn  to  some  of  the  comments  that  have  been  made.    Honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua  suggested  that  the  $1  per  day  is  the  total  assistance  that  Government  provides  for  our 
<br/>vulnerable children.  He tried to compare that to the other allowances that honourable Ministers or the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister receives when they move offshore.  To say that this $1 per day is the total 
<br/>amount of money that the Government provides for the vulnerable children, I think, is absolute rubbish.  
<br/>Government assistance to vulnerable children starts before birth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistance is given to pregnant mothers, food vouchers, free healthcare, free birth certificates, 
<br/></span><span>free education, free transport to schools, free textbooks, social welfare assistance to families and children, 
<br/>subsidy for water and electricity, free medicine, free access to GPs, and the list goes on and on. These are 
<br/>all the kinds of assistance that are given to the vulnerable children that we have in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulanauca made fun of the assistance that is given by Government in providing boats 
<br/>to those who request this.  That is something that he needs to say to the children who have to cross streams 
<br/>to  get  to  schools  and  whose  lives  are  put  at  risk.    This  Government  is  there  for  safe  transport,  for 
<br/>conserving lives, for helping people make progress in their lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Leawere says we are surrendering our sovereignty at our national seaports. Absolute 
<br/>hogwash!  We have partnered with Aitken Spence to run the ports but the Ports still belongs to Fiji.  In 
<br/>so doing, we have seen massive improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of our Ports - a critical 
<br/>requirement to grow investment, and trade and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of the Opposition says Fiji should not try to compare with Singapore, nor 
<br/>try and be better than Australia and New Zealand. We say, why not?  Why should we not reach for the 
<br/>stars?  Why should we not work to make our tomorrow better than our today?  Why not?  Why should 
<br/>we not make the Fiji of our grandchildren, better than our Fiji today?  Why not?  Why dream small?  We 
<br/>need to dream big. It is through innovation, investment and effective utilization of resources and dynamic 
<br/>powerful leadership that we will improve, ensure growth and truly leave no one behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government does not sell anyone short.  We will not sell our people short. 
<br/>Unlike what we have heard thus far from the Opposition, this Government, this Party and this Leader 
<br/>thinks our people deserve the best.  They deserve the best.  We have been doing that for the past eight 
<br/>years  under  the  FijiFirst  Government,  and  the  eight  years  before  that  under  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally and unreservedly support the 2022-2023 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Budget 2022-
<br/>2023.  The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet Ministers, Members of Parliament, Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition and Members, I hope that the other side of the House will accept one of the Members

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1683 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from this side and not </span><span>liumuri</span><span> him at the last minute and not accept him to be with them as a candidate to 
<br/>run down the Opposition side’s contributions in not supporting the FijiFirst Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me reiterate, the expectations and projection that our economy will grow at 12.5 percent is 
<br/>based on the 12.4 percent growth projections for tourist arrivals.  It is unlikely that we will achieve the 
<br/>12.4 percent growth projections because of the challenges due to increase in the fossil fuel price with 
<br/>corresponding increases.  The Bula Boom catchphrase is a fraud on the nation.  We accept that the real 
<br/>growth ratio as per Bureau of Statistics data – 1973, real GDP growth was 12.7 percent. 1979 – 12 percent 
<br/>and in 1989, our real GDP growth was 12.9 percent and in 1999 - 8.7 percent.  The claim that we are 
<br/>going to achieve an unprecedented growth of 12.4 percent is not true and misleading because the global 
<br/>growth trend has been revised downward from 4.1 to 2.9 percent which means we have to make necessary 
<br/>structural adjustments.  It should be clear that our real GDP per capita in 2020 using the 2014 data only– 
<br/>FJ$9,970 which is equivalent to US$5,000.  Our per capita income in fact has declined from $12,000 in 
<br/>2018 to $9,970 in 2020, meaning our purchasing power parity is also on a declining trend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me reiterate that on the revenue side since 2014, the gap or shortfall between the budgeted 
<br/>revenue and actual revenue continues to increase substantially and has reached unprecedented levels.  For 
<br/>example,  in  2014,  the  revenue  shortfall  was  only  around  $350  million.    In  2017-2018,  the  revenue 
<br/></span><span>shortfall increased to $613 million, almost doubled.  Such degree of error is unacceptable whilst on the 
<br/></span><span>expenditure side, there was an under expenditure of $160 million in 2014.  Again, in 2018-2019 financial 
<br/>year,  there  was  a  number  of  expenditure  of  over  $1  billion  which  is  almost  half  the  total  budgeted 
<br/>expenditure. In 2019-2020 financial year, there was an under expenditure of $487 million.  Variations of 
<br/>margins of errors are too high which is unacceptable so is poor budgeting, poor forecasting and poor 
<br/>implementation as reiterated by the Leader of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I again reiterate that diversity and multiculturalism needs to be revisited and incorporated in the 
<br/>budget.  The FijiFirst Government has failed to foster partnership and consensus building.  There is more 
<br/>division and mistrust in the country because of FijiFirst’s my way or the highway type of leadership.  It 
<br/>does not believe in political consultation or partnership.  FijiFirst is a threat to the nation and must go.  
<br/>We must all continue to be proud and embrace diversity within our cultural and multiracial society.  It 
<br/>should be considered as our strength in moving the nation forward rather than as a hurdle or stumbling 
<br/>block.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate what the Leader of Opposition stated.  Rather than embracing and promoting values 
<br/>and the richness of our diversity, the FijiFirst Government has tried to force cultural autonomy, integration 
<br/>and assimilation.  Anything discussed about indigenous people’s development, being targeted in terms of 
<br/>policy is immediately termed as racist.  You people need to get away from ostrich-type of mentality.  
<br/>Open  your mind.  When you speak of diversity, I  mean recognition of our differences which can be 
<br/>synergised for national development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In New Zealand, it was identified that in order to build a thriving and inclusive Aotearoa New 
<br/>Zealand, policies need to reflect the communities they served, placing the community at the centre of 
<br/>policy making.  Ethnic diversity is increasing in the public sector workforce.  There is a necessary to 
<br/>integrate  ethnic  diversity  into  the  policy  agenda  in  local  and  central  government  and  New  Zealand 
<br/>businesses.  There have been various researches carried out on this subject by Professor Wadan Narsey, 
<br/>Mick Beddoes, et cetera, and I saw one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Parliament, the honourable Attorney-General made a statement about the indigenous Fijians.  
<br/>This is in August 2019 at a COP he attended.  It was uttered by the honourable Minister for iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs who sat next to him in silence. Perhaps, the honourable Minister for Economy was speaking for 
<br/>honourable Bainimarama. The all-knowing Minister said in an exchange on native land - we have this 
<br/>slogan that has come up now – asset rich but cash poor.   Exactly! We own 92 percent of the land but are 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cash  poor  because  of  the  fact  that  the  transactions  and  the  pervading  political  mentality  stopped  the 
<br/>iTaukei from becoming wealthy from the land use.  He puts his finger on a crucial issue - the iTaukei 
<br/>nearly owned all the land but generally do not have much money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes driven by sober confidence, the honourable Minister for Economy forgets himself so 
<br/>I will remind him of the facts that face him.  He speaks of transactions and a pervading political mentality 
<br/>resulting in the iTaukei failing to achieve prosperity for the use of their land.  He is right but they have 
<br/>been in virtual total control of Fiji for the past 15 or so years when they conducted their destructive coup. 
<br/>So, they were in a position to influence in a positive way the transactions to which he refers and to change 
<br/>the political mentality that worked against the indigenous people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  they  did  not  do  this  so  it  might  be  appropriate  to  suggest  that  they  and  their 
<br/>Government  deserve  the  last  part  of  the  blame  for  the  predicament  of  our  indigenous  people.  If  the 
<br/>Minister is true to form he will attempt to pass the problem off to previous governments but that excuse 
<br/>looks threadbare when they have been in office for such a long time. And what they cannot undo or 
<br/>escape is their so many oppressive Decrees against the indigenous people which remain in force today.  
<br/>That aside, they went through the motions which sounded like a big initiative to address the needs of the 
<br/>landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I refer here to the iTaukei Development Fund which is in the Budget. In mid-March 2014 it was 
<br/>announced that there will be $10 million a year to assist landowners develop their own land but five years 
<br/>later, only 28 percent or $14 million of the $50 million could have been utilised. That is a failure in any 
<br/>measure.  In the 2023 Budget, this $10 million a year for the iTaukei Land Development is demoted to 
<br/>Head 50 Miscellaneous and reduced to $4 million. What a shame! Was this a genuine good effort to help 
<br/>or was it just to give an impression that something was being done. It is a gimmick just to create a false 
<br/>impression that this Government cares about the iTaukei. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Compare this $14 million worth of assistance to our majority indigenous of community to the 
<br/>8,071 building permit issue to citizens of the same periods valued at 41.4 million. The permits were for 
<br/>new buildings addition to dwelling, factories, shops, et cetera. Granted the money is utilised in the $1.4 
<br/>million, it would be paid for by the individual from loans re-negotiated but it is still for development - for 
<br/>personal and economic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It seems that the size of the development gap between the indigenous citizens and the rest is very 
<br/>large. Unless of course, a high percentage of those who succeeded in getting these commercial loans were 
<br/>from the indigenous community.  It is a doubt because the norm for loan approvals across all banks has 
<br/>been 50 percent indigenous and 75 percent for others.  Would the bankers association care to publish 
<br/>figures on this?  This is a glaring issue for many successful loan applications, the land they use as security 
<br/>may well be native lease from the indigenous community but the same landowners are not necessarily 
<br/>able to do the same when they seek finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economic gap may even be widening currently at a breathtaking pace.  For example, the $1.4 
<br/>billion value in building permits issued - 3978 valued at $481.3 million - were for new private buildings 
<br/>and additions to buildings, 1416 permits were for new buildings and other miscellaneous buildings valued 
<br/>at $940.6 million. This was for factories, shops, restaurants warehouses, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are under the impression that the indigenous people owns 92 percent of the land and are 
<br/>earning millions, it should be noted that the iTLTB paid out an annual lease amount of $73.5 million in 
<br/>2017  for  447655  hectares  of  land,  equivalent  to  1.1  million  acres.  That  means  the  landowners  get  a 
<br/>princely sum of 6647 per acre per annum of $5.50 per month per acre.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1685 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also reiterated for Fiji’s minority communities to remember that it was through the greatest 
<br/>act  and  trust  of  good  faith  in  colonial  history  that  the  Great  Council  of  Chiefs,  through  the 
<br/>recommendations of Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, supported the establishment of the NLTB Act. All business 
<br/>land was then transferred to that Ministry on their behalf.  This cleared the way for our indigenous citizens 
<br/>and investors to access and use Fijian land for their own development and for the nation. That happened 
<br/>79 years ago on 7</span><span>th</span><span> June, 1940. It has been on the back of this Act of Trust that many of our successful 
<br/>businesses build their fortunes on and it helped make Fiji today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the complex and diverse society such as ours, it is vital for all of us especially for our leaders 
<br/>in politics and commerce to make every effort to understand, acknowledge and respect the value systems 
<br/>of each community, especially our indigenous Fijian citizens.  Others may have value systems that give 
<br/>priority  to  immediate  family,  individualism  and  monetary  and  material  wealth,  as  their  measure  of 
<br/>success,  but  our  indigenous  communities  are  still  very  much  community-based,  attaching  great 
<br/>importance to the family groups, the village jointly owned land and </span><span>qoliqoli, </span><span>the church and the </span><span>vanua.</span><span>
<br/>Therefore, the speed of action and priorities for the development are very different for those of others.  
<br/>That is not to say that there are no successful indigenous entrepreneurs because there are very many 
<br/>successful individuals and families abroad and you have to also look at the success of Fijian Holdings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But given that they have played their role in well-earned success through a generous terms of 
<br/></span><span>lease, the rest of us need to pause and reflect.  This should motivate us to reach out willingly and share 
<br/>entrepreneurial skills, and expertise with our indigenous citizens and businesses which can add to the 
<br/>lease income by developing some of the land with commercial and residential projects.  This should build 
<br/>up additional resources and income for them and security for their future generation.

<div><span>A happy and content harmonious people would produce a happy and productive workshop which 
<br/>would drive a successful economy.  This research article of course is backed by data from the 2019- 2020 
<br/>Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) on page 9 where it confirms that 74.8 percent of the 
<br/>poor are iTaukei.  We know the upheaval this created when this fact was shown and which has rapidly 
<br/>deteriorated under FijiFirst.  The iTaukei must vote out this FijiFirst Government and save itself from 
<br/>future deterioration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  recall  the  honourable  Attorney-General  saying  that  not  voting  for  FijiFirst  is  like  holding  a 
<br/>dagger to your neck.  This will not work as thousands of voters are now abandoning FijiFirst.  I am calling 
<br/>on  the  Government  in  terms  of  the  Budget  to  set  up  a  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  economic 
<br/>development state of the iTaukei indigenous people for inclusion for funding.  The Terms of Reference 
<br/>(TOR) could be enquiry into opportunities and challenges of the engagement of indigenous traditional 
<br/>landowners,  resource  owners  in  the  economic  development  of  Fiji.    We  could  look  at  the  current 
<br/>engagement structure and funding of representative bodies including councils, native title bodies, native 
<br/>companies and businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The road structure performance and resourcing of relevant government entities in relation to this, 
<br/>legislative and administrative and funding constraints and capacity for improving economic engagement, 
<br/>strategies for enhancing economic development opportunities and capacity building, establishing baseline 
<br/>data and frameworks, opportunities that are being assessed and can be derived and recommended from 
<br/>these  frameworks.    The  overall  impact  of  this  will  be  on  encouraging  in  investment  and  existing 
<br/>initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On baseline data on iTaukei, why is the Government paranoid about ethnic data?  It needs to be 
<br/>open  about  this.    All  countries  collect  this  and  it  is  an  essential  tool  for  government  policies  and 
<br/>programmes.  This paranoia resulted in the sacking of Mr. Kemueli Naiqama, the Fiji Bureau of Statistics 
<br/>Chief Executive  Officer (CEO).   In one study  in  Australia, the following  was  recommended to  help 
<br/>overcome overlapping legislative regimes, administrative complexity and other barriers to representative

<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bodies attempting to make use of economic opportunity.  The Commonwealth Government should give 
<br/>consideration to the creation of indigenous strategy in terms of establishment of an Indigenous Economic 
<br/>Development  Board  to  provide  tailored  business  development,  legal  and  research  support  to  such 
<br/>businesses.    Why  is  this  type  of  initiative  impossible  for  FijiFirst  Government  to  do  for  the  iTaukei 
<br/>businesses?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  been  attending  and 
<br/>opening all provincial councils.  He has stated at the openings how Government has contributed to the 
<br/>development in the provinces.  While opening the Serua Provincial Council, he stated that the money 
<br/>spent  right  in  the  community  includes  more  than  $20  million  for  roads,  $10  million  for 
<br/>telecommunications and other connectivity, $5 million for schools and in Kadavu over $55.6 million, he 
<br/>added the investments on roads, bridges, jetty, networks we have listened to your concerns.  The question 
<br/>is, what are the results of these in terms of economic empowerment?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These developments are, of course, commended as any development should be commended, but 
<br/>has this translated to lifting the indigenous people out of poverty.  This must be clearly indicated and it 
<br/>needs  to  be  assisted  through  further  research  studies  with  recommendations  on  the  results  of  that  - 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation of how this has lifted or moving the iTaukei away from that 78.4 percent of 
<br/></span><span>the poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I again emphasise that this might be a cry in futility given the FijiFirst Government misguided 
<br/>ethos for equal citizenry which has blinded them, and not even acknowledging or mentioning anywhere 
<br/>in their budget documents that 74.8 percent of the poor are </span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>. They do not want to recognize that 
<br/>their false ideology of equal citizenry has left the indigenous </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> behind economically or maybe it 
<br/>could be deliberate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What honourable Prime Minister has stated in his campaign speeches at the Provincials Councils 
<br/>reflects the limits of FijiFirst.  They are chained to their ideology of equal citizenry (they are blinded by 
<br/>it) and this has left the indigenous people of Fiji behind. It has been taken to the extreme where ethnic 
<br/>data which reveal anomalies, is suppressed, kept secret and demonized.  From the FijiFirst treason </span><span>coup</span><span>
<br/>of 2006 and its’ imposed 2013 Constitution and laws which are anti-indigenous and contrary to the UN 
<br/>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. All these has clouded their thinking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  FijiFirst  Government  will  never  change  its  ideology  and  the  only  solution  from  my 
<br/>perspective is to remove it. The </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> indigenous Fiji must vote out this FijiFirst Government for the 
<br/>very sake of survival. This is the last chance. A new partnership needs to be produced as we did; which 
<br/>produced the 1997 Constitution must arise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, no mention is made of any increases in the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>
<br/>allowances  where  there  is  a  provision  of  $1.49  million,  the  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>  allowance  which  has  a 
<br/>provision  of  $428,600.    The  honourable  Prime  Minister  was  questioned  and  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs did a question on this but their dancing skills was much better than other leaders. Unfortunately, 
<br/>they were over to dance away from providing clear cut answers. So, the question is - is the </span><span>Turaga ni 
<br/>Koro</span><span> allowances increased or not? They should be given increases given the important roles they play.  I 
<br/>note a provision for $4.24 million for Provincial Councils. This only covers the salary costs of staff but 
<br/>not the operations which has to be covered by the </span><span>Soli ni Yasana</span><span>. The Government should cover both 
<br/>salary costs and operations as the </span><span>Soli ni Yasana</span><span> is a burden on the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> indigenous in the province 
<br/>and is a double taxation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ministry of Trade, Tourism and Commerce, I would like to highlight that the total budget 
<br/>for Cooperatives is $1.071 million. Of this $495,000 is for General Admin, $162,000 for Training and 
<br/>$414,000 for Extension.  This is totally inadequate and an injustice to our people.  What I would like to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1687 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ask is what has the Ministry done to form and assist cooperatives for </span><span>mataqali, yavusa,</span><span> villages,  </span><span>tikina</span><span>, 
<br/>and groups such as </span><span>Yaqona</span><span> Farmers,  </span><span>Dalo</span><span> Farmers, Cassava Farmers, Ginger Farmers  - where these 
<br/>groups are nurtured and mainstreamed into the national and international economy in terms of product 
<br/>development, capacity enhancement, value addition and market access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cooperatives are ideal for these groups given its communal nature and group wide benefits and 
<br/>pooling of resources by individuals into larger groups for economies of scale.  I am very disappointed 
<br/>with the inadequate budget given the importance and potential of cooperatives. At least $5 million to $10 
<br/>million should be allocated to Cooperatives especially for Training and Facilitation by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the First Home Grant, this has been mentioned from this side of Parliament - that provision is 
<br/>discriminatory and no such grants exist for building on </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land except you have to use your FNPF.  
<br/>This grant needs to be extended to those who wish to build on </span><span>mataqali </span><span>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>              In terms of some of the issues raised by the other side of Parliament, I again reiterate that what 
<br/>they are saying is wrong that the Opposition does not want to assist people.  Of course we want people to 
<br/>be assisted.  And one of the comments stated that “the Professor should go back to school”. Do you 
<br/>understand that at the university that the Professor holds the highest level of academic position? Do you 
<br/></span><span>understand the academic requirements of a Professor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             (Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- You need a PhD, you need to publish in the journals and et cetera.  
<br/>How can you say that to a Professor that he should go back to school?  How many of you have PhDs?  
<br/>He has PhDs, so you cannot compare yourself to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            (Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I mean you guys should go back to school.  The other one called one 
<br/>of the Opposition Members as having a pea-sized brain. We need to ensure that this Parliament remains 
<br/>honourable.  Judging from the amount of derogatory words thrown from the other side, I think they 
<br/>should be taken to the Privileges Committee before this Parliament ends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister mentioned Bill No.17 where consultations were done.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this is a joke to say that consultations were done, because there were no consultations 
<br/>done, and it was only done after.  Even for us, we were enlightening the population on that, we were 
<br/>taken to CID and spent the whole night there and the next few nights being interviewed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I do not even know who complained which resulted in us being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taken in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  are  always  saying  past  Governments  have  not  done  anything.    If  they  had  not  done 
<br/>anything, then why are the roads here, why is the airport here, why are the wharves here, why is Nadi 
<br/>Airport  here,  why  is  the  Monasavu  Hydro  Scheme  there?    It  has  been  repeated  by  you  that  past 
<br/>Governments have not done anything.

<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  why  are  they  always  bringing  up  Mr.  Sitiveni  Rabuka  and  Ms. 
<br/>Lynda  Tabuya?    They  complained  about  them  and  mentioned  their  names  about  15  times,  I  was 
<br/>counting it.  What are you paranoid about?  Are you afraid or what?  Are you afraid of the survey 
<br/>which was done where they were leading in the polls and that you will be voted out and that is what 
<br/>is going to happen?  So stop having a phobia about them.  You campaign in peace and let everyone 
<br/>else campaign in peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to echo what honourable Attorney-General had mentioned where he stated that 
<br/>most honourable Members of the Opposition pulled out the ethnic card to threaten stability in the 
<br/>country.  Who is doing that?  We are just contributing in a meaningful way. My contribution today 
<br/>is backed up by research data. It is an alternative development and clear genuine partnerships, which 
<br/>is what  I am talking about.  It is not bringing about racial instability or threatening stability.  So, 
<br/>please, stop misleading Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 8.20 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR.  I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, fellow 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen; I rise to affirm the Ministry of Health and Medical Service’s full support as 
<br/>well as my support for the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  commend  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  and  staff  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy, who had worked tirelessly particularly during that week, even though we were hosting the 
<br/>Pacific Island Leaders in the Pacific Islands Forum and also for the vision given by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, his decisive leadership and willingness and urging all of us to deliver not only in 
<br/>terms  of  the  Budget  but  all  the  services  and  encouraging  all  of  us,  whether  we  are  Ministers  or 
<br/>Assistant Ministers or Members of Parliament to ensure that no one is indeed left behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our budget is $395 million.  Sir, it is actually $413 million because $17.2 million is in Head 
<br/>50  for  Public  Private  Partnership  initiatives  such  as  the  Lautoka  Health  Care  Fiji,  the  Private 
<br/>Partnership  with  GPs,  Free  Dental  Practitioners  Scheme,  Private  Laboratories,  Radiology  and 
<br/>Outsourcing Biomedical and Laboratory Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Budget book, it says very clearly what we have to do.  We 
<br/>are  going to  ensure that  we march towards universal  health coverage and this is  SDG 3 on  good 
<br/>health and wellbeing.   Sir, we want to be able to ensure that we continue to strengthen our primary 
<br/>healthcare system, also that our secondary healthcare system is actually stronger and more robust, 
<br/>but also our tertiary level healthcare system.  And the tertiary level healthcare system is the work that 
<br/>is being done in our big hospitals at CWM and Lautoka, and more importantly now with Health Care 
<br/>Fiji and PPP that is happening in Lautoka where open heart surgery and radiotherapy will be available 
<br/>for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in primary healthcare, our major focus remains both in non-communicable 
<br/>disease and communicable disease, and ensuring that our children are given the opportunity of a good 
<br/>quality  of  life  by  being  able  to  roll  out  programmes  such  as  our  expanded  programme  on 
<br/>immunisation, so that we can be able to mitigate against vaccine preventable diseases.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we are in the new normal and the Ministry of Health continues to put emphasis 
<br/>on  primary  healthcare  because  we  have  found  that  working  on  primary  healthcare,  creating  that 
<br/>surveillance systems, ensuring that we are liaising with a community health workers, having a zone-
<br/>based approach to the whole of Fiji that we can be able to identify and deal with emerging threats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  has  been  an  allocation  of  more  than  $1  million  for  the  National  Centre  for  Health 
<br/>Promotion,  Communicable  Disease  Prevention,  Non-Communicable  Disease  Prevention,  WASH, 
<br/>Leptospirosis Control, Dengue Prevention and Control.  This is not including the support that we 
<br/>receive from development partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these public health initiatives will ensure that we treat and effectively manage 
<br/>emerging threats, such as leptospirosis, typhoid and monkeypox that we have seen have now become 
<br/>a  public  health  disease  of  concern,  and  continue  to  work  with  COVID-19.    In  addition,  we  will 
<br/>continue to resource more than 200 facilities and work with the community, with our boots on the 
<br/>ground approach, to combat COVID-19, measles and NTDs.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, back in 1995, the Ministers of Health in the Pacific, in their biennial meeting, 
<br/>met together and they set out a concept called the Healthy Island initiative where they agreed that 
<br/>our children are nurtured in body and mind, environments invite learning and leisure, people work in

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>age with dignity, ecological balances or social pride and the ocean which sustains us is protected.  
<br/>We have found that in this intervening period with COVID-19, these concepts remain true.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  on  21</span><span>st</span><span>  June,  2022,  re-launched  with  genuine 
<br/>interest our Heathy Settings Approach.  In this Parliament about two years ago, I talked about the 
<br/>health promoting schools concept where more than 300 schools in Fiji from more than a thousand 
<br/>schools are now health-promoting schools.  You will see some of the signboards out there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  now  also  have  healthy  settings,  for  example,  in  workplace  organisations,  because  we 
<br/>found  that  in  OHS,  there  is  a  bit  of  emphasis  on  the  safety  component  rather  than  the  health 
<br/>component.    When  this  was  launched,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  was  a  big  uptake  by  Government 
<br/>Departments and corporate bodies that want to work with us.  The next step is to move to faith-based 
<br/>organisations and health promoting communities, and we believe this is a way in which we could be 
<br/>able to target specifically the NCD surge that we have and also communicable diseases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  with  secondary  and  tertiary  healthcare,  the  CWM  Hospital  has  $46  million 
<br/>allocated to it, $20 million for Labasa, and as you are aware, Sir, personal emoluments, fuel and oil 
<br/>and oxygen are the major costs in running a hospital.  Nevertheless, we will continue to ensure that 
<br/></span><span>we strengthen, not only secondary healthcare but also tertiary level care, where there is a higher level 
<br/></span><span>of  specialised  care  within  these  hospitals  and  these  may  include  some  of  the  specialists  that  we 
<br/>already have and also specialists that we will have when Health Care Fiji is running well on its own.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is an allocation of nearly $2.5 million for the purchase of equipment.  Also, 
<br/>we have to remember that there is another allocation of $3 million for  Emergency Radiology and 
<br/>Laboratory  Services.    Honourable  Salote  Radrodro  had  talked  about  that case  that  waited  for  CT 
<br/>scan,  Mr.  Speaker,  with  this  $3  million  allocation,  we  do  not  need  do  that  because  we  can  then 
<br/>outsource it, for example, to Oceania Hospital or to another provider that has a CT scan in private 
<br/>practice because that allocation has been made available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  $1.5  million  allocated  for  overseas  referral  but  understanding  and 
<br/>knowing that Health Care Fiji is now coming on board and during this transition period, this amount 
<br/>that is needed may actually, over the intervening years, reduce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have $300,000 that is set aside for medical teams.  Mr. Speaker, now that the borders 
<br/>have opened into Fiji, there are medical teams that come nearly every week and some of them need 
<br/>transportation,  accommodation  and  this  allocation  is  provided  to  ensure  that  there  is  a  seamless 
<br/>organisation done for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also have $900,000 set aside for early intervention, directed to the Frank 
<br/>Hilton organisation.   This  is a wonderful organisation and with  this, we  will ensure that they  are 
<br/>equipped to identify early children needing support and sustain a programme to help them, including 
<br/>mainstreaming  them.    One  of  their  successful  programmes  that  we  have  been  working  on  is 
<br/>identifying  and  treating  deafness  in  children  and  also  their  wheelchair  programme  for  disabled 
<br/>children, to ensure that they are robust wheelchairs that can be able to withstand the needs of our 
<br/>geography and also our environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have $2.25 million set aside for emergency evacuation by air from rural and maritime 
<br/>areas.  Mr. Speaker, I remember the days when I was a young doctor and this allocation was smaller.  
<br/>There were times when patients were needed to come urgently but we did not have enough providers 
<br/>or we did not have enough funding.  Therefore, they had to wait until the next boat. In some instances, 
<br/>some  of  them  did  not  make  it,  and  if  they  arrived  they  were  too  late.    Sir,  that  does  not  happen 
<br/>anymore because we now have several providers that tender and provide that service for us, and this

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1691 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget  is  all throughout  Fiji  to  ensure that if any Fijian in  any rural or maritime area that has an 
<br/>emergency and needs to come over very quickly, a doctor and a team will go over and pick the patient 
<br/>up and bring them back.  There have been instances over the last few years where a flying surgical 
<br/>team  actually  goes  across  and  provides  a  much-needed  operation  to  save  the  person,  or  in  some 
<br/>instances, to save the mother and the child of a baby being born by caesarean section.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, $211,000 is set aside for the Fiji Albinism Project, in ensuring that no one is, 
<br/>indeed left, behind because we know that apart from the social and psychological challenges albinism 
<br/>may pose, but there are, indeed, some significant medical issues that need to be looked after in those 
<br/>with albinism including the fact that they have challenges with skin diseases and skin cancer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with the PPP with Health Care Fiji in Lautoka, the Ministry and Health Care 
<br/>Fiji Management are facilitating the gradual handover operations  through the transition period.  I 
<br/>have alluded that $30 million is being set aside in Head 50 to be able to help or support that, apart 
<br/>from the fact that $28 million has also been appropriated for Lautoka Hospital in its operational cost, 
<br/>and this is an increase from $780,000 from last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  led  by  my  Permanent  Secretary,  remains  fully  engaged  in  the 
<br/></span><span>discussion and site visits to ensure that the transition is smooth and seamless, while maintaining full 
<br/></span><span>functions for the two Hospitals of Lautoka and Ba.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have continued, as a Government, to provide salaries of all workers who are yet to make 
<br/>that transition and those who do not choose to join Health Care Fiji will remain and be redeployed 
<br/>within the Ministry’s Health facilities. We look at opportunities for them to be able to strengthen 
<br/>some of the work being done in Sigatoka, for example, or in the Tavua Sub-Divisional Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  members  of  the  public  that  go  to  Lautoka  and  Ba  will  do  so  at  no  cost  as 
<br/>currently the practice.  Health Care Fiji will be responsible for all aspects of delivery of services and 
<br/>some of the changes we can look forward to as a result of this PPP include:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Division.    We  are  confident  that  with  the  PPP,  what  it  will  bring  into  the  Health  Care 
<br/>Service Fiji is brighter and better future for heath in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have set aside in the Budget about $2 million for maintenance works in our 
<br/>Sub-Divisional Hospitals, health centres and nursing stations.  Again, as I have alluded to, this does 
<br/>not include some of the funding that is available that is coming through donor support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in Head 50, $2 million is set, aside as I have alluded to, for the maintenance of 
<br/>all health facilities but there are some payments that we have outstanding, like the upgrading works 
<br/>for Lautoka Theatre and X-Ray Department that has to be paid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Budget, there is $2.2 million for the Labasa interior renovation and the beginning of 
<br/>work at Savusavu Hospital which is $2 million which is for the initial stage of land stabilisation and 
<br/>further refurbishment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are committed to the upgrading of these new facilities and as discussed in Parliament also 
<br/>earlier, Mr. Speaker, some of our nursing stations have been changed and they have been upgraded 
<br/>to health centres with a nurse practitioner, and in the case of Tau and Nawaicoba, even a doctor is 
<br/></span><span>now available there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  his  response,  honourable  Seniloli  remarked  on  IT  connectivity  for  health 
<br/>facilities.    I  need to  point  out  that Government  has allocated in  this Budget $1.3 million  for  ICT 
<br/>infrastructure and network for the purchase of hardware network infrastructure.  In addition, we have 
<br/>support coming through World Bank to be able to support us with the new connections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recently,  we  have  installed  and  is  now  functioning  the  Recompression 
<br/>Chamber  at  the  CWM  Hospital  to  the  tune  of  $680,000.    We  have  funding  available  during  this 
<br/>Budget and we are thankful to the Ministry of Economy and the honourable Minister for giving us 
<br/>funding so that we can continue to train practitioners to be able to provide treatment for those who 
<br/>have decompression illness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the free General Practitioners (GPs) Scheme has been talked about in detail 
<br/>by quite a few of my colleagues but sufficient to say that $1 million has been set aside and there are 
<br/>now 38 GPs.  I have talked to a few of them and they are very excited to be part of this programme.  
<br/>As you know, a lot of our GPs began their service within the Civil Service and at some stage in their 
<br/>career, they were looking at ways to be able to contribute back to the Civil Service and they find that 
<br/>this works well for them because they are able to do that and by contributing to nation-building by 
<br/>seeing ordinary Fijians that come through their door, but at a cost so that their businesses can remain 
<br/>viable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded by the honourable Minister for Economy, there is an incentive 
<br/>now for GPs to establish new clinics in rural areas, like Nawaicoba, Malolo, Drasa, Sabeto, Seaqaqa, 
<br/>Nasarawaqa, Korolevu and Pacific Harbour, to name a few. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  have  $500,000  set  aside  in  the  new  budget  for  the  General 
<br/>Practitioners Scheme - this  is  the private  Dental  Practitioners. Again, there is  a lot of  excitement 
<br/>within the oral health community on the ability to be able to also contribute in this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  has  been  some  discussions  this  week  about  the  </span><span>Nasi  ni  Koro  </span><span>or 
<br/>community health workers.  We have $3 million set aside for the 1,582 community health workers 
<br/>or </span><span>Nasi ni Koro. </span><span> What we do is, every working day, there is an amount of money that is paid for 
<br/>them  so  all  of  them  do  not  necessarily  receive  their  wages  on  the  particular  Thursday  that  civil 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1693 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>servants will get theirs because there are certain times during the week in which their payments are 
<br/>made.  It is dependent on ensuring that their paperwork comes through and is seen and processed.  
<br/>We have also worked hand in hand with the Ministry of Economy to ensure that this process becomes 
<br/>simpler, so that they will be able to receive their wage when it is due.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision by the honourable Prime Minister has ensured that we have a stronger foot on 
<br/>the ground in our communities.  What we do know is that, this programme, since we have started 
<br/>incentivising  community  health  workers  with  allowances,  we  have  had  more  community  health 
<br/>workers because even in places such as the Lami-Nausori corridor, some of the informal settlements 
<br/>now have community health workers who are on this scheme and they actually receive allowances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We liaise with them, they are our hand and foot on the ground.  They do their surveillance, 
<br/>they identify those who are unwell and they tell the zone medical officers and zone nurses, so we see 
<br/>that this system is working very well.  That started before COVID-19.  One of the strengths of our 
<br/>response  to  COVID-19  and  also  the  response  to  the  vaccination  campaign  was  the  work  of  the 
<br/>community health workers, and I would like to thank them at this juncture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked about how social determinants of health are so important.  
<br/></span><span>As the Minister for Health with my senior officials in the Ministry of Health, we are so pleased to 
<br/></span><span>see the work that has been done in other areas - the infrastructural work, the roads that are being built 
<br/>and bridges because these all contribute towards the social determinants of health because when there 
<br/>is access by roads, then people can come to our health centres. We can be able to go and visit them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also thankful and grateful that the Budget also sets aside a significant portion for social 
<br/>protection because this social protection will ensure that  if there are three young children in  your 
<br/>family, they have the mechanism where the parents would be able to ensure that they have a good 
<br/>diet because there is obviously $30 a month available to be able to use that for their good diet or take 
<br/>them to the hospital, for example, when they are unwell.  These all contribute to a healthy society, it 
<br/>is just not health on its own.  So, in a way, those social determinants are all indirectly affecting health 
<br/>- the access to roads, proper water supply, water sanitation and hygiene, and a few others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  finish,  I  just  also  want  to  say  that  throughout  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, the Government led by the honourable Prime Minister showed that we cared for our civil 
<br/>servants by ensuring that their salaries were never touched.  There was suggestion by Opposition to 
<br/>cut their salary by 20 percent up to 35 percent. We never did it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  only  that  but  we  have  restored  their  allowances  -  maritime  and  rural  allowances  and 
<br/>overtime beginning with nurses with the Supplementary Budget at the beginning of this year and 
<br/>now for the other technical officers within the Ministry of Health up to Band F.  This is a true sign 
<br/>of the Government putting the Civil Service first and understanding the important roles they play 
<br/>with regard to health in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to finish just on two things before I sit down. I know the first bell 
<br/>has rung.  This is now my fourth or fifth Budget and one thing that has become very clear to me is 
<br/>whenever we have Budget debates, the Opposition has not ever come up with an alternative budget. 
<br/>They have never ever told us an alternative budget to hear…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Hold on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have never heard the honourable Leader of the Opposition or one of the leaders of their Party

<div><span>stand up and say, “We are going to have a budget of $3.2 billion. We will get $2 billion from this, 
<br/>this and this. We will loan $1.2 billion”. They never have.  They have never even told us how much 
<br/>they will set aside for health itself.  They have never told us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Throughout this week, all we have been hearing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the same complaint and 
<br/>complaint.  It is not easy to be able to balance a budget.  It is not easy to be able to ensure that a 
<br/>budget is provided that sees to all Fijians.  We have heard from the Opposition, “We want budget for 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  We want budget only for the sugarcane growers.” This Government creates a budget for 
<br/>all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  All  Fijians  are  affected  positively  by  the  Budget.    This, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>again, is another sign that we truly put Fiji first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It may be the last time for majority of the Opposition Members to be here in Parliament so 
<br/>before they leave this Parliamentary sitting, they have to reflect on the fact that they have never given 
<br/>us an alternative budget because a truly functioning Opposition will do so.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SIGARARA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament: Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my full support to the 2022-2023 National Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, I must thank the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy 
<br/>together  with  his  team  for  preparing  a  Budget  that  does  not  only  have  resilience  but  provides  a 
<br/>platform for all Fijians for the road to economic recovery. Allow me to also thank the honourable 
<br/>Mosese  Bulitavu,  honourable  Mere  Naulumatua  and  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  for  their 
<br/>contribution, giving their heart out with their mind and their support. I think credit should be given 
<br/>when it is due and I thank them for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is very deserving for all Fijian because it is structured with the vision 
<br/>to strengthen support for individual families, providing a safety net for our senior citizens, providing equal 
<br/>opportunities for students with the education and opportunities cementing the aim of ensuring economic 
<br/>stability and growth and many more.  Given the nature of the impacts of the two global crisis such as 
<br/>COVID-19 and the Russian-Ukraine war, we as a nation, demonstrated persistency throughout the cause 
<br/>of the obstacles and the difficulties.  But one thing is clear, the Budget echoed a very strong message that 
<br/>even in the darkest days or crisis of our economy, Fiji would not just recover, but  would emerged from 
<br/>the pandemic with base and resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is truly empowering that we fought and moved together as a nation.  With 
<br/>decisive leadership of our honourable Prime Minister, he has put in place a Government to trust to put 
<br/>our hopes and confidence in.  Additionally, I know that the honourable Prime Minister knows where he 
<br/>is taking us and for us as followers, know that he is leading us to a better future.  Similar to the 40 years 
<br/>Moses led the Israelites, God heard his promise to always lead him and in Fiji, God kept and anointed 
<br/>our honourable Prime Minister with the vision of equality, harmony, unity and modernity by building a 
<br/>fair and just society for all Fijians.  I can confidently say in this august Parliament that the cause of the 
<br/>direction that was started by the honourable Prime Minister was not altered and neither disturbed, but it 
<br/>remained steady till today.  This is the kind of leadership Fiji needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2022-2023 Budget has been well crafted with the tremendous support and 
<br/>participation of the Fijian people.  The true Fijian spirit of never giving up in the face of adversity has 
<br/>propelled us to the road of recovery.  The payout assistance under the inflation mitigation package is not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a hand out or a freebie, as most of the Opposition Members are indicating.  However, it is targeted to 
<br/>useful resource to ease the struggles of every individual family to provide more food on the table.  For 
<br/>example, the $180 per child for the next six months, $180 payout for the Government pensioners, $180 
<br/>aftercare fund, $180 for social welfare recipients, $180 for all tertiary students and bus fare subsidy by 
<br/>10 percent across the board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also noted the existing incentives and subsidises that will continue for the 
<br/>next financial year.  The removal of the VAT from the expanded list of 21 essential items, the continuous 
<br/>subsidy such as the direct subsidy of water and electricity, bus fares, removal of market vendors fees and 
<br/>many more.  These targeted resources are strategies that will address inflation.  Reacting to the Bible 
<br/>scripture in the </span><span>Book of Mathew 7:9:</span><span>  It says and I quote: “You parents, if your children ask for a loaf of 
<br/>bread, do you give him a stone instead.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most certainly not.  As we parents, we will provide for whatever need for our 
<br/>children.  Therefore, the basic metaphor for this verse is that, a human father would not refuse a basic 
<br/>desire for his son.  So God too would not refuse a basic need for one of his followers.  Similarly, through 
<br/>this promising compassionate Budget, the Fijian Government will not turn a blind eye to the struggles of 
<br/>every Fijian but it will make every means to make the struggles of everyone, a priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  lend  my  full  support  and  appreciation  on  the  introduction  of  the  new 
<br/>scholarship scheme known as the Skills Qualification.  Sir, such a Scheme is very rewarding because it 
<br/>will provide a platform for every student, irrespective of their background or geographical setting with 
<br/>opportunity to afford higher skill education. Mr. Speaker, Sir, what a beauty with this Scheme, there is a 
<br/>Chinese proverbs that says and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“If you give a man a fish he will be hungry tomorrow, but if you teach a man to fish, he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be richer forever”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And it is in the proverb that the Skilsl Qualification Scheme will be the right tool to empower, give 
<br/>students an occupation that will feed them for over a lifetime. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  the  launch  of  the  Ministry’s  10  Year  Strategic  Plan  last  year,  it  was 
<br/>provided that the way towards transforming rural areas to be resilient, productive and sustainable it is 
<br/>with the ambitions that the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management is 
<br/>grateful for its Budget allocations of $15 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  continue  to  utilise  the  funds  allocated  to  the  Self  Help 
<br/>Programme, Community Access Roads, Footpaths, Foot Bridges, High Priority Water and High Priority 
<br/>Sanitation to implement projects aim to benefit the communities in the rural and maritime areas in Fiji 
<br/>and with the forward looking vision to build up a rural economy to be a transitional pillar in meeting the 
<br/>central efforts of reducing poverty and increase in economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  $2 million is budged for the next financial year to cater for the community 
<br/>access roads, footpaths and foot bridges through this budget allocation, the Ministry is confident that it 
<br/>will continue to place more importance in opening up greater opportunities for the rural and maritime 
<br/>communities such as roads and community access roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by saying this, we want to provide assistance by not only improving accessibility 
<br/>for the communities but particularly for the children.  Sir, the Fijian Government is doing this so that we 
<br/>can help these children from walking for several hours and even crossing creeks and rivers just to get to 
<br/>their school.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  enlighten  this  august  Chamber  for  the  past  three  years,  the  Ministry 
<br/>implemented  278  projects  with  a  total  cost  of  over  $6  million  on  average  31  percent  projects  were 
<br/>implemented each  year which is equivalent to 86 new projects. These projects were the strategies to 
<br/>improve communities’ access to services, maintain the safety of all Fijians to either exclusive disability 
<br/>or older person accessibility, improving productivity and maintaining the higher socio-economic quality 
<br/>with the aim to alleviate the struggles of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Self  Help  Programme  is  one  of  the  key  capital  programme  under  the 
<br/>Ministry  to  ensure  communities  have  sustainable  living  standards  and  providing  sustainable  growth 
<br/>through the resilience communities.  Therefore, in the next financial year, the Ministry has been allocated 
<br/>with a budget of $1 million for this programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the past three years, the Ministry implemented 411 projects with the 
<br/>total cost of approximately $5 million.  With all these development projects, the Ministry has witnessed 
<br/>the  communities’  improvement  to  access  clean  and  safe  drinking  water,  proper  sanitation  for  toilet 
<br/>facilities, better and affordable access to training centres and improvement in the standard of living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  fulfil the  constitutional  rights  of all  Fijians in accessing quality  and  safe 
<br/></span><span>drinking  water  with  adequate  quantities  in  all  the  rural  areas,  the  Ministry  commends  the  additional 
<br/></span><span>budget allocation for $300,000 towards the high priority water and sanitation.  A total of $800,000 for 
<br/>the next fiscal year will be consistent support to meeting the global efforts in ensuring the availability and 
<br/>sustainable management of water and sanitation to benefit all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore under the Ministry’s Public Sector Investment Programmes (PSIP), 
<br/>the Government has now extended the reach of its services to the rural communities through strategically 
<br/>placed government stations to serve the provisions and districts throughout remote rural communities in 
<br/>Fiji.  This would include the establishment of a new government station and yet to be commissioned in 
<br/>rural remote areas such as Namarai in Ra, Wainikoro in Macuata, as well as the construction of the new 
<br/>government  quarters  in  duplex  in  Kubulau  in  Bua.    About  14,000  Fijians  from  more  than  3,000 
<br/>households from the surrounding villages and settlements near the government stations are expected to 
<br/>benefit from the implementation of these projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final payment of these projects will be available in this new financial year 
<br/>202-2023 before they are ready for commissioning.  Such a development is a testimony of government 
<br/>intention of ensuring that every Fijian in our rural communities are able to access our service at their 
<br/>doorstep.  In the recent months, there has been an increase in collaboration with key State agencies to 
<br/>prepare  the  Ministry  in  improving  its  planning  for  inclusive  rural  development  implementation  of 
<br/>programmes.  A pilot project is currently being sampled at Wainilotulevu and Nasoqo Village in the 
<br/>district of Veinuqa in the province of Namosi.  These two communities have been identified as vulnerable 
<br/>communities  who  have  just  been  accessed  by  road  this  financial  year  2021-2022  and  the  integrated 
<br/>government approach would be the dawn of the new era in the whole of Government approach in uplifting 
<br/>the livelihoods of all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, partnership collaboration with other government ministries, the 
<br/>private  sector,  CSOs  and  development  partners  are  going  to  be  at  the  heart  of  this  new  radical 
<br/>transformations  in  the  rural  areas.    The  old  Fijian  custom  of  </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span>,  meaning  community 
<br/>cooperation is so important at the national level, as it is an internal approach which is even more needed 
<br/>in today’s context.  Through such incentives and collaborations, not only do we ensure that we develop 
<br/>a culture of resilience, productivity and sustainability in development of rural areas but more importantly, 
<br/>that we are united in tackling today’s ever changing global challenges together as Fijians.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this strategic, inclusive and integrated approach in rural development is in line

<br/>COVID-19.  The Ministry is forever optimistic and more determined than ever to spread positive change

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I fully lend my support towards the 2022-2023 Budget.</span><span> Vinaka vakalevu. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset, I wish to thank you for accommodating my 
<br/>request.    The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  fellow  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament, I rise to speak in support of the 2022-2023 National Budget delivered by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  join  my  Government  colleagues  and  congratulate  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and Minister for Economy and his team led by Mr. Shiri Krishna Gounder for a smart, 
<br/>sustainable and fit-for-purpose Budget.  Allow me to make few general comments before I turn to specific 
<br/>remarks relating to the areas of employment productivity, industrial relations, youth and sports that falls 
<br/>my ministerial portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a profound and a solid vision of our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and our Government in ensuring that we deliver the best to all Fijians despite the impact of COVID-19 
<br/>that was felt heavily in our small island nation.   Added to this, the current Russia-Ukraine conflict is 
<br/>having a major impact on our economy and also on the livelihood of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite this external pressure this Budget builds on the strong foundation laid 
<br/>out in previous budgets under this Government.  The projection of 12.4 percent economic growth this 
<br/>year is another milestone achievement for our Government.  It gives us confidence in planning for the 
<br/>future.    Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Members  from  the  Opposition  side  fail  to  accept  these 
<br/>figures.  The Opposition views lack substance or any form of informed intelligence to back any of their 
<br/>claims.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is an impressive documentation of our consolidation and recovery 
<br/>that underlines how this Government has dealt with the external or global and internal challenges through 
<br/>these difficult times. Sir, today, we are proud to say that the Bula Boom is already being felt by our nation. 
<br/>It is unfortunate that the Opposition does not have any vision for this nation.  They are only concerned 
<br/>about petty issues while the FijiFirst Government has carefully crafted this Budget for the betterment and 
<br/>wellbeing of all Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Budget is a solid indicator of our honourable Prime Minister’s leadership 
<br/>and the commitment that we all should put our people first in our agenda.  The FijiFirst Government has 
<br/>stood  by  all  Fijians  in  various  crisis  whether  it  be  natural  disasters,  effects  of  climate  change  or  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic.  We stand united with our people and we will continue to deliver the best for all 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government through the visionary and responsible leadership of 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister will not be stopped by short-sighted and ridiculous ideas floating from the 
<br/>Opposition just to please a few or overblown ideas to massage their inflated egos.  Through reforms we 
<br/>have taken Government services right to the doorstep, of all Fijians no matter where they are and we will 
<br/>continue to serve our people and place them in the centre of our reforms, as we have done during these 
<br/>past two terms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a progressive, inclusive and people-focused Government that puts 
<br/>Fiji and its people first every time.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to specific remarks relating to the areas of employment, productivity 
<br/>and industrial relation,  youth and sports, that falls under my Ministerial portfolio.  During the recent 
<br/>Pacific Island Forum (PIF) Meeting I met the honourable Prime Minister of Australia when he visited the 
<br/>Australian  Pacific  Training  Coalition  (APTC)  Age  Care  Pilot  Programme  that  prepares  our  Fijian 
<br/>candidates to meet the industry’s standards in Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Australian Prime Minister stated that there was a high demand for aged care workers because 
<br/>of Australian’s high ageing population.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, when our borders were re-opened in December 
<br/>last year, there was a lot of noise from the Opposition except honourable Bulitavu that a wrong decision 
<br/>has been made.  This is when we began to meet the demands in Australia and New Zealand for our 
<br/>workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture,  may  I  also  congratulate our honourable Prime Minister  for 
<br/>bringing unity amongst the Pacific family.  Today, I stand in this august Parliament to announce that 
<br/>another milestone has been achieved under the Vuvale Partnership which was signed by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government and the Australian Government.  A total of 1,820 Fijians exceeding the estimate target of 
<br/>$1,000 are now participating under the Pacific Australian Labour Mobility Programme from January 
<br/>2022 to the first week of July, 2022 alone.  But in total Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have 5,986 for the PLS and 
<br/></span><span>the seasonal work for Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a huge positive outcome that ensures that out economic recovery starts 
<br/>sooner rather than later, following the re-opening of Fiji’s borders in December, 2021.  It means that 
<br/>thousands of Fijian households have a long term and secure source of income with great spin-off benefits 
<br/>to local communities and businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While this schemes are greatly welcomed, my Ministry will be pro-active in ensuring that our 
<br/>own employment market is maintained to meet our own labour market demands.  This means following 
<br/>through on the measures for skills training for greater local employment ability in this Budget.  This 
<br/>2022–2023 Budget as the honourable Attorney-General has outlined in detail means we will build on our 
<br/>recovery and not simply reactivate measures to external pressures through the continued impact of the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Europe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this also means that we must be innovative and creative in using our resources 
<br/>to sustain ourselves better despite ongoing global conditions that make it difficult for us.  I will outline 
<br/>some  of  these  innovations  among  our  youth  and  in  this  sporting  arena  later  in  my  presentation.    As 
<br/>outlined in the Budget, the starting point is the cutting of the Budget deficit almost into half.  This makes 
<br/>for a smart budget for its vision and financial planning to continue to look after all Fijians and at the same 
<br/>time build our economy in a sustainable and fit-for-purpose manner.  By continuing the wide range of tax 
<br/>benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and improved policy and structural conditions for business, the ball is now 
<br/>firmly in the court of the business sector to continue the post pandemic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  this  regard,  the  Ministry  of  Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial 
<br/>Relations will continue to play a positive role in supporting both sides of the economic equation equally 
<br/>for the employers and the employee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has enforced compliance to the National Minimum Wages and the 
<br/>10 sectoral base minimum wages.  This ensures employers pay the right wages to their workers with 
<br/>effective audits conducted by the Compliance Officers at the Ministry.  As announced in the Revised 
<br/>Budget 2021-2022, the National Minimum Wage Rates and the 10 sectoral based minimum wage rate 
<br/>was said to be increased in four stages.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first two have already been implemented 
<br/>on 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022 and 1</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2022, while the other two will be implemented on 1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2022 and 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2023.  Increasing the National Minimum Wage to $4 per hour is a great achievement of this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government.  This will ensure that we will continue to enforce the minimum terms and conditions of 
<br/>employment and engage in good faith employment relations with the employers and workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in the FNPF contributions to workers’ wages is another step in the 
<br/>right direction that will help workers save more through their FNPF contribution for a secure future.   I 
<br/>was surprised with the comments from the National Secretary of the Fiji Trade Union Congress in his 
<br/>recent media statement on why FNPF contributions were not restored to its original level.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it seems that he fails to understand the meaning of recovery, maybe to attract media attention.  He is 
<br/>ignoring the fact that 92 percent of the employed in the formal sector are back at work compared to the 
<br/>pre-COVID-19 levels.  I hope that he reads the Budget Address in a fair manner to appreciate and know 
<br/>exactly what the FijiFirst Government is doing to benefit all workers in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  $2  million  initiative  announced  for  the  ‘Stronger  Together  Job  Support 
<br/>Scheme’  for  1,500  out  of  work  Fijians  is  an  excellent  opportunity  for  our  Fijian  workers  to  secure 
<br/>employment  at  the  same  time  help  the  industry  to  grow.    Sir,  the  rebranding  of  TVET  to  Skills 
<br/>Qualification is an excellent move that will attract more students to take up skills qualification at tertiary 
<br/>training institutions and at the same time assist in the skills shortage faced at the industry level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also welcome the effort in extending the Employment Tax Scheme until 
<br/></span><span>December 2024 with the 300 percent tax deduction of the amount of any salary or wages paid for the first 
<br/>time workers.  In particular, the tax deduction of 400 percent for the salary and wages paid to persons 
<br/>with  disabilities  who  have  been  employed  for  a  period  three  years.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  another 
<br/>positive and inclusive step in narrowing the employment ability gap of persons with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we encourage and support social dialogue as an effective mechanism paving 
<br/>the way to bring about resolutions to disputes and conflicts amongst disputing parties, unlike what I read 
<br/>in the newspaper with honourable Leawere misleading Parliament yesterday about the compliance.  Sir, 
<br/>this will strengthen the consultation and co-operation between workers and employers within the labour 
<br/>market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  Minister  for  Economy  for  the  allocation  for  improved 
<br/>productivity. On 13th June, 2019, Fiji launched its first ever Fiji National Productivity Master Plan 2021-
<br/>2036.    Productivity  is  an  important  agenda,  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  for  all  developing  countries  and  is  an 
<br/>effective way for constant improvement and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we welcome the allocated budget for the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  This 
<br/>continued  level  of  funding  during  this  difficult  time  is  testament  to  the  importance  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government has given and will continue to provide for the youth and sports.  As the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General has outlined over 70 percent of Fiji’s population can be classified as youth and it stands to reason 
<br/>that with this youthful population, and support from the other not so youthful demographic, Fiji is also a 
<br/>great and growing sporting nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key focus areas for the Ministry remains in youth and sports, development 
<br/>programmes.  The Budget submission for 2022-2023 is aligned closely to these areas and continuing to 
<br/>drive Government’s agenda that development programmes, developed and managed by the Ministry is 
<br/>made available to all eligible Fijians and it is inclusive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we continue to grow the sector and this sector grows on its own accord, we will focus on new 
<br/>game plans that consider the socioeconomic impact on angles to this growth.  This means that we need 
<br/>to move towards development models that are in touch with global developments.  Sports is now big 
<br/>business, Mr. Speaker, Sir - while we work on and achieve our goals in that direction as a responsible 
<br/>Ministry of a responsible Government we will not forget the small picture that sports is for all. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will ensure that our local communities and community sports, get all the 
<br/>attention  and  care  that  it  deserves.    In  terms  of  youth  development  initiatives  with  an  allocation  of 
<br/>$516,000 the Ministry continues to work with youth groups.  This includes providing empowerment and 
<br/>developing training programmes and initiatives to enable young people in our Fijian community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must realise the potential they have in the vast unutilised land and local resources, and 
<br/>we have found that the youth farm initiative while providing immediate relief during the worst of 
<br/>COVID-19 is a viable means of growing the sector beyond that.  It has now grown into a long term 
<br/>and sustainable project that provides food security, economic opportunities, gainful employment and 
<br/>employment creation opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also intends to increase youth enrolment into our TVET, as we 
<br/>see this as a meeting local employment needs in key areas as well as continuing a workforce that is 
<br/>work  ready  for  initiatives  such  as  the  Pacific  Labour  Mobility  Scheme.    Sports  as  an  enabler  of 
<br/>sustainable development has continued economic impact, not least through sporting remittance but 
<br/>also through the growth of Fiji as a regional sporting power house.  This has included the hosting of 
<br/>a growing range of Oceania level sports as well as more international events that bring in revenue, 
<br/>recognition and promotion of brand Fiji as well as sports Fiji.  We will continue to grow in this rea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from a sports development point of view, the key focus of Government is 
<br/>to continue to invest in local infrastructure.  The growth of high profile Fijian sports people and our 
<br/>sporting teams in the last decades or so has been among other factors due to the investment by this 
<br/>Government as local level infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue to upgrade the existing facilities and development of new facilities across 
<br/>Fiji to enable all Fijians to have access to world class facilities to maximise participation of all Fijians 
<br/>in sports.  This will also involve working with the range of development partners to promote inclusive 
<br/>sporting programmes, in particular in terms of gender inclusivity and promotion of women and girls 
<br/>in sports.  Fiji continues to be the leader in the Pacific region in terms of promotion of gender equality.  
<br/>This has seen women participation continue to increase on a yearly basis with notable achievement 
<br/>for women in sports like the bronze medal won by the Fijiana 7s team at the recent Tokyo Olympic 
<br/>Games and the Fijiana 15s women claiming the 2022 Super Rugby Women’s Competition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the competition of the teams and others such as the Fiji Women’s Soccer 
<br/>and  Netball  team  shows  that  this  programme  has  reached  across  Fiji,  including  the  remote  and 
<br/>maritime areas, and is not restricted to narrow urban corridors.   Again, this is a result of the combined 
<br/>effort  with  the  National  Sporting  Association  for  promotion  of  sports  across  Fiji  with  equal 
<br/>opportunities and access for all Fijians.  Considering the power of sports in community building, the 
<br/>Ministry has worked closely with the Fiji National Sports Commission in empowering communities 
<br/>to take ownership of sports.  The Commission through Government funding has helped set up 46 
<br/>Community Sports Associations around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Community  Sports  Association  is  an  association  of  members  of 
<br/>registered youth clubs, single and multi-sports club and work together to facilitate community sports 
<br/>and physical activities.  The Government is providing funding this year for this Community Sports 
<br/>Association to grow and lead the revival of community and </span><span>tikina</span><span> provincial based competitions with 
<br/>the multi-sports focus.  This $3.81 billion blueprint by the FijiFirst Government only reassures that 
<br/>people and their rights, needs and aspirations are at the heart of our economy.  It is a people-centred 
<br/>budget; a kind, considerate, yet robust budget designed to heal, build and consolidate a prosperous, 
<br/>peaceful and progressive Fiji for all Fijians.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been in this Parliament for the last eight years and this is the first 
<br/>time I have observed an Opposition Member making a Point of Order against an Opposition Member.  
<br/>In fact, it is a very historical day and I will tell you the problem.  The only thing that I can make out 
<br/>is that they are totally confuse, they are divided and the worst thing is, that they do not have any trust 
<br/>in each other.  They are the ones who want to run the country.  It is a shame!  Not only that, I even 
<br/>heard  them  saying,  “Times  up,  times  up”  to  their  own  colleague.    It  is  really  a  sad  day  for  the 
<br/>Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank this august Parliament for the privilege to speak and I fully support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion to approve the 2022-2023 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as you will realise, that brings to an end the number 
<br/>of speakers for today.  We have a full day tomorrow where we will have the Right of Reply from the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy, followed by the Committee of Supply.  Your attention in both the 
<br/>cases is required, so I require a full House tomorrow.  We have a lot of work to do, we have a full 
<br/>day, we can do it.  We now adjourn till tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
