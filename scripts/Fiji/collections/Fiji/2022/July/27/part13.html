<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Programme 1-1-6 - Fiji Mahogany be increased by $500,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T. NAVURELEVU.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- May I just comment, Mr. Chairman, the $250,000 there is for Fiji 
<br/>Mahogany Trust is purely for the administration of the Trust.  The additional $500,000 is to be managed 
<br/>by  the  Trust  as  well  to  help  the  commercial  activities  for  value  adding  in  the  Mahogany  Industry, 
<br/>particularly to increase value adding products for export. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, there are over 50 percent of sawn timber export at the moment, so we need to 
<br/>increase the production of mahogany sawn timber for export.  If this can be increased by $500,000 to 
<br/>assist existing businesses that are already there to increase their capacity to mill, process and export 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to support the motion to increase 
<br/>the allocation on SEG 6 on Fiji Mahogany Trust (FMT).  The reason for  that is, I just want to remind the 
<br/>Parliament on my intervention earlier yesterday with regards to some issues being raised by landowners 
<br/></span><span>on whose land Fiji Hardwood Corporation mahogany plantations are located and when they have these 
<br/></span><span>issues, FMT, I believe is not resourced enough to respond effectively to the wide and varying issues that 
<br/>arise out of the interest of the landowners and the plantations are wide and buried and big and FMT needs 
<br/>to have a very close association with landowners to protect their interest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just one example, as I had noted earlier Mr. Chairman, was these logs that were left to rot in 
<br/>Tailevu belonging to </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Ravouvou</span><span> </span><span>in the </span><span>Vanua o Bure</span><span>.  Just because of a dispute between the 
<br/>dairy farmer and Fiji Hardwood Corporation, in that, it turn the landowners have lost revenue from rotten 
<br/>timbers that has not been stamped.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are driving to Rakiraki, you will see these piles of mahogany on the side of the road, so I 
<br/>would just like to support this motion by the honourable Bulanauca to increase this allocation for the 
<br/>interest of the landowners whose interest is protected by Fiji Mahogany Trust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- In support of the motion by honourable Bulanauca, I think that the 
<br/>motion is a very good one in terms of expansion of the work of the Fiji Mahogany Trust to not only look 
<br/>after  the  affairs of the landowners but also to assist in  getting them to participate  in the  commercial 
<br/>activities generated from the mahogany. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  note  that  Government  has  given  licences  through  their  arms  for  those  who  can  log  the 
<br/>mahogany and also those who can export, et cetera.  So it is unfortunate that not a lot of landowning 
<br/>units  on  whose  lands  that  the  mahogany  have  been  planted  on,  are  actually  not  part  of  these 
<br/>commercial activities. I stand to support the need to increase the allocation for Fiji Mahogany Trust 
<br/>so that we can see some benefit being given to landowning units in terms of commercial activities 
<br/>and other businesses that have been generated from the mahogany trees, currently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the motion being moved by honourable Bulanauca to 
<br/>amend is different from what honourable Tikoduadua is saying.  Honourable Bulanauca is talking 
<br/>about value adding, honourable Tikoduadua is saying that the money be used to resolve disputes, and 
<br/>honourable Aseri Radrodro is saying that we need to get this money to be able to get more landowner 
<br/>participation.  But you have to look at actual trust or the constitution itself to see what it is there for?  
<br/>Honourable Bulanauca knows that the trust actually sits with the Mahogany Industry Council and 
<br/>they participate in that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1751 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The funding here is not to meet the expense of value adding but it is more to do with the 
<br/>coordination between the landowners.  I can tell you where that money goes to  - the trustee fees, 
<br/>travel  expenses,  other  allowances  and  logistics,  meal  allowances,  registration  of  Trust  Board 
<br/>Training, site visits and components and meetings with the beneficiaries - that is where the money 
<br/>goes  to.    In  respect  of  the  actual  value  adding  and  the  access  to  the  mahogany  itself,  of  course 
<br/>landowner groups have actually applied for the licences.  Honourable Bulanauca, was involved in 
<br/>one of those companies and I understand that company is no longer operational and he knows that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Aseri Radrodro, you should know that this does not set up landowner companies.  
<br/>They have the ability to apply themselves and as you know (honourable Bulanauca also knows this) 
<br/>that the Trust was in doldrums for a number of years because of the mismanagement of funds that 
<br/>was  given  to  the  Trust  Fund  -  its  objectives  were  not  being  achieved.  In  respect  of  honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua’s claim about the dispute and timber rotting, - it is obviously a civil matter.  It is not the 
<br/>FMT’s mandate to go and resolve that issue - it is a civil matter that needs to be resolved.  If the Fiji 
<br/>Hardwood Corporation is not cooperating, et cetera, they could have been brought to our attention.  
<br/>I do not know if it was brought to our attention or not but now you have raised it with us, we will 
<br/>talk to them about it. But it is not FMTs mandate nor is it within the FMTs purview to go and resolve 
<br/>a civil matter, if you are talking about accessibility to land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that the Mahogany Trust is more about a  liaison group in 
<br/>respect of how they interact and do the consultations, this amendment to give it more money would, 
<br/>in fact be misplaced, so we recommend that we stick with the $250,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Chairman, the explanation done by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy is understandable, it is for the trustees and I understand that. The landowners have fair 
<br/>access.  If that can be extended to help the landowners and also the existing businesses of other races 
<br/>that  are  already  there,  to  pop  up  the  value  adding  part  of  it  as  has  been  emphasised,  for  export 
<br/>particularly  decking  and  so  on,  on  value  adding.    It  is  very  important  to  be  assisted  somewhere 
<br/>whether through the trust or somewhere along there to help the existing ones and landowners coming 
<br/>into it.. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, as honourable Bulanauca correctly pointed out, that the 
<br/>trust is for that purpose which he has just stated. In respect of doing value adding in terms of other 
<br/>forms of assistance that could be done through other avenues, whether it is through forestry, whether 
<br/>it is through Fiji Hardwood Corporation, as opposed to doing it within the constitutional framework 
<br/>of an organisation that does not have it within its remit of the Constitution to be able to do anything 
<br/></span><span>other than what it is being set up for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members the amendment has been moved and we will vote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the amendment that has been moved by the honourable Bulanauca. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Head 2-1-2-10 Small Grants Project, I see that 
<br/>in terms of the estimate in 2021, it is less in this year’s budget of 2022-2023.  Can we have some 
<br/>clarifications on that SEG, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  My apologies, I did not hear the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  It  is  on  SEG  10  -  Small  Grant  Projects,  just  $2  million  more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocated in the last budget, but now it has been reduced.  Any clarifications on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I  thought  you  would  be  happy  about  that.    It  has  been 
<br/>reduced by $1 million because the current scope of works has been carried out through the PM’s 
<br/>Small Grant Project, the capacity for it to be able to deliver that.  There is no point allocating funding 
<br/>another million dollars just for the sake of it just because we allocated it the last time, so we cut it 
<br/>back to $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  N.T.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-2-6,  I  seek  some 
<br/>clarification  regarding  the  allocation  of  the  small  grants  to  Rabi  Island  Council  and  Kioa  Island 
<br/>Council.  The reason why I am seeking the clarification is that, most of the people who make up the 
<br/>membership  of  these  Island  Council  or  the  particular  ethnic  group,  some  of  them  only  have  Fiji 
<br/>passports and the rest are still very much governed from their own sovereign countries, Kiribati and 
<br/>Tuvalu.  Does the allocation of grants cater only for the people who hold Fiji citizenship or also for 
<br/>those with direct links to the Island Councils under the various sovereign countries?  That is the point 
<br/>of clarification I am seeking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Chairman, essentially it is for the activities of the Rabi 
<br/></span><span>Island  Council.    On  the  allocation  of  the  annual  grant  of  $155,000  -  70  percent  of  the  funds  are 
<br/>diverted for development and 30 percent is to meet the operational cost.  A sum of $307,470 has been 
<br/>released to  date to  meet  the operational  expenses as rent,  utilities, wages, salaries, and stationery 
<br/>expenses.  Development grants cover additional expenses which provides value to the community 
<br/>for example, plant equipment, fibre glass boats, building materials, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rabi Island Council also has investments as it is providing office space to companies - 
<br/>the Banaban Building which they have here and their financial statement is prepared annually. So 
<br/>essentially, it is for those people who are on the island itself, who are living there as a community.  
<br/>This, as you know honourable Member, is something that we inherited from the British.  These people 
<br/>were moved here because they mined their island and took the phosphate from the island and they 
<br/>had nowhere to live. So, of course in those days because of the British Colony they brought them 
<br/>over to Rabi and Kioa so that is what has happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing with the Kioa Island Council – an annual grant of $70,000 is provided where 
<br/>100 percent  of funding is diverted toward development.  The sum  of $59,137 has been utilised to 
<br/>undertake the upgrade of their water supply system project and for the project to commence the Kioa 
<br/></span><span>Island Council is waiting on the agreement to be signed with WAF.  In regards to income generating 
<br/></span><span>projects, the Island Council is undertaking a procurement of Yamaha outboard engines from Asco 
<br/>Motors and the LPO has already been issued to Asco Motors.  There is no other source of funding 
<br/>for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Chairman, I seek further clarification on that Sir. 
<br/>The issue that is clouding my view here is that Rabi Island Council and Kioa Island Council, most of 
<br/>them up until this point in time do not hold any citizenship in Fiji.  They belong to their sovereign 
<br/>country  so  they  are  governed  by  their  sovereign  country,  and  yet  this  grant  is  coming  out  of  our 
<br/>national budget.  If it is for the people that hold Fiji’s citizenship that is alright with me but for the 
<br/>rest.  I am grateful for all this time that they have been sitting there because the Qarase Government 
<br/>did something on that, we should issue passports to them (citizenship).  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is being done. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1753 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  may  help  clarify  the  issue  about  the 
<br/>citizenship, in fact, that is true.  I remembered when I was acting in the Prime Minister’s portfolio 
<br/>this was something that was been sorted out between Immigration and the two councils. There are 
<br/>some exchanges now so that we can regularise and of course issue passports accordingly.  This is not 
<br/>only  for  Rabi  and  Kioa,  there  are  even  immigration  issues  involving  the  whole  Pacific  Island 
<br/>countries - some Tongans who came as students are still here, so work is currently being undertaken 
<br/>between the Department of Immigration and the councils to sort out some of these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It does help also Sir that we now have the opportunity to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have more than one citizenship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 2-1-2-10 be decreased by $990,000 in respect of Small Grants Projects $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, it is no secret that this SEG10 
<br/></span><span>will be utilised as a slush fund by the Prime Minister’s Office for his private projects all over the 
<br/></span><span>country for vote buying and that is probably why we have been seeing some Prime Minister’s Office 
<br/>staff hanging around the front of the Chamber all this week.  I reckon this allocation should be slashed 
<br/>by $990,000 and let him make do with the $10,000, until the honourable Prime Minister can update 
<br/>this Parliament with his latest Annual Report.  The last one was for 2018-2019 - this Parliament and 
<br/>the budget process is not a private ATM for this government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, does that even require a response.  This kind of sarcasm 
<br/>– really, how do we respond to that?  But Sir, there is obviously a lot of projects under the Small 
<br/>Grants Projects with the Prime Minister’s Office as  I mentioned earlier on.  Honourable Leawere 
<br/>asked why was it $2 million and now it is $1 million and I said that he would be happy about it.  
<br/>Honourable Qereqeretabua thinks it should be only $10,000, slush fund and all that nonsense.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, if I can just sort of give an example.  What are these funds used for?  In 2021-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction of school chain-link fence and gate of Ratu Iliesa Memorial School;  
<br/>Nabukaluka Evacuation Centre;  and 
<br/></span><span>Construction of walkway with roof at Vunibokoi District School.  
<br/></span><span>Completion of 1x2 classroom in Navakasiga Primary School and Naceva District School.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are schools in the rural areas that need assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua does not even have the decency of listening to the explanation 
<br/>that we are giving, where she is requiring $990,000 be cut, she is not even listening.  This is the 
<br/>Committee  of  Supply.    You  are  supposed  to  be  listening  to  issues  that  you  raise,  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua.  These are schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moce  Secondary  School.    Purchase  of  beds  and  mattresses  for  Kubulau  District  School.  
<br/>Those  people  who  do  go  to  deep-rural  areas  do  know  that  some  of  the  schools  where  kids  are 
<br/>travelling for primary school boarding school.  Some of the schools that have been set up by these 
<br/>communities, they do not have funds.  We give FEGs.  But they do not have the material to build 
<br/>these  things.    Some  of  the  schools  do  not  even  floors  and  this  is  what  it  does  -  basic  assistance.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Setting  up  of  water  pump  –  Naqeledamu  Village.    Completion  of  evacuation  centre  –  Vunivutu 
<br/>Village, Maui Village Women’s Group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, 2022-2023: Taunovo Village – solar works. Tokou Village – completion of 
<br/>dispensary.  St John Bosco Primary School  – completion of multipurpose shed. Nateca Village  – 
<br/>repair of one wooden boat.  You call it a slush fund? Vusama Village – setting of water pump.  These 
<br/>people did not have a pump, they are getting a water pump.  I want them to know that honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua and NFP think it is a slush fund to give people water. Vuniwai Village – solar system 
<br/>for 46 houses.  Sawaieke District School - solar system. Rukurukulevu Village - seawall steps and 
<br/>Bucalevu Secondary School – school driveway to be cemented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, some of these areas, some of the ministries of course they have their mandate 
<br/>to be able to do some of these things.  Sometimes these are small ones that actually get left behind.  
<br/>Some of these things come up as a matter of emergency.  People do turn up and do ask the PM’s 
<br/>Office for assistance and if we see that there is obviously a particular restrain on it, we have cut it 
<br/>back by $1 million.  One would think, “may be election year, we will ramp it up.”  If it was a slush 
<br/>fund, honourable Qereqeretabua, we will ramp it up to $3 million to $4 million.  But we actually cut 
<br/>back on it because we cutting our deficit back. We have got these projects, some of them have not 
<br/></span><span>been completed.  We are trying to complete these then we move on to the next one.  It is a huge insult 
<br/></span><span>when they make those kind of comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  am  kind  of  surprised  at  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General’s response on two counts.  One, of course, he admits that these are projects that 
<br/>those ministries need to undertake and if he is talking about rural schools, this is what we have been 
<br/>saying.  What is the Ministry of Education doing?  What is the Ministry of Rural Development doing? 
<br/>These are activities that need to be identified in the mainstream budgets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with honourable Qereqeretabua when she used the words “slush fund” because this is 
<br/>a government, Mr. Chairman, which is known, if you look at 2018 and what they did, the amount of 
<br/>money through all kinds of initiatives and they are still doing it.  Even the last Election Observers 
<br/>Report actually pointed, you know the use of government funds during an election year or during the 
<br/>campaign t was very clear.  She is making a valid point and to say that NFP does not want people to 
<br/>get these things, we understand the Prime Minister gets the request, different ministers get requests 
<br/>from everywhere but to make it like as if NFP is opposed to helping people …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is laughing now because that is what he was trying to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have been caught out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is what he was trying to do. He is laughing now because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is what he was trying to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Don’t personalise things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So the point is, Mr. Chairman, this is a Government and that 
<br/>is why we are raising this. She is absolutely right that this is not the time to allocate funds like this.  
<br/>If the respective Ministers, ministries that is their responsibility, they should do that. Let us cut out 
<br/>this crap that we are opposed to people getting assistance.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1755 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, I give the floor to honourable Qereqeretabua for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>her Right of Reply.  We have had enough debate on this item. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Two  points,  I  do  agree  with  the  honourable  Professor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prasad that this should be the line Ministries responsibility,  chain-link fences, flooring, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my Right of Reply, I think if the Government had any sense they would have diverted this 
<br/>$990,000 to the agriculture allocation especially to strengthen our food security because of global 
<br/>supply  chain  disruptions.  We  have  heard  about  that  all  this  week  and  then  only  then  can  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister go and wear a </span><span>salusalu</span><span> with the honourable Minister for Agriculture for 
<br/>the  disbursement  of  meaningful  farming  implements  and  market  pathways  that  are  beneficial  to 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, just stick to this activity. Forget about agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will now vote on this amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 2-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Clarification on Programme 2-1-1, even in Programme 1-1 as 
<br/>well.  There seems to be an increase in the allocation that has been given from the previous year’s 
<br/>allocation. Can we just get a clarification on the reasons for the increase in established staff?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Programme 3-1, Sir, this is the increase as a result of the 
<br/>transfer of the funds from SEG 7 which is the IBMS Project Monitoring Staff to fund the System 
<br/>Analysis position.  So, essentially there were 12 vacant positions that will be filled in the coming 
<br/>months because when they want to be filled before we did not fund it, but now they will be filled.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Just another clarification.  I note that this is my second term in 
<br/>Parliament. Those that were in the first term in Parliament, they are eligible for pension. I do not see 
<br/>pension for MPs somewhere. Where are they allocated?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is in Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Managed from the Cabinet Office? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, it is in Head 50. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 3-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Just a clarification – Programme 3-1-9 - Disaster Recovery for 
<br/>ePassport Project.  I note that there are other allocations about vaccine passports.  So, how is this 
<br/>linked with the ePassport, the allocations here and allocations in your Ministry?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Passports are separate to the vaccine passports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- It is not related to vaccine passport? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, this is a normal passport.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 2.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 2 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will move onto Head 6 – Ministry of Defence. 
<br/>National Security and Policing.  The honourable Attorney-General whose portfolios we were going 
<br/>to take has been called out for a diplomatic appointment.  In the meantime we will move on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 6 – Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1-1? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I would just like some clarification from 
<br/>the Minister on why under SEG 7 the allocation for Remembrance Day Celebration ($120,000) is 
<br/>actually less than the national event for Fiji Day Celebrations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- With the Remembrance Day Celebration, there is only 
<br/></span><span>one  major  activity  in  Suva  which  is  the  national  and  then  the  Ex-Servicemen  Association  in  the 
<br/>divisions, they just have their own as compared to the national celebrations, it is usually celebrated. 
<br/>We have the national and we have the main geographical centres as well.  One major celebration in 
<br/>the East which is usually held in Levuka and the one in the West is usually held either between Nadi 
<br/>or  Lautoka  and,  of  course,  for  the  Northern  Division  in  Labasa.    So  the  magnitude  of  the  events 
<br/>dictates the allocation accordingly, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I move without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 6-1-1-7 in respect of Human Trafficking be increased to $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S. QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr. Chairman,  I think it is  a little bit tokenistic that this 
<br/>Government  is allocating a measly sum of $10,000 to tackle human trafficking when we can already 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1757 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>see the signs of its prevalence around the country and we have all seen global reports about human 
<br/>trafficking. I do not think that we need to remind the Minister that human trafficking is happening 
<br/>here amongst our people.  Is a scourge on our nation that must be ripped out because of its linkages 
<br/>to things like prostitution, drug trafficking, pornography and who knows.  Maybe even in the trade 
<br/>of human organs if live bodies are transported closer to where the buyer is, this is why I am moving 
<br/>that this allocation be increased, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I wish to respond to that.  Of course we 
<br/>are  concerned  about  human  trafficking  but  the  Ministry  is  not  doing  the  work.  The  Ministry  is 
<br/>responsible for the policies and the strategies behind this.  The work is done by the border agencies 
<br/>particularly.  The  critical  work  in  terms  of  human  trafficking  and  everybody  knows  about  the  US 
<br/>Report. We are sorting it out, there is a Committee, I have already raised that in Parliament and that 
<br/>is why that allocation, Mr. Chairman.  The Ministry of Defence does not go out and do this work, if 
<br/>that can be made clear to all honourable Members of this Chamber, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Attorney-General, we are on Head No. 6 at the moment. We 
<br/>have  skipped  whilst  you  were  away  but  we  will  go  back  immediately  after  this.    Honourable 
<br/>Members, Parliament will now vote on the amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 3 - Office of the Attorney- General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, may I ask for clarification on Programme 
<br/>1-1-1, Personal Emoluments with an allocation of  over $3 million, please?  How many lawyers are 
<br/>in the Solicitor-General’s Office?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, if the honourable Member would see that it 
<br/>is an increase of $64,000 and not $3.3 million.  In the last budget it was $3.2 million, it is gone up by 
<br/>$64,000.   It  funds the salaries of 80 established  positions of which 71 are filled and nine vacant, 
<br/>which are under recruitment process.  That of course, includes lawyers and other staff too.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- The reason I asked this is because it seems that a lot of 
<br/>legal cases or perhaps all legal cases involving the Government seemed to be handled primarily by 
<br/></span><span>R. Patel Lawyers, specifically, Mr. Devanesh Sharma and Ms. Gul Fatima and interestingly, I just 
<br/></span><span>note that this firm  also  represents  the Government’s FijiFirst  Party so  I  would like to  understand 
<br/>which allocation this Ministry is paying for legal representation by R. Patel as surely there must be 
<br/>enough  experienced  lawyers  in  the  Office  the  Solicitor-General,  who  taxpayers  pay  for  before  I 
<br/>consider to move a motion or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 3.

<div><span>Head 3 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 4 - Ministry of Economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I just need clarification on Programme 1-1-6, we 
<br/>note that the Operating Grant to FRCS has increased from $27 million to $32 million, now it has

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gone up to $40 million in this year’s allocation.  Can we get a clarification on this before we can 
<br/>move a motion to the increase or decrease this allocation of $40 million? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-    The  Annual  Operating  Grant  is  provided  to  FRCS  in 
<br/>meeting  the  operational  expenses,  include  employee  cost,  training,  travel  accommodation, 
<br/>communication,  postage,  IT  cost,  utilities,  motor  vehicle  expenses,  property  expenses,  other 
<br/>operating expenses and VAT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2022-2023,  FRCS  is  looking  forward  to  successfully  rolling  out  its  strategic  plan  and 
<br/>achievement  of  expatriate  outcomes,  including  the  delivery  of  excellence  in  revenue  collection, 
<br/>border protection, trade and travel facilitation to help Fiji grow and protection from external border 
<br/>hazards too, because they look after customs.  Of course, it includes capital works too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major forecasted  capital works include the  completion of NTIS project,  upgrade of office 
<br/>facilities in Suva and Lautoka Wharf, because we see there has been leakage points, renovation for 
<br/>Lautoka Office, upgrade of the accounting system, technical training for staff and renewable of Joint 
<br/>Card for taxpayers expiring in 2022-2023.  If you have the Joint taxpayer card that is expiring, we 
<br/>need to issue you new cards in respect of that.  So there is a number of IT projects too including the 
<br/></span><span>physical upgrade of those facilities at Suva and Lautoka wharf and also  for the renovation of the 
<br/></span><span>Lautoka Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I move without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 4-1-3-7 be decreased by $2.5 million in respect of implementation of new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget system which was allocated $2.5 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  moved  this  motion  because  we  have 
<br/>heard absolutely nothing about this proposed new budget system.  It is clear that the Minister knows 
<br/>he  has  a  problem  but  $2.5  million  is  not  going  to  fix  it  an  perhaps  if  this  Ministry  respects  the 
<br/>taxpayers enough with an Annual Report we could see where this was going but it is just hypocrisy 
<br/>in the highest order that the Minister comes here to ask for $3.8 billion but could not be bothered 
<br/>showing  taxpayers  how  it  uses  their  taxes  through  Annual  Reports  and  this  is  just  basic,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua is just another different plane 
<br/></span><span>altogether.  The current process of budget preparation (budget books), required working on Microsoft 
<br/>Excel and Word which requires a lot of effort and time whereby the Budget documents are printed 
<br/>and manually checked for any errors. Therefore, a new software is required to be implemented to 
<br/>ease the formulation of the budget. These things they do not come about when you flick your finger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  make  a  transit  from  the  manual  system,  $2.5  million  has  been  allocated  for  the 
<br/>implementation of the new budget system which involves a procurement of the new budget software 
<br/>and it is related services from Questica Software Limited in USA. The cost breakdown as follows; 
<br/>Payment to Questica - $2.3 million, PC upgrade for budget and planning - $80,000, minor renovation 
<br/>works  - $20,000, training  - $20,000  and contingency fund  - $50,000.    ITC has approved that the 
<br/>hosting services will be  on cloud-based  and within  the approved  cost.   A contract  agreement has 
<br/>already been signed between Questica and Ministry of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So what honourable Qereqeretabua is saying is, let us be caught up in the last century and let 
<br/>us do all of this manually. So all those staff whose names I read out, they need to work and enslave

<br/>you make changes it moves because it is on MS Excel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, it is 2022 and if the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy is saying that we cannot be stuck in the last century, then whatever we have been using 
<br/>these last few years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- MS Excel, that is what we have been using. That is what I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just said to you. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Programme 1, Activity?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 6 – </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> allowance.  How much do they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>get, Mr. Chairman and how many </span><span>turaga ni koro</span><span> do we have across Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> allowance – </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> of 
<br/>course, are appointed under the iTaukei Affairs, </span><span>tikina</span><span> and village council regulations.  The </span><span>Turaga ni 
<br/>Koro</span><span> allowance consists of three components.  Monthly allowance of $100.  We have 1,218 </span><span>Turaga ni 
<br/>Koro</span><span>.  TMO – telegram money order charges of $16,400 and training expenses of $16,000.  So, it is 1,218 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Koro.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The additional funds provided, Sir, for the allowance of 45 new </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>, who will be 
<br/>appointed in the new financial year which is about $54,000.  Training expenses - $3,600 and TMO – as 
<br/>you know some of them need the TMO, charges of $6,400.  So, 1,218 plus the new 45 </span><span>Turaga ni Koro.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>,  Sir,  funding  for  the  quarterly  allowance  of  262  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>  in  14 
<br/>provinces.    The  allowances  actually  vary  from  $320  to  $560  per  quarter  due  to  factors  such  as 
<br/>geographical areas and other contingency cost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to move a motion on that one.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Well,  you  better  start  writing  because  I  have  three  other  motions  here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, in respect of Head 5-1-1-5, it mentions Tabua 
<br/>Shop Expenses - $40,000.  Could I ask for a clarification from the Minister on the $40,000 allocation for

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Tabua Shop?  How many </span><span>tabua</span><span> have been bought and sold?  When will Parliament see a breakdown 
<br/>of this operation and whether it is profitable or not because again, we do not have an annual report to 
<br/>draw from?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, to support the Tabua Shop’s mission to protect and promote 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>cultural heritage, particularly in the trade of </span><span>tabua</span><span> while promoting sustainable development 
<br/>in terms of monitoring and regulating the circulation of </span><span>tabua</span><span> in accordance with its prominence within 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>culture.  The budgetary provision is for:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Conducting awareness in the various </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities and to all </span><span>tabua</span><span> users on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various components of </span><span>tabua</span><span> policy; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Buyback scheme, include buying of </span><span>tabua</span><span> from pawn shop owners and the general public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to replenish the </span><span>tabua</span><span> shop.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has confiscated 130 </span><span>tabua.</span><span>  The Ministry is currently consulting and negotiating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with iTaukei Trust Fund on the operation and management of the </span><span>Tabua </span><span>shop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>. 
<br/>Head 5-1-1-6: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Chairman, Sir, I am proposing: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That we increase the Turaga ni Koro Allowance twice to $2,988,000 in Head 5-1-1-6.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.SAYED-KHAIYUM- Honourable Gavoka is moving that too, isn’t it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- This issue has been raised various times at the Provincial Councils 
<br/>and also by the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> themselves, in terms of the increased role they are playing.  In the past, 
<br/>they played a more passive role but now they are very active and a lot more responsibilities is placed on 
<br/>them from the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and the Provincial Councils, in terms of not only monitoring 
<br/>and also general management in villages but also reporting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reporting requirement has increased and this has placed a lot more on them. In fact, it seems 
<br/>to have become more full time role now.  Probably in the future, it needs to be assessed and formalised 
<br/>in order to adequately recognise this position of </span><span>Turaga-Ni-Koro</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Anyone else wishes to speak on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  I  withdraw  my  motion  but  I  would  like  to  speak  on  this  one,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman, if I may.  I totally agree with the motion to increase the allowance for the </span><span>Turaga-Ni-Koro</span><span>, I 
<br/>asked for more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These, Mr. Chairman, are really people who are up on 24/7 basis looking after the affairs of the 
<br/>villages. Their work is quite challenging and if properly resourced and renumerated, they can uplift the 
<br/>standard in villages and in many areas; the supervision of the fishing, any business activities like farming.  
<br/>We are not fully utilising them, Mr. Chairman.  I believe, if they are trained properly and properly paid, 
<br/>they can be more effective at various level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I hear from Government now there is about 1,263 villages across the country.   These are 
<br/>people who are economic units.  I lived in my village for most part of my life and I see a lot of programmes 
<br/>from the agencies carrying out training programmes, awareness programmes and the like in villages but 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1761 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as soon as they depart, things fall apart.  There is no follow through. Sir, NGOs do a lot of work in the 
<br/>villages. There is no follow through and life goes back to normal and the quality of life in the village 
<br/>continues to deteriorate in many ways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, our Party will be looking and upgrading the governance in the village and to strengthen the 
<br/>position  of  Turaga-ni-Koro,  hence  their  request  that  be  appropriately  renumerated  and  given  all  the 
<br/>support to be virtually like CEOs in a unit.  In many ways, it can help the economy of the villagers, in 
<br/>addition to the social and responsibilities that they look after today.  That, Mr. Chairman, are the views 
<br/>of the Party that we look after the Turaga ni Koro as they are in charge of the huge segments of our 
<br/>population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Chairman, just in support of the motion in Parliament, right now, 
<br/>most of the civil servants that are coming to the villages do not bring their </span><span>sevusevu</span><span>.  They said that they 
<br/>do not have allocations for these traditional customary duty and it is the Turaga ni Koro</span><span> </span><span>that runs around 
<br/>in the village collecting money for the </span><span>sevusevu</span><span> of these civil servants to look good in coming to the 
<br/>village or in the communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is not true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Hey, I stay in the village, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is not true, when we went to your village we brought our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>own </span><span>sevusevu.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes, I said most of the civil servants that are coming now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order, order!

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, if I could just help clarify or honourable Rasova 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wants to go before me, Sir, Kadavu before Nadroga. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I thank you, honourable Minister.  In regards to the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro, </span><span>I 
<br/>think there is a rule but then I support the motion by honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau in regards to the 
<br/>doubling of their allowances.  Their allowances is about $400 every quarter, but given that in our village, 
<br/></span><span>we do not have a </span><span>Vale ni Vanua, </span><span> it has all been damaged by the hurricane, so the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>does 
<br/></span><span>almost  everything.    He  feeds  them,  house  them  and  these  are  almost  all  the  Ministries;  the  Health, 
<br/>Fisheries, Agriculture, Police, and I support the increase of the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>allowance</span><span> </span><span>all over Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, I was going to make a comment, if you do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mind, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, just for the honourable Member’s information, 
<br/>the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>were paid $75 prior to 2016 and we increased it to $100 a month.  We do have budgets 
<br/>for </span><span>sevusevu,</span><span> honourable Kuridrani.  We increased the allowance for the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>from $75 to 
<br/>$100, District Advisory Councillors never used to get paid, they are also paid now as they also provide 
<br/>service together with </span><span>Turaga ni Koro.  </span><span>We try and get them all to work together too, so the increment 
<br/>was made in 2016.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Chairman, in time to come, when we get a lot more fiscal flexibility, we will be 
<br/>able  to  increase  those  allowances  for  all  those  such  people  in  the  same  way  that  we  increase  the 
<br/>allowances from $50 a month to $200 a month for the community nurses and they actually play a very 
<br/>pivotal role in that respect, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In response to the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General, thank you for saying that we will move forward on that, but this should have been done a long 
<br/>time ago.  I think they have been paid lower than the minimum wage, and we brought this up here on 
<br/>numerous times.  The other side has never even considered it and today, I am asking the honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We increased it, what are you talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- The increase is not adequate, we have inflation, cost of goods have 
<br/>gone  up  and  our  honourable  Members  on  this  side  have  mentioned  the  reasons  that  it  needs  to  be 
<br/>increased.  That was a few years ago.  I think you do not understand the term “inflation”, but I am asking 
<br/>the Government side, if there are some things which you can go along with us in the Opposition regarding 
<br/>this Budget, this is the one, so I am asking you to use your conscience and let us approve it together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Chi, chi, you go and change your way of thinking then. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote that Head 5-1-1-6 be increased by 1,494,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I would like to propose: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 6-1-1-6 - Provincial Councils ($4,242,895) be increased by $3 million to $7,242,895. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  reason  behind  this  is  that  the  allocation  is 
<br/></span><span>basically for salaries of those who are working at the Provincial Councils, but the operational cost is not 
<br/></span><span>covered - that is covered by the </span><span>soli ni Yasana</span><span>. I mention this because it is like a double taxation on the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> population especially those at the villages but of course they are supported by their compatriots 
<br/>who are working and that includes all of us - that is why I am saying it is a double taxation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would be appropriate or good for the Government to also cover - just like any other organisation 
<br/>or department - or fund the operations which the personnel need to do. The personnel or staff cannot just 
<br/>be there on their own, they need funding for their operations and that includes vehicles, office expenses, 
<br/>et cetera.  That is why I am asking for this and I am proposing that in terms of that amount to be increased 
<br/>by $ 3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, if the honourable Members was astute he would note that 
<br/>the iTaukei Affairs Board has actually come down in terms of funding from $5.2 million to $2.1 million 
<br/>and that $3 million reduction in fact has been given to the Provincial Councils.  If you look at the figures 
<br/>for last year, iTaukei Affairs Board received $5.2 million and now they are receiving $2.1 million - is a 
<br/>variance of $3 million and that $3 million has gone to the Provincial Councils.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1763 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, a lot more financing beef up has been provided through the Provincial Councils 
<br/>itself.  So, we have the 111 staff from the iTaukei Affairs Board payroll now in the Provincial Council 
<br/>payroll. So Provincial Council numbers, technically in fact, have gone up as a move from the iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  current  financial  year  the  Assistant  Roko,  Treasurer  and  Conservation  Officer  were 
<br/>reflected under the iTaukei Affairs Board payroll, whereas these officers actually operate from and are 
<br/>situated in the respective Provincial Council’s Offices.  Movement is now aligned to reflect the current 
<br/>establishment in the iTaukei Affairs Board and each Provincial Council Office - those positions have, in 
<br/>fact gone to the Provincial Council Office.  They have a lot more say, and they are the ones who actually 
<br/>pay them the salaries and the increase is due to the transfer of funds with the iTaukei Affairs Board as per 
<br/>the comments I just made.  If you look at the Provincial Council Office Budget is has actually gone up 
<br/>by $3.086 million compared to last year, which I sense he has not picked up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  seek  clarification  from  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>regarding the $4.2 million for Provincial Councils.  What is the distribution of that $4.2 million to the 
<br/>Provincial Councils? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, it depends obviously on the size of the Provincial Councils, 
<br/></span><span>not all Provincial Councils have the same size. As you know you come from Ba and it is one of the largest 
<br/>provinces, and has higher areas to cover, some provinces are much smaller.  So it depends on the size of 
<br/>the provincial councils themselves.  I cannot give you a break down now of that, but it depends on the 
<br/>size of the provincial council office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T. NAVURELEVU.- Mr. Chairman, I wanted to just speak in support of the motion 
<br/>regarding the provincial councils.  I guess that the funding provided by the Government is only for salaries 
<br/>and wages of the staff in the provincial councils.  What we are concerned about is the operating fund for 
<br/>the  provincial  council  which  are  met  only  by  those  provinces  using  profits  from  their  company,  the 
<br/>dividend from their investment and the provincial rate.  That is the reason why we requested if the fund 
<br/>is increased to accommodate the expenses of the provincial councils.  They are doing similar jobs and 
<br/>services as other Government departments which have been given expenses for operating, that is why I 
<br/>support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Tuisawau, you have the right of reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Chairman, in response to the honourable Attorney-General and 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Economy, the movement of personnel might be the case, but the fact as confirmed by the 
<br/></span><span>Turaga Tui Namuka</span><span>, the provincial council personnel or staff are funded by the Government, but the 
<br/>operations are funded by the people of the province including their dividends - that is why we are asking 
<br/>for that.  It is not to fund the salaries but to cover the operational costwhich are covered now by the 
<br/>members of the  </span><span>yasana,</span><span> including through the soli </span><span>yasana,</span><span> to at least give relief to the people in the 
<br/>provinces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members,  we will now vote on the amendment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  just  wanted  to  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for a point of clarification on Activity 1-7 - Review of Village Guidelines.  Are these village 
<br/>guidelines same as ….

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We are on Activity 2 now.  We have done Activity 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- My apologies, Mr. Chairman, as the motion was still being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>debated, I was waiting to be given the opportunity just to clarify this one issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I let this one pass on this occasion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Just a point of clarification from the honourable Minister, 
<br/>on SEG 7 Review of Village Guidelines, is this something similar to the by-laws that have been shelved 
<br/>and what is the $20,000 for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Chairman, not the bylaws, it is essentially to ensure that we 
<br/>have this review, ensure hygiene, sanitation, and the environment is maintained - basically the order in 
<br/>the villages, nothing to do with the bylaws.   It is just a guideline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Activity 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Raise your voice so that I can hear it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, it is on SEG 10 - Survey of Unsurveyed Lands, is this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to do with some villages that are yet to be surveyed? Just some clarification on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The survey of all unsurveyed </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land - once the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>land boundaries have been demarcated, the work involves consultation with landowning units to clear 
<br/>and clean reference points, plant pegs, measure and fix boundaries, calculate, compute survey software, 
<br/>plot and draw survey plans and draft register of iTaukei land document.   As you know, some of these 
<br/>boundaries are not clearly defined.  They have to go out into the bush and mark these lands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  in  2021-2022  the  team  undertook  the  following  consultations  and  survey 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completion of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Vatulele, Nadroga, Navosa – 100 percent completed; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Malolo, Nadroga, Navosa – 95 percent completed; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Namosi – 20 percent; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Serua – 30 percent; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Nadi, Ba – 90 percent; 
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Vitogo, Ba – 80 percent; and 
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Tikina Lakeba, Lau – currently sits at zero percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the identified areas, the redefinition for the 14 landowning units.  For 2022-2023, this 
<br/>will  fund  the  operational  expenses  for  the  survey  and  demarcation  of  iTaukei  land  in  the  following 
<br/>Districts: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi in Sabeto; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Ba Tikina Vitogo; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Serua as in Deuba, Nuku, Serua-Tikina; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Lau, Lakeba, and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Kadavu, Tikina Sanima 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 7 - Customary Title Disputes ($30,000),  I wish 
<br/>to seek clarification on this one.  I see in a lot of meetings that the honourable Prime Minister goes to, he 
<br/>always comments on the number of vacant traditional positions in the provinces.  Are most of those due 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1765 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to disputes?  Because if they are, then this allocation is insufficient.  If it is not disputes then the ministry 
<br/>must be resourced to go in and ensure that these positions are filled, because it keeps coming up year in, 
<br/>year out.  The government keeps highlighting the fact that a lot of traditional positions are vacant either 
<br/>because there are too many disputes or we are not applying ourselves to have them filled.  I fail to see 
<br/>any allocation here that could help resolve the issue that keeps coming up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, what the honourable Prime Minister has been talking about 
<br/>is that there is an issue about unfilled positions but there are no disputes - it is simply not filled and that 
<br/>does not mean that there is a dispute, and of course there are some that is disputed.  One is unfilled and 
<br/>one is disputed.  This essentially is an ongoing process where the confirmation of every customary title 
<br/>is solely dependent on the request that is received from the </span><span>vanua</span><span> if there is a dispute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dispute cases are both formal and informal - they go and sit down, reconciliation or they talk with 
<br/>the formal ones.  Funding generally is here to meet the travel and accommodation costs for inspection 
<br/>and various other things, contingency costs.  Some of the unfilled positions are not because there is a 
<br/>dispute, they simply have not been filled but there is no dispute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, on that note there should be some resources here for government 
<br/></span><span>to help the </span><span>vanua</span><span> to fill these positions otherwise some of them have been vacant and left unfilled for 
<br/></span><span>years. They must take up the initiative and have this filled.  So, there must be some allocation here to 
<br/>resource a team otherwise it will continue to remain unfilled and we will keep hearing about this and 
<br/>nothing gets done and the </span><span>vanua</span><span> is weakened in the process. What I am saying is - if it is a dispute thing 
<br/>then increase the allocation and if it is not, then help them to fill the positions, whatever it takes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We cannot force them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members we will not vote on Head 5 – Ministry of iTaukei

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2-7, could the honourable 
<br/>Minister please clarify if $201,845 allocation for Project Officers – Labour Services means that these 
<br/>officers will be hired to ensure robust contracts, insurance, injury, disability cover, and fairer salaries 
<br/>for  our  Fiji  people  going  to  offshore  employment  such  as  fisheries  observers  and  domestic  and 
<br/>regional observers and also the Pacific Labour Scheme?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sorry, Sir.  Was that a question?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Would you repeat that, honourable Member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Yes, Mr. Chairman, with pleasure.  Could the honourable 
<br/>Minister clarify please if that $201,845 allocation for Project Officers – Labour Services under SEG 
<br/>7 means that these people will be hired to ensure robust contracts, insurance and injury and disability 
<br/>cover, and also fair salaries for our people who are going on offshore employment such as fishery 
<br/>observers  for  domestic  and  international  and  regional  fishing  boats  and  also  the  Pacific  Labour 
<br/>Scheme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, if I can clarify, it funds wages of 10 Data Entry Clerks, 
<br/>Band E – Step 1 to assist with the calculation of wages arrears backdated three years for backlog 
<br/>cases  of  25  security  companies,  40  supermarket  branches  that  are  currently  investigated  by  the 
<br/>Ministry for non-compliance on wages regulation in the following areas:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Non-payment of minimum rates of pay; 
<br/>Overtime; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Meal allowance; and  
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span>Annual Leave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These companies have not paid these.  Complaints have been lodged.  They now have to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the data entry.  They are doing the investigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  number  of  cases  is  expected  to  increase  with  the  implementation  of  revised  national 
<br/>minimum wage rate because as you know that every quarter the minimum wage is being increased.  
<br/>There  are  some  companies,  we  are  getting  complaints,  which  are  not  actually  adhering  to  this 
<br/>minimum wage increase.  So, we need to investigate.  We need people that document this.  So, this 
<br/>is why we made this additional allocation.  There is a new expenditure allocation to deal with these 
<br/>domestic issues at this point in time and that is what it is for.  It includes also the FNPF component.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-3-10 - Workmen’s Compensation.  Is 
<br/>that to do with Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) or is it just the pending cases that 
<br/>are there in the Ministry to be compensated or assisted?  Just some clarification from the honourable 
<br/>Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Sir and I actually apologise, it should be called 
<br/>“Worker’s Compensation” not Workmen’s Compensation.  They have changed the law to make it 
<br/>gender neutral so unfortunately anyway, honourable Qereqeretabua when we get the new system, it 
<br/>will be easier to change which you blocked.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, this funding is obviously to do with injuries and death occurred before 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December, 2018, before ACCF came into being. It has got nothing to do with ACCF. This is the 
<br/>backlog of cases. So, if you see honourable Leawere, the amount of money that has been given in 
<br/>this Budget is less than the previous year.  Why? Because the backlog of cases are being cleared.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the previous year, you had $1.2 million. This has been reduced by $346,000 so it is now 
<br/>$900,000. God willing next year it will be far less. So, then it will be clearing up all the backlog of 
<br/>cases prior to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2018. All workers compensation goes to ACCF now, new ones.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-4-7, can we have some clarification on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign Employment Mobility Services.  What is it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is with the regularisation of 12 project officers under 
<br/>SEG 1.  The Foreign Employment Service and Pacific Labour Scheme vote has been merged into the 
<br/>Foreign Employment Mobility Services. This is to do with the recruitment and selection where they 
<br/>assist monitoring local and overseas contracts, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Medical and Fitness Test, we have an allocation for that.  Marketing Training Awareness, 
<br/>Policy  and  Process  Review,  Stakeholder  Collaboration  and,  of  course,  the  office  needs  to  run 
<br/>specifically for this office supplies and equipment. That makes up $230,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- So, essentially the people who are going overseas on seasonal work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come under this unit, is that what you are staying? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, they look after specifically. So, it is not just for the ones 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who go to Australia, there are also the ones that go to New Zealand under the Duavata Initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Still  on  Programme  1-4-5  –  NEC  Board  Expenses 
<br/></span><span>allocation  ($5,140),  I  just  wanted  some  clarification,  please.  The  Ministry  of  Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Industrial Relations also has overdue Annual Reports to this House so my question 
<br/>is,  how many unemployed people registered with the Centre have now  found a job  last  year that 
<br/>warrants this expense for the board? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the honourable Member has got the wrong forum, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is the Budget she can ask that during Question time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Member, are you asking about this figure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I have already answered it. The figure is to do with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>board for NEC; meetings, expenses, catering, travel, logistic for consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Members,  we  will  now  vote  on  Head  7  -  Ministry  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  in  relation  to  Programme  2-1-8  - 
<br/>Refurbishment of Overseas Missions ($1,000,000), it is under “R”, which means it is highly unlikely 
<br/>that this will happen.  Can the honourable Minister, please, clarify if this $1 million allocation for the 
<br/>refurbishment  of  Overseas  Missions  means  we  have  not  yet  sold  our  Overseas  Missions  that  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy had said in a previous budget and which a large chunk of revenue 
<br/>projection from those sales did not actually happen?  Which Overseas Missions are being refurbished 
<br/>specifically?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the priority is being given to Canberra and Wellington.  
<br/>Wellington,  Sir,  as  you  know  one  of  our  buildings,  you  cannot  actually  stay  in  the  building.  
<br/>Wellington as we know is an earthquake fault line so there are cracks appearing in the building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the High Commissioner has to be housed in another premises.  A few years ago, 
<br/>Sir, the Australian Government offered us to buy one of our buildings we owned in Canberra because 
<br/>when we bought that building at that point in time, they used to use asbestos.  There was a buy back 
<br/>scheme in Canberra, so we actually sold it, they demolished it and rebuild something else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, we are talking to the New Zealand Government in respect of our building 
<br/>there which we own and also the building which we own in Canberra.  Sir, you would know that you 
<br/>were in fact a High Commissioner to United Kingdom too.  That building is in urgent state of repair, 
<br/>there are about four levels to it, it is near Hyde Park.  We are prioritising, obviously we are trying to 
<br/>be  fiscally  prudent,  but  at  this  point  in  time  we  are  looking  at  Canberra  and  Wellington  being 
<br/>upgraded but if we had other forms of refurbishment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In UK, I do not know if you have been there honourable Qereqeretabua, but it is worth quite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a lot of money but it also can quickly deteriorate if we do not fix it up too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 8 – Ministry of Foreign

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 8 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 9 – Independent Bodies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO.  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  this  particular  Head  on  Fijian  Elections 
<br/>Office,  we  heard  the  honourable  Attorney-General  this  morning  on  the  independence  of  these 
<br/>Independent Bodies.  I would like to reiterate the concerns of the independence are not only coming 
<br/>from us, but also the political parties and international forums or bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Which international body? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Journalists and media associations, generally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Journalists? They are not independent bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- This is our concern, Sir, and there are various ways to rectify 
<br/>this.  He has stated it is independent, but we need to look at it from a rational point of view.  There 
<br/>is unease within the population regarding the independence of these bodies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Fijian Elections Office, Sir, there has been concerns about the software used there and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that was also one of the recommendations made in the Joint Opposition Parties’ submission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  honourable  Member  is  talking  about 
<br/>something that is completely different from the Budget.  He is talking about software, et cetera.  He 
<br/>needs to get to the point, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1769 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- I am coming to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Well, get to it quickly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- I am proposing an increase (this is good for the Elections Office) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of $1 million to the Fijian Elections Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Firstly, $500,000 for an independent audit of the Fijian Elections 
<br/>software systems including the algorithms setup, basically to check whether the rules incorporated 
<br/>in the calculations within the computer systems are accurate, credible and transparent.  That is why 
<br/>I am calling for an independent audit of that with that $500,000 out of the $1 million increase which 
<br/>I am suggesting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  $500,000  (and  this  is  from  our  experience  at  the  last  Elections)  where  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General was at the Count Centre when the count was on. There were concerns 
<br/>about interference with the count and to alleviate those concerns, we in the Opposition parties would 
<br/></span><span>like that funding of  $500,000  to set up a duplicate count centre to be managed and staffed jointly 
<br/></span><span>by Opposition Political parties. This will ensure transparency of count and to alleviate any concerns 
<br/>… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are a joke. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  …  held  by  the  population  by  the  people.  There  is  another 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>verification in place in order to ensure that the Elections counts are transparent and credible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Move your amendments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move an increase of $1 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes, I have explained that, I have no further issues to add. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Chairman, this is more a general comment in support of 
<br/></span><span>what has been said earlier.  In fact, I laughed this morning when the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/></span><span>made  this  sweeping  claim  about  some  of  the  independent  bodies  are,  in  fact,  we  should  have  an 
<br/>independent inquiry as to whether these independent institutions are truly independent because just 
<br/>recently, I have talked about the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission, as an example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, FCCC is not in Head 9.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Independent Commissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We are in Head 9, it is not a commission. It is in the next 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, I am just giving an example in response to what you have 
<br/>said earlier about the independence of independent institutions.  It is really a joke from the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  to  say  because  he  knows  that  many  of  these  independent  institutions  are  not 
<br/>independent. And we know even here in this Parliament that the kind of interference that takes place 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so,  Mr.  Chairman,  I  think  the  honourable  Attorney-General  should  stop  claiming  that  these 
<br/>independent institutions are really independent as they are not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, can I make a comment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, if honourable Professor Prasad is saying that Judicial is 
<br/>not independent, I want him to say it outside Parliament. I really wanted him to do that, if he really 
<br/>believes that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  his  stupidity  or  by  honourable  Ro  Tuisawau  about  having  a  second  counting 
<br/>station. I was no way near the counting area, it has already been explained but they are harping on a 
<br/>narrative. International bodies have said the Elections were credible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Elections  Office  had  been  held  in  highest  esteem.  They  have  got  enough  exposure, 
<br/>enough training and they have also got those accolades (please read those).  You are actually just 
<br/>hanging on to some narratives that say ‘international organisations’, what?  You are talking about 
<br/></span><span>ABC Australia?  That is all you are hanging your hat on?  Algorithms - you are reading too much 
<br/></span><span>conspiracy books, that is the problem, Mr. Chairman. How can you, even if there was to be a second 
<br/>counting station funded in $500,000 absolutely no clue as to how it is done, absolutely no clue how 
<br/>much people get paid.  He plucks out $500,000 (I do not know what part of the anatomy) and says 
<br/>‘Let’s just have it’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, this is a real preposterous proposition.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU-  Yes,  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  as  usual,  comes  up 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, speak on the motion, do not speak on me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- How many people believe him?  That is what I am trying to ask 
<br/>here.  The argument here today is between what he is saying and what we are saying, so it is always 
<br/>good to have an independent audit.  What is wrong with an independent audit, why are you afraid of 
<br/>it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  The UN is auditing the Elections Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- He mentioned the different Election Observers, et cetera, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not go into these details, and on the duplicate count centre, that can be done with that amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Oh yes, right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- We just need a small group of people … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Go back to USP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- And we get the information from our agents at the polling centres 
<br/>and all they do is they message us the photo of the result.  We take that, input it and we can even use 
<br/>MS Excel, it is not as expensive as you are saying.  That is why I am proposing those two amendments 
<br/>of $1million ($500,000 each) for those initiatives.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, this is a request for clarification from the 
<br/>honourable Minister.  The Fiji Elections Office on Page 58 is being allocated $16.9 million here and 
<br/>$14.8 million under Head 50 for Elections.  Given that it is now August 2022 and we have about six-
<br/>month window until the last possible date for Elections January 2023, is a total of $31.7 million to 
<br/>run the Elections for about 682,000 registered voters plus the ongoing voter registration overseas for 
<br/>postal votes sufficient? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  CHAIRMAN.-  Honourable  Member,  just  deal  with  this  one,  forget  about  the  other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Heads that will come later.  You can ask the question on that when we come to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- So can I continue, Mr. Chairman?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Yes you can. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Knowing also that the Fiji Elections Office is supposed to 
<br/>hire buses to transport voters to their polling venues so that you do not get a worse voter turnout that 
<br/>we did in 2018, is this amount sufficient?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, the funding obviously is sufficient.  We have 
<br/>had discussions during Budget consultation with the Elections Office.  The Elections Office is not 
<br/>going to supply buses, it is working with the bus companies to make sure that the buses actually run. 
<br/>It is sufficient enough. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members we will vote on Head 9. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 9 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 13 – Independent Commissions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Head 13-1-1 – FICAC, I notice it is being 
<br/>allocated $10.5 million and this is requesting clarification.  That is an increase from $7.9 million that 
<br/>was allocated in the last Budget.  Can the honourable Minister, please, update us to his knowledge is 
<br/>in their workplan that justifies a little over $3 million increase because this seems to be a little bit 
<br/>shady with all the gung hoe investigation of people and jailing them, but again no annual report?  So 
<br/>the question, should they be surcharged investigated according to their own anti-corruption laws if 
<br/>they cannot show transparency on how they use our public funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, the honourable Member is incorrect in saying 
<br/>that there is no annual reports.  I wonder which planet she lives on.  FICAC has been giving its annual 
<br/>reports.  It gives its annual report to His Excellency the President also, it has appeared before the 
<br/>Committee also.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the increased funding, she says that they take them to court and jail them.  Sir, FICAC 
<br/>does not jail people, it actually investigates and prosecutes.  It is the judiciary that assesses the cases 
<br/>and the judiciary then makes a decision.  So, FICAC does not do the jailing, get your facts right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, the other reason why it has actually been extended is that there is fast-
<br/>tracking of cases now. You have got specific anti-corruption cases, there is a backlog of cases, I think 
<br/>one of the Members in the Budget Address said, “Oh, what has happened to the Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji complaint ($33 million)” someone referred to from the other side.  It is essentially to ensures that 
<br/>we get more people to be able to do this investigations really quickly Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also the training requirements: improvement of IT infrastructure and digital investigation 
<br/>equipment  and  media  campaigns.  The  salaries  and  allowance  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  make  up  $6.3 
<br/>million, there is 155 established positions, 148 are filled, 7 are vacant and there is operations, travel 
<br/>subsistence,  communication,  maintenance  and  operations,  vehicle,  procurement  of  goods  and 
<br/>services, special expenditure, capital purchase which is about $600,000.  So that is what the increase 
<br/>is for Sir.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.CHAIRMAN.- We will now vote on Head 13 – Independent Commissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 13 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for any comments on Head 14.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-2-7, it is regarding this rehabilitation 
<br/>programme. I just need some elaboration from the honourable Minister. Does this cover the work of 
<br/>Corrections going out to the communities, schools in terms of awareness or is it just specifically for 
<br/>inmates after they have been incarcerated?  Is the allocation about that?  I was just wondering if that 
<br/>covers the whole of Fiji in terms of rehabilitation programme in terms of awareness to avoid further 
<br/>occurrences of being brought into prison.  I was wondering if that amount covers the communities 
<br/>all over the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, Sir, it is for a number of rehabilitation programmes.  It 
<br/></span><span>does apply across the board with more for things like online church services for inmates who cannot 
<br/></span><span>come  out.  There  is  also  the  Counsellor  and  Psychologist  Awareness  Workshop  as  well  as  the 
<br/></span><span>Musudovu</span><span> Operations, Electrical Training, the Refrigeration Course, Electrical Materials, et cetera.  
<br/>Also, the training equipment for the vocational side of things.  It funds all of that in terms of the 
<br/>rehabilitation programme within the prison itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also various outreach programmes that we do have, Sir, including for example the 
<br/>Yellow Ribbon Project. I have been to a couple of those where they bring in potential employers and 
<br/>they had them out at the Fiji Sports ground at Laucala Bay, where all the different inmates, some are 
<br/>chefs, some have different skill sets and a lot of them actually got recruited by employers whist they 
<br/>were in prison. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of them have three months or six months to come out and they recruited them. As soon 
<br/>as they came out they actually had a job and as we have found with the rate of recidivism in fact 
<br/>increases when people come out of prison system and they do not actually get a job because people 
<br/>actually ostracized them.  That is part of that programme, rehabilitation links in with Yellow Ribbon 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1773 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Project creating that awareness within the members of the public and this is why honourable Member 
<br/>the rate of recidivism in Fiji has actually decreased substantially.  It used to be 50 percent only a few 
<br/>years ago, it decreased quite substantially. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Gavoka, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On combining these two – rehabilitation and 
<br/>yellow ribbon, we have a situation here on our people who are accepted to go and work overseas but 
<br/>because there is a police record that goes back 10, 15 or 20 years, they cannot go.  Some of these offences 
<br/>were pretty trivial like, drunk and disorderly, trespassing and they are that old and unfortunately, the NEC 
<br/>policy is that, no matter how old the offence, if you have a police record, you cannot go on seasonal work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know I have checked with some people and they said look you can expunge the record after 10 
<br/>years but when you rehabilitate them and they carry that kind of record with them, there is very little 
<br/>possibility for them to be part of this seasonal work programme overseas, so when we look at this, I 
<br/>wonder if that can be included in it, so they can be rehabilitated in full, not to be carrying a record that 
<br/>disables them from other opportunities.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, just to respond to that, that is not part of the purview of this 
<br/></span><span>particular Head but what honourable Gavoka is saying, it has been a problem for some people but after 
<br/>10 years, you can have your PCs or previous convictions, the record given to you where anything prior 
<br/>to 10 years does not appear.  Some employers of course, go the extra mile and want everything that you 
<br/>want.  I know of people who have actually gone overseas on this Scheme where they have actually had 
<br/>convictions but it was like 15, 20 years ago, 25 years ago because that the record that they presented and 
<br/>as honourable Gavoka said some of them have very minor offences, the drunk and disorderly, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also depends on the employers, Sir, and depends on where they are going to work.  If you are 
<br/>going to, for example be a fruit picker, your employer may not necessarily be as severe in respect of the 
<br/>restrictions.  If you are going to work in somebody’s home like aged-care services, they may think alright, 
<br/>you may not necessarily be suitable so it depends.  It is horses for courses but we can have after 10 years, 
<br/>your PC can show that there is no convictions.  Of course, someone has the right to go and look beyond 
<br/>that.  But some people of course, have gone also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  can  I  just  help  as  well  because  this  is 
<br/>something  that  we  are  also  involved  in,  the  police.    One,  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General, it depends on the preference of the employers.  But what we, the Fiji Police Force is also doing 
<br/></span><span>is, they also issue a certificate called  the “Rehab Certificate”, which some employers allow that and 
<br/></span><span>accept it, particularly for those that have records, and especially for  those that want to go for the Pacific 
<br/>Labour Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman, but NEC has a policy that if we have a 
<br/>police record - forget it.  I mean that is basically what they are saying to people now.  So, if that can be 
<br/>changed, it will be appreciated but right now that is the policy of NEC and no matter how old it is, if there 
<br/>is a police record, you do not get considered for these overseas things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Some people have gone through NEC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Where is the honourable Minister?  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Services: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- We will move on to Head 14 – Fiji Corrections Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 14 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15 – Ministry of Justice  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is open for any comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15-1-1-7: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I just want to seek clarification  on Head 
<br/>15-1-1-7 - Fijian Vaccine Pass System Operating Cost ($2,607,968) and at the same time, if I may just 
<br/>jump ahead and seek clarification from the Ministry of Communications on Head 16, Page  71, Fijian 
<br/>Vaccine Pass System an allocation of $1,696,901.  Can I just ask the honourable Minister what is the 
<br/></span><span>difference with the same allocation for two different Ministries?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just take this one at this time. When we get to that page, we will deal with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this allocation in the Ministry of Justice is to do with the 
<br/>actual operational expenditure of this Vaccine Pass and there is recruitment of staff because we need 
<br/>people to do the data entry which will cost about $246,000 because we are going to pay some rental and 
<br/>storage cost $209,000, training $15,000 and operating expenditure of having these people to go out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next financial year, the Office will continue upgrading three centres in Suva, Lautoka and 
<br/>Labasa be equipped with more IT equipment and issuing of Vaccines Passports Certificates and that is 
<br/>what this is for. So, the operationalization, in fact, hiring of the staff because the reason why is in the 
<br/>Ministry of Justice because that is where the Births, Deaths and Marriages (BDM).  So, they need to be 
<br/>able to link with the Birth Certificates and your Vaccine Pass itself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will vote on Head 15. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 15 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Tikoduadua, take note when we get to the next Head, you can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ask your other question on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 16 – Ministry of Communications 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- The floor is now open for any comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I would just like to ask as a matter of clarification from 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  about  what  is  given  that  there  is  an  allocation  for  Qorvis  Communication  - 
<br/>$800,000.  How much is paid to them from which allocation and what is their role?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1775 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- As it suggest, for Qorvis Communication gets paid $800,000, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just for Qorvis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, we have this allocation for Qorvis Communication, 
<br/>so the question is where is the allocation for Vatis in the Ministry of Communications and where is it 
<br/>coming from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, we have Public Awareness, Media Relations - $256,880. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is clarified with the previous question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I am sorry, Sir, it is not just Vatis, the other expenditure related 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to public awareness, media relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh </span><span>ignore him, not worth it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 16-2-1: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, can I have some clarification on Head 16-2-1 - Ease of 
<br/>Doing Business ($9 million)?  I would have thought that this belongs to Ministry of Commerce, Trade 
<br/>and Tourism and I believe at one time, the honourable Minister had indicated that Ease of Doing Business 
<br/>is no longer any need for it.  Why do we have this $9 million on Ease of Doing Business or rather, what 
<br/>is it for?  I know there was a committee that was looking into this two or three years ago, would that be 
<br/>this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, there is  a difference between Ease of Doing 
<br/>Business  Survey  which  is  conducted  by  the  World  Bank  which  is  what  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Commerce, Trade and Tourism was talking about, how it has been corrupted in the survey which we have 
<br/>been highlighting  for  a number of  years.   Of  course, it fitted the narrative then of the  Opposition in 
<br/>particular, honourable Professor Prasad had just left but that was Ease of Doing Business Survey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is Ease of Doing Business in Fiji for businesses in Fiji.  As we have highlighted previously, 
<br/>this essentially  is  to allow  for the new  business licence  and  getting  construction  permits,  enable and 
<br/>participates  in  government  agencies  to  approve  the  applications  online.    Both  the  applicants  and 
<br/></span><span>processing agencies will be able to track the progress of their application submission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The system will collate 16 plus approval agencies and encompass 25 e-services relative to permits 
<br/>and approval for starting a business and obtaining building permits.  That is all the different agencies, 
<br/>whether it is the National Fire Authority (NFA), Occupational Health &amp; Safety (OHS), everyone will be 
<br/>part of this.  You will be able to apply online, submit your documents online and you will be able to then 
<br/>get your approval online too, it should reduce significantly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Has anyone that is doing business in Fiji, if I go to different agencies to get approvals, most of 
<br/>them will ask to replicate the same information you have just given to other agency, even filling out your 
<br/>address,  basic  details,  so  this  will  be  one  window  where  it  applies.    All  the  agencies  will  get  the 
<br/>information and they can then give you the approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Chairman, it requires a lot of investments in the e-space.  That is why it is actually 
<br/>under Programme 2-1 - Digital Government Transformation (DGT).   That is why it is there because it is 
<br/>a software and the DGT office has acquired the services from various companies.  There was a tender

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>called, there is a  company  called Toppan  Ecquaria Pte.  Ltd that has in  fact, been  given the software 
<br/>development.  He is the new technology partner. 
<br/>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 16-3-1: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Chairman, on Head 16-3-1, I thank the Government for the feasibility 
<br/>study  on  International  Redundant  Connectivity  that  is  proposed  for  the  Western  Division.    I  seek 
<br/>clarification from the honourable Minister.  There are two international connections in the Pacific, we 
<br/>also have Hawaiki Cable apart from the Southern Cross Cable.  My question is, are you planning to have 
<br/>an alternative route for international connectivity or you will retain the same Southern Cross Cable? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, the word “redundancy” means that you are not 
<br/>going to use the same line.  Redundancy means if one fails, you pick up the other one, so why would we 
<br/>lend the Southern Cross Cable also in the Western Division?  The whole point of redundancy is that, if 
<br/>Southern Cross Cable goes down then you get another one.  Obviously, we will get another one.  We do 
<br/>not want to pre-empt who is going to be because there will be tenders called who will give us the best 
<br/>deal, but most certainly, it will not be Southern Cross Cable because then you do not have redundancy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman on Head 16-3-1-7, there are two allocations for 
<br/></span><span>ICT meetings, one is for $50,000 and one is for $200,000.  Just seeking clarification from the honourable 
<br/>Minister on those two allocations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The first one $50,000 is to fund for hosting or attending ICT 
<br/>related meetings such as the Commonwealth Telecommunications Organisation (CTO), that is when we 
<br/>attend some of those meetings to fund those expenses or if we have meetings locally held in Fiji or within 
<br/>the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second one is the Special ICT Meetings which is $200,000.  The Special ICT Meetings (let 
<br/>me give you the exact detail), we have been given the opportunity to host two international workshops in 
<br/>Fiji.  One is by the International Telecommunications Union, the Radio Communications Seminar which 
<br/>will be held this year in October, $100,000 has been allocated for it, so we will get tourists filling up our 
<br/>hotels and the second one is the Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT) a Policy and Regulatory Framework 
<br/>Forum which will be held in July of next year which has got a $100,000.  We are expecting a range of 
<br/>about 70 to 100 participants to attend these two meetings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, of course, it is vital for Fiji to be represented and host international workshops and 
<br/></span><span>conferences.  We are the telecommunications hub in the Pacific, we need to maintain that level, not just 
<br/></span><span>credibility but of course, the standard and put ourselves out there.  These organisations have reached out 
<br/>to us and we made this allocation, obviously it has an economic spin over because they occupy hotels, 
<br/>they come and stay here and that is what we are hosting the meeting for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will vote on Head 16. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 16 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, on  that note, we will suspend the House for half-an-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hour so that you can have a stretch.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 17 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 – Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1-7 - Administrative Expenses 
<br/>($50,000). I would like to have some clarity from the honourable Minister.  What kind of expenses are 
<br/>these and should it not be broken down into specific expenditure in other SEGs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, this is mainly for office equipment, not only 
<br/></span><span>improvement but of course the purchase of maintenance equipment particularly the computers, printers 
<br/>and other office needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1-6, can we get some breakdown in 
<br/>terms of the District Advisory Counsellor Allowances?  How many District Advisory Counsellors are 
<br/>entitled to this $623,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, there are 302 District Advisory Counsellors 
<br/>all over Fiji .  In the last financial year, few of the DAC appointments were vacant and of course some 
<br/>have been filled now but in total we have 302 District Advisory Counsellors all over Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Programme  1-1-8    -  Final  payment  -  Namarai, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kubulau and Wainikoro Government Stations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, these area mainly retention fees based on 
<br/>the contract.  As I did state yesterday, we have constructed a few new rural government stations and we 
<br/>have Namarai, Kubulau is the quarters and, of course, Wainikoro Government Station as well, so these 
<br/></span><span>are the retention fees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, SEG 6  Annual Fees – Centre for Integrated Rural 
<br/>Development for Asia and Pacific, just a clarification on the nature of our membership and the benefits 
<br/>regarding that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Fiji joined the Centre for Integrated Rural 
<br/>Development for Asia and Pacific (CIRDAP) in 2013.  It is headquartered in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Fiji 
<br/>is the 15th member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  sent  our  people  for  training  and  of  course  to  see  the  best  practices  in  terms  of  rural 
<br/>development.  Included in that, we have an agreement with India, and this is out of the relationship that 
<br/>we  have  established  with  CIRDAP  -  we  are  sending  one  officer  from  the  Ministry  every  year,  an 
<br/>undergraduate to go and do postgraduate diploma studies in rural development in India.  A lot of benefits 
<br/>that we are getting out of this, Mr. Chairman, and the allocation is our fee that we are required to pay 
<br/>annually.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Programme  2-1-9  -  Institutional  Strengthening  for 
<br/>Divisional and Provincial Offices ($25,000).  All the four Commissioners – Central, Eastern, Western 
<br/>and Northern have similar allocations of $25,000 under SEG 9 which comes to a $100,000.  What 
<br/>does this institutional strengthening activity mean? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, this is about improving the standards and of 
<br/>course equipment as well in most of the rural outposts.  One of the disappointing things that we faced in 
<br/>the past, and this is the image of Government in the rural areas – the offices are neglected.  They would 
<br/>have furniture from decades ago, and this is why the Ministry has been given the allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> If you go now to Vunidawa, you will see the change in the office in terms of equipping them, 
<br/>including multimedia and things like that.  This is why the allocation is given to the four Divisional 
<br/>Commissioners and of course, now, we have new stations like Kavala and Namarai and they have to be 
<br/>equipped as well so that they can perform their functions effectively and efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, I have a motion but I will probably change that for a 
<br/>clarification.  The honourable Minister has explained SEG 9 on institutional strengthening.  Does that 
<br/>cover the capacity building in provincial council offices, or just what you have mentioned? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  provincial  councils  come  under  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs, but this was a change done by the Qarase Government based on a Mosese Sikivou Report where 
<br/>we have come away from District Officer.  We still have the District Officer post but most of them were 
<br/>aligned towards the provincial administration and boundary, so their title now is Provincial Administrator.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of skills, if you look at SEG 7, I will use that example as well for community capacity 
<br/>building- we have talked about Turaga ni Koro, every now and then they are changed, Mata ni Tikina are 
<br/>changed - we do the trainings so that they are aware of the Government processes and systems and we 
<br/>have that allocation there as well.  Of course, from that institutional strengthening as well, particularly, 
<br/>when needs do arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I want to move without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 18-3-1-10 - Grants to Self-Help Projects be increased by $2 million from the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocated $1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, it is very clear that public funds are not entirely 
<br/>getting into the hands of those who need it the most, especially with this Budget.  Our rural people need 
<br/>access to their public funds to help them improve their livelihoods and dignity.  Why is Government still 
<br/>offering water-sealed toilets which are clearly non-Category 5 cyclone pro-structures as the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health recently did in a blitz in March?  Why are our people not being offered the latest 
<br/>technology that is better for our environment and improves health risks like, leptospirosis and typhoid, 
<br/>such as compost toilets that the SPC in Nabua have already assessed as having potential for use in the 
<br/>Pacific?  Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why are our rural communities, especially in the Western Division not 
<br/>being assisted and encouraged to get into solar farms, so that they can be self-sufficient in energy security 
<br/>and  sell  back  access  power  to  the  EFL  grid  under  power  purchase  agreements?  Surely,  with  the 
<br/>fluctuation in oil and energy costs, this should be topmost in the Government’s agenda.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members when you move an amendment, it is either increase 
<br/>or decrease.  Give one reason and that is it, that is what we do and either we increase it or decrease it.  
<br/>Any further comments on that motion.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, under the same SEG, there is an allocation 
<br/>for Rural High Risk Water and Sanitation which is specifically for water in high risk areas, those that 
<br/>suffer from leptospirosis, typhoid, et cetera, and of course flushed toilets. That is a new allocation that 
<br/>just came in two years ago.  Self-Help is a totally different allocation altogether for a different purpose 
<br/>which unfortunately she does not understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I have no further comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members we will now vote on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Can the honourable Minister detail why it cost 
<br/>$20,000 under SEG 7 - Guidelines for Constructing New Evacuation Centres and Retrofitting Existing 
<br/>Evacuation Centres ($20,000).  I am just wondering about who is going to be doing this.  I hope it is not 
<br/>going to be some lucky consultant come to pick the brains of our locals who know very well and have 
<br/></span><span>lived through these gaps already to prepare the guidelines for constructing new evacuation centres and 
<br/></span><span>retrofitting existing evacuation centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Which planet do you live on?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- How is this $20,000 going to be utilised for this SEG? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this essentially is to allow the NDMO to 
<br/>coordinate and facilitate discussions and consultations to lead to the formulation of guidelines for the 
<br/>construction of the new evacuation centres and the retrofitting of existing evacuation centres.  This is the 
<br/>NDMO coordinating and facilitating discussions with the various communities around Fiji. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, as I have alluded to so often in this 
<br/>Parliament, unfortunately, some of the community halls that are now referred to as Evacuation Centres 
<br/>were not build to standard and that is why we have to have a proper guideline and who is going to be 
<br/>awarded this?  It will be out on tender and anyone is free to bid and it will be awarded accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- For this $20,000, it is just for the discussion and consultation of 
<br/></span><span>the public.  You cannot build an evacuation centre for $20,000, nor can you get an expatriate consultant 
<br/></span><span>for $20,000 as you seem to allude. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  But  if  I  may  add  on  to  the  evacuation  centres,  Mr. 
<br/>Chairman.  I just told honourable Lalabalavu that this Friday before Parliament, I will be convening a 
<br/>virtual meeting, thankful to the new partnership that we have with UNDP.  Under the new strategic 
<br/>development plan that focuses on resilience, we have an allocation now through an organisation that 
<br/>will give us a few million dollars through that organisation to construct a few new evacuation centres 
<br/>and of course there is also opportunity to do retrofitting. So, we will be getting the list this Friday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you may recall, in the 2020 Budget, four evacuation centres were already approved but 
<br/>was not  funded because  of COVID-19.  So probably those four will be priority  but  again  we  are 
<br/>thankful for the partnerships that we have, it is not from Fiji taxpayer’s money but we should be able 
<br/>to do some evacuation centres and of course retrofitting as well in this new financial year.  So, the 
<br/>meeting will be this Friday, Mr. Chairman.

<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  do  have  a  motion.    I  have  no  further 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comments on that one.  This is on SEG 10 now, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Chairman, on Programme 4-1-10, I propose: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  this  SEG  be  increased  by  $2  million  in  respect  of  Disaster  Relief  and  Rehabilitation 
<br/>Fund which has been allocated $500,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I second, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, we all remember all the horrifying natural 
<br/>disasters that we have lived through just over the last few years and I really hope that we have learnt 
<br/>our lessons.  If another category five cyclone were to pulverise our nation like it did with </span><span>TC Winston,</span><span>
<br/>is this $500,000 allocation supposed to be enough to get us back on our feet?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Sir,  the  word  is  actually  “Relief  and 
<br/>Rehabilitation Fund.”  Sir, we already have other funds available.  We have, for example, the Prime 
<br/>Minister’s Disaster Relief Rehabilitation Fund account.  It has already got $3.2 million.  This Relief 
<br/></span><span>Fund, of course, Sir, is an emergency fund that is available to NDMO.  In case they need it during an 
<br/></span><span>emergency, for example, it can range from food, it can range to any other type of service.  We, of 
<br/>course have other funding too that is available to us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Qereqeretabua,  again,  has  misplaced  her  comments  that  this  is  the  only  fund 
<br/>available.  It is not.  There are other funds available too but there is a specific allocation made to 
<br/>NDMO in respect of any disaster, Sir, for relief purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I do hope that our side will support my 
<br/>motion because as I speak, there are people still living in tents after having been relocated, so I think 
<br/>that this $2 million increase is well justified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this amendment that Head 
<br/>18 be increased by $2 million in Programme 4-1-10 with respect to Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation 
<br/>Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we move on and vote on Head 18.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 18 agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 19 – Republic of Military Forces 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for any comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, can I just to ask a bit of clarification on Programme 
<br/>1-1-7 Basic Recruit Course. How many do we have each year and the numbers that you recruit per 
<br/>intake? I presume here that there is more than one basic recruit drive each year.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1781 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  With  the  allocation,  the  number  that  the  RFMF  is 
<br/>looking at  is 100 and they can just do that 100 within one training cycle, Mr. Chairman.  But I hope 
<br/>that the honourable Members are also aware that there is a recruit training that has just passed out 
<br/>recently.  It usually happens every year when we have selection for officers. So, when they have their 
<br/>recruit training, some also join then but  this is just for one recruit and about  100 personnel  been 
<br/>considered for this intake.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Staying  on  Programme  1-1-8,  I  am  just  asking  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  if  he  can  detail  the  SEG  8,  an  allocation  of  $900,000  allocated  for  the 
<br/>Renovation/Upgrade  of  RFMF  Infrastructure,  Amenities  and  Office  Buildings.    Could  he  please 
<br/>clarify if this will include the rebuilding of the 3FIR building that caught fire at Queen Elizabeth 
<br/>Barracks on Christmas Eve last year?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, can I also ask the honourable Minister to briefly update what the findings are from 
<br/>the National Fire Authority Investigations into this incident and should this allocation be increased 
<br/>to include 24 hour CCTV recordings?  I note that on SEG 8, there is also an Upgrade/Renovation of 
<br/>RFMF Quarters and Barracks but  my  questions  specifically is  about  the  3FIR  Building  at  Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth Barracks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The breakdown for the $900,000, $350,000 is allocated 
<br/>for  the  construction  of  a  new  warehouse.    The  aim  of  this  project  is  to  construct  a  new  RFMF 
<br/>Warehouse at Jerusalem Road in order to centralise procurement and distribution of stores for both, 
<br/>RFMF Operations as well as HADR activities in the Central and Eastern Divisions.  The estimated 
<br/>cost of the project is approximately $3.7 million which will be implemented in phases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Phase  1  will  involve  civil  works  such  as  road,  installation  of  EFL  power  supply  and  soil 
<br/>excavation work.  Phase 2 will involve the actual construction work for the warehouse. Phase 3 is 
<br/>the installation of equipment and commissioning of the project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, the project commenced in 2018-2019 financial year and funds were expanded 
<br/>to undertake the topographical survey for the lots at Jerusalem Road and due to funding constraints 
<br/>rising from the natural disasters and COVID-19, the project had to be deferred and of course we have 
<br/>the funding now for this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the funding for this year (2022-2023), funds allocated will cater for early civil works such 
<br/>as  side  levelling,  soil  compaction,  Environment  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and  the  installation  of 
<br/></span><span>service such as water, electricity and sewerage system. Mr. Chairman, another $100,000 is allocated 
<br/></span><span>for the upgrade/renovation of RFMF Quarters and Barracks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  2021-2022  financial  year,  the  funds  were  utilised  to  upgrade  and  renovate  nine 
<br/>quarters which consist of CO 3FIR’s quarters, 1x 6 married quarters at Queen Elizabeth Barracks, 
<br/>Nabuni and the Deputy Commander RFMF’s quarters and variation for Director Human Resources 
<br/>Management quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the financial year 2022-2023, funds allocated will be to cater for the three East and three 
<br/>West Accommodation.  These are soldier’s accommodation for those that do not know and of course, 
<br/>for East and West as well, the DLP for CO 3FIR’s quarter.  Of course, $270,000 is also allocated for 
<br/>purchase of ITU equipment.  The allocation caters for IT infrastructure and networking capabilities 
<br/>as well as procurement of IT equipment for the RFMF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again for the 2021-2022 financial year, the funds have been expanded for the procurement 
<br/>of desktops, laptops and installation of IT equipment, network structure, cabling, equipment storage

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>backup and the list goes on.  In fact, the estimate for it, Mr. Chairman is around $400,000 but the 
<br/>allocation is $400,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this financial year the infrastructure upgrade of $200,000 will focus on fibre optic and 
<br/>copper relocation, copper rehabilitation and running of new fibre optic cables at QEB and another 
<br/>$200,000  will  be  allocated  for  replacement  and  the  procurement  of  laptops,  computers.  
<br/>Communication equipment as well, an allocation of $200,000.  Kitchen equipment, an allocation of 
<br/>$65,000 and the purchase of specialised medical equipment.  Sorry, I will not go on the list where 
<br/>those will go but that is the breakdown of the $900,000 roughly, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, can I seek clarification on Progamme 1-9-8 - Upgrade 
<br/>of RFMF Nadi Camp ($250,000).  I think for most of us when you hear about Nadi and the military, 
<br/>there is Blackrock there.  The impression is that the military facility in Nadi is at Blackrock but the 
<br/>camp is still being maintained honourable Minister, can you explain why we have this?  That is the 
<br/>impression  the  public  gets  that  Blackrock  is  the  military  base  in  Nadi  and  here  you  are  still 
<br/>maintaining the Nadi Camp, can you explain that please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Blackrock has a different purpose, it is an institution for  
<br/></span><span>Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and Peacekeeping Training, but the troops that 
<br/></span><span>are in Nadi are there for the safety and security of the Airport and they have special arrangements 
<br/>with AFL and CAAFI.  That is why we need to maintain that Camp.  They have their drills, how long 
<br/>does it take them to get into the airport facility if there is a threat, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this allocation Mr. Chairman is for the kitchen and dining facilities in that Camp.  If you 
<br/>have been there, it is in a bad state for ages and this is why that allocation is given but we need to be 
<br/>in the AFL compound in Nadi for the obvious reason that I have stated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-5-7 - Maritime Surveillance 
<br/>Centre  Operations  ($50,000.    I  understand  that  under  the  Vuvale  arrangement  a  new  maritime 
<br/>essential services centre valued at approximately FJ$124 million in Lami is supposed to be ready by 
<br/>2024 and until that happens, do we still have our sovereign EEZ to police and surveillance?  Can the 
<br/>Minister clarify, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please, what is your question on $50,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  With  your  permission,  Mr.  Chairman,  to  explain  my 
<br/></span><span>question, just two days ago the Police Commissioner was on FBC News saying that Fiji did not have 
<br/></span><span>enough manpower to fight hard drug dealers who are exploiting our EEZ to sell methamphetamine 
<br/>and cocaine.  Is this allocation enough? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is to do with the Fiji Military Forces. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, RFMF, Navy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Yes,  we  have  a  huge  maritime  zone  and  we  have 
<br/>challenges to try and influence our EEZ but this is basically just for Maritime Surveillance Centre 
<br/>Operations when it was set up in 2017, Mr. Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This funds of $50,000 will be used for the payment of software allowance because they have 
<br/>the Marine Traffic Automatic Identification System, the flight radar ProAir satellite coverage, the 
<br/>VAMS licence and of course, these applies not only to the Fiji Navy but of course  also to all the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agencies  because  we  are  centralizing  our  maritime  surveillance  operations  and  that  include 
<br/>information on air rescue, information on land rescue and information on sea rescue as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a big change that we have done since 2018. You would recall, Mr. Chairman, when 
<br/>we had that incident in Labasa involving the plane, it was a difficult task trying to coordinate. Now 
<br/>this  is  why  we  need  all  these  different  software  because  land,  sea  and  air  rescues  are  being 
<br/>coordinated from one Centre. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Programme 1-5-7, Mr. Chairman, and before I move a motion, 
<br/>it is regarding a Naval Recruit Course of $150,000. Can we just get a clarification in terms of the 
<br/>number of recruits in terms of this $150,000 allocation and in terms of gender equality whether this 
<br/>will be accommodated in this basic recruit course?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  we  are  looking  at  70    personnel  and 
<br/>Government is an equal employment opportunity provider. We have women now in the Fiji Navy 
<br/>and as long as they meet the conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, 70 is the number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, yes, 70. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, I move a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase this basic recruit course by another $150,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- I second the motion, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Chairman,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  the 
<br/>information that has been given but I think there is a need to have more Navy recruit and personnel 
<br/>to take into account the new Surveillance Centre that will come into play in 2023.  Also, there is a 
<br/>need  to  increase  the  recruitment  of  girls  and  women  into  the  Navy  to  ensure  that  there  will  be  a 
<br/>criteria set.   There are a lot of unemployed  youths so there is  a need to consider this recruitment 
<br/>process in the Navy to try and give employment opportunities to our young girls, especially, now that 
<br/>the Government  is  using this labour scheme to  send people abroad.  So this  is  one way they can 
<br/>also… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  We do not send people abroad, people choose to go abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- … choose to come to the Naval Employment Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, I wish to say that we cannot just recruit 
<br/>people and then leave them idle because there will be no boats or no jobs for them.  Next year we 
<br/>will have, around May, the next boat that is coming online.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part of the manning of the </span><span>Puamau</span><span> which will be the new boat is considered here, we have 
<br/>to train them.  Of course, for women, as I have stated, Government and the Fiji Navy is an equal 
<br/>employment opportunity provider.  We have even now sent women for officer training and the first 
<br/>two have qualified.  The first one is from Verata District.  I want you to know that, Mr. Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUDUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  Head  19-1-6-1  -  Officers  and  Other 
<br/>Ranks  ($1.086  million).  Honourable  Minister,  we  understand  that  Territorial  Force  comprises  a 
<br/>significant  contribution  to  the  RFMF,  particularly  through  peacekeeping  operations  and  peace 
<br/>support operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament does not get enough feasibility about the use of the Territorial Force and how it 
<br/>interprets due to the lack of report by the RFMF with regards to Territorial Force part of their annual 
<br/>reports.  I  would  just  like  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister,  we  are  waiting  for  annual  reports  to 
<br/>understand this, so when should we expect the first annual report?  I know there has been a backlog.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  new  Commander  of  RFMF  has 
<br/>assured me that they are finalising the annual reports, as I have stated previously in this Chamber, 
<br/></span><span>that they will start from the current year and work backwards, because it goes with the audit reports 
<br/></span><span>as well.  So we should be expecting it and we just need to be familiar with the Annual Reports Mr. 
<br/>Chairman.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, I have a question for clarification from 
<br/>the honourable Minister on Programme 1-1-4 - Power Supply ($1.2 million).  I find similar entries 
<br/>for the other Divisions. Can the honourable Minister clarify that so that I do not have to answer the 
<br/>other similar allocations for other Divisions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, this is for the payment of 
<br/>electricity bills for all the police institutions and those in the living quarters, particularly the Police 
<br/>Headquarters, Nasese and Nasova Police Barracks and other institutions that currently fall under this 
<br/>activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  The  honourable  Minister  mentioned  about  Nasova 
<br/>quarters, et cetera. Does he also mean the Force is paying for electricity bills for the accommodation 
<br/>of police officers too or are these for the administration only of the Fiji Police Force? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would assume in the Minister’s reply, he alluded that this SEG 4 is for power supply and 
<br/>also covers the areas of Nasova. So my question is does that also cover the areas of accommodation 
<br/>for the police given that the assumption that police officers would be paying for their own electricity 
<br/>bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I will have to come back on that 
<br/>because I know that they used to have kerosene allowance.  Just to give the right answer, I need to 
<br/>clarify this and get back. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- If I could clarify, no it does not cover the individual quarters.  
<br/>This covers, for example the electricity bills for the police headquarters complex, the four Divisional 
<br/>headquarters,  CID,  Internal  Bureau  headquarters,  Narcotic  Bureau,  Fiji  Police  Academy  at  the 
<br/>Nasese, Nasova barracks as you know we have got facilities there, the Training Centre, et cetera, the 
<br/>Transport Pool, Forensic Building, Dog Kennel, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I might be jumping the gun here but like I had asked 
<br/>earlier for clarification.  The other Divisional Headquarters have similar allocations for power supply.  
<br/>You will find that like for instance on page 103 for the Southern Division you have an allocation of 
<br/>($200,000). I agree yes to police accommodation, police pay their own but I take it that this is for 
<br/>administrative purposes only rather than individual quarters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1-5, there is an e-transaction cost of 
<br/>$50,000.  What is the e-transaction cost relating to in the Fiji Police Force and this Criminal Information 
<br/>System annual fee of $50,000?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Chairman, this is to facilitate the changes to cashless 
<br/>transactions, particularly while obtaining police clearance to service providers like Vodafone, M-PAiSA 
<br/>and the Digicel whatever as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This Criminal Information System annual fee of $50,000.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  It  is  the  annual  subscription  fFor  the  Criminal  Records 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Information System (CRIS).  An Automated Fingerprint Identification System. (AFIS).

<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  Mr.  Chairman  on  Programme  1-1-5  -  School  Scouts  Programme 
<br/>($98,000).  Just a question to the honourable Minister, what schools would qualify for this programme, 
<br/>is it for male and female students?  If not, where is the Girl Guides programme, if this is just for male 
<br/>students?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  People had put in their proposals which was 
<br/>considered by the Ministry of Economy and one such proposal was put by Fiji Scouts Council and that is 
<br/>how this particular item is what you see before you and Fiji Sports Association will be using this money 
<br/>for training girls and boys.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, Programme 1-1-7 - Education Forum ($10,000).   Can 
<br/></span><span>we have some clarification from the honourable Minister in terms of the $10,000, is that enough to cover 
<br/>all the travelling in terms of those members who come to attend that Forum? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Yes, it is sufficient, Mr. Chairman, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 21-2-2-6: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, Programme 2-2-6, this issue seems that there is 
<br/>not enough funds for some of the primary schools I have come across in terms of maintenance.  So, I am 
<br/>not sure whether this covers that and the need for urgent school repairs, toilets, windows, pathways and 
<br/>upgrading of toilets, et cetera.  So, I am just wondering if that could be looked at and increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue,  honourable  Minister is school  grounds.  For  example, in Rewa, Naitasiri  and 
<br/>Tailevu there is only one ground there which is Cakobau Park and it is always congested. So, the school 
<br/>grounds are being used for major games.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In these provinces, we are using Naluwai District School, Burebasaga District School and Nakelo 
<br/></span><span>District School.  I have come across seeing them in terms of the collection of gate-takings, et cetera with 
<br/></span><span>the schools also partaking of that.  Major games are happening there so the grounds need to be upgraded 
<br/>and maintained.  I am just seeking clarification whether that can cover that because it just like an extra 
<br/>burden on the school committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, there is a purpose for FENC and the purpose for FENC is 
<br/>very clearly outlined in the school handbook. There are five categories and how the money should be 
<br/>used and there is no allocation for what he is talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  amount  be    increased  by  $5  million  because  obviously,    that  is  not  enough 
<br/>because  I have  seen schools struggling in terms of  basic maintenance, Rewa  District School, 
<br/>Burebasaga District School and some of them are buying their own furniture now and seeking 
<br/>donations. So, it is a rationale suggestion.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- So, the second one is definitely a need. It is an extra and it is not 
<br/>budgeted for the grounds used by for national competitions.  For example, Skipper Cup, Vanua Shield, 
<br/>and these includes a lot of wear and tear on the school grounds. The Committees have to bring in sand to 
<br/>bury the ground.  FRU keeps setting high standards and they come in, they do this and do that, otherwise 
<br/>you will not have the game here.  So, I am asking for extra allocation to the school committees. It is not 
<br/>only in Rewa, Naitasiri, Tailevu and it is all over the provinces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, there is provision, if the funds are left in any of those five 
<br/>areas that I mentioned for five allotments then they can request for virement.  So, provision is there for 
<br/>virement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You have your Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The provision is there but my assertion is not enough which is why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am moving the motion for an extra $5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question on amendment put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion lost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  under  Programme  4-1-5,  there  is  an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation of $20,000 for Year 12 Life Maths.  Can I just get some explanation for that, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, there has been a change in the curriculum and we have 
<br/>introduced Life Maths and Pure Maths.  Life Maths was introduced for Year 11 already, Year 12 will be 
<br/>introduced in the next academic year and this money is for training of teachers and preparing any resource 
<br/>materials that are required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  Programme  8-1-10,  the  question  is  on  the 
<br/>Rehabilitation of Levuka World Heritage Structure ($1.5 million). Can you explain what this is about, 
<br/>honourable  Minister,  and  whether  it  covers  individual  homes  where  they  are  required  to  have  the 
<br/>maintenance up to world heritage standards?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Chairman, the amount allocated under this particular SEG will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>used to rehabilitate Levuka Community Centre and St. John’s Catholic Church. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Mr. Chairman, just a question to the honourable Minister on St. John’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Catholic Church, what are you going to be doing there?  Is it for the stained glass or what is it for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  It is  a  complete renovation, ensuring that we  maintain that  place  as  a 
<br/>heritage, the way it was before.  If the stained glass is there, it will be maintained and the heritage architect 
<br/>as well as the team have put up the plan for the rehabilitation of those two sites.  If you are wondering 
<br/>where we are at this stage, the tender was called, it is closed, so we are in the construction or renovation 
<br/>phase now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P.TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, along the same line, I remember I asked 
<br/>this question in the Supplementary Budget.  Is this the same allocation as that or is this in addition to what 
<br/>was allocated in the previous one for Levuka in the March Budget because St. John was in that allocation 
<br/>too?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- This is the church, not the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Chairman,  if  I  could,  in  the  Revised  Estimate,  it  was 
<br/>$147,000, now it is actually $1.5 million, so obviously work has progressed.  So, we are going to go into 
<br/>the construction phase, to start doing the actual work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  has  been  a  change  of  $1.3  million  in  other  words,  physical  work  will  actually  start, 
<br/>happening at the restoration and strengthening of the Levuka Community Centre and the rehabilitation 
<br/>of St. John Catholic Church in Cawaci. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I am still on SEG 10, honourable Minister.  I 
<br/>would like to ask about the upgrade of the Fiji Museum with the allocation of $718,000.  Now this is 
<br/>under ‘R’ and the Museum I believe has been closed for quite a few years now. Do we have a date by 
<br/>when the Museum might reopen? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The Museum is open for certain functions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREREQERETABUA.- No, that is the verandah, but the actual Museum itself? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I will not be able to give you a date. Museum is run by a Board and they 
<br/>will be able to tell me the date. But I know there is a lot of work going on and they would like to complete 
<br/>that work before it is open to the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, honourable Qereqeretabua seems to make a lot of  “Oh, I 
<br/>notice under R”.  Yes, there is a reason for that because you actually have contracts and when it is under 
<br/>“R”, it means that it is being supervised.  So when contracts are given tenders, funds are released based 
<br/>on the acquittals that are made.  It is proper accounting.  When it is not under R, the money is simply 
<br/>given to the Ministry but because it is a major project it has to be under R.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, CIU also has a check-off on it so, for example, there is additional requirement of $468,000, 
<br/>you will note that in the last budget they received $250,000 and there has been an additional requirement 
<br/>of $268,000 for renovation of current storage, expansion of buildings of two levels, painting of exterior 
<br/>and  other  repair  works,  installation  of  air  conditioning  system,  installation  of  new  shelves  inside 
<br/>collection storage, wiring works and new extension. These are all the works that are done.  So ‘R’ (please 
<br/>understand) is nothing sinister as you are trying to portray, - ’R’ is when there is proper accountability so 
<br/>monies are then acquitted on the basis of acquittals made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 21 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 22 – Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL. P.  TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman,  I would like to  ask  the Minister under 
<br/>Programme  1-1-6  -  Grant  to  NGOs    ($1,000,000).  I  just  wanted  to  know  the  NGOs  that  are  the 
<br/>beneficiaries of this $1 million allocation and whether the RAF Fiji is included in that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Which NGO in particular - FRIENDS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, not FRIENDS.  FRIENDS is a friend of RAF.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1789 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- The particular list itself - I would not be able to tell you actually 
<br/>where the RAF is, but I can bring that later.  I just want to say, Sir, this was previously $500,000 but it 
<br/>has now been increased by another $500,000 to $1 million because obviously we found that we want to 
<br/>collaborate a lot more with CSOs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that has changed is the way that we actually process this.  Before we had this 
<br/>long-term arrangement that we had in place and we found in some instances that money was not used in 
<br/>a transparent way. So now we have an expression of interest that is done, all of them including St. John 
<br/>Ambulance have to apply every year and we then identify those who meet that, then we are able to work 
<br/>with them given the budget.  But we found that $500,000 was not enough and we are thankful it has now 
<br/>been moved to $1 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-Mr.  Chairman,  SEG  8  -  Maintenance  of  Sub-Divisional  Hospitals, 
<br/>Health Centres and Nursing Stations and I am asking this question on your behalf too, Mr. Chairman, 
<br/>as  this  is  about  the  Wainibokasi  Hospital.    What  type  of  maintenance  is  going  to  happen  at  the 
<br/>Wainibokasi Hospital in terms of this allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Chairman, I can say at this stage one of our multilateral 
<br/></span><span>partners has picked up Wainibokasi apart from a few other Health Centres in the next financial year, but 
<br/></span><span>that is not captured in this budget alone.  Wainibokasi is in our list for fixing, not through this budget line, 
<br/>but through one of our multilateral partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, still on SEG7, could the honourable Minister 
<br/>please clarify the allocations in Indemnity Charges of $150,000; Medical HR Contingency $2.5 million; 
<br/>Health Care Financing $30,000 and Health Information System $70,000? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Chairman,  the  Medical  Contingency  is  what  we  pay 
<br/>General Practitioners and Specialists from private sectors that actually do locum for us.  So if you went, 
<br/>for example, to Valelevu, it now has more than 20 doctors, and about five of them are actually locums 
<br/>and they come and provide support after hours at night.  So you would have seen some of these Health 
<br/>Centres now work 24/7.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why they are able to work 24/7 is because these doctors and Specialists work there 
<br/>after hours.  Our Specialists at CWM are being strengthened and supported by Specialists from the private 
<br/>sector who actually were working within the Ministry of Health, and we can bring them back on locum 
<br/>to help us, especially with the on-call arrangements as such.  The numbers we have here are 31 GPs and 
<br/></span><span>nine Specialists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Chairman,  on  SEG10,  there  is  this  Kidney  Dialysis  Treatment 
<br/>Subsidy of $1.5 million.  Can the honourable Minister clarify this, what percentage would this be to the 
<br/>total spent by people on dialysis?  It is saying that $1.5 million is going to subsidise dialysis, in the bigger 
<br/>scheme of things how much do we spend on dialysis every year?  I ask the question because I have a 
<br/>friends in Sigatoka, a colleague in my company whose mother has three dialysis a week and each session 
<br/>is $200, so he is spending $600 a week - how far does this go in helping to bring down the cost of dialysis?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Chairman, this is for those who meet the threshold, those 
<br/>below $30,000 are able to utilise this funding. We have dialysis available through the National Kidney 
<br/>Centre in Nadera and also the private dialysis units - those who meet the threshold are able to go there 
<br/>and the Government subsidises and gives $150.  In Labasa, that is run by the Board of Visitors and it is 
<br/>actually subsidised.  You also have to remember honourable Member, that dialysis is available at the 
<br/>CWM Hospital in the  Intensive Care  Unit, so  acute  dialysis   happens in the hospitals  for  any  Fijian 
<br/>whether  you earn $30,000 or more,  you get it for free.   If someone is very unwell and goes into the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hospital and needs dialysis to stay alive, they get it for free during that acute stage, but it is the chronic 
<br/>dialysis when they actually get home, those who actually meet the threshold can then apply and get this 
<br/>subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Tikoduadua, I always come back to you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, just in two parts; FFirstly, I would just like 
<br/>to thank the honourable Minister for saying that he is going to come back to us with the NGO names.  On 
<br/>SEG 6 - I just wanted to re-enforce that.  I have a motion on SEG 10 though, I do not know if you would 
<br/>like me to move that now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- No, not yet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,  just  a  matter  of 
<br/>clarification from the honourable Minister for Health with regards to SEG 1.  I note that the doctor’s 
<br/>salary is still the same with the allocation. Are you intending to recruit more doctors under this allocation?
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Do you mean the one from last year until now because if you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>look at it, last year it was $91 million now it is $92 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Secondly,  on  SEG  5,  with  the  increase  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation for security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I. WAQAINABETE.-  For security services  - $4.7 million, that  is for the security 
<br/>services that has been tendered out.  So, when you go to CWM hospital and Valelevu, during the time 
<br/>you were at the hospital we used to have people employed by the Ministry.  What we found is that in 
<br/>some instances they did not turn up to work or quite a bit of them were unwell.  That is why we outsourced 
<br/>it in the tender and at the moment I believe Grid Security is the one that is covering a lot of the hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Head 22-1-1-10 be increased by $500,000 with respect to Kidney Dialysis Treatment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Subsidy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, there seems to be a never ending need 
<br/>for kidney dialysis which is really proportional to the spread of NCD in Fiji.  I know we have had a whole 
<br/>lot of debate about this.  I am sure that there is never going to be enough money to allocate but in this 
<br/>regard, I believe that we should add another $500,000 to the initial allocation of $1.5 million to make it 
<br/>$2 million to create opportunity for people who are suffering from kidney  problems in to the future.  
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you Mr. Chairman, Sir, I speak for the motion from 
<br/>honourable Tikoduadua and in particular when we are talking about dialysis and kidney disease.  I always 
<br/>wonder how much funding we are giving to the prevention of NCDs in Fiji and I go forward a couple of 
<br/>pages  and  I  see  the  National  Centre  for  Health  Promotion  for  example,  is  getting  $200,000; 
<br/>Communicable Disease Prevention and Control - $80,000; Non-Communicable Disease Prevention and 
<br/>Control - $150,000 and so forth, so I want to endorse the motion from honourable Tikoduadua to increase 
<br/>the allocation for dialysis treatment subsidy.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, if I may, when someone has kidney dialysis 
<br/>that means their kidney is already diseased, the prevention is completely different.  We are talking about 
<br/>kidney dialysis and I want to make a few things clear.  In the previous budget it was $75 subsidy about 
<br/>two budgets ago.  This is the government that actually provided a subsidy of $75 then it went up to $150.  
<br/>In the last budget it was $1.2 million, it is now being increased by $300,000 to $1.5 million.   It has 
<br/>increased on the number of patients that are seen, identified by the doctors that actually meet the threshold.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Housing and Community Development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Sorry,  his  is  not on this  particular Head.   I am  just 
<br/>trying to ask a point for clarification, Mr. Chairman.  Because you had announced earlier that we 
<br/>would end with  Head 22, can we just  get  some indication in  terms  of how far  you would like to 
<br/>proceed in terms of the Head?  We are fine if you want to proceed but just how far as we need to re-
<br/>sort our notes and all that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I am surprised, you normally do your homework well ahead of what we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have to do.  Just give me five minutes and I will answer that question for you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 23.

<br/>Economic  Empowerment  of  Persons  with  Disabilities,  Programme  1-1-7  -  $18,000.    Could  some 
<br/>clarification be provided on that please in terms of programmes, where it is covered and the nature 
<br/>of the coverage?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, this is in lifting up persons living with 
<br/>disabilities and their families out of financial hardships through skills training and provision of seed

<div><span>grants for business of successful recipients.  A training will be conducted by a successful trainer who 
<br/>is experienced in training persons with disabilities, proposed some relevant licence if needed, seeds 
<br/>release-based on approval processes. It is for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This funding is increased by $8,000 but as you also know, Mr. Chairman, that there other 
<br/>assistance too apart from the allowances that the people get jobs anywhere else, we get a 400 percent 
<br/>tax deduction. So we find a lot of people or some people are being given employment opportunities.  
<br/>This is just to help them. And of course there are other Ministries that can also help them whether it 
<br/>is through maritime development, agriculture, et cetera, in terms of jobs or farming, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, this is still on Activity 1.  On SEG 7 
<br/>there  is  an  allocation  of  Community  Based  Corrections  Programme  -  $70,000.  I  need  some 
<br/>clarifications from the honourable Minister with regards to the nature of the programmes allocated 
<br/>here. What relation is that to the Yellow Ribbon Programme covered for women? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, if I could clarify, Community Based Corrections is a 
<br/>system that fosters community based sentencing options and rehabilitation/reintegration of offenders. 
<br/>It complements Yellow Ribbon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also,  Mr.  Chairman,  it  cater  for  activities  like  purchase  of  information, 
<br/>communication, education materials, rehabilitation programmes, mini expo for children or in conflict 
<br/>with the law, juveniles, restorative  justice conferencing and awareness, monitoring evaluation and 
<br/>learning  exercise  for  the  activities  carried  out  on  rehabilitation  programme  and  there  is  also 
<br/>consultations with magistrate, in particular with juveniles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  refresher  training  for  the  community  volunteers,  supervisors  and  there  is  some 
<br/>remuneration for volunteers. The allowance of supervisors are, of course, paid only on days they are 
<br/>engaged, so maybe say twice a week, that is what it caters for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- On Programme 1-2-7 -  Integrated National Poverty 
<br/>Eradication Programme ($200,000). Is this like for the whole of the Government Ministry or just an 
<br/>aspect of that for women, children and poverty alleviation?  What does it cover, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this unit monitors and evaluates the impact of poverty, 
<br/>alleviation programmes of Government, Intergraded National Poverty and Eradication Programme 
<br/>Framework  (INEP)    which  will  contribute  and  assist  towards  poverty  reductions.  So  they  work 
<br/></span><span>together with the different Ministries saying, “Look, this is our experience, how can we actually help, 
<br/></span><span>identify  and  alleviate  poverty?”  This  is  an  integrated  approach.  You  will  also  see  that  it  is  for 
<br/>Strengthening  Coordination  Structures  Mechanism  Framework  Systems  under  INEP,  monitoring 
<br/>evaluation  of  10  Government  Poverty  Alleviation  Programmes  and  conducting  awareness  on 
<br/>Government’s Poverty Reduction Programme. The Budget for this has increased slightly by about 
<br/>$15,000 compared to the previous budget. So, it is now $200,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 3-1-8, can we have an update on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Barefoot College ($1.1 million)?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, this is coming to a conclusion.  The reduction and the 
<br/>allocation of course is a final contractual payment for the completion of the project. The Barefoot 
<br/>College, Mr. Chairman, Sir, is to empower rural women in Fiji to be solar engineers, be local capacity 
<br/>and electrify poor of the grid communities’ clean low cost solar energy. It is the first ever woman 
<br/>solar  training  centre  of  its  kind  in  the  Pacific.  It  will  create  low  carbon  development  pathway  to 
<br/>reduce the current and future contribution of climate change.

<div><span>A total of 1,200 rural households are expected to benefit each year from this initiative. To-
<br/>date the total percentage of works completed is 72.76 percent.  The works that have been carried out, 
<br/>site  civil  works,  ceiling  electrical  works,  interior  painting  works  underway  at  classroom  and 
<br/>administration building, the ceiling and tiling works, interior painting works underway at the staff 
<br/>accommodation building plus the works underway at the water tank base and battery room, electrical 
<br/>works underway and piping works underway.  We expect this to be completed in this financial year 
<br/>and we hope to have the launch of it very soon.  In fact it is a big deal for that particular part of Vanua 
<br/>Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on Head 24.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 24 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 25 – Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, on Programme 1-2-7 ($500,000) for 
<br/></span><span>Youth Capacity Building and Training Programme.  Can I ask the honourable Minister to explain 
<br/></span><span>what programme is included in this allocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, it does involve a number of initiatives.  It 
<br/>covers  the  Youth  Development  Programmes  and  support  the  youths  with  Youth  Farm  Initiatives 
<br/>Assistance  and  income  generating  projects  for  improved  livelihoods  and  their  well-being.    The 
<br/>Capacity Building and Training Programme is in line with the Government’s Budget Guidelines  - 
<br/>Economic  Recovery  and  New  Business  Development,  protection  of  the  most  vulnerable  and  of 
<br/>course food security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, some of the initiatives that have been engaged in this particular programme 
<br/>has  been  climate  change  programmes,  conduct  and  implementation  of  National  Certification 
<br/>Resilience Level 1, Youth Coast Care Programme ($8,000), Implementation of Waste Management 
<br/>Programme  ($8,000),    Youth  Grant  and  Youth  Farm  Initiative,  Youth  Farm  Initiative  Assistance 
<br/>($160,000), Income Generating Projects ($100,000), Training Cost at Nasau Youth Training Centre, 
<br/>Agriculture  Training,  Carpentry  Training,  Outreach  and  Monitoring  of  Youth  Grant  Assistance 
<br/>Training Programmes, Youth Club Registration (we help them to register their clubs) and Wages for 
<br/>Youth Training Centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Chairman, one of the big initiatives that the Ministry of Youth is helping us with is getting 
<br/>all the youth clubs to register so they can also qualify for this Jobs for Nature 2.0 programme that we 
<br/>have got, where Government will actually pay them the minimum wage which will be $4 an hour 
<br/>from next year January to actually go out and plant trees.  For them to qualify, a youth club has to be 
<br/>registered or women’s club has to be registered for them to qualify and we have allocated substantial 
<br/>amount of money for this programme.  The Ministry of Youths is working together with the Ministry 
<br/>of iTaukei Affairs, Rural and Maritime Development, they are all working in conjunction to be able 
<br/>to ensure that we roll this programme out well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, seeking clarification from honourable Minister.  
<br/>Before I note that we used to have Construction and Maintenance of Rural Grounds on Programme 
<br/>2-1-10 or some thereabouts.  Is that in another programme or is it deleted? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Chairman, if I could respond?  It does not mean it is deleted, 
<br/>but it means that at moment it is not funded.  Of course, Mr. Chairman, it can come back on, but we have

<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this particular purpose the construction of hard courts.  We support the construction of two hard courts; 
<br/>one is the construction of a hard court in Tataiya  Memorial School, Rakiraki and Kamikamica Park, 
<br/>Lautoka and the construction of two multi-purpose courts at Tuatua Housing in Labasa and Vunidawa in 
<br/>Naitasiri.  The one in Rakiraki and the Kamikamica Park will cost around $94,000, the construction of 
<br/>the two multipurpose courts one will be at the cost of $180,000 and the one in Naitasiri will be at the cost 
<br/>of $360,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, on SEG 6 - Overseas Sporting Tours 
<br/>allocation of $1.9 million. In that allocation, would you also include teams like the Drua franchise or 
<br/>is it for other sport given that Drua is a franchise already supported by Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, the way the Drua works is that if you see this allocation 
<br/>in Head 50, you will see the $3 million for the purchase of the rest of the shares. So this will be a 
<br/>total input of $6 million. Drua then does its own thing.  Their company and they have worked within 
<br/>their own financial framework. This is in respect of other overseas sporting tours so the ones that 
<br/>have been identified, Mr. Chairman, Sir, is the Archery, Pacific Games Athletics, Basketball, Cricket, 
<br/>Hockey,  Netball  (we  have  also),  Fiji  Rugby  Union  which  is  the  Women’s  15  ranking  event,  the 
<br/>Northern Tour sanctioned event which is the preparation of the 2023 World Cup playing Scotland, 
<br/></span><span>Ireland  and  France  and  the  Fijiana  15  test  match  playing  Japan,  Australia  and  New  Zealand 
<br/></span><span>essentially  to  improve  our  ranking.  So  this  is  what  it  has  been  allocated  for.    World Cup  Sevens 
<br/>ranking  event,  Special  Olympics  -  Summer  Games  and  Weightlifting,  Pacific  Games  through 
<br/>Oceania, Senior, Junior and Youth games and Yachting.

<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 25 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 26 – Higher Education Institutions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I note that USP is not there but there is no 
<br/>point in asking for an explanation.  So I suppose we will just need to ask the question, will you pay 
<br/>the grant in the term of your Government and include that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Or will that be reconsidered and on what grounds?  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Just take into account what is under Higher Education on that Activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM. Sir, I had explained this in the Revised Budget Address that 
<br/>should USP go ahead with  the independent  investigation in  respect  of the matters that have been 
<br/>identified by Chair of ARC and the Chancellor and investigation results come out, we will find the 
<br/>money to provide the funding. We are quite happy to do that and we can do that.  But they have to 
<br/>go through that process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- I do not know whether you are commenting or …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- I am lamenting this because we are really telling the whole world 
<br/>that USP is no longer important to us.  At least put a provision in here and then decide how to go.  If 
<br/>you totally remove it from the Estimates, you really are telling people that this is an institution that

<div><span>will  no  longer  support  and  no  longer  consider.    Look,  the  perception  you  are  creating  is  very 
<br/>dangerous, when you come up with something like that.  It is mind-boggling that we can just turn 
<br/>our back on an institution like USP.  I just cannot comprehend it.  How can you be so careless about 
<br/>USP?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You want us to throw money … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- No.  You have issues but at least make the provision in the budget 
<br/>and work towards rectifying the issues.  Here you are telling everyone, you do not care, close the 
<br/>university, go somewhere else.  That is what you are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Order! Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, you can only discuss what is here in the budget.  If USP is not here, it 
<br/>is not here for discussion.  You can discuss other university or institutions that are there, that is what 
<br/>it is.  That is what the budget is about.  We are talking about this current budget. That Programme 
<br/></span><span>regarding USP will come up during the year, it always will.  It has come up in the past, Government 
<br/></span><span>has dealt with it in the answers, it will come up again in the future, but it is not an end, it is a thing in 
<br/>progress.  Government has made the conditions so let us just stick to what is here on Head 26-1-1.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will vote on that Head. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 26 agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 30 - Ministry of Agriculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Can we just get a clarification on 1-1-10 from the honourable 
<br/>Minister  regarding  the  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority  -  Capital  Grant  ($1,500,000);  and 
<br/>Committee on Better Utilisation of Land ($6,900,000)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, the AMA Grant is given to AMA to allow them to 
<br/>collect produce from interior, maritime areas where other exporters do not go and middlemen do not 
<br/></span><span>go and pick it up because it is expensive, it is not worth.  This particular amount is given to allow 
<br/></span><span>them to go and pick up the produce, bring it and sell it and pay them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, on the same SEG, I would like to move 
<br/>a motion: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To increase this allocation on SEG 10 for Agriculture Marketing Authority from $1.5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million to $2 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Chairman, the issue of Agro Marketing Authority 
<br/>has always been a matter for concern for rural-based farmers, particularly, the subsistence farmers, 
<br/>as the honourable Minister has explained.  The issue seems to suggest that there has never enough 
<br/>capacity within AMA to receive all of the produce that the farmers expect AMA to buy. In order to 
<br/>alleviate  that  particularly  because  this  is  dealing  with  the  poorest  of  the  poor.    To  increase  this 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1796 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocation from $1.5 million to $2 million to look after the interest of all our rural farmers whose 
<br/>produce if they come to the market would normally rot if they are not able to sell it in time and if the 
<br/>private sector does not take them.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, if I can explain, that is incorrect that AMA has 
<br/>not been able to pick up produce. AMA has expanded in terms of area of collection and AMA has 
<br/>grown in terms of volume that they collect and AMA has grown 300 times in terms of the number of 
<br/>containers that they are lifting and exporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>AMA has also expanded in terms of the produce that they pick up.  Now, they are picking up 
<br/>in extended areas - fish, they are picking up </span><span>dalo</span><span>, cassava, </span><span>kava.  </span><span>Mr. Chairman, Sir, if you look at 
<br/>the AMA numbers now, they will show you that AMA has done extremely well over the last three 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue of volume, what we have done is to ensure that we pick up the produce as much as 
<br/>possible, we have also made two tier price.  The first tier we offer them the market price and then 
<br/>beyond that first  tier volume, we  are offering them  a slightly lower price so that we  collect  their 
<br/>produce and sell it at a lower price here so that they are not able to leave their produce and rot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Chairman, Sir, AMA has done extremely well and I urge the honourable Member to 
<br/>see me later on and I will give him the data on how AMA has expanded in terms of collection area 
<br/>and in terms of volume. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Chairman, Sir, I support the motion for the need to increase 
<br/>the allocation for AMA Capital Grant.  There is a need to increase the presence of AMA, for example, 
<br/>in the Province of Naitasiri. There is a need to set up a collection centres say in Vunidawa, Sawani 
<br/>or Naqali.  This is evident Mr. Chairman, Sir, during the lockdown as a lot of farmers brought their 
<br/>produce down to  Sawani and most returned to  the village without their produce being  bought  by 
<br/>AMA.  This is something I hope that the AMA will look into to ensure that when farmers bring their 
<br/>produce to the respective collecting centres they need to first be paid at an equitable rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If not at the market rate, you need to pay them first at a rate that is usually transacted in the 
<br/>market and also make sure that most of the farmers when they bring their produce to the city centres 
<br/>are  received  by  AMA.  So  I  support  the  motion  in  the  sense  that  there  is  a  need  to  increase  your 
<br/>presence closer to the farmers and setup collection centres rather than bringing their produce right to 
<br/>Nausori to sell. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- No, Mr. Chairman, Sir, let me tell you something: that areas closer 
<br/>to Nausori, et cetera, where the exporters and middlemen are picking up.  By law we are not supposed 
<br/>to pick it up from  them, we are not going to the farmers because these are the areas where exporters 
<br/>are picking up and the exporters are complaining before that AMA is cannibalising in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So we made it very clear to AMA that these are the areas that you are not supposed to go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are supposed to go to Kadavu, Cicia, Nadarivatu, Nabuatoutou, Cikobia … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Listen, let me explain, what happens is that when the exporters have 
<br/>enough of produce in this area then they do not want to pick up the extra, then these farmers bring it 
<br/>up and they want to dump it up with AMA.  Then AMA buys it but does not go to those areas because 
<br/>the  exporters  will  complain.    These  are  Sawani,  Muaniweni,  Viria  –  these  are  areas  divided  by  the 
<br/>exporters.  There are designated exporters who are operating out of these areas.  AMA is not supposed to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1797 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go and collect from those areas.  It is only in the interior where exporters are not going, that is where 
<br/>AMA  is  going.    That  is  what  this  operating  grant  is  for,  for  them  to  go  because  those  areas  are  not 
<br/>economical for private sector operators to go and pick it up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  can  I  add  one  thing  because  as  part  of  the  budget 
<br/>consultations,  we had a number of submissions on this.  We had one gentleman saying I want a particular 
<br/>price for my cassava.  I am not getting it at Nausori Market because there is in fact an oversupply of 
<br/>cassava.  A lot of people are growing it, so the private sector comes along, there is a lot of competition, 
<br/>they pay a lower price.  This farmer said I want to be paid this price.  AMA should pay me this price.  I 
<br/>said but how can AMA pay this particular price and what will AMA do because they cannot sell it.  He 
<br/>said I really do not care.  You just throw the cassava away but I want my money for the cassava.  AMA 
<br/>cannot do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will be completely unsustainable.  AMA simply cannot buy at a price that the market does not 
<br/>dictate.  If AMA buys it at that particular price then AMA will not be able to sell it because people want 
<br/>to pay a lower price.  How will they be able to export it?  That is some of the things you need to understand 
<br/>and I think some of the contributions being made simply see AMA just as a buying agency.  But AMA 
<br/>also, when it exports itself, it also makes money too.  This is why some of the funding there, they do not 
<br/></span><span>give  a  100  percent  because  they  use  that  money  to  also  go  and  do  more  business.    So,  we  need  to 
<br/></span><span>understand that, Sir,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- .  Thank you, Sir.  Just a matter of clarification from the Minister.  If he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can just clarify about this programme of the Committee of Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Speak on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Sorry, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- Honourable Members, we will now vote on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Sir, can I get my right of reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.- You can.  I am feeling generous.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I hear what the honourable 
<br/>Minister is saying and the clarification by the honourable Attorney-General.  The reality on the ground is 
<br/></span><span>that, the subsistence farmers are saying there is a disconnect between the Ministry of Agriculture and the 
<br/></span><span>farmer, in terms of the agriculture encouraging farmers to produce but at the same time since AMA is 
<br/>under the authority also of the Ministry of Agriculture, it is unable to deal, unable to accept everything 
<br/>that the farmers produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  I  recognise  the  issue  on  the  interest  of  the  private  sector  in  this  regard  as  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General has explained.  But the reason why we would like to see and you know, a 
<br/>higher allocation than what is allocated here is because the need is great.  You only have to go to the Suva 
<br/>Market or the Nausori Market, Mr. Chairman, to see the farmers who come all the way up from the </span><span>colo</span><span>
<br/>of the Waidina, </span><span>colo</span><span> of the Wainimala to sell their produce like </span><span>dalo</span><span>, </span><span>tavioka</span><span> and </span><span>vudi</span><span> in great amounts 
<br/>but are unable to you know sell it all because the volume is too much, so there is a lot of reliance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Agro Marketing to look after the interest of farmers that are well into the interior of Viti Levu.  I 
<br/>recognised what the Minister is saying, that farmers down below are also trying to take advantage of that 
<br/>but I would still ask, Mr. Chairman, for the interest of all these people, who you know, who have rotten 
<br/>produce every Sunday morning, who are unable to sell their goods because there is so much volume but

<div><span>it is not being bought by Agro Marketing, to increase the allocation at least by $500,000 to $2 million to 
<br/>meet the needs of these poor subsistence farmers.

<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Chairman, just to clarify the misconception…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-  Yes, do not get angry.

<div><span>Motion lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Head 30-2-2-9:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I want clarification from the honourable Minister regarding Activity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2-2-9 on  Farm Mechanisation of $1.5 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  there  are  two  components  to  that.  I  had  explained 
<br/>yesterday in my speech that we are now going in big time into mechanisation of our agriculture sector. 
<br/>In that mechanisation agenda that we have, we want farmers to form cooperative where we will provide 
<br/>them with machinery. In this case, there are three machineries we are targeting, tractors, excavator and 
<br/>rice harvester.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we are organising the farmers into groups and getting them to register as a cooperative and 
<br/>we are looking at providing tractors, excavator and harvester.  So, for harvester we are looking at 10 
<br/>harvesters this time around and three excavator in this area where ginger grows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Which areas are you targeting for this ginger excavators? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Naitasiri  area  and  then  we  are  looking  at  providing  tractors  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cooperatives throughout Fiji about 25 of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these three machineries, Government will provide through this allocation - two-third of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>total cost and one-third will be provided by these groups of clusters of cooperatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- On SEG 10, there is a machinery outsourcing, how is that different 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from this farm mechanisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Chairman,  this  is  the  first  time  the  Ministry  of  Economy  has 
<br/>provided this $7 million. Until now the Ministry has been organising its tractor for land preparation, 
<br/>excavator for land clearing, bulldozer for land clearing.  But giving the limited number of machinery, we 
<br/>will not able to get the machinery on time to the farmers. So, we have now decided with the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy that we will outsource the entire activity, whether you need it for ploughing, in field drainage, 
<br/>land clearing, you need a bulldozer or an excavator, tractor or rotavator, there is a 50/50 cost sharing 
<br/>basis.  So, it ensures greater efficiency of service delivery. It will ensure that farmers get it before the 
<br/>planting times starts, so that there is no delay in that crop cultivation and ensure that we are able to bring 
<br/>in new land under cultivation eventually raise productivity and production.

<div><span>Debate on the 2022-2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1799 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr. Chairman, can  I just ask  the  honourable Minister to  give  us an 
<br/>indication of the waiting  time that the farmers experienced when they book a tractor or what not?  We 
<br/>have been getting a lot of calls that it take months before the machinery gets into the farmers.   Do  you 
<br/>have an average rating time nationally or regionally? Can you indicate that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- That is precisely why we are now outsourcing. It will not be our tractor 
<br/>they have to book, they have to wait.  What Ministry of Economy will do, they will get a tender out to 
<br/>register  providers  of  machinery.    Those  who  will  provide  tractor  in  area  wise  in  Nadi,  Lautoka,  Ba, 
<br/>Labasa, Seaqaqa, Wainikoro, et cetera, excavator, bulldozer, so the moment we get a request we will 
<br/>immediately go and inspect and then give the job order to that particular registered provider whether it is 
<br/>a tractor, excavator or bulldozer, they have to pay their 50 percent and when the job is done we inspect 
<br/>and then we will pay the remaining 50 percent to the provider. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Chairman, when will you expect this to be in place, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- As soon as the Budget is out, the Ministry of Economy will get the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tender out.  So it will take a couple of months to get this through.   
<br/></span></div>
