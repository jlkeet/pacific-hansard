<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee of Supply - Budget Estimates 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, Parliament will now resolve into Committee of Supply to consider each 
<br/>Head in the Budget Estimates.  It is envisaged that this process will be completed on Thursday evening, 
<br/>after which the Committee of Supply will then vote on the Schedules and Clauses of the 2022-2023 
<br/>Appropriation Bill 2022.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, we will attempt to complete debate and votes on 
<br/>Heads 1 to 22 before we adjourn tonight.  As you are already aware by now for the Committee stage, I 
<br/>will sit at the Table with the Secretary-General and Members will refer to me as “Mr. Chairman”. The 
<br/>mace will also be placed on the lower bracket, signifying that Parliament is in Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the Secretary-General will then announce each Head separately.  Members 
<br/>may then speak on that Head and you may speak more than once on each Head. Please take note that in 
<br/></span><span>some of the Heads, there will be several programmes and activities listed.  I remind Honourable Members 
<br/></span><span>that we will deal with these progressively and we will not regress to the programmes and activities that 
<br/>have been earlier discussed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as you may all be aware, you may also move amendments to the Estimates 
<br/>under the respective Heads.  If a Member moves an amendment, I will call for a seconder and then debate 
<br/>will ensue.  At the end of the debate, the mover will have the right of reply and this will be followed by 
<br/>the vote on the amendment.  This will be the process for all amendments that will follow.  Amendments 
<br/>are limited to those permitted under Standing Order 100(2) being an increase, decrease or removal of the 
<br/>item or subhead from the Head being debated.  When there are no further amendments and debates, we 
<br/>will then proceed to vote on the Head.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please take note that the amendment slips and copies of Standing Orders 
<br/>100 have been placed on your tables to assist you during the Committee of Supply stage.  E-copies have 
<br/>been emailed to all honourable Members connecting virtually.  There are Heads 1 to 50 which we need 
<br/>to get through today and tomorrow, therefore, I seek your full cooperation during this crucial process.  I 
<br/>think that is clear.  Everyone has been through this before.  We will be going through this again in our 
<br/>own time.    
<br/></span></div>
