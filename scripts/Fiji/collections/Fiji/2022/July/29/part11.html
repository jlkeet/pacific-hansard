<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(11)</span><span> </span><span>Fisheries (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 38/2022). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be speaking on all the 11 Bills altogether. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of the first Budget amendment – Bill No. 28/2022, before I do speak on the Bill itself, 
<br/>Sir, I would like to point out a typesetting error.  If honourable Members could look at Clause 5 of the 
<br/>Bill and the heading is “</span><span>Sections 115A and 115B inserted</span><span>”.  If you read Clause 5, it says, and I quote: 
<br/>“The principal Act is amended after section 115 by inserting the following new sections -”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will see the next heading, “</span><span>Investigation or complaint by the Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service</span><span>”.  As the heading above suggests, you have ‘15A’ but it should be ‘115A’, so ‘1’ dropped off in 
<br/>the typesetting - apologies for the typesetting error. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill seeks to amend the Tax Administration Act 2009 to address budgetary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policy changes.  It: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Allows the CEO to pay into the Consolidated Fund any uncollected refund amount that has 
<br/></span><span>remained uncollected for five or more years from the date the refund has become due. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Empowers the  Tax  Agents  Board to  refer complaints to the  Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service (FRCS) to investigate those tax agents.  The Board is also empowered to compound 
<br/>all offences under Part 4 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sets a time limit of 31st December, 2022 within which a claim for refund of Non-resident 
<br/>Withholding  Tax  paid  for professional services by  a resident person where the tax was 
<br/>collected contrary to the provision of any Double Taxation Agreement may be made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provides  a  general  reference  to  the  chairperson  of  the  Board,  that  is,  by  removing  the 
<br/>reference to the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Removes  reference  to  the  Superyacht  Charter  Act  2010  as  a  tax  law  to  align  to  the 
<br/>amendments made to the Superyacht Charter Act 2010 (which I will come to later on) and 
<br/>for the Superyacht Charter Act 2010 to be read together with the Customs Act 1986.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will not specifically go into the Clauses itself because they are quite self-explanatory.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, we had widespread consultations on this including representation that 
<br/>were made by the Superyacht Charter industry, in particular from the Fijian professionals who look after 
<br/>the superyachts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  in  respect  of  Bill  No.  29  of  2022,  it  seeks  to  amend  the  Income  Tax  Act  to  address  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budgetary policy changes. The Bill provides for: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A  new  division  on  repurchase  transactions  or  repo  transactions,  any  gain  made  on  the 
<br/>disposal of security under repo transaction would be exempted from  Capital Gains Tax 
<br/>(CGT). The Bill also excludes a person under repo transaction from the requirement to file 
<br/>a CGT tax return.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exempts resident individuals and Fijian citizens from CGT on the disposal of shares held 
<br/>before 1st May, 2011; and
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="5">Page 5</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1971 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remove the concessionary rate of 17 percent for companies relocating the international 
<br/>regional headquarters to Fiji going up to 20 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in respect of Bill No. 30 of 2022, again, Sir, just one type setting error I would say if the 
<br/>honourable Members look at the Bill itself you will see Clause 1 then you have Clause 2.  Clause 2 should 
<br/>just have the heading “</span><span>Section 14 amended</span><span>”.  Just to put it in perspective, if you turn the Bill over you 
<br/>will see, for example, Clause 3 says “</span><span>Section 21 amended</span><span>”, Clause 4 says “</span><span>Schedule 1 amended</span><span>”, back 
<br/>to the front page, Clause 2 should have a heading that says “</span><span>Section 14 amended</span><span>” which is already there 
<br/>in any case, but the heading got dropped off.  There is no substantive change to the amendment itself just 
<br/>the heading needs to be there, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual amendment seeks to amend the Value Added Tax Act to address the 
<br/>budgetary policy changes.  Clause 1 of the Bill provides for the short title.  Clause 2 amends section 14 
<br/>of the Act to remove the 15 percent VAT which is applied on the importation of electric vehicles.  You 
<br/>will see in Clause 2 all the various codes that applies to electric vehicles. Clause 3 of the Bill amends 
<br/>section 21 of the Act to ensure that VAT reverse charge is paid by a person who is registered for VAT 
<br/>for  relevant  services  received  by  the  person  from  anyone  outside  Fiji.    Clause  4  of  the  Bill  amends 
<br/>Schedule 1 to the Act to allow for the disposal of residential dwellings used to provide accommodation 
<br/></span><span>by way of hire to be exempted from VAT, regardless of whether input tax was claimed in relation to the 
<br/></span><span>residential dwelling or not, which will help a lot of ordinary Fijians, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next Bill is Bill No. 31 of 2022 which is the Customs (Budget Amendment) 
<br/>Bill. It seeks to address the customs announcement made in relation to the policy itself, changes through 
<br/>the Budget.  Sir, Clause 1 of the Bill provides to the short title and commencement.  Clause 2 of the Bill 
<br/>amends Section 2(1) of the Act to insert a definition for the term “approved form” and to extend the 
<br/>definition of “customs laws”.  For the purposes of clarity, an “</span><span>approved form” is a form approved by the 
<br/>Comptroller.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 amends section 64 of the Act to empower the Minister responsible for 
<br/>finance to prescribe offences for any breach of the customs prohibited imports and exports regulation 
<br/>including  penalties  for  such  offences  not  exceeding  a  fine  of  $25,000,  imprisonment  of  a  term  not 
<br/>exceeding 10 years.  Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 148A of the Act to provide that any person who 
<br/>engages in the business of forwarding cargo on board an aircraft or ship without a licence under the 
<br/>section, commits an offence and is liable for conviction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have seen a lot of people now just ad hoc becoming agents - we need people to be licensed 
<br/></span><span>so we can have some clarity around those who can provide that particular service.  We have people for 
<br/></span><span>example who use the services of organisations and then those organisations sort of disappear overnight 
<br/>and their goods get lost, et cetera, so this is to instil confidence in the business transactions. There is a 
<br/>transitional provision in relation to the licensing of freight forwarders whereby any person who, prior to 
<br/>1st August, 2022, engages in the business of forwarding cargo on board an aircraft or ship, without a 
<br/>licence must obtain a licence on or before 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022, so they are given a month to get that 
<br/>licence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also we want the CEO or the Comptroller of Customs to be able to publish 
<br/>and publicly make available all licenced freight forwarders.  So any ordinary citizen who is importing 
<br/>things know exactly who to go to as opposed to just sort of finding their way around, so in this way 
<br/>we  know  that  these  people  are  actually  licensed.    The  Act  also  provides  for  the  review  of  the 
<br/>Comptroller’s  decision  under  any  of  the  Customs  laws  and  again,  the  provision  to  empower  the 
<br/>Minister to prescribe penalties not exceeding a fine of $25,000 and imprisonment of 10 years or both.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next Bill No. 32 is the amendment to the Customs Tariff Act - Customs  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>1972 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tariff (Budget  Amendment)  Bill. Clause 1 provides for the short title. Clause 2 is to  provide for 
<br/>change in duty rate of passenger motor vehicles.  And again, you will see that, Sir, in the Bills itself, 
<br/>the various codes are there in which you will be able to see the tariff codes.  You can see in section 
<br/>2, it is all listed here and these were all announced in the Budget itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just by way of summary, an import of excise of 5 percent will now be imposed on importation 
<br/>of new diesel or petrol passenger motor cars.  In addition, a fiscal duty rate of 5 percent will now 
<br/>apply on the importation of new hybrid passenger motor cars.  Furthermore, on the specific rate of 
<br/>fiscal duty on used passenger vehicles (diesel, petrol and hybrid) will increase by $1,000 per unit.  
<br/>Import VAT will not apply on the importation of pure electric powered buses, passenger motor cars 
<br/>and  motor  bikes  to  promote  and  support  the  use  of  green  technologies.  The  concession  220  is 
<br/>applicable to persons taking up initial permanent residence in Fiji, persons on work permit in Fiji and 
<br/>returning residence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 3 of the Bill amends concession code 220 to provide that used motor vehicles imported 
<br/>under this concession, conform to the import licence conditions stipulated under Customs Regulation.  
<br/>Concession 247 is applicable to the prawn industry.  Currently there are conditions on the importation 
<br/>of prawn larvae, prawn feed and lime through this concession.  Such conditions include the imported 
<br/></span><span>goods being used directly for the prawn farming industry only.  So it is again to assist the prawn 
<br/></span><span>farming industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  Clause  3  of  the  Bill  amends  concession  code  247  to  delete  such 
<br/>conditions and instead, provide that the only condition of such importation moving forward will be 
<br/>that the concession is reflected in the price of the goods at retail sale.  This will facilitate the sale of 
<br/>these  specialised  goods  to  companies  and  other  entities  within  the  sector.  This  will  also  provide 
<br/>further support to small scale and developing companies and other entities that are not able to directly 
<br/>import  supplies.    Clause  3  of  the  Bill  deletes  concession  code  270  on  jet  skis,  given  it  is  now  a 
<br/>redundant concession as the duty rate on jet skis is free in any case, so you do not need that code,  
<br/>essentially we are cleaning up the law itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excise Budget (Amendment) (Bill No. 33 of 2022), Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of 
<br/>the Act by inserting a new definition for the term “Minister” responsible; Clause 3 amends the Act 
<br/>by inserting a new section 2A to provide that the Act must be read as one with the Customs Act 1986, 
<br/>as I have referred to earlier on; Clause 4 of the Bill amends the Act by inserting a new section 25A 
<br/>to provide for the amendment of assessments of excise duty by manufacturers; Clause 5 of the Bill 
<br/>amends the Act by inserting new sections 38A, 38B and 38C to provide for dealing with goods subject 
<br/></span><span>to lien and garnishee orders; and Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill amends sections 52, 53, 54 and 58 
<br/></span><span>of the Act respectively for consistency purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next Bill, (Bill No. 34 of 2022) which is the Superyacht Charter Act, as you know that 
<br/>this Act established a charter permit system to allow superyachts to charter in Fijian waters.  The 
<br/>amendment  Bill  seeks to make Fiji  competitive  with  other holiday destinations by amongst  other 
<br/>things, extending the category of superyachts that may charter in Fijian waters.  Moreover, the Bill 
<br/>seeks to amend the Act to provide for ease of administration in which the powers available under the 
<br/>Customs Act 1986 will now also apply to this particular Act.  So there is unison between the actual 
<br/>laws themselves too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of clauses in respect to that.  Some of the key ones is the 
<br/>definition of “Code of Conduct” by deleting the reference to “FIHTA subcommittee” and substituting 
<br/>“body  responsible  for  overseeing  of  hotel  and  tourism”.    We  are  amending  the  definition  of 
<br/>“Environment and Climate Adaptation Levy” to delete the reference to the “Schedule” and deleting 
<br/>the definition of “FIHTA subcommittee” too.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1973 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 5 of the Bill which is important, section 7 of the Act to decrease the 
<br/>Charter Free from “$USD55,000 “to “$USD30,000”, the rest of the Bill is in compliance with all of 
<br/>the submissions that have been made regarding that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next Bill (Bill No. 35 of 2022) is the Tertiary Scholarships and Loans 
<br/>Act.    In 2021 the Parliament enacted  amendments  to  the Act  to  change  all reference to  “Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarships and Loans Board” to “Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service”.  This measure was 
<br/>undertaken to reflect the service-based approach that has been adopted by the Tertiary Scholarships 
<br/>and Loans Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 14 of the Act establishes the secretariat which comprises of the CEO and other staff 
<br/>as the Service deems necessary but does not provide for the specific functions of the Secretariat in 
<br/>relation to the Service and the Act.  Of course, this particular organisation is growing and we need 
<br/>some  rules  around  the  functioning  of  this  organisation.    Therefore  to  remove  an  ambiguity,  the 
<br/>Tertiary Scholarship and  Loans  (Budget  Amendment) Bill  seeks to  amend the Act  to  remove the 
<br/>secretariat and provide for the appointment of the CEO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also provide for the CEO’s responsibilities and allows the CEO to appoint employees 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Service.    Further,  the  Bill  provides  for  the  exception  from  liability  for  the  service  and 
<br/></span><span>employees of the Service.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill further provides for the change of name of the 
<br/>Act from the “Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Act” to “Tertiary Scholarship and Loans Service Act”. 
<br/>Those  Clauses,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  reflected  in  the  Bill  amendment  itself  to  give  that  level  of 
<br/>transparent guidance and governance in that organisation itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Insurance (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 36 of 2022), the 
<br/>Act itself provides amongst other things the regulation of business of insurance and for the licensing 
<br/>and supervision of insurers and insurance intermediary or what we call “brokers”.  Under section 42 
<br/>of the Act. Sir, a person may apply to the Reserve Bank of Fiji for a licence in order to carry on a 
<br/>business as a broker or an agent for an insurer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Insurance (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 seeks to amend the Act to 
<br/>increase  the  licence  term  to  a  term  not  exceeding  five  years.    This  will  not  only  help  with  the 
<br/>administration of licensing of insurance agents in the country, it will also help insurance agents in 
<br/>the business operations for a longer period.  It gives them certainty, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many people and I know many of you would know insurance agents whether they are selling 
<br/></span><span>life insurance or general insurance. I remember honourable Rasova did engage in that many years 
<br/></span><span>ago. But you would have had to get your insurance agent licence renewed every year and a lot of 
<br/>people actually earn a good living through this. So, you should not have to go and renew your licence 
<br/>every year, some of them have been doing it for the past 40 years or 50 years. So, this is making life 
<br/>easier for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, the </span><span>suki</span><span> and the cigarette sellers, they get a licence now for five years.  This 
<br/>is basically in alignment with that, to make life a lot easier and of course they can get up to five years.  
<br/>Some may choose to get a licence only for three years, that is their choice, but you can now get it up 
<br/>to five years and we know most of them will get it for five years or will apply for five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill No. 37 of 2022, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Veterinary Surgeons Act 1956 provides a registration 
<br/>of Veterinary Surgeons in Fiji. Section 2 of the Act defines the Registrar as the Assistant Director 
<br/>Agriculture (Animal Health and Production) and it includes any person lawfully appointed to act for 
<br/>him or her. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>1974 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently the position of Assistant Director Agriculture (Animal Health and Production) does 
<br/>not exist and in practice so far the Registrar’s role has been carried out by the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>responsible  for  agriculture.  The  Veterinary  Surgeons  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill  2022,  therefore, 
<br/>seeks to update the Act and to align current practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also seeks to amend the Act to provide for the registration of Veterinary Surgeons 
<br/>and the regulation making power of the Minister.  The Bill further seeks to amend the Act to include 
<br/>the Fiji National University students under Schedule 2 of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are various amendments to that and as highlighted in the Budget, we 
<br/>will now have the ability to those people who can act, what we call as “para-vets”.  They are not full 
<br/>vets but they are para-vets.  They can do certain things.  Some of them can even setup their own 
<br/>businesses because at the moment for example, the Ministry of Agriculture will not allow farmers to 
<br/>administer antibiotics on the animals because you have to give the right levels. If you do not give the 
<br/>right levels for antibiotics, it is passed through the animal, the animals can die or when the human 
<br/>consumes that, the humans actually gets affected by that level of antibiotics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a huge study being done in fact the former Executive Chair of BAF who has just 
<br/></span><span>completed his PhD in London just a couple of days ago.  His entire thesis is built around that as to 
<br/></span><span>how antibiotics and antibodies pumped into animals, passes onto human beings.  There has never 
<br/>been any such research done in Fiji.  So, at the moment the Ministry of Agriculture does not allow 
<br/>the farmers to administer that.  With para-vets, they can actually maybe go and setup their practices 
<br/>in Dreketi, Seaqaqa, Nadroga, Ba or wherever else it is where there are a lot of cattle and they can 
<br/>then  administer  them.    So  the  Minister  will  be  empowered  to  include  these  people  within  this 
<br/>particular framework and also it eases the burden on the Ministry of Agriculture because they have 
<br/>a limited number of people, they cannot be on every farm all the time, 24/7.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the next amendment is Bill No. 38 of 2022.  It provides for the requirement 
<br/>for a licence to be issued by licensing officer to take fish for trade or business.  Licence issued under 
<br/>the Act terminates on 31st December each year.  The Act also provides that a fishing vessel used for 
<br/>trade or business is to be registered and the registration is renewed annually.  Moreover, under the 
<br/>Act, for a licence to be issued to fish in a registered customary fishing grounds, a permit issued by 
<br/>the  commissioner  of  a  Division  is  first  required.    In  other  words,  the  Commissioner  has  to  be 
<br/>involved.  The permit is granted for a period as the law currently provides for a period not exceeding 
<br/>three years but expires on 31st December each year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commissioner will first consult the customary fishing owners before issuing the permit.  
<br/></span><span>However, the current practice is that the Commissioner issues the permit until 31st December the 
<br/>year the permit was applied for.  A licence issued to take fish in a registered customary fishing ground 
<br/>is subject to the terms and conditions of the permit issued by the commissioner and of course the 
<br/>commissioner does that in consultation with the customary fishing owner rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  process  of  applying  for  a  licence  or  permit  every  year  and  of  the  renewal  of  the 
<br/>registration  of  the  fishing  vessel  annually  can  be  time  consuming  and  creates  administrative  and 
<br/>logistical difficulties.  As a result, a fisher (man or woman) may not have a lot of opportunities to 
<br/>secure bank loans and to invest in the fishing business due to the short period of licence or permit 
<br/>granted.  Sometimes they apply in January.  By the time they get a licence, it may be April and they 
<br/>have only then a few months to fish.  Sometimes they may get it in May, they only have four or five 
<br/>months to fish.  As a result, even though the customary fishing owners may say yes, we give permit 
<br/>for this person to fish here for the next three years but the licence is only issued on a yearly basis.  
<br/>So, if the customary fishing owners, to put it in short, customary fishing owners agree that a person

<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1975 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can fish in that particular area for the next three years, we now with this amendment can actually 
<br/>issue the licence for three years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the amendment Bill seeks to amend the Act to give certainty and allow for more 
<br/>investment particularly in terms of securing bank loans and indeed many, we have had interest from 
<br/>many customary fishing owner rights people themselves who want to get a licence because they want 
<br/>to get into fishing themselves.  They want to go and secure a boat, they want to go and buy a boat 
<br/>but they need longevity as far as the licence is concerned.  Some of them have monies, they may 
<br/>want to get a loan from FDB but if they have a fishing licence for three years themselves and they 
<br/>are  the  customary  fishing  owners,  FDB  will  be  more  readily  be  able  to  lend  them  the  money.  
<br/>Sometimes they require only $5,000 or $10,000.  So with a licence of three years, they can secure 
<br/>that loan and be able to get into business themselves as opposed to simply giving it out to other people 
<br/>who will come and fish in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again as my notes here this will also encourage the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people who have 
<br/>customary  rights  over  the  customary  fishing  ground  to  invest  themselves  in  commercial  fishing 
<br/>business as they now would have the ability to secure bank loans, et cetera and get into commercial 
<br/>fishing themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also seeks to amend the Act to clarify that a permit granted to fish in a customary 
<br/>fishing  ground  will  only  be  granted  by  the  Commissioner  and  only  upon  consultation  with  the 
<br/>customary fishing owner rights and the owners themselves.  The requirement for consent from the 
<br/>customary fishing owners further reinforces the current practices and strengthens and protects the 
<br/>rights of customary fishing owners themselves.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are the bills that we have 
<br/>put in place by way of amendments and they are the introductory remarks for them.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  outset,  let  me  again  express  my  serious 
<br/>concern with the way these Bills are being brought into Parliament.  We have had a week of debating 
<br/>the Budget and it is customary from tradition, from past practices that you also dedicate a week to 
<br/>debate the Bills. They are consequential and very much part of the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Monday,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  spoke  in  my  presentation  about  the  many  gaps  the  many 
<br/>opportunities in revenue for this country that have gone begging or have been repealed without this 
<br/>House without the Members fully understanding the magnitude of the losses to the income to this 
<br/></span><span>country.  I quoted the case about Stamp Duty, an Act that has been there since 1936 or so it was 
<br/></span><span>repealed  about  a  year  or  two  ago  in  this  manner,  most  of  us  not  realising  that  $80  million  was 
<br/>removed, was denied our treasury.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And of course there are other messures that were repealed; withholding tax $120 million came 
<br/>through the same way, company tax from 28 percent to 20 percent came through the same way, the 
<br/>branch profit tax $70 million same way, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) $74 million in the same way, so I 
<br/>could go on, Mr. Speaker and lament the fact that we, on most occasions, do this blindly and that is 
<br/>inexcusable, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Did we know that when the honourable Minister said that we will repeal the Stamp Duty Act 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we will be losing $80 million? Did we know that? We did not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  I talked about the revenue loss. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We did not, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>1976 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- After the Budget last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, and it is because we bring Bills in this manner and as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a result there is short fall in revenue we end up borrowing.  The deficit grows and we borrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And,  of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  highlighted  the  cases  where  some  revenue  measures  were 
<br/>legislated six years ago but not activated.  Somebody is sleeping on the job and it is because of the 
<br/>manner they bring these Bills into Parliament.  As we have said in the past it is legislation by ambush.  
<br/>We did not have enough time to study this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole of this week we were going home late in the evening.  We did not have time to 
<br/>study these Bills.  We should have been given these Bills a week or two ago and dedicate the next 
<br/>following week for this debate, Mr. Speaker.  The country loses out and as we in SODEPLA say the 
<br/></span><span>lewenivanua</span><span> lose out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I raised a number of issues and cases where a lady was sent home to die because she could 
<br/>no longer afford dialysis.  I spoke about a young woman who is selling her body because she cannot 
<br/>repay her TELS loans.  I talked about families of six that live in one room. All these are happening 
<br/></span><span>because there is perceived shortage lack of revenue.  And yet the revenue goes begging because this 
<br/></span><span>Government is pandering to the interest of a select few at the cost of the people of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I mean the honourable Minister is saying “hogwash”. Hopefully this is done in 
<br/>Cabinet  before  you  bring  it  to  Parliament,  do  you  do  that?  Obviously  they  do  not  have  Cabinet 
<br/>meetings to discuss all these things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, SODELPA the focus is on revenue and we have carried out an analysis of the 
<br/>revenue potential based on the figures we are given today, if implemented, if we bring back all that 
<br/>has been repealed the deficit will decrease from $800,000,000 to $300,000,000 and that is leaving 
<br/>the expenditures intact.  If we work on the expenditure, there could be a surplus. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and there are other tax measures to be legislated and they have not done it 
<br/>because if you are not collecting, you will end up borrowing.  Everywhere we go in Fiji even our 
<br/>people who you thought do not understand economics are asking the question “What about all these 
<br/></span><span>dinau, </span><span>who is going to pay?”  The </span><span>dinau </span><span>will grow if you continue to ignore the revenue opportunities 
<br/>for this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, specifically on Bill No. 29, clause 3 states: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Capital gain made by a resident person of Fijian citizen on the disposal of shares 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if the shares were held by the person before 1 May, 2011”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I make the point again, have you have time to discuss this?  We would 
<br/>have highlighted the fact that Fiji’s citizen is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2015, only Fiji 
<br/>resident because a Fiji citizen can be living in Australia holding a Fiji passport.  He would come to 
<br/>Fiji, dispose of his assets and take the money back to Australia with Fiji losing on income.  We want 
<br/>to remove ‘Fiji citizen’ from this because it is not defined in the Income Tax Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And again Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it has come through a Committee, people would have picked 
<br/>this up, not in this manner.  At least we have people now who are watching this and are advising us 
<br/>of these anomalies that you tend to slip in in the way you bring in Bills into this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1977 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we remove “Fiji citizen” and keep it at “Fiji residents”.  Fiji residents are 
<br/>people, organisations, corporate bodies that is it, Fiji residents, the way it is defined in the Income 
<br/>Tax Act 2015.  You bring in Fiji citizens, the potential loss is huge and we must avoid that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this clause 138 which now increases the concessionary tax for company 
<br/>regional headquarters to Fiji from 17 to 20 percent.  This was given some years ago with the belief 
<br/>that it will bring more companies to Fiji. You have the headquarters in Fiji and we believe there is 
<br/>only  one  company,  ANZ  that  took  advantage  of  this,  but  I  believe  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy is saying there are two.  We would like to know who the second one is.  But all these 
<br/>years, this concession has not worked and we are now increasing the tax from 17 to 20 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said on Monday in 2012, we used to collect 28 percent on 
<br/>Corporate Tax.  We brought it down to 20 percent, we brought it down to 17 percent and some are 
<br/>paying  10  percent.    I  highlighted  the  case  where  in  2012  or  2013,  we  were  collecting  about 
<br/>$421,000,000 from this and it has come down to $121,000,000.  That is the scale of the losses that 
<br/>we see by reducing these taxes without proper scrutiny by the people of this country; by Parliament 
<br/>and the Committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have stated that SODELPA will take Corporate Tax back to 28 percent the way it was, so 
<br/></span><span>that this country can collect revenue that helps serve our people.  That is the crux of the matter, we 
<br/>must look after our people.  Every time you give away something, remember you are denying our 
<br/>people that revenue.  Every time you do that, you are denying our people services.  SODELPA will 
<br/>provide free tertiary education.   SODELPA will forgive the TELS debts, we can do it because we 
<br/>will watch the revenue streams of this country. We will be careful that we look after our people and 
<br/>not, as I have said, pander to the interest of the few. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Stop campaigning! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It is not campaigning, Mr. Speaker, I am trying to drive home  a key 
<br/>message here, “Do not treat revenue measures in this cavalier manner.” I just hope, Mr. Speaker, that 
<br/>we were given more time to scrutinise these Bills, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Bill, Mr. Speaker, there was 150 percent tax concession given to these companies to 
<br/>relocate over here for their capital outlays.  The amendment is silent on that.  What is happening to 
<br/>the 150 percent tax concession, honourable Minister for Economy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the sort of things, Mr. Speaker, that should come to the fore.  It can be highlighted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if we have time to deliberate on these Bills, not in the manner that is being done here today, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister highlighted the case that SODELPA will introduce a 
<br/>resource tax to benefit the iTaukei and we have highlighted the number of companies that will be 
<br/>contributing to this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- And tax who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  There  is  a  list  of  companies  that  will  be  taxed  –  companies  that 
<br/>impact on the environment, the resource owners, and the honourable Minister asked, “How are you 
<br/>going to spend it?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  what  will  happen,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  will  collect  this  tax  and  we  will  spend  it  on 
<br/>upgrading the villages across the country - $50,000 per village every year.  That will be the money 
<br/>spent on villages to upgrade them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, that is what you can do when you watch your revenue.  But there is always this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>insinuation that it is racist or that it is only for a particular segment of the population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- But, Mr. Speaker, let us not forget that when we bring in free tertiary, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is for everyone.  When we forgive TELs debt, it is for everyone …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … let us stop all these indigenous issue.  Our people, the resource 
<br/>owners, deserve to be uplifted.  We have been saying that for quite some time and SODELPA is 
<br/>ready to do it with a tax at 5 percent on the companies that I have highlighted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, again, I express my disappointment that it is done in this manner, that the 36 
<br/>Bills or something came through this manner and I just wish, Mr. Speaker, that in the next Parliament 
<br/>when SODELPA is in charge, it will be done in a proper way … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … not in the manner that it is being done to us today, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my contribution today, Mr. Speaker, and we are missing out a lot with the cavalier 
<br/>manner and the very casual manner that FijiFirst runs this Parliament and in particular, the way it 
<br/>looks after the revenue measures of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make my contribution on the Consequential 
<br/>Bills this morning.  First, I would like to state that the contents of the Bills seem to be devious and 
<br/>deceiving in terms of what is highlighted in the individual Bills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will start with the Fisheries (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 38/2022).  I hope that 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Economy and the honourable Minister for Fisheries will provide some 
<br/>insights and clarity in the amendments that are before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note that the new amendments require the consent of the iTaukei people, 
<br/>whose fisheries rights may be affected, as  given for any such period.  I would like to request the 
<br/>honourable Minister to enlighten us, is there any certain threshold that needs to be obtained from the 
<br/>fisheries licence holder, like any Native land leases you need 60 percent that is clearly stated in here?  
<br/>Maybe, the honourable Minister can enlighten Parliament that there is a certain percentage which is not 
<br/>highlighted in this Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other is that. we acknowledge the three year term that has been given to the licence holders.  
<br/>The issue here, there are certain fishing grounds that are covered under the marine protection areas.  The 
<br/>monitoring of all these licence holders that is an issue that needs to be also clarified, especially when 
<br/>licence holders usually fish at night and they do not know whether the person fishing is the rightful licence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1979 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>holder to that particular area.  So these are some of the issues and concerns, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation 
<br/>to the amendments on the Fisheries Bill.  We would like the honourable Minister to also enlighten this 
<br/>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we welcome the Veterinary Surgeons Act, especially with those in the dairy 
<br/>industries. They need to be assisted in terms of tackling diseases like brucellosis and future disease that 
<br/>will come to the farming areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the amendment of Insurance Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, note that the Bill has now increase the 
<br/>term  to  five  years  but  have  recently  passed  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  Act  but  the 
<br/>implementation of this Act is still to be done until this day.  These are some of the things regarding these 
<br/>Consequential Bills when they are introduced in this House but for the actual implementation of these 
<br/>Bills that will become a question and concern, especially whether the relevant ministries and departments 
<br/>have the necessary resources and capacity to implement and monitor these suggestions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of tax administration amendments.  We question the intent of Clause 3 
<br/>of the Bill where the Act to allow for future of uncollected refunds that have remained uncollected for 
<br/>five years, or more from the date of the refunds that are due by paying the uncollected amounts into the 
<br/></span><span>consolidated funds.  If the honourable Minister could enlighten us, what is the amount involved that he 
<br/></span><span>needs to amend these particular clauses in the Income Tax Administration Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some of the concerns and issues that probably need clarification from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister for Fisheries and also from the honourable Minister for Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand on the 
<br/>Consequential Bills, particularly on the  Income Tax Bill No. 29 of 2022, on the issue of Capital Gains 
<br/>Tax (CGT).  I would like to state that the spot given by this Government to big businesses, specifically 
<br/>the financial institutions is immoral.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In grievous time such as this, the huge increase in fuel prices where ordinary struggle businesses 
<br/>are going to suffer terribly.  Here we see this Government providing tax relief amounts to millions of 
<br/>dollars to the already rich banks and other approved financial institutions.  This CGT exemptions is just 
<br/>one side of this  despicable tirade this Government  is  giving  a $200 million  as COVID-19  guarantee 
<br/>scheme at 0.25 percent to the same financial institutions and the same on land at the rate of 3.99 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out  of  nothing,  this  Government  is  giving  these  financial  institutions  the  same  group  to  be 
<br/></span><span>exempted  from  CGT,  a  whopping  1,500  percent  mark-up.    The  qualifying  5,553  businesses  that  are 
<br/></span><span>supposedly  to  be  assisted  had  been  hoodwinked  additionally  to  the  huge  fuel  price  increase  this 
<br/>Government is charging them via this group, a mark-up of 1,500 percent.  I urge this Government to scrap 
<br/>this on our poor and struggling businesses.  We urge that this Government direct the financial institutions 
<br/>to charge only 0.25 percent to the 5,553 struggling businesses.  In grievous times such as this, the huge 
<br/>fuel increases has already made a huge dent on the businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Those are my suggestions on this particular area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on tertiary scholarships, Bill No. 35 of 2022.  We note the debt of $581 million 
<br/>and we are very concerned about the honourable Attorney-General’s suggestion and arrangements being 
<br/>made to pass this on to the banks.  We feel that this will be a further noose on our students, especially, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when  you do that,  you  are black-marking them.   The  time is  going  up  with the  rules, regulations or 
<br/>conditions of banks and this will further dampen the enthusiasm of students and their commitment in 
<br/>trying to get into the workforce to start a life after they graduate.  It will hinder their progress in terms of, 
<br/>for example, travel, getting further loans, may be some interest in property or even vehicles, not only for 
<br/>them as young students but if they want to start their families.  These are hindrances to them and a burden.  
<br/>We urge that this, in terms of TELS, be re-looked at and that they remain as per the current arrangements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  have  three  other  speakers  on  my  list  for  this  agenda  item.    Honourable 
<br/>Members, we will take a break for morning tea now and after that, we will take the first  speaker the 
<br/>honourable Qereqeretabua.  Make sure you are here on time.

<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  </span><span>vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>  and  good  morning 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everyone, I am pretty sure we are all happy it is a Friday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to state categorically that this intervention of mine on Bill 
<br/>No.  38  of  2022,  I  just  want  to  make  sure  that  it  is  on  the  </span><span>Hansard,</span><span>  I  am  not  against  fishermen  or 
<br/>fisherwomen earning some money due to the temporary lifting of the ban on </span><span>dri</span><span> or </span><span>bech de mer</span><span> but I do 
<br/>wish to share some concerns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am afraid the honourable Attorney-General in his introductory remarks about Bill No. 38, kind 
<br/>of cherry-picked around the issues and it is quite sad but it actually quite predictable that Government 
<br/>tinkers with little elements of the Fisheries Act just to make them popular before the Elections, while the 
<br/>holistic overview of our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the resources in our EEZ that the State is 
<br/>merely a custodian for, on behalf of us the taxpayers, who are also voters are largely ignored. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No  specific  stock  assessment  for  the  lucrative  </span><span>dri  </span><span>or  </span><span>bech  de  mer</span><span>  fishery  has  been  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament that gives us some comfort that this so-called temporary lifting of the ban is based on good 
<br/></span><span>science that will ensure that the </span><span>bech de mer</span><span> are also allowed to carry out their core-function of keeping 
<br/></span><span>our reefs clean.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government, I am afraid, is probably only fixated on the quick returns when the </span><span>bech de mer</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is landed in Hong Kong or China.  It is all just a rush job for temporary relieve for the….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Bullshit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Wow! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he can withdraw the word ‘bullshit’  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Because it is unparliamentary language 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- No, that is a lie! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The “bullshit”, but you can change that to lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just mind your expressions in Parliament.  You have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, that was quite shocking!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Anyway, this Government is the least bit worried about Fiji’s blue ocean sovereign EEZ’s ability 
<br/>to provide fresh protein daily to the people.  Instead this Bill distracts us with high value species within 
<br/>the inshore fishery while the sharks, the sharks - the two-legged sharks, are thrashing around enjoying 
<br/>our EEZ (full chow!) knowing we have major gaps and laxity in the protection of our Fiji offshore fishery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The RFMF Navy has only $50,000 budget allocation for Maritime Surveillance Centre operations 
<br/>as  we  were  told  this  week.    We  know  that  under  the  </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>  arrangement  a  new  Maritime  Essential

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services Centre valued at approximately FJ$124 million in Lami, is supposed to be ready by 2024.  But 
<br/>until that happens, Mr. Speaker, we still have our sovereign EEZ and fisheries to patrol and survey.  How 
<br/>does this Bill suggest that the fisheries ministry do that in partnership with other border security agencies?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just three days ago, the Police Commissioner was on FBC News saying that Fiji does not have 
<br/>enough manpower to fight hard drug dealers who are exploiting our EEZ to sell methamphetamine and 
<br/>cocaine, and that is coming from the head of police.  Forget about fisheries then.  Where in this Bill does 
<br/>it cater for fisheries to immediately cancel or impose fines or hard penalties like blacklisting with the 
<br/>Regional  Fisheries  Management  Organisations  or  (RFMOs)?    On  fishing  vessels  such  as  the  </span><span>Tiro  II</span><span>
<br/>longliner where a Fiji national died from that horrific beheading and for which to this day, the taxpayers, 
<br/>let alone their families, still have no idea about what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where in this Bill does it compel Fisheries to cooperate closely with the navy and get more vessels 
<br/>out in the water patrolling areas of interest that they can see on the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) or 
<br/>through Automatic Identification Systems (AIS)?  Where in this Bill does it suggest a sensible target like 
<br/>300-days at sea patrol for fisheries enforcement and surveillance?  Where does this Bill deal with IUU – 
<br/>Illegal,  Unreported  and  Unregulated  fishing?    Where  in  this  Bill  does  it  compel  Gen3  reports  from 
<br/>fisheries observers to be scrutinised by the inter-agency taskforces?  Where in this Bill does it protect our 
<br/></span><span>domestic, regional and international  fisheries  observers with  proper  employment  contracts, insurance 
<br/></span><span>cover and compensation from injury or death?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill is disappointing, Mr. Speaker, and should be withdrawn and brought back with tighter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fisheries protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, at the outset, if I may, I will only be speaking on two particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bills that is Bill No. 38 and also Bill No. 34.  I will continue on with the fisheries tone, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Bill No. 38, I rise to support the Bill to amend the Fisheries Act.  The amendment, 
<br/>specifically, will provide for longer tenure for fishing licence and the registration of a fishing vessel and 
<br/>the  permit  to  fish  on  registered  customary  fishing  grounds.    This  is  actually  done,  Mr.  Speaker,  to 
<br/>encourage investment in the commercial fishing space.  The current practice of applying for a renewal of 
<br/>licences  or  permits  annually  makes  the  process  actually  quite  cumbersome  and  creates  additional 
<br/>administrative and also logistical burdens on businesses, and also on our fisher-folk particularly MSMEs.  
<br/>This is something that we are actually trying to ease, so we have to look at it in that particular perspective, 
<br/>Sir. This results in the loss of opportunities for our fisher-folk as they may not be able to secure bank 
<br/>loans  to  invest  in  their  fishing  businesses,  noting  that  banks  and  commercial  firms  would  find  such 
<br/></span><span>lending, risky due to the short period of that particular licence or permit granted.  This actually causes a 
<br/></span><span>hindrance to fishers who operate their fishing business to actually earn their livelihood, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these amendments basically simplify all those particular processes.  As we all know, 
<br/>the commercial fishing industry like any other industry has been severely affected by the COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, with  ships anchored for months without business, and with a vision of sustainable fisheries 
<br/>for a bluer Fijian economy, we have to ensure that our businesses in the fishing industry are offered an 
<br/>inclusive environment to keep their businesses sustainable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This amendment also, Mr. Speaker, will allow businesses to hold licences or permits for a period 
<br/>not exceeding three years and this is the Government’s commitment to ensuring ease of doing business 
<br/>even for the smallest of businesses. This will not only streamline the process but it will give certainty to 
<br/>lenders, Mr. Speaker, to lend to these fisher-folk.  Consequently, Sir,  I wish to reiterate that the Bill 
<br/>ensures  that  the  permit  granted  to  fish  in  a  customary  fishing  ground  will  only  be  granted  by  the 
<br/>Commissioner, in consultation with the customary fishing owners.  I wanted to emphasise that there will 
<br/>be consultations and consent before the permit is granted.  This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, further reinforces the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1983 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>current practice and actually strengthens and reinforces the rights of customary fishing owners, because 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government has and always will protect our land and our sea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government continues to implement measures with respect to the 
<br/>ease of doing business to remove red tape and give relief and support to businesses.  As such I support 
<br/>the Bill No. 38 to amend the Fisheries Act and this will augur well with the reforms undertaken with 
<br/>respect to the Investment Regulatory Framework as per the new Investment Act 2021.  As at 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 
<br/>2022 a foreign investor in the fisheries sector needs to bring a minimum investment of $1.5 million.  This 
<br/>reflects the amendments to legal framework with respect to reforms and it is actually not done in isolation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to add on to what was said earlier, Sir, with respect to the protection of our seas, et cetera, we 
<br/>have just come back from Geneva at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations and one of the 
<br/>major topics as part of the discussion was the protection of the sea and how subsidies are actually given 
<br/>to larger fishing nations, et cetera.  There was a lot of discussions around that area in terms of rules and 
<br/>regulations that do happen and after 21 years we had an agreement on it, so I suggest to those that are 
<br/>interested to have a look and see the documents that are in place with respect to our protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to Bill No. 34 I also rise to support this Bill to amend the Superyacht 
<br/></span><span>Charters.  One of our greatest priorities in the Fijian Tourism Industry is actually growing its value. Value, 
<br/></span><span>not only in revenue we receive but the jobs that we actually create and supporting industries that benefit 
<br/>and the communities that we are actually reach.  We saw this for almost two years when our borders were 
<br/>closed to air travel and we introduced the Blue Lanes Initiative.  Last year alone we received about 150 
<br/>superyachts bringing in hundreds of people  and it  was because  of these  key niches  such  as  yachting 
<br/>tourism that kept a lot of businesses open. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  for  Fiji the  yachting  market is  actually  growing to be  a  lucrative source of 
<br/>income. It also fuels our competitiveness as a tourist destination and although yachting arrival numbers 
<br/>are modest in comparison to air or to cruise, their actual spend is often greater.  So, of the 4,473 yachties 
<br/>that arrived in 2018 we recorded approximately $34.9 million which was spent on fuel, maintenance, 
<br/>dockage, food provisioning, restaurants and other tourism activities, with economic benefits that were 
<br/>actually spread to a lot of the remote communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  increased  the  duty  concession  period  for  vessels  used  solely  for 
<br/>pleasure cruising from 24 months to 60 months, so the yachts coming in could actually stay longer and 
<br/>legally in Fijian waters or have the yachts berthed on our shores for up to two years.  So, when they stay 
<br/>longer they actually spend more money in our economy, even if it is just on storage Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Denarau  alone  (from  what  I  understand)  is  expecting  up  to  40  superyacht  this  year  with 
<br/>interest still coming in.  That is fantastic news for us, Sir.  The Superyacht Charter (Amendment) 
<br/>Bill, Sir, seeks to reduce the charter fee from US$55,000 to US$30,000 while reducing the minimum 
<br/>length  requirement  from  24  metres  to  18  metres.    This  will  definitely  boost  our  already  growing 
<br/>marine  tourism.    All  things  considered,  I  fully  support  the  amendments  to  the  actual  Superyacht 
<br/>Charter (Amendment) Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, quickly if I may just add on to what was discussed earlier on by honourable 
<br/>Viliame Gavoka in terms of taxes.  Fiji is now being looked upon as a fantastic area to come and 
<br/>invest.  One of the reasons why we put these taxes in place is so that we can invite investment.  He 
<br/>does not understand Sir, if we had gone offshore and seen the interest in Fiji.  Just one particular 
<br/>sector alone is the outsourcing sector with a massive interest in Fiji.  Right around the world, it creates 
<br/>jobs  and  we  are  looking  at  about  5,000  jobs  this  year.  The  whole  world  is  now  looking  at  risk 
<br/>diversification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You are selling your soul! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- No one is selling anything, the only people that sold anything was you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>guys previously.  We are not selling our souls, absolutely not selling our souls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole world is now looking at Fiji as a risk diversification place.  They got burnt in the 
<br/>Philippines, they got burnt in India, so now they are saying,where is the next place where we can 
<br/>actually do this?  Even for example if we look at Australia, there are investors willing to come into 
<br/>Fiji, invest in Fiji, bring people here if they also need to, but at the same time, employ our own.  All 
<br/>of these areas mean that we have to look at our taxation et cetera, and that is just one part of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have created such a phenomenal investment climate in Fiji, that Fiji is looked at as a great 
<br/>place to come and invest.  Go check the numbers honourable Gavoka.  It is not about just revenue 
<br/>collection the way you are talking about it, it is talking about the volume of people that will come 
<br/>and invest in Fiji.  The way that you are saying, they will turn around and go back and run away and 
<br/>take whatever they have with them.  They will not come back, our taxes are competitive.  We are 
<br/>looked on as a favourable destination, we are looked on by Australian companies as a near-shore 
<br/>place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Show me the money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- He said, show me the money.  Let me just give you a classic example.  
<br/>Sir, we went right through COVID-19, and every civil servant in this country was paid in full.  You 
<br/>tell me that is the bad Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of the word “bullshit” by honourable 
<br/>Semi  Koroilavesau,  Minister  of  Fisheries  against  honourable  Lenora  Qereqeretabua,  is  not  only 
<br/>disgusting but shocking.  In fact, he should be referred to the Privileges Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin to highlight my concerns on some of the Consequential Bills, 
<br/>I would use a few minutes of my time to correct the blatant lie that I believe was deliberately uttered 
<br/>by  honourable  Sachida  Nand  yesterday  during  debate  on  Government  Guarantee  to  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation (FSC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  yourself  were  involved  in  negotiation  in  your  role  as  High 
<br/>Commissioner to London after 1987, 1988, 1989 with Tate &amp; Lyle and you know the state of the 
<br/>Sugar Industry.  For posterity’s sake Sir, we need to correct those lies because in future, people will 
<br/></span><span>be looking at our </span><span>Hansard</span><span>, looking at the data that we put out, so I want to use few minutes to correct 
<br/></span><span>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Tuesday, you also remarked that I had a </span><span>saqamoli </span><span>sized brain.  I do not mind being called 
<br/>names as in politics, we get used to it.  But our role as honourable Members, Sir, is not to come and 
<br/>lie here despite the truth staring in our face.  Honourable Nand said we should tell the truth about the 
<br/>decline of the sugar industry and that it started after 1987 and continued.  We all know why he lied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the statistics speak for themselves. In 1987, despite a prolonged harvest boycott, 
<br/>2.960 million tonnes of cane were harvested that produced 401,000 tonnes of sugar at a remarkable 
<br/>TCTS of 7.4 tonnes of cane required to make one tonne of sugar.  A year later in 1988 - 22,127 cane 
<br/>growers produced 3.185 million tonnes of cane from which 363,000 tonnes of sugar was produced 
<br/>at a TCTS of 8.8, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, yesterday he was given the opportunity to speak on this topic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we are on something else, Sir.  He is beating around the bush.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- There is nothing about sugar that we are debating today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, he is just dealing with his point and he will be coming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>around to the Bills.  You have the floor, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Sir, it is very important to correct the lies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1989, crop production was 4.099 million tonnes and 401,000 tonnes of sugar was made at 
<br/>a TCTS of 8.9.  In 1990, Sir, it was 4.016 million tonnes of cane and 408,000 tonnes of sugar at a 
<br/>TCTS of 9.8, despite another harvest boycott with growers demanding the sharing formula of sugar 
<br/>proceeds in the Denning Award to be retained in the Master Award.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1991, Sir, cane production was 3.380 million tonnes from which the four Mills produced 
<br/></span><span>389,000 tonnes of sugar at a TCTS of 8.7, despite another harvest boycott demanding the scrapping 
<br/></span><span>of the proposed Labour Reforms. In 1992, Sir, it was 3.533 million tonnes, 426,000 tonnes of sugar 
<br/>at a TCTS of 8.3.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in 1993, cane production was 3.704 million tonnes of sugar from which the four 
<br/>Mills made 442,000 tonnes of sugar at a TCTS of 8.4. This is despite the devastating effects of </span><span>TC 
<br/>Kina</span><span>  that  wreaked  havoc,  destroying  the  Ba  and  Sigatoka  Bridges  and  causing  widespread 
<br/>destruction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 1994, Sir, 23,254 growers produced 4.064 million tonnes of cane at a TCTS of 7.9.  The 
<br/>four mills produced 517,000 tonnes of sugar. This is a record and a feat not surpassed for the last 28 
<br/>years, and it all happened after 1988 and 1989. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, 1998 saw a prolonged drought, the worst in 
<br/></span><span>our history.  Despite this, 2.098 million tonnes of cane was harvested, producing 256,000 tonnes of 
<br/></span><span>sugar at a TCTS of 8.2.  So those are the facts, Sir, and that is why it is important to correct the lies 
<br/>that was told by the honourable Member when he spoke yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also urge the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy not to twist facts. The 
<br/>European Union grant, Sir, as you know very well of $350 million was not only for the Alternative 
<br/>Livelihood Programme, it was for other facets of the industry.  It was for the mills, particularly further 
<br/>growth of the industry with targeted assistance to growers to increase their yield by planting new 
<br/>crops and full consideration given to research, field expertise, et cetera.  Sir, I was involved in the 
<br/>project documentation, so I know there were three aspects of it. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I sincerely hope 
<br/>that the truth is not distorted by honourable Government Ministers in the way that it has been. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Returning to the Bills, Sir, there are 11 Bills that we are discussing in this motion.  Obviously, 
<br/>some are Consequential Bills, some are straightforward and some honourable Members have already 
<br/>spoken on the others.  I will confine myself to one or two and the one that I want to point out, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is the Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill.  Again, this Bill we have discussed in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>1986 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>previous Parliament is a good example of a Bill that has come about through lobbying and currying 
<br/>flavour with the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually entrenches and legitimises erosion of tax funds. It has an 
<br/>extension of the amendments to tax legislation in August 2021 which we had opposed.  That was 
<br/>applying the law retrospectively; no Government would do that, no Government would want to lose 
<br/>revenue especially when trying to reset its economic compass while trying to recover from the effects 
<br/>of the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that time, Sir, it was waving Capital Gains Tax (CGT) for sale of shares acquired before 
<br/>1st April, 2011.  For all intents and purposes, it was yet another piece of legislation that is born out 
<br/>of a cabal, the financiers and beneficiaries of the FijiFirst Party.  As usual, the FijiFirst Government’s 
<br/>(I call them the silent 25) do not want to accept this without fluttering an eye, even without remotely 
<br/>understanding the ramifications of the Bill.  The question that arose in August 2021, Sir, as you would 
<br/>recall… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  was,  why  go  back  10  years  before  the  CGT  was 
<br/>promulgated  into  law  through  a  Decree?  Why  was  Government  prepared  to  lose  income  when 
<br/>ordinary tax payers were struggling to put food on the table?  That is the question we asked when we 
<br/>debated that Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this latest amendment actually extends that exemption.  All those who 
<br/>own shares before May  2011 are exempted from paying CGT if they sell it.   It  is  a fundamental 
<br/>question that the Government is failing to answer.  How many established businesses or privately-
<br/>owned corporations, locally owned, of course, have been operating before May 2011 quite profitably 
<br/>each year, where sale of shares will attract CGT?  No prizes for guessing their names but we know 
<br/>that most of their names appear on the donor list of the FijiFirst Party since 2014.  It is true and it is 
<br/>a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how many taxpayers as individuals have stake in profitable companies who 
<br/>will benefit from this exemption?  Not a lot, and we know that given the gap between the rich, middle 
<br/>income  earners  and  those  below  the  income  tax  threshold  of  $30,000  per  annum.  So  ordinary 
<br/></span><span>taxpayers who are citizens will not benefit from this change. So, why bring such legislation?  And 
<br/></span><span>Government wants us to vote for this law and hope that no one notices because someone last year 
<br/>had asked for this law change.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want to know who are these people?  Perhaps 
<br/>then they will better understand what law the honourable Minister for Economy brought to the floor 
<br/>of Parliament, we want to know why Government suddenly chooses this time to give away money to 
<br/>rich people by exempting them from CGT.  Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  has  suddenly  decided  that  if  people  who  owned  shares 
<br/>before  2011  should  not  pay  CGT  when  they  sell  them.    Why  has  he  decided  now?    Does  the 
<br/>Government suddenly think that CGT is unfair?  If so, Mr. Speaker, what about other capital assets? 
<br/>What about people who have invested in homes or flats that they rent to others?  If these are sold, 
<br/>they  must  pay  CGT,  so  why  are  they  not  being  exempted?  Why  is  it  only  shares  that  are  being 
<br/>exempted?  We all want to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is who benefits from these special clause. I am 
<br/>asking the honourable Minister for Economy this question, who are the people who are lobbying for 
<br/>this change? Why is he doing it? I do not see any economic logic, I do not see any tax logic.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1987 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, we know there are always people who lobby for law changes from 
<br/>time to time, that is fine, that is normal.  But when they lobby for their own selfish gains, selfish 
<br/>reasons, to save tax money for themselves, why is the Government agreeing to this?  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, this is where we are now.  We have a Government which cannot look after people’s health, we 
<br/>have rising poverty, we have rising unemployment, but when very special people ask Government 
<br/>for  very  special  laws,  this  Parliament  is  used  to  give  them  those  very  special  tax  benefits.    This 
<br/>Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill really should be withdrawn and it should not have come to 
<br/>this Parliament again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> One  the  Tertiary  Scholarships  and  Loans  Bill,  which,  in  my  view,  is  another  contentious 
<br/>piece  of  legislation  is  being  renamed  as  a  service  and  members  of  the  service  who  are  the  CEO, 
<br/>employees are exempted from civil or criminal litigation.  Why?  I do not understand this.  Why 
<br/>provide them with immunity for enforcing actions allowable under the TELS legislation?  Will their 
<br/>actions be draconian?  Will it hurt students, their parents and guardians?  Will they closely work with 
<br/>FRCS to ensure those who owe TELS loans are not allowed to travel abroad without permission of 
<br/>both TELS and FRCS?  Because of this immunity from civil or criminal litigation, it does not make 
<br/>sense when incentives have already been offered to their students to clear off their debt, and many 
<br/>will when they have meaningful and gainful employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not need laws of this nature.  On one hand, the Government is providing exemptions, 
<br/>on the other hand it is snatching away the 10 percent Corporate Tax paid by firms listed on the South 
<br/>Pacific  Stock  Exchange.    For  example,  the  Fijian  Holdings  Limited  where  shareholders  are 
<br/>indigenous Fijians, many of them hold ordinary shares and are ordinary citizens, will see their rates 
<br/>of return to investment going down.  This is a very good example of laws not thought out properly, 
<br/>not consulted with people who understand this, perhaps better than those who actually work on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final  one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  on the tax administration.  The question  I have for the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy is, he is talking about refunds going to the Consolidated Fund, but 
<br/>my  understanding  is,  if  a  taxpayer,  after  doing  the  tax  return  files  his  or  her  tax  return,  and  the 
<br/>assessment by FRCS shows that he or she or the company has a refund, then one would expect that 
<br/>refund to go to those who deserve their refunds.  I cannot understand what sort of refund is sitting 
<br/>with FRCS for which we are making now laws that it should go to the Consolidated Fund.  If FRCS 
<br/>is not refunding people, then that is a problem.  I do not see a problem of refunds sitting with the 
<br/>organisation.  So it does not make sense unless FRCS deliberately does not refund taxpayers when 
<br/>the assessment is that there is a refund.  I know that there are many people who have complained to 
<br/>us about refunds not being made on time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Name them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Oh, come on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  I know people who have showed the documentation and these 
<br/>are ordinary people.  Sometimes ordinary people who expect refunds, the amount is just sitting there.  
<br/>So I do not understand what the intention of the Bill is when it is clear that the refund should go to 
<br/>those who deserve the refund after the assessment by FRCS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to talk to the various 
<br/>Bills.  I think one of the things that I keep noticing is that, every time honourable Members of the 
<br/>National Federation Party stand up, they think of interpreting everything as a conspiracy against the 
<br/>people of this country, where there is nothing untoward.  They will look under the mat, they will look 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under  whatever  it  is  on  the  floor  to  find  some  sort  of  conspiracy  and  this  is  something  that  is 
<br/>happening all the time over and over again, every little thing.  But as soon the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy and Attorney-General does his reply, he completely sheds light on the things that they 
<br/>are seeing in darkness.  So wait for your reply, you will get it at the end of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  things  that  I  wanted  to  talk  about,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today  are  some  of  the 
<br/>comments that were made by the honourable Gavoka.  He has questioned the taxation policies of 
<br/>Government.  He is, sort of, interpreting everything that the Government has done in terms of the 
<br/>taxation policies that we have put in place as being detrimental to the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But you will recall, a few years ago when we had high taxation rates in this country, one of 
<br/>the problems that we had in Fiji was that there was so much of our economy that was in the black 
<br/>economy, because our taxation rates were high, people were hiding their revenue.  I remember as a 
<br/>former Minister for Employment, we used to walk into shops and these companies would have two 
<br/>sets of books for the wages.  One that they show others and the others that they keep for themselves 
<br/>and this was happening across the board.  So one of the things that Government did was reduce the 
<br/>taxation rates where people said, “Alright the taxation rates are so low, why do we not just show our 
<br/>true books?”  That was what has happened.  We have shed light to all these black economy that has 
<br/></span><span>sort of dissipated over the years and if you look at a lot of the countries around the world that are 
<br/></span><span>really growing, Singapore, Mauritius you will find that the company taxation rates are low. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not just the company taxation rates and profits but also taxation rates in other areas.  The 
<br/>honourable  Member  has  talked  about  a  special  resource  tax  focused  on  some  companies.    If  you 
<br/>increase the taxation rates for all of the companies that come in this country, what happens to them?  
<br/>Will they come here?  How do we get employment for our children?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last night Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was talking to one of the Executives of Lyndhurst Group.  I 
<br/>think they have a Business Process Outsourcing </span><span>(</span><span>BPO</span><span>),</span><span> they now have 300 seats in their outsourcing.  
<br/>Their target is to raise it to 15,000 seats and you know the kind of people that are getting into these 
<br/>jobs, these are young graduates who are not being able to get good jobs.  These are the ones who are 
<br/>getting these jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you are looking at the taxation rate of a country, you do not just look at the amount of 
<br/>money that you collect from the direct taxation.  If you attract a lot of more investment, people come 
<br/>in, more people get jobs.  We do the taxation rates for regional headquarters coming to Fiji.  True, 
<br/>the honourable Member said only or maybe two companies are coming in, but what happens when 
<br/></span><span>you reduce the taxation rates for the headquarters, the actual reduction in the amount of tax that is 
<br/></span><span>collected is miniscule, compared to the benefits that you get when these companies come here and 
<br/>they have so many expatriates, leasing buildings, leasing homes, the spending, the indirect benefits 
<br/>of what you get from that simple policy is much more than the reduction you get in the direct tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You see this is the holistic way of looking at our country’s economy, we are not focusing just 
<br/>on the direct taxation, we have to look at the overall impact of everything that is happening. When 
<br/>you look at the economies... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You see, honourable Professor Prasad knows this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me explain something, if you have a shop and you are selling glasses, you can either put 
<br/>a 50 percent or 100 percent return on this glass, the number of glasses that you will sell is far less 
<br/>than the company that sells these glasses and puts a 5 percent return on it.  You compromise volume 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1989 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with your percentage return on each item.  So if you are able to increase volume, there is more benefit 
<br/>- Simple, 101 Economics!  By reducing the taxation rates you incur more investments, more jobs and 
<br/>it grows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Change the revenue … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The revenue increases.  How do you think we have been able to invest 
<br/>millions  of  dollars  into  the  roads  and  electricity  in  this  country?    How  do  you  think  it  has  been 
<br/>possible for us to pay social pension of $100 per month?  It is through these taxation policies there 
<br/>has been continuous growth, continuous increase in the amount of revenue that Government has been 
<br/>able to generate and that, honourable Members, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the increase in revenue is given 
<br/>out to all those who need it, not just for a select few.  So this Government is looking at everything 
<br/>done holistically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not myopic, we do not look at small little things.  We look at the whole impact of our 
<br/>policies.  It is having an impact.  Nine years of continuous growth is not an easy thing to achieve.  
<br/>That is coming from the kind of policies that we have.   And I think again, the issue that honourable 
<br/>Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport talked about.  They are reducing the charge 
<br/></span><span>on the superyachts, the amount of fees $50,000 to $30,000 - think about that.  Before every superyacht 
<br/></span><span>came, we charged them $50,000, now $50,000, maybe you get 100 yachts but maybe if you reduce 
<br/>it down to $35,000, we might get 200 yachts.  Can we see the logic?  One plus one equals two – basic 
<br/>economics.  Think big, think about the impact of everything that we do. I studied economics but I 
<br/>did not implement it but I just want to say - think about what you are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing that I want to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issues that we have in Bill No. 13 where 
<br/>we  are  talking  about  encouraging  the  use  of  importation  of  electric  vehicles  in  this  country  is 
<br/>something I fully support.  This is a big challenge for us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the fuel 
<br/>that we charge, the more that we are able to import electric vehicles in this country is going to impact 
<br/>our ability to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in this country  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one that I really welcome is Bill No. 31. One of the things in Bill No. 31 talks about 
<br/>licensing people that bring in goods into our country.  I am sure everybody in this House has heard 
<br/>the bad stories of people paying money to  freight  forwarders and something nasty happens.  The 
<br/>goods do not arrive, we know all about it, we all have relatives so I am very glad that this is in because 
<br/>it is going to help those people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of all the bills that have been 
<br/></span><span>tabled in Parliament today, this morning.  But I am going to speak, make a brief intervention on two 
<br/>of  the  bills  that  are  directly  relevant  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Ministry  of  Environment 
<br/>respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one is Bill 30, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which allows for the removal of 15 percent VAT 
<br/>on the importation of electric vehicle.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few months back, I had the privilege of 
<br/>launching the electric vehicles that are being imported into the country by Palas Automart.  Sir, from 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Environment’s  perspective  this  is  a  major  breakthrough  in  terms  of  getting  more 
<br/>vehicles serviced through electricity onto our roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we note that road transport accounts for 30 percent of air pollution in towns 
<br/>and cities in particular.  With the movement of more people from low income into middle income 
<br/>and high income bracket, basically we are now seeing more private vehicles on the road and therefore 
<br/>resulting  in  more  emissions  of  hydrocarbons,  carbon  monoxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  sulphur  dioxide, 
<br/>which are harmful to humans in numerous ways.  It is a major breakthrough if we are able to entice 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people, motivate people through tax policies to own or substitute electric vehicles in place of other 
<br/>vehicles which are using particularly fossil fuels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on an economic point of view, we will, at the moment we are spending close 
<br/>to $1.5 billion – 19 percent of our total import bill on the importation of fossil fuels.  Of course, not 
<br/>all of this $1.5 billion fuel goes to motor vehicles but also goes to industrial activity. Sir, a  large 
<br/>portion of it is actually utilised by vehicles on the road.  Now, we will not be able to get electric 
<br/>vehicles ownership overnight but progressively if you are able to entice, create awareness, motivate 
<br/>people and also hit their pocket in terms of not using the other vehicles which is consuming imported 
<br/>fuel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the Ministry of Environment’s point of view we are very happy to see 
<br/>this amendment to the VAT Act 1991 where we are basically seeing the removal of the 15 percent 
<br/>VAT on importation of electric vehicles which are more affordable and people can buy.  Also during 
<br/>the launch, it was noted that through the single charge, you can drive the vehicle up to 263 kilometres 
<br/>basically meaning that you can dual charge the vehicle and you can take it to Nadi with the single 
<br/>charge and then you can charge it in the normal port (240 volts) switch and you can charge the vehicle 
<br/>then drive it back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry of Environment, we wholeheartedly support and applaud 
<br/>this move to promote affordability of electric vehicles so that people can switch or buy these vehicle 
<br/>for ownership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Bill No. 37, I thank the honourable Minister for Economy for bringing 
<br/>in these amendments as you know Veterinarians are a rare group of experts all around Fiji.  Some 
<br/>time  back,  New  Zealand  had  only  two  universities  offering  veterinary  qualification  -  Massey 
<br/>University and Lincoln University.  I think there are a few other universities now offering veterinary 
<br/>qualifications.  It is very expensive to offer that particular programme and also it requires specialised 
<br/>veterinary  hospital  because  we  really  want  to  graduate  quality  students  graduated  from  this 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, this was not the case when the programmes started at FNU and students were 
<br/>enrolled and the university had to get them through and they tried their best to get the students out 
<br/>and get the actual practical exposure through the limited number of private veterinary outlets.  Sir, 
<br/>close to 45 students have come out of this programme but there is a problem in terms of registering 
<br/>them as veterinarians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all the problem is that, there are certain missing elements of these graduates which 
<br/>the current Veterinary Council was refusing to admit them. What the Ministry, in collaboration with 
<br/>the  Fiji  National  University,  have  now  established  is  a  special  six  months  intensive  programme 
<br/>jointly with the University of Sydney which the fresh lot of graduates are now going through. Once 
<br/>they finish, they will then sit for a qualifying exam. Once they pass the qualifying exam, then the 
<br/>Permanent  Secretary  for  Agriculture  with  the  amendment  now  given  to  the  existing  Veterinary 
<br/>Surgeons Act, states the registrar (there is nothing called registrar now in the Ministry of Agriculture)  
<br/>so it is the Permanent Secretary for Agriculture with this amendment who will have the power to 
<br/>admit them after administering that particular qualifying exam. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is really a 
<br/>welcome move in terms of amending the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1956.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Act  which  came  into  being  in  1956  did  not  allow  any  other 
<br/>university graduates to be admitted in Fiji so the Act is amended to allow FNU graduates and also 
<br/>allow the honourable Minister to make regulations and amend schedules so that we can allow other 
<br/>graduates  from  other  countries,  jurisdictions  and  other  universities,  as  long  as  they  pass  their 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1991 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>qualifying  exams  set  and  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  collaboration  with  other 
<br/>bodies to set up the exam and mark that particular exam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the honourable Minister for Economy announced in his Budget Speech 
<br/>in the meantime we want to take and utilise these graduates who are out there to open up para-vet 
<br/>outlets and assist in in providing service of basic administration of anaesthesia, basic castration, basic 
<br/>stitches to the owners of the animals throughout Fiji giving them the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  behalf  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  we  are  very  happy  to  see  this 
<br/>amendment to the Act so that we have established part of that outlet throughout Fiji and secondly, and 
<br/>that it gives a pathway for these graduates to be admitted as a full veterinarian and they can join private 
<br/>outlets or Ministry of Agriculture or establish their own veterinary outlet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my response in regards to Bill No. 28 the Tax 
<br/>Administration Act.   I note that I understand when monies are uncollected over a period of time and we 
<br/>have  seen  it  with  BSP  and  FNPF,  perhaps  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  also  FRCS  could 
<br/>consider advertising it and give layers of protection to the taxpayers because I know that the taxpayers 
<br/>has lodged and their families are not aware that there is a refund owing.  Give them a lesser protection 
<br/></span><span>where they can still write in and also the five years is inconsistent with section 34 (2) (b).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Attorney-General is aware, for seven years, taxpayers were not allowed to 
<br/>destroy tax or your financial documents.  These are the accounts and records, you are supposed to keep 
<br/>that. So the inconsistency in unclaimed after five years you do not claim money, then it goes into the 
<br/>consolidated funds, then you have seven years where we cannot destroy records.  Perhaps, they can look 
<br/>at making the time limit similar, seven years and seven years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was section 112 of the amendment, I note that they have removed 
<br/>the Auditor-General from its traditional role as an independent authority, now it has gone back to (there 
<br/>is a new amendment) the Chairperson.  I believe the Chairperson will be appointed by the FRCS or by 
<br/>the Minister concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  one,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  section  115,  Power  of  Tax  Agents  Board  to  compound 
<br/>offences.  Section 59 of the Act actually empowers the CEO of FRCS to compound the offence.  With 
<br/>this amendment, we are saying the Tax Board have also been given the right to amend, so you have the 
<br/>Tax Board and you have FRCS, CEO.  It can become complicated, it can become an internal issue when 
<br/>two of them within that institution both have these powers.  I request if the honourable Minister can look 
<br/></span><span>into that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Income Tax, we have all heard about basically any capital gains, capital gains as we will 
<br/>know it is tax on profits.  Any capital gains, this is the amendment they brought in of any shares that you 
<br/>sell first before 1</span><span>st</span><span> May, 2011, shares that were  vote before those dates are exempted from CGT which 
<br/>is tax on your profits.  I have heard what the honourable Opposition Members have said.  Why is it limited 
<br/>only  to  shares?    I  retract  that,  it  is  10  percent  -  my  apologies.    Thank  you  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture, Waterways and Environment. Why is it only shares?  Why is it not on all other properties?  
<br/>Why are we discriminating other taxpayers as well who also want to sell their properties apart from shares, 
<br/>but then again a good law is one where it is for everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at this and the timing that it is brought in, I am just wondering and we are all wondering 
<br/>and we have heard it from this side of Parliament who benefits from this?  But do not worry about it, 
<br/>when we get in, we will know and just to add, I cannot understand the rationale why we are giving out 
<br/>tax relief on this provision when we have a $9.1 million debt.  I do not understand.  This is a tax relief.  If 
<br/>anything, we need money, the nation needs money, but then we are giving tax relief.  I mean, I heard the

<div><span>honourable</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Health making comments, your</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Health needs money.  We need that, 
<br/>but you are giving tax relief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Superyacht Charter (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022, Mr. Speaker, the principal Act was 
<br/>introduced in 2010.  We appreciate the superyachts coming in, it is a good incentive.  I have noted that 
<br/>charter fees has now reduced from $55,000 to $30,000.  I heard the honourable Minister for Commerce, 
<br/>Trade and Tourism mentioned about the amount - $34.8 million in 2018 and that is good, but I would 
<br/>like to hear 2019 and 2020 when COVID-19 came in.  However, the fact that it is reduced, is that an 
<br/>indication that this scheme is not working?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will try to be brief.  Let me just address 
<br/>some of the issues raised this morning while we are discussing the Bills, before I go into the specific 11 
<br/>Bills before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We keep hearing from the other side this phrase, ‘when we get in’.  I want to ask my colleagues 
<br/>on the other side, who will get in; is it SODELPA and Unity Fiji, is it NFP and PAP?  Mr. Speaker, they 
<br/>already know the results of the elections and that is why they are forming these marriages because NFP 
<br/>cannot do it on their own and SODELPA knows that they cannot do it on their own.  So, who will get in, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir?  We have not gone into elections but they already know the results.  Bring it on, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me go back to the sugar industry.  Honourable Professor Prasad, unfortunately, keeps talking 
<br/>about the good old days of the sugar industry.  Look at all the statistics that he has been giving us.  Well, 
<br/>let me add to your facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  why  I  have  said,  I  was  so 
<br/>disappointed with his contribution during the Budget debate and not only that, he is here in this Parliament 
<br/>as a politician.  But outside Parliament, Sir, he is an academic, he is a so-called intellectual, who should 
<br/>have the critical and analytical thinking skills that, unfortunately, some honourable Members on the other 
<br/>side lack. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the good old days of the sugar industry.  All the figures that he quoted started 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the 1980s, only as far as 2006 – deliberately and deliberately! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Now, I got you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think my  honourable friend is actually misleading Parliament.  
<br/>All I said, Mr. Speaker, I was correcting the statistics for the period that was referred to by the honourable 
<br/>Member.  That was all I said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Don’t embarrass yourself any further.

<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is fun. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I keep referring to the good old days because when you look at the TCTS, when you look at the 
<br/>harvest, all were  good  because the leases  were intact,  and  this  is what he  was not mentioning in his 
<br/>contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is why, unfortunately,  the honourable Kuridrani (who is not here),  I 
<br/>always refer to the petition politics of old override the common good and, unfortunately, it is the poor 
<br/>farmers who suffered.  We all know the divisions in the sugar industry -  Fiji Cane Growers Association, 
<br/>the National Farmers Union and we have the Unions too, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They were good old days.

<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Good old days, in fact you are right.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I have said this and I will say it again, as we were approaching 1997, the bulk of the sugar leases were to 
<br/>expire from 1997 onwards. Look at the number of farmers after 1997 and again, I have also said this in 
<br/></span><span>this august House, five years from the expiry of leases - farmers were not investing in the farm because 
<br/></span><span>they do not know their future.  They had the money in their pocket or they divested it elsewhere because 
<br/>the future of the Sugar Industry was not certain at that time.  I have said it, they were focusing on the 
<br/>1997 Constitution but they forgot the farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the leases expired after 1996. This is the proof when the Labour 
<br/>Government  came  in  after  the  Elections  of  1999,  they  had  the  Sugar  and  Land  Resettlement  Unit 
<br/>established in the Ministry. Why a resettlement unit? Because of the petition politics.  Go to Vakabalea 
<br/>and Raiwaqa in Navua, go to Jittu, these were the farmers that were not given lease renewals and they 
<br/>have to leave the farms, unfortunately. Go to Delaivuna in Taveuni, there were three estates: one was in 
<br/>Nadroga (I forgot the name) and two in Vanua Levu, including Valelawa.  Under the Labour Government, 
<br/>they facilitated the farmers who have left the farm and that is where the alternative livelihoods came in 
<br/>as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I know the history of the Sugar Industry because that led 
<br/></span><span>this decisive leader who cared about every  Fijian to relook at the conditions of the lease so that it becomes 
<br/>a win-win situation for everyone. Unfortunately, we missed it, the honourable Aseri Radrodro was asking 
<br/>about the CBUL allocation in the Ministry of Agriculture of $6.9 million this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To-date, Government through this leader has paid more than $80 million to </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> just to top up 
<br/>the lease, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from where it was previously, and another $6.9 million this year.  So, it will 
<br/>be interesting when someone wants to talk about the Sugar Industry again.  The land issue was the main 
<br/>contributing factor, apart from the condition of the Mills and so many other things. But that has to be 
<br/>factored into the current state of the Sugar Industry.  It affected Vanua Levu significantly and that is why, 
<br/>again, through this leadership, the Northern Development Programme it was in the SDL Government but 
<br/>it was just all on paper, the Look North Policy until the honourable Prime Minister came in, in 2008 and 
<br/>started injecting millions into the Northern Division to revive the economy because of the exodus by the 
<br/>cane farmers when the land leases were not. So when we are talking about the Sugar Industry, let us factor 
<br/>into the discussions the issue about non-renewal of leases.  Unfortunately, we are still recovering from 
<br/>this, but there has been some positive turnaround and we are optimistic, the Government is still optimistic.

<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are talking about TCTS, because I also receive the results or the progress from the two 
<br/>Divisional Commissioners.  As we speak today, they are both in Lautoka - the Commissioner West and 
<br/>Commissioner Northern.  One positive aspect out of this year’s harvest that is going on is the amount of, 
<br/>what we call, Pure Obtainable Cane Sugar (POCS) from an average of 9.9 percent in the few years, now 
<br/>it has gone up to almost 11 percent.  That is a direct result of the amount of investment that Government 
<br/>is doing into the industry: farm mechanisation, land clearance, particularly on agro inputs so the quality 
<br/>of sugar has also improved.  That is a positive.  These are the things that need to be brought into this 
<br/>Parliament so that we all have a good understanding of the industry rather than just picking on what suits 
<br/>you best.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not a tax expert but even without doing Economics, some of these issues 
<br/>are just common sense.  It is good that we all have advisors, and I know that the honourable Gavoka 
<br/>probably would have been advised by a former tax employee. But then, we as national leaders, should 
<br/>have a conceptual level of understanding.  We should learn to think critically and analytically and we 
<br/>should look at cost versus benefit.  “Okay, we are losing this revenue, but what are the benefits out of the 
<br/>policies  as  a  result  of  this,  it  is  not  only  about  losing  revenue.”  The  honourable  Professor  Prasad  is 
<br/>listening and laughing because that is common sense, that is the conceptual level of understanding and 
<br/>that is critical thinking and asking beyond the obvious.  Tell them they are losing revenue, but what does 
<br/></span><span>it mean?  Who is benefiting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have talked about the black economy and I was the Commissioner Northern and this is still 
<br/>an ongoing issue.  We have businesses operating out of residential areas and a lot of rezoning has taken 
<br/>place over the years.  The Government’s responsibility is to create the environment, there should be long 
<br/>term benefits and let us not be short sighted, let us be strategic in our thinking, and that is why some of 
<br/>these taxations were taken away because we are looking at the benefits already.  We know, the benefits 
<br/>in the future may be not coming immediately, but let us create the environment, let us bring back the 
<br/>confidence and the trust so that the people can come.  This is not only about loss of revenue, it is because 
<br/>of the supporters, this conspiracy theory and desperation that is coming from the other side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Qoliqoli Bill, I appreciate the change and I am thankful.  I used to do a 
<br/>lot of signing, thousands in a day in Vanua Levu, at the beginning of the year and again it expires in 
<br/>December.  Some come around June, only a limited time and I am thankful for this change.  I hope that 
<br/>we will all benefit from it.  There are some challenges the honourable Radrodro talked about, whether it 
<br/>will mean re-arrangements.  No, the customary law has not changed, but there are some governance issues 
<br/>that we need to look into.  Of course, the Commissioners in the Ministry of Rural Development and the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs are looking at these issues, particularly, when it comes to the money that the 
<br/></span><span>applicants  pay  that  goes  to  the  resource  owners.    This  needs  to  be  accounted  for  and  be  transparent 
<br/></span><span>because  the  </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span>  is  something  that  we  share  in  common.    As  we  say  in  the  iTaukei  language,  </span><span>i 
<br/>kanakana</span><span>, </span><span>i qoliqoli cokovata</span><span> - it is shared.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, only some benefit from it and that is why the iTaukei Affairs is keeping it now 
<br/>until the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> owners form their own trusts.  There are few </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> in Fiji, I know, </span><span>Turaga na Tui 
<br/>Cakau’s i qoliqoli</span><span>, he has got his trust. Everything goes into the trust and everyone benefits but there are 
<br/>some  </span><span>i  qoliqoli</span><span>  owners  who  have  only  one  person  benefiting.    That  is  why  we  need  to  have  this 
<br/>accountability system because there are security related issues that will come out of this.  I know for a 
<br/>fact that there was a village in Bua that wanted to be registered to another </span><span>tikina</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>despite the iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs Act, simply because of the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> issue.  These are the implications, if we are not careful Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I wish to support the amendments to the Veterinary Surgeons (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022, 
<br/>Bill  No. 37 of 2022.  We need it,  I think  I  have  stated it  so many times when  I  was in  Agriculture, 
<br/>unfortunately, there was no local Veterinarian in Fiji, we had two.  Most of our laws were premised 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1995 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>around the Australia and New Zealand’s standards, but we live in a globalized world. We have other very 
<br/>good  competent  institutions  as  well.  Some  of  our  people  probably  have  gone  through  Los  Banos 
<br/>University in the Philippines and so many others and this is why need these amendments because it is 
<br/>important for the services that we offer to the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my contribution and I fully support the Bills before the Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the areas on </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> has been 
<br/>covered by  honourable Seruiratu.  I  would just like to correct the statements that have  been made by 
<br/>honourable Radrodro and honourable Qereqeretabua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to begin, I must thank all our officers who had worked overtime in the rural 
<br/>communities over the last six years since the Ministry of Fisheries was formed as a stand-alone ministry, 
<br/>since 2017 - their work and dedication is greatly appreciated.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know our ministry 
<br/>officials do not stick to time when they go out to the outer island or in isolated communities.  They work 
<br/>during the day and then go through the night to be able to complete all the consultations that they have to 
<br/>carry out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to honourable Aseri Radrodro, the consultations were undertaken with the support of 
<br/></span><span>the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> and it extended over a period of three years. As per the issuance of licensce the mandatory 
<br/>procedure is to go through Commissioners’ Office who consults with the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> for their approval.  That 
<br/>covers the issue raised by him and that is the common practice that is being carried and this is the practice 
<br/>that was carried before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, is the three years licence tenure against MPA and surveillance exercise.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, licences are issued with conditions on what is allowed and what is not allowed even for night fishing.  
<br/>This is done with consideration of the</span><span> Vanua</span><span> which is listed in the condition.  If a particular </span><span>Vanua</span><span> does 
<br/>not want any spear fishing or fishing at night, then these conditions will be stipulated in the licence itself.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is nothing new, procedures and processes remain the same even with the fees, it is 
<br/>only licence tenure which is being proposed from one year to three years to assist with loans and business 
<br/>aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  now like to  go to honourable Qereqeretabua.   I  was quite  astounded by the  way the 
<br/>honorable Qereqeretabua stood up and just made a general comment on issues I had spent a whole half-
<br/>an-hour with honourable Radrodro, explaining to him at morning tea what is on the ground and what we 
<br/>are carrying out.  It is not an overnight exercise.  It does not only take a short period of time.  It has taken 
<br/></span><span>three years and two years have been shut down by COVID-19 and we are continuing to do consultation, 
<br/></span><span>hopefully in the last quarter we will complete the consultations.  To address the comments raised by 
<br/>honourable Qereqeretabua, first, I would like to highlight the importance of understanding the different 
<br/>legislations that protect different areas of Fiji’s fisheries waters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Bill that is being proposed is specifically for tenure in the Inshore Fisheries Act.  
<br/>Honourable Qereqeretabua has gone on and talked about the EEZ and its protection and how it is not 
<br/>reflected in this Bill.  Let me correct her, Mr. Speaker, by saying inshore coastal fisheries is legislated 
<br/>under the Fisheries Act which discusses the areas outside the internal waters including the archipelagic, 
<br/>territorial and the EEZ is covered under a different legislation which is the Offshore Fisheries Act of 2012 
<br/>and its regulations of 2014.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member spoke about how effective our surveillance activity is, how 
<br/>we are ensuring that our EEZ is closely monitored, how we are ensuring biodiversity, what are the fines 
<br/>and  prosecution  and  enabling  legislation  under  observer  protection.      Let  me  remind  the  honourable 
<br/>Member  that  our  offshore  fisheries  which  he  has  spoken  about  is  well-covered  under  the  current 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>1996 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legislation.  Let me give an example of what is covered in the Act without going into detail on what is 
<br/>covered under the offshore legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidation of Fiji’s blue economy – part four – conservation, management and development 
<br/>cover the areas of concern raised by the honourable Member.  Are we monitoring EEZ from the two-
<br/>legged sharks?  Part 5 and 6 – licences and authorisations and monitoring control and surveillance.  Are 
<br/>there appropriate fines?  Part 8 – 9 – jurisdiction and evidence and offshore fisheries have fixed penalties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  these  are  just  some  of  the  many  legislations  that  we  have.    Additionally,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, the honourable Member should understand that we have Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) 
<br/>which is administered under the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), Fiji Navy and Ministry of Fisheries.  
<br/>This allows us to monitor all activities that occur in our waters.  This, in addition to our aerial and surface 
<br/>patrols done by our Navy and ASNET providers such as Australia, New Zealand, France and the United 
<br/>States.  Mr. Speaker, most of these assets should be known to the honourable Member herself and other 
<br/>Members when it is clearly covered in the media every week.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sirr, just picking up, just some of the responses on 
<br/>what the honourable Minister for Fisheries was saying.  Fundamentally what he said is that honourable 
<br/></span><span>Qereqeretabua as usual and this time in a monumental way got the wrong law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were talking about the Act – the Fisheries Act of 1941.  She was talking about the Offshore 
<br/>Fisheries Act of 2012 and Sir, the Act is here for all Members rather than me regurgitating every single 
<br/>sentence of this particular Act, Sir.  Section 13 of the Act says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding anything contained in the Rivers and Streams Act 1880, it shall be 
<br/>an offence for any person to take fish on any reef or any </span><span>kai</span><span> (cockle) or other shellfish bed in 
<br/>any area in respect of which the rights of any </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or other division or subdivision of the 
<br/>iTaukei  people  that  have  been  registered  by  the  iTaukei  Fisheries  Commission  in  the 
<br/>Registrar of iTaukei Customary Fishing Rights unless he or she shall be a member of such 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span>, division or subdivision of iTaukei people who does not require a licence under 
<br/>section  5  to  take  such  fish  or  shall  first  have  obtained  a  permit  to  do  so  from  the 
<br/>Commissioner of the Division in which such area is situated provided that – “ 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The one of relevance says, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The grant of a permit shall be in the discretion of such Commissioner who shall 
<br/></span><span>consult the fisheries officer and the subdivision of the iTaukei people whose fishing 
<br/></span><span>rights may be affected thereby, prior to granting the same.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then it says again, I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A permit, under this may be granted for any period not exceeding 3 years (just 
<br/>in case you all go running off and trying to distort this), but every such permit shall 
<br/>expire on 31st December in any one of such years.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So that is the impracticality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  saying  that  the  Divisional  Commissioner  can  go  to  the  iTaukei 
<br/>landowners or the customary fishing rights owners and say, “look, would you like to give a permit 
<br/>for up to three years, no more than three years but up to three years?” If they say, yes, or they say, 
<br/>no to or they say 18 months, then in practice when they come and give the fishing licence, they only 
<br/>give it for one year.  All we are saying is that now we amend that to say that if the customary owners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1997 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say 18 months, the Ministry of Fisheries can give a permit up to 18 months. If they say three years, 
<br/>they can give a licence up to three years. That is all we are saying.  Honourable Qereqeretabua went 
<br/>off offshore, completely wrong, Sir.  So just to clarify that and the honourable Minister for Fisheries 
<br/>clarified that quite well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I think, honourable Professor Prasad and honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua expressed their indignation of what the honourable Minister had said, but yesterday I 
<br/>recall honourable Professor Prasad saying the word “crap” which essentially means the same thing.  
<br/>You said it, it is on record.  You can say the word, I do want to say the word.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>maybe because we are talking about VAT, maybe you should have said bovine manure, that could 
<br/>have been the same thing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of other issues, just on the superyachts, let us get the easy ones.  
<br/>The superyachts again, I do not think many people objected to that but essentially, this is a submission 
<br/>made by the superyacht industry and the people who look after the superyachts in Fiji, Sir, that there 
<br/>is a lot of competition now. Countries like Tonga and various other Pacific Island countries including 
<br/>those in South America, Australia and New Zealand are offering very lucrative taxation environment 
<br/>to lure the superyachts, because as we know that the superyacht industry, Sir, captures probably only 
<br/></span><span>about one or two percent of the world population and the rich.  They do spend a lot of money, COVID 
<br/></span><span>or no COVID.  They have a lot of wealth available at their disposal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before superyachts  meant  very large  yachts.    Now  you have super-duper  yachts.  So, now 
<br/>before superyachts manned very large yachts, now you have super-duper yachts that are less than 24 
<br/>metres. Now, it has gone down to 18 metres and this is a direct submission from them and we know 
<br/>we have already received a lot of positive response from those people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to correct honourable Aseri Radrodro, he said that the amendments to the 
<br/>law have been made but nothing else has happened is incorrect. In fact before the 50</span><span>th</span><span> celebrations 
<br/>of FIA or the anniversary they had recently, the day before that we had put in place the regulations 
<br/>which now gives what we call the “Limited Practising Certificates” to various accountants is now 
<br/>being made available.  They can charge lower rates, lot more smaller businesses can go and get their 
<br/>cash flows done, their financial statements done, P&amp;L done, et cetera. That is in conjunction, Sir, 
<br/>with Business Assistance Fiji (BAF). The Members have not mentioned this, in the Budget we have 
<br/>allocated them $600,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, if someone, a co-operative, a small person in a village who has got a small business, a 
<br/></span><span>small entrepreneur in the Suva-Nausori corridor, Nadi-Lautoka wants to apply for a loan from Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Development Bank, they can go to BAF and say, “please look I have made this much money, this is 
<br/>my bank account, I do not know how to put together all these accounts, can you please do it for me 
<br/>and then I can make a submission to FDB.”  It will done for them for free; BAF does that now. So, 
<br/>these are the kind of synergies we drawing across the different organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Tuisawau  again  got  it  wrong,  he  said  this  $200  million 
<br/>concession is only benefitting financial institutions, a lot of maybe bovine manure because essentially 
<br/>the $200 million concessional facility is available to those banks that want to actually access that 
<br/>fund from the Reserve Bank of Fiji at 0.25 percent.  They get that particular money, then they on-
<br/>lend that at no more than 3.99 percent, so they take the risk but the interest rate is lower.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we see, Sir, it is not forced upon those organisations and more so, Sir, if you see, most of 
<br/>the loans under this concessional loan (if he were to do his homework), he would see that bulk of it 
<br/>has been given by FDB, not by the commercial  banks because as we said, there are already high 
<br/>levels of liquidity in the market, so they themselves have their own cash which they want to on-lend.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>1998 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The interest rates for their loans have come down but now this concessional loan, Sir, in fact have 
<br/>also assisted people and most of them have actually gone to FDB to take advantage of it and FDB is 
<br/>the one that has given the bulk of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forfeiture, just very quickly, Sir, this happens all the time.  Honourable Waqanika said that 
<br/>maybe, they should advertise.  Of course, they will advertise, that is part and parcel of the process. 
<br/>The same with the banks, when people do not have active bank accounts, they advertise. Many other 
<br/>organisations advertise, the whole process will be of course exhausted.  Once we have been through 
<br/>that exhausted process, then they will forfeit those monies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, she said it should be aligned to the seven-year record keeping.  That has got nothing to 
<br/>do with record keeping, this is more to do with records that have already been assessed, they already 
<br/>now been said, “You are entitled to this much money, please collect this money.”  And if they do not 
<br/>come forward, obviously that is nothing to do with their records.  Those are two different matters.  
<br/>She is confusing herself and trying to confuse others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If,  for  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  say  someone  has  got  some  money  due,  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad, maybe after the next elections may want to go and meditate on top of a mountain 
<br/></span><span>and may disappear for 10 years has got some money owed to him, if he comes down from the top of 
<br/></span><span>the mountain after suffering as to what will happen in the next elections, he may come down and say 
<br/>“hey, I have already been away for 10 years, but I have got this monies due to him”, we will give that 
<br/>money.   Sir, FRCS will  give that  money to  them.   It  is  not  like he has  gone forever, if someone 
<br/>appears and disappears for five years, honourable Rasova and then pops up again, they will get that 
<br/>money.  In the meantime, of course, it can go to the Consolidated Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to make is that the honourable Gavoka, unfortunately, 
<br/>I think has latched on to a few ex-FRCS staff who obviously are no longer there because their view 
<br/>of economics and finance was in fact very limited in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century because those old tax people or 
<br/>officials had a very limited way of viewing tax and I will demonstrate that through figures.  It took 
<br/>Fiji 34 years since Independence to reach $1 billion in collection of tax revenue.  He is now grunting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Indirect taxes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tax revenue of $1 billion, it took 34 years, then it took 10 years to double it to $2 billion.  Sir, 
<br/></span><span>this is also within the supposed regime of low tax rates.  The point being, Sir, is that high tax rates 
<br/></span><span>does not necessarily mean high revenue, everyone knows that.  There is a World Bank Report 2006 
<br/>– 2007 that said that one-third of the Fijian economy was in the black which basically meant a lot of 
<br/>businesses,  because  of  high  tax  rate  kept  two  books;  one  for  FRCS  and  one  was  a  true  book  for 
<br/>themselves.  That is a fact! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a thing actually and it is interesting, it was referred to me, what they call the Laffer 
<br/>curve.  The Laffer curve’s argument is that you will reach a point where the tax rates are so high, that 
<br/>we start to collect less compared to if your tax rates were low.  There has to be a medium that you 
<br/>need to achieve, a balance you need to achieve to be able to ensure that when people pay taxes, they 
<br/>willingly pay taxes and you collect more.  Everyone knows, honourable Professor Prasad, a lot of 
<br/>people would know this. Perhaps when he was in USP he did not know this, but maybe he does know 
<br/>now that are lot of people kept double books.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone  knew  that.    Honourable  Waqanika  will  testify.    She  is  shaking  her  head  in 
<br/>agreement, she worked at FRCS before so the fact is, Sir, a lot of people kept double books because

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1999 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they did not want to pay high taxes.  In fact, Sir, after the taxes were lowered, they in fact then started 
<br/>paying the right tax.  They said, “It is no point cheating the system, might as well pay the thing and 
<br/>get it over and done with” – that is what has happened. This is why, Sir, in a short period of time we 
<br/>are able to double the tax revenue and that is a fact.  There are figures available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the pandemic had not happened, our tax revenue would have gone up to 
<br/>$3 million today.  Unfortunately, of course our collection has decreased.  Prior to the pandemic, Sir, 
<br/>tax revenue as collected was 24 percent of our GDP; 24 percent of our GDP came from tax revenue.  
<br/>A country like Sri Lanka, Sir, of course was 12 percent (they do not tell you that in their discussions), 
<br/>country like Australia is 28 percent, New Zealand is 30 percent, high levels of taxation, high tax rate 
<br/>but we are 24 percent (not that far behind), notwithstanding the fact that we have lower tax rates. 
<br/>Honourable Gavoka wants to slap on a 28 percent to all corporates, he wants to slap on a 33 percent 
<br/>to all foreign companies and then on top of that he wants to slap on a resource tax. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a the kind myopic approach to tax revenue, not thinking about the 
<br/>consequences  as  highlighted  by  honourable  Seruiratu  and  honourable  Usamate;  what  are  the 
<br/>consequences of having this high tax regime, enormous ramifications, in particular, in a country that 
<br/>has  been  dependent  on  large  scale  foreign  investment.    All  the  banks  in  Fiji  until  recently  were 
<br/></span><span>foreign-owned.  Of course, we had National Bank of Fiji which we lost but after that, all the banks 
<br/></span><span>were foreign-owned. Only now HFC is the only 100 percent Fijian-owned bank.  Every other single 
<br/>bank, Sir, is foreign-owned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka knows this, he worked at resorts that were all foreign-owned, and most 
<br/>of the island resorts in Fiji are foreign-owned.  But he also knows that in that period since the tourism 
<br/>sector started in 1960s and let us talk about lobbying then, hotels had years of tax concession, did not 
<br/>pay corporate tax, they had things like SLIP, half a SLIP, et cetera. As soon as the tax period was 
<br/>about to expire, they do some renovation then they get another eight years of corporate tax holiday. 
<br/>That was what happened.  No one is talking about that, he is not talking about that.  After 1987, Sir, 
<br/>we had the Tax Free Kalabu Zone, a garment industry was built on the back of a 13-year tax free 
<br/>holiday, and they are not talking about that.  Why are we not being intellectually honest?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  easy to  come  and pontificate about  these things  without having the 
<br/>facts.  This is the historical basis of it.  Today, as I highlighted in Parliament, we have for example 
<br/>incentives of people to invest in the BPO sector.  Honourable Professor Prasad ran it down saying, 
<br/>“oh, we were given in 2009, not much has happened.”  Of course, a lot has happened.  It was the only 
<br/>sector that grew jobs and 3,000 job during the pandemic.  Infrastructure actually grew. You have to 
<br/></span><span>come up to speed with those things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So these things actually do take time but we have companies now who want to set up their 
<br/>operations in Fiji and saying, “Look, we do not want the tax holiday because under the OECD rules, 
<br/>we cannot get tax free holidays, we have to pay the 15 percent.  So what else can you give us?” They 
<br/>will create 2,000 or 3,000 jobs, we are talking about young people.  Honourable Waqanika does not 
<br/>want them to leave Fiji, she wants them to stay in Fiji. So, we said, “okay, you pay the 15 percent tax 
<br/>but  we  will  give  you  some  other  incentive”.    In  the  same  way  that  Mind  Pearl  came  to  Fiji,  we 
<br/>subsidised the wages they paid to our young people for three years.  Today the ITC sectors has got a 
<br/>hold in Fiji. Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to put these things into perspective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that, I referred already to the 
<br/>Laffer curve.  Sir, VAT refunds used to sit around about $200 million, today VAT refunds stand at 
<br/>about $100 million, in other words the refund of FRCS has greatly become a lot more efficient. So a 
<br/>lot more money goes into the system.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that, sticking on tax for a  while that honourable Gavoka 
<br/>talked about and I think honourable Professor Prasad also may have mentioned this, about the Capital 
<br/>Gains Tax.  Honourable Waqanika also mentioned this.  Let me read this out because I do not think 
<br/>they have read to the law, this is under the CGT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  says,  “Section 67  exempt capital  gains.   The  following  capital  gains  are exempt capital 
<br/>gains.”  In other words, if you make a capital gain, for those who may not know, put simply, capital 
<br/>gain is, if I have a house of $50,000 worth today, I have not done any renovations and then when I 
<br/>sell that house, say for a $100,000, that capital gain between $50,000 and $100,000, I have to pay 10 
<br/>percent tax.  However, if it is:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(f)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made by a resident individual or Fijian citizen that does not exceed $30,000 
<br/>(I do not pay capital gains tax.  In other words, I sold my house for $65,000 I do not pay 
<br/>any CGT).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made by a resident individual or a Fijian citizen on the first disposal of either 
<br/>the individual’s first residential property or principal place of residence; (So I got my first 
<br/>home, I sell it, I make a capital gain, I do not pay any CGT.  They are saying where are the 
<br/></span><span>other capital gains, they are saying it is only on shares).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made by a person on the disposal of shares listed on the South Pacific Stock 
<br/>Exchange. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made on disposal of an asset that is used solely to derive exempt income, 
<br/>excluding the disposal of shares. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any gain made by a person on the disposal of an interest in a company within section 2(c) 
<br/>of the definition of “company”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made by a resident individual or a Fiji citizen on disposal of his or her interest 
<br/>in a family home (If you have three or four brothers or sisters who own the shares and they 
<br/>sell  their  family  home,  no  capital  gain  tax),  provided  however  that  the  disposal  of  the 
<br/>interest is by way of transfer to an existing joint tenant or tenant in common.)  In other 
<br/>words, if my brother is selling me his share of the property, he does not pay capital gains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(g)</span><span> </span><span>Any gain made by a resident person from a capital asset, including from the sale of shares 
<br/></span><span>where  a  private  or  public  company  goes  through  re-organisation,  restructure  or 
<br/></span><span>amalgamation for the purposes of listing or as part of the listing process on the South Pacific 
<br/>Stock Exchange, provided that (In other words, if you have a family company listed on the 
<br/>South Pacific Stock Exchange so if there be any gains made, you do not pay any CGT): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the private company is listed on the South Pacific Stock Exchange within 24 months 
<br/>from the date of commencement of re-organisation, re-structure or amalgamation; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)   where the private company is not listed with the South Pacific Stock Exchange in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accordance with paragraph (1);  
<br/>the gain from the re-organisation, restructure ….

<div><span>a capital gain made by the trustee or beneficiary of a deceased estate on the disposal of an 
<br/>asset forming part of the estate that, if the gain had been made by the deceased on a disposal 
<br/>of the  asset immediately  before  death,  the  gain  would be an exempt  capital  gain to the 
<br/>deceased under this subsection, but only when the asset is disposed of by the trustee or

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>beneficiary  within  two  years  ….  (In  other  words  if  someone  dies  who  bequeaths  the 
<br/>property to you, you sell it, you do not pay any capital gain). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a capital gain made by a person on the disposal of shares if the shares were held by the 
<br/>person before 1st May, 2011.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This seems to irk them.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if they look at the amendment, what we are making 
<br/>is that if you look at the wording, “a capital gain made by a person on the dispose of shares”, “a 
<br/>person” can also include a foreigner.  What we are amending now it is just saying, it is only applicable 
<br/>to a resident person of Fijian citizen.  In other words foreigners cannot get capital gains.  So we are 
<br/>restricting the number of people.  In other words you will collect more money and they went of on a 
<br/>tangent and said, “we will not get more money”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point  is  that,  they  went  on  about  the  Corporate  Tax,  we  did  not  approve  the 
<br/>Corporate Tax reduction, Honourable Gavoka there was no Parliament then, it was done before 2014.  
<br/>So you had no say in that.  Corporate Tax, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the listed companies used to pay normal 
<br/>tax. Fijian Holdings, honourable Professor Prasad wanted to put a slight twist to it, I know this is 
<br/>about bringing in Fijian Holdings, you did not talk about Harry (Hari) Punja’s Companies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Do not just talk about Fijian Holdings.  Fijian Holdings used 
<br/>to pay Corporate Tax like everyone else, all companies and then we reduced it to 10 years.  So for 
<br/>the past number of seven or 10 years, Fijian Holdings has been paying 10 percent.  All we are saying 
<br/>now under the amendment that any company that is listed, if you are paying Corporate Tax of 10 
<br/>percent, you can pay Corporate Tax for seven years, after that you pay the normal tax like everyone 
<br/>else, honourable Gavoka, same thing.  So they have an objection to that.  They do not know what 
<br/>they are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir the other point that  I wish to  also make is,  he went  on  about  how much 
<br/>revenue  we  would  have  lost,  even  though  we  had  all  this  Corporate  Tax  rate  of  17  percent  for 
<br/>regional, global head office.  There are two companies:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>ANZ Regional Headquarters, not ANZ Bank, please understand, not ANZ Bank, they pay 
<br/>normal Corporate Tax.  The ANZ Regional Headquarters used to be in Melbourne.  They 
<br/>came to Fiji.  They are paying 17 percent; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A company called National Insurance Company PTE Holdings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is when your tax advisor had left FRCS that is why he does not know about this company because 
<br/>this company came after that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but more importantly Sir, the revenue loss … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is all done in-house, honourable Gavoka.  We have got 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a lot of smart people in-house.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the revenue loss that he is talking about being so momentous in fact was 
<br/>$26,000. The difference between 17 percent and 20 percent, we have done the calculation and it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>

<div><span>2022-2023 Budget Consequential Bills 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>only $26,000.  It goes to the point that honourable Seruiratu and honourable Usamate made that this 
<br/>was to try and attract businesses.  We do not look at simply how much corporate tax rate they pay. 
<br/>When they come here they rent houses, they hire people, there are people come in and out.  It lifts 
<br/>the profile of Fiji as a place to come and do business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You see when you run a government, you cannot work in silo, you have to look at the big 
<br/>picture.  It is all like a mosaic piece that comes together.  You have to look at Brand Fiji and if they 
<br/>understood what we have been doing, we are taking about Film Fiji, we have Investment Fiji, we 
<br/>have Fiji Airways.  All of these things Mr. Speaker, Sir, comes as a mosaic.  Honourable Gavoka, 
<br/>please do not look at your watch, I have got some more to go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last two points, honourable Professor Prasad asked, why is this indemnity 
<br/>given to tertiary scholarships and loans services?  It is nothing peculiar, if he bothered to look at all 
<br/>the other statutory organisations they all have the same course, this is the problem.  He has got a 
<br/>problem with the CEO that is his problem because he is a former USP person, that is his problem, 
<br/>that is where he is coming from.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  you  look  at  the  Acts,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Act  says  on  Accident 
<br/></span><span>Compensation Act 2017, Fiji Revenue and Customs Service Act 1998, Civil Aviation Authority of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  Act  1979,  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  Act  2011,  Maritime  Safety  Authority  Act  2009, 
<br/>Biosecurity  Authority  of  Fiji  Act  2008,  Fiji  Roads  Authority  Act  2012,  Fiji  Independence 
<br/>Commission Against Corruption Act 2007, Fiji Development Bank Act 1966, Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji Act 2007. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of them have some form of protection of liability for all the office holders and obviously 
<br/>you have to have that in the statutory organisation. So there is nothing sinister about that.  We can 
<br/>move away from that way of thinking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last one I would like to make and honourable Professor Prasad and some of 
<br/>the others on the other side keep on harping on about it, saying that “we are doing all of these because 
<br/>of the people who have donated to FijiFirst”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he were to look at some of the checks, changes we made in the past couple 
<br/>of  years  (please  listen  to  this  carefully),  where  duties  have  been  reduced  for  a  number  of  those 
<br/>manufacturing companies individuals who have interest in those companies have donated to FijiFirst 
<br/>in their own individual right.  If we were looking after them as he seems to always suggest, we would 
<br/></span><span>not have done that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many of those companies have forgone their protection but we have done it because we look 
<br/>at the overall economic picture, we look at the overall economic integrity.  There is a time all of them 
<br/>came, everyone makes submission right from all the organisations, some of them that they are very 
<br/>close to, they all made submissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But we have said, no, we have a particular philosophical commitment that if you have run a 
<br/>company for thirty-forty years and you have had all these protections all these time, it is about time 
<br/>you stood on your own two feet. Businesses cannot continue to get that level of protection because 
<br/>ultimately it affects the consumer, ultimately it affects the pricing for the consumers and it really 
<br/>saddens me that these people Mr. Speaker, Sir, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- 10 years …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2003 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I have already explained that.  I am 
<br/>talking about all the others.  He knows about the dairy industry.  Those people actually bought the 
<br/>debt.  Today the farmers who were into dairy do not have any debt, they have a sitting debt hanging 
<br/>over their heads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, but the point is this, we have electoral laws that are now very transparent, 
<br/>no business can give money.  Only an individual can give money and no more than FJ$10,000 in 12 
<br/>months.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The donor list put out on social media.  These people, these citizens of Fiji or former citizens 
<br/>of  Fiji  have  been  harassed,  have  been  berated,  have  been  ostracised,  have  been  trolled  on  social 
<br/>media, people like them have done it.  Their supporters have done it.  What is wrong with that, Sir?  
<br/>And what we are saying, Sir, is that that is their constitutional right to do so.  You go to Australia, 
<br/>individuals donate money but none of the political parties go and harass them that way, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But what we have a problem with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the lack of transparency demonstrated 
<br/>by  other  political  parties.    I  cannot  speak  for  SODELPA.    I  do  not  know  about  SODELPA  but  I 
<br/></span><span>definitely know about NFP.  I definitely know about NFP.  In their accounts, they had lamb curry 
<br/></span><span>nights whatever - $19,000 - $20,000, whatever it was, Mr. Speaker.  </span><span>Goss phulia</span><span>, whatever it was 
<br/>but the point is that we do not do </span><span>lovo</span><span> nights or </span><span>goss phulia</span><span> nights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the honourable Attorney-General is developing some 
<br/>kind of a god complex situation.  I mean this man knows that those issues were dealt with by the 
<br/>independent Elections Office and he talks about harassment of political parties.  It is the opposition 
<br/>parties in this country which are harassed every day, Mr. Speaker.  Not his party and we know, we 
<br/>know the list of donors.  He is talking about $10,000 each.  I mean you have one company – family 
<br/>including children giving $10,000 and he is talking about transparency and accountability.  Yes, I 
<br/>think he should refrain from talking about issues that have been dealt by an independent office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I only raised this matter because he did and I am not 
<br/>talking about the harassment of political parties.  I am talking about the harassment of individual 
<br/>citizens who donated funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad, when he gets in a fluster like that, you know we have hit a raw 
<br/>nerve.  He always does that.  But, Sir, my point being is this, there is nothing wrong and this goes to 
<br/></span><span>the whole culture of the political party set-up.  There is nothing wrong with an individual who has 
<br/></span><span>the gumption, who has the transparency to say, I am donating this much money to a political party.  
<br/>What is wrong with that?  It is not from my business account.  It is from my personal account.  Why 
<br/>should we? Individuals have given their money, we do not go and harass them.  We do not call out 
<br/>their names.  We do not stand up in Parliament say hey because you have an association with these 
<br/>people, that is why you are saying this.  We do not have anything to do with donors, Sir.  We do not 
<br/>harass donors.  Please keep quiet!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this, we do not actually harass donors nor should anybody else, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  And therefore, what  we have  a problem  with,  Sir, are  political  parties holding 
<br/>events in which there is no accountability of who gave the funds and how they gained the funds and 
<br/>where the funds came from - that is the issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if tomorrow 200 business people from their own personal account, Sir, 
<br/>decide to give money to SODELPA or PAP or NFP, that is fine, that is their prerogative.  What we 
<br/>do have a problem with Sir, is that when people donate funds and we do not know where the money 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is coming from, all political parties have an event in which, Sir, monies have come in but they do not 
<br/>have  any  accountability.    Who  gave  the  $5  who  gave  the  $5,000  -  that  does  not  go  towards 
<br/>transparency, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to make that point because you know we have a problem 
<br/>with unnamed donors. I wish to Sir, through this particular forum, please urge all Fijians who want 
<br/>to donate to political parties, it is your choice.  You want to give $5, please do so and I also urge all 
<br/>the political parties, just because some individual has donated money to a particular political party, 
<br/>that is their right, let them do it.  But do not come to this Parliament and use this again as a forum to 
<br/>harass them – we know who gave you the money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is there, it is publically-listed we do not say it we know who gave you the money.  What 
<br/>we do have a problem with, we have anecdotes about companies giving them money under the table, 
<br/>about people giving money through various events and we have obviously raised this issue.  So, again, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of these issues going back again, for example, to what honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>went on about a wrong Act.  All of these seems to be clouded in some form of conspiratorial issue, theory 
<br/></span><span>that all of these we have done just to suit a handful of people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, speaking on all of these Bills as highlighted by many Members, in particular 
<br/>from this side, go to the heart of what the Budget Announcement is about. It is about putting in place laws 
<br/>that streamlines our processes, that makes life easier for ordinary Fijians, that puts in place immediate
