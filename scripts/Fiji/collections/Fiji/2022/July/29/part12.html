<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF BILLS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Monday, 25th July, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the following Bills be debated, voted upon and be passed: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Television (Cross-Carriage of Designated Events) (Repeal) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>39/2022); 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Telecommunication (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 40/2022);  
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Illicit Drugs Control (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 41/2022);  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 42/2022);  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Pharmacy Profession (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 43/2022); and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Medicinal Products (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 44/2022).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to speak on all of the Bills before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>us which are the six.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Television (Cross-Carriage of Designated Events) (Repeal) Bill, Sir, this is an Act that was 
<br/>commenced  on  29th  May,  2014,  enacted,  amongst  other  things,  to  ensure  that  designated  events  are 
<br/>broadcast on free-to-air television for the benefit of all Fijian viewers, enable and maintain fair market 
<br/>conduct  and  effective  competition  in  the  Fiji  Broadcast  Media  Industry  and  ensure  viability  of 
<br/>comprehensive range of quality television services in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objective of the Acts, Sir, guarantee the availability of comprehensive range of high quality 
<br/>television services and provision of any effective means of upholding competitiveness and fair market 
<br/>practices in the broadcasting sector.  Many Fijians,  especially the marginalised did not have access to 
<br/>subscription television or channels from all the three free-to-air television broadcasters at that point  in 
<br/>time and could only receive channels from one or two free-to-air television broadcasters depending where 
<br/>they lived or what kind of antenna they actually had.  Therefore, the Act ensured that anyone who had 
<br/>accessed  at  least  one  of  the  channels  from  the  free-to-air  television  broadcaster  will  be  able  to  view 
<br/>coverage what we call that designated important events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  list  of  designated  events,  Sir,  were  the  General  Elections  results,  the  National  Budget 
<br/>Address, Parliament proceedings, Question and Answer sessions, State funerals, Rugby League World 
<br/>Cup,  FIFA World Cup,  Netball World Cup, Olympic Games, Commonwealth  Games, South Pacific 
<br/>Games, Mini South Pacific Games, Coca-Cola Games, Statement by the Chairperson  of the Electoral 
<br/>Commission  following  the  announcement  of  the  Writ  for  the  Election  of  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>Candidate  Ball  Draw,  Statement  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Electoral  Commission  and  Supervisor  of 
<br/>Elections, prior to the commence of pre-polling voting, all medium messages from the Fijian Elections 
<br/>Office for Election day, final announcement of the Election results by the Supervisor of Elections and 
<br/>allocation of seats by the Electoral Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, with the implementation of the National Digital Television Platform 
<br/>- </span><span>Walesi</span><span>, in the mandatory analogue to digital switchover every free-to-air television broadcaster has  at 
<br/>least 100 percent coverage throughout  Fiji through territorial, satellite and over the top means.   This 
<br/>means that Fijians can now view all the channels from all the  free-to-air television stations using the 
<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2007 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Walesi</span><span> currently has nine free-to-air television channels which are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>FBC; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji One; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>FBC Sports; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Mai TV; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji One Channel 2; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>FBC 2; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Parliament Channel; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Educational Channel; and  
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Hope Channel (Religious-based Channel). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Sir, because now all these free-to-air television channels are available on the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform 
<br/>and we have tens of thousands of people who have now access to </span><span>Walesi</span><span> both on their phones and, of 
<br/>course, on the television set, Sir, there is no need now to have a specific requirement for what we call the 
<br/>cross-carriage  of  designated  events  because  now  you  can  watch  it  on  the  </span><span>Walesi</span><span>  platform  and  it  is 
<br/>available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are asking for the Act to be repealed now as we no longer 
<br/></span><span>require that.  If the Act is actually continued, then the television companies will need to continue to share 
<br/>whatever  exclusive  rights they  may  have.  For example, if tomorrow  Fiji  One  secures the right to  an 
<br/>international event that is listed here, they  do not  have to  go  and share that with  FBC or  </span><span>Mai TV</span><span> or 
<br/>converse it with </span><span>Mai TV</span><span> as a particular programme because now you can watch it from anywhere in Fiji.  
<br/>Previously, there are certain parts of Fiji that only got Fiji One, only certain parts of Fiji that have got 
<br/>FBC, so that is why there is a need to share those important events with different television stations. So 
<br/>that is on the first Bill itself, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  one,  Sir,  is  the  Telecommunication  Act  which  provides  for  the  regulation  of 
<br/>telecommunication industry in Fiji. This is provided under section 24 of the Act, Sir.   Telecommunication 
<br/>Authority of Fiji charges telecommunication service providers an annual revenue base licence fee.  The 
<br/>percentage of this annual revenue base licence fee is to be put into an existing trust fund, set aside for the 
<br/>continuing  development  of  Fiji  Telecommunications  Industry,  allowing  Fiji  to  further  similar 
<br/>understanding as the information telecommunications hub of the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Budget Amendment Bill seeks to amend section 24 of the Act to facilitate 
<br/>the payment of a percentage of the annual revenue base licence fee charge to service providers to the 
<br/></span><span>Telecommunication  Development  Trust  Fund  that  was  established  under  Regulation  4  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Telecommunications Trust Fund Regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a minor amendment but essentially gives the authorisation.  There are two 
<br/>clauses, one is Clause 1 which provides for the short title and the other one is actually amending section 
<br/>24 to empower the Minister to prescribe a percentage of the charges and fees collected, which is to be 
<br/>paid to the Telecommunications Development Trust Fund.  As we have highlighted earlier on, we use 
<br/>these funds also to connect remote schools, villages, et cetera, to the internet, and we also then use the 
<br/>funding from the Universal Service Funds to put up towers in areas like Kadavu and various other places 
<br/>that does not have connectivity, so people can get mobile phone connectivity and not just for voice but 
<br/>also for data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is Bill No. 41 of 2022, which is the Illicit Drugs Control (Budget 
<br/>Amendment) Bill.  The Illicit Drugs Control Act 2004 was enacted in 2004 as the name suggests, to 
<br/>regulate and control the cultivation, manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, supply, possession and 
<br/>use  of  illicit  drugs  and  controlled  chemicals  and  for  related  matters.    Part  2  of  the  Act  prohibits  the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>importation, cultivation, manufacture and supply, et cetera, of these.  Schedule 1 to the Act lists Cannabis 
<br/>and Cannabis resin, Cannabis fruit, Cannabis plant, Cannabis seed and Cannabis oil as illicit drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendment before Parliament at this moment seeks to amend the Act to pave the way for the 
<br/>establishment of the industrial hemp industry in Fiji.  As highlighted previously, industrial hemp is a 
<br/>lucrative and largely untapped resource in the global economy due to popular misconceptions linking it 
<br/>to marijuana.  Indeed, some countries are benefiting  from it quite significantly.  Our law is not very 
<br/>sophisticated at this point in time because it actually does not distinguish between the different types of 
<br/>cannabis, so hemp and marijuana both derive from the </span><span>Cannabis sativa</span><span> plant, but they are cultivated 
<br/>differently, possess different chemical attributes and are used for different reasons. A defining difference 
<br/>between the two is the level of </span><span>Tetrahydrocannabinol</span><span> (THC) present in industrial hemp.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  THC  is  the  psychoactive  substance  that  produces  what  we  call,  the  ‘high’ 
<br/>associated with smoking marijuana.  Industrial hemp contains less than 1 percent of THC, you can smoke 
<br/>an entire field and you will not get high and as such, cannot be used as a recreational drug in the way the 
<br/>marijuana is used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industrial hemp is one of the most versatile crops with more than 50,000 uses, including food, 
<br/></span><span>nutrition  -  the  seeds  are  used  for  food  purposes,  personal  care,  health  and  wellness,  paper,  textiles, 
<br/></span><span>building materials, medicines, pet bedding, plastic alternatives, bio fuels and energy.  It has immense 
<br/>potential for the Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, we understand there was a session at the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and I think it was the 
<br/>CEO  of  ANZ  who  actually  said  that  they  are  quite  excited  about  this  particular  new  initiative  by 
<br/>Government.  The Bill seeks to amend Schedule 1 to the Act to remove industrial hemp and all of its 
<br/>extracts with no more than 1 percent of THC concentration from the list of illicit drugs to allow for the 
<br/>importation, possession, cultivation, sale and supply of industrial hemp.  All other forms of Cannabis 
<br/>remain a Schedule 1 illicit drug.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is  only the first  step  and it  will be  a very  detailed and  comprehensive 
<br/>framework for the growing, cultivation and harvesting of industrial hemp.  This Bill just allows us to 
<br/>bring in the seeds and the plants and we need to start testing the soil and nutrient composition and verify 
<br/>the viability of industrial hemp market for Fiji.  We are working very closely with the United Nations 
<br/>Office of Drugs and Crime to make sure everything checks out and obviously, we get their endorsement 
<br/>too and to establish a system that is workable and not easily exploited.  We are also working with the Fiji 
<br/>National University to ensure, in particular the Agriculture School that we are able to test the cannabis 
<br/></span><span>plants and indeed the growing of the nursery at the Agriculture School in Koronivia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the initial scoping work goes well and we find there is a real opportunity for 
<br/>Fiji, we will roll out the comprehensive licensing framework, which we will bring to Parliament through 
<br/>a standalone law.  In the meantime, we need to be able to forge ahead with this and we need to start doing 
<br/>the testing.  We have a team of people, I understand coming in about four to five weeks’ time.  They will 
<br/>be going around Fiji looking at various parts of Fiji which might be suitable, testing the soil, etcetera, to 
<br/>see how we can progress next.  We are obviously talking to all the different agencies including the Fiji 
<br/>Police Force and various other agencies regarding illicit drugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next Bill No. 42 of 2022 provides for, amongst other things, the continuation of Fiji National 
<br/>Provident Fund (FNPF) and its functions and duties in relation to overarching fiduciary duty as custodians 
<br/>of members’ retirement funds.  The Bill seeks to amend the Act to allow trustees to invest minors monies 
<br/>held in the trust for minors into FNPF and accordingly, allow for FNPF to admit such minors as FNPF 
<br/>members. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2009 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also seeks to amend the Act to increase the rates of mandated contributions by employers 
<br/>and employees from 6 percent to 7 percent with effect from 1st January, 2023 to 31st December, 2023.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we know this was reduced as part of temporarily reliefs provided to employers and 
<br/>employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Bill further seeks to amend the Act to enable the closure 
<br/>of dormant accounts that have remained dominant for a period as determined by the FNPF board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, lastly the Bill amends the Act to allow sole nominees of an FNPF member to 
<br/>continue with the members drawdown account.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drawdown account is an account 
<br/>established by the FNPF board as a result of an option exercised by an FNPF member or nominee of the 
<br/>FNPF member, consequent on an entitlement event which provides for phased payment of the funds 
<br/>lodged in the account by the holder of the drawdown account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendment provides that the sole nominee for the drawdown accounts can be a person who 
<br/>is no longer restricted to an FNPF member’s spouse. Because before let us assume that you had a spouse 
<br/>but a lot of people may be unmarried and they may nominate for example their parents or some member 
<br/>of the family, so this allows for the drawdown account, that is after a person has gone on pension for them 
<br/>to actually continue to receive that.  At the moment that is only for spouses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  next  Bill  is  the  Pharmacy  Profession  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill.    The 
<br/></span><span>Pharmacy Profession Act 2011 provides for the protection of the health and safety of the public in relation 
<br/>to the practice of pharmacy.  Pharmacies services include the supply, compounding or dispensation of 
<br/>medicines, and the provision of advice and counsel on the effective and safe use of medicines.  The Act 
<br/>also regulates the operations of pharmacies, pharmacy businesses and the provision of pharmacy services 
<br/>in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, many private pharmacy services are only available at limited times or 
<br/>are not available even in populated areas of Fiji.  For example Sir, there are no pharmacies on any island 
<br/>except Viti Levu or Vanua Levu meaning that there are no pharmacies in Kadavu, Taveuni, Ovalau or 
<br/>even Rotuma for that matter.  I am talking about private pharmacies.  There is only one pharmacy in 
<br/>Vanua Levu outside Labasa, only one pharmacy exists between Nausori and Tavua, travelling on the 
<br/>Kings Road and only one pharmacy exists between Lami and Sigatoka travelling on the Queens Road.  
<br/>One of the lessons COVID-19 pandemic taught the world was how important it was to have adequate 
<br/>access to health care services including of course, medicines.  Lock-downs were some of the necessary 
<br/>measures that were put in place during the pandemic but how do boundaries work with such geographical, 
<br/>clustered medical services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, we had to relook at how and why pharmacy services are organised 
<br/></span><span>the way they are and here is what we found.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, pharmacy services are regulated under 
<br/>two different laws, the Pharmacy Profession Act 2011 and the Medicinal Products Act 2011.  These laws 
<br/>were  promulgated  together  and  were  meant  to  establish  the  framework  for  pharmacy  and  medicine 
<br/>services in Fiji.  Unfortunately, two aspects of the legal framework under these laws are anti-competitive.  
<br/>Firstly, Sir, our pharmacists are only allowed to open two pharmacy businesses, this is only possible for 
<br/>a pharmacist to  own  more than two  pharmacies, if no other pharmacist is  willing and  able to  own  a 
<br/>pharmacy in that area.  This is of course archaic and a very pointless rule in what has actually prevented 
<br/>the setting up of pharmacy in Rotuma.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rotuma of course is  a  geographically isolated location  and it is only viable  as  an investment 
<br/>option if the interested of pharmacist is able to sustain his or her business through pharmacists in other 
<br/>locations. However, because the Act limits the ownership to two or less than two pharmacies, the only 
<br/>eligible pharmacists in Fiji lack the resources to make a viable investment in Rotuma.  This is the same 
<br/>for other geographically isolated locations. The rules do not make any sense for them Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>A pharmacist actually tried to setup a pharmacy in Rotuma but because of this rule, the application was 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in fact unsuccessful - someone had gone and booked and said that they intended to open a pharmacy, 
<br/>therefore no one else was allowed to go in there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Pharmacy Profession Board currently regulates the business 
<br/>end for pharmacy practice as well as the professional end.  It is illegal to operate a pharmacy without the 
<br/>authorisation from the Board under section 45, without an approval of the premises of the business from 
<br/>the  Board  itself.    When  making  a  decision  whether  to  authorise  or  approve  a  pharmacy  business  or 
<br/>premises  the  board  is  able  to  request  for  any  information  or  documents  it  requires  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>ownership  of  the  business  and  the  people  who  actually  sit  on  the  board  are  existing  pharmacists 
<br/>themselves, so the board is also able to prescribe any condition they think appropriate for the approval of 
<br/>the premises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is like saying, for example, that if I want to open up a pharmacy, say in 
<br/>Korovou tomorrow, the people who will decide whether I can open a pharmacy in Korovou would be my 
<br/>competitors.  Other pharmacists sit on the Board and they will decide.  In one particular case, Sir, the 
<br/>person wanted to open a pharmacy and they said that they wanted to see all his financials; they wanted to 
<br/>see how he made the medicine; they wanted to know the source of his medicine; where he bought it from; 
<br/>whether he bought in bulk; whether he bought it wholesale; and whether he bought it at retail.  When he 
<br/></span><span>gave all the information, they wanted more information and yet these are the people who are directly his 
<br/></span><span>competitors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In carrying out their roles, Sir, the Board thus has access to information concerning the operations 
<br/>of  the  pharmacy  businesses  and  their  ability  to  compete  in  the  market  and  significant  powers  which 
<br/>impact how these businesses operate.  This has resulted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I highlighted in at least one 
<br/>instance, where a member of the Board had access to the finances of one of his own competitors and used 
<br/>his  position  on  the  Board  to  continuously  request  for  more  information  week  after  week,  constantly 
<br/>delaying the application of his competitor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Framework  under  the  Act  allows  for  the  Board  to  consist  of  at  least  two  registered 
<br/>pharmacists who owned their own pharmacies.  This means at any given time, the Board will consist of 
<br/>members competing in the market they are actually regulating, except that the Board members will have 
<br/>access to the confidential business information of their competitors and be able to directly impact the 
<br/>businesses of their competition.  Furthermore, Sir, the quorum of the Board, section 14(5) is five members 
<br/>giving the sector members a significant say in meetings where the quorum is just only met.  The anti-
<br/>competitive nature of this Framework contributes to the limited services offered by pharmacies since it 
<br/>places amongst other things that decision-making for pharmacy business matters in the hands of a select 
<br/></span><span>group  of  competing  pharmacists.    It stifles  competition  and  does  not enable a level playing  field  for 
<br/></span><span>pharmacists in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pharmacy Profession (Budget Amendment) Bill seeks to amend 
<br/>the Act to address the anti-competitive nature of the Act to ensure that pharmacy businesses are able to 
<br/>compete more effectively.  It does this by firstly, increasing the number of pharmacies that registered 
<br/>pharmacists may own from two to five, to allow for registered pharmacists to expand his or her business 
<br/>where  pharmacy  services  are  needed.    This  is  a  significant  step  for  pharmacies  and  will  allow  for 
<br/>expansion into areas previously unserviced.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  seeks  to  transfer  the  Board’s  role  in  authorising  the  operations  of  pharmacy 
<br/>businesses  and  the  premises  and  locations  for  these  businesses  to  the  Fijian  Competition  Consumer 
<br/>Commission (FCCC).  Sir, FCCC is a third-party independent regulator established under Section 7 of 
<br/>the FCCC Act 2010 and FCCC possesses expertise in competition and market dynamics and is better 
<br/>placed to determine the business-related aspects of the pharmacy business market, as it does for example, 
<br/>should there be any mergers and acquisitions, they actually do the regulations for that. For example, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2011 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recently  we  had  a  major  acquisition,  regarding  banks,  regarding  for  example,  telecommunication 
<br/>companies.  The proposed amendments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, seeks to transfer only the business and market 
<br/>regulation from the Board to FCCC, to provide for accountability and transparency and to avoid any 
<br/>conflict of interest which may arise during the running of a pharmacy business in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Board will continue to regulate the professional standards of the pharmacy.  
<br/>That is the Board’s job.  Every pharmacist will need to be registered with the Board, will still need to 
<br/>meet the qualifications and training required by the Board in order to practice and will still be subject to 
<br/>investigations and disciplinary proceedings where misconduct is alleged.  The Board’s role in regulating 
<br/>the profession will continue as it is the Board’s mandate.  It is only the business end that will be transferred 
<br/>to  an  independent  regulator  to  ensure  that  conflicts  of  interest  are  minimised  and  that  a  small  set  of 
<br/>pharmacies do not have an undue advantage in the market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also goes a few steps further.  Apart from addressing the anti-competitive nature of the 
<br/>Act, Mr. Speaker, the Bill also proposes a proactive solution to limited pharmacy services in times of 
<br/>need.  The Bill seeks to provide for a wider reach of medical and dental services to the public through the 
<br/>engagement of a general and dental practitioners practicing on their own account under PPP with the 
<br/>Government of the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a complement to the objectives of the PPP scheme, the Bill seeks to empower general and 
<br/>dental practitioners engaged under PPP scheme to supply and dispense medicines approved by the PS of 
<br/>Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  provided  the  nearest  pharmacy  is  not  operating.    So,  for 
<br/>example, if I get sick and assuming I am in Sigatoka and I go to the doctor and the doctor says look you 
<br/>need to start taking antibiotics immediately but the pharmacy is not open, so maybe I go to Zen’s Medical 
<br/>near Natadola in the Maro area where there is some shops there, et cetera, but there is no pharmacy 
<br/>around, he said, “Look, you need to take the antibiotics now”, but in order for you to start taking the 
<br/>medicine,  he  may  give  you  the  antibiotics  for  the  next  24  hours  which  allows  you  to  take  the 
<br/>antibiotics immediately.  Then in the next 24 hours, you can go to the nearest pharmacy and buy it.  
<br/>So, this Bill actually, Mr. Speaker, incorporates the ability of those doctors and dental practitioners 
<br/>who are in the PPP Scheme with Government to be able to dispense that medicine at least for the 
<br/>next 24 hours until you get to a pharmacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  seeks  to  extend  the  period  of  Authorisation  Licence 
<br/>under Section 45(a) of the Act up to five years, so you get licence up to five years for that too. The 
<br/>doctors who dispense such medicine, for example, they cannot give it for a week. There is a fine for 
<br/>that. They can only do it for 24 hours or maybe up to 48 hours depending where they are or their 
<br/></span><span>unavailability.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is part of that particular Bill (Bill No. 43 of 2022).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  next  one is  the  Medicinal  Products  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill.    The 
<br/>Medicinal Products Act 2011 actually provides for the protection of the health and safety of the public 
<br/>by regulating the import, manufacture, export supplies, sale, advertising and promotion on medicinal 
<br/>products,  devises,  poisons  and  similar  products.  The  Act  seeks  to  ensure  that  such  products  and 
<br/>services are of acceptable, quality, safety and efficacy.  The Act was promulgated together with the 
<br/>Pharmacy  Profession  Act  2011  and  these  two  Acts  worked  in  tandem  to  establish  the  regulatory 
<br/>framework for medicines and pharmacies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  explained, the anti-competitive nature of the pharmacy  framework in 
<br/>relation  to  the  Pharmacy  Profession  Bill,  I  will  not  repeat  that  here  however  in  respect  of  the 
<br/>Medicinal Products (Budget Amendment) Bill, Sir, it also seeks to amend the Act to address the anti-
<br/>competitive nature of the Act to ensure pharmacy businesses are able to compete more effectively 
<br/>and provide for wider reach of medical and dental services to the public through the engagement of 
<br/>General Practitioners and Dentists practising on their own account under the PPP Scheme. Under the

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Act, no person may import, manufacture, export, store, distribute and sell any medicinal products 
<br/>without a licence from the Fiji Medicinal Products Board. Additionally, no person may manufacture, 
<br/>prepare, store or sell any products unless the premises are licensed by the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as these are the businesses with aspects of the pharmacy business and so 
<br/>should not be under the purview of the Board. The rationale here is the same as proposed under the 
<br/>Bill to amend the Pharmacy Act. As the Board consists of registered pharmacists operating their own 
<br/>pharmacies,  by  allowing  the  board  to  determine  the  medicinal  stock  as  well  as  giving  the  Board 
<br/>access to the details of the operation of the pharmacy business, they can delve and find out what are 
<br/>you doing in your business and what is the set up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act has created a system whereby some competing pharmacies have an unfair advantage 
<br/>over others. There are certain drugs, for example, you cannot simply put on the shelf, you need to 
<br/>have a storage facility and some of these pharmacists who want to sell these drugs, they are not being 
<br/>given the approval by the Board themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this systems which is conducive to fair and dynamic competition in this market, as such 
<br/>the Bill seeks to transfer the business and market control role of the Board to the Fijian Competition 
<br/></span><span>Consumer  Commission  (FCCC).    As  highlighted,  it  is  a  third  party  regulator,  Sir.    The  proposed 
<br/></span><span>amendment seeks to transfer business and market regulation from the Board to FCCC to provide for 
<br/>accountability and transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this does not mean that drugs and medicinal products will be imported into 
<br/>the  country  with  no  input  from  the  Board.  The  Board  will  still  be  responsible  for  registering  all 
<br/>medicinal products, poisons and devices under Part 7 to Part 10 of the Act.  It is illegal to import, 
<br/>manufacture, export, store, sell, distribute, transport offer for sale, exposed to sale or even advertise 
<br/>any medicinal product unless such product is registered with the Board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  a  medicinal  product  has  been  registered  by  the  Board,  it  can  then  be 
<br/>imported and dealt with. The Minister and the Board may then work together under Section 34 of the 
<br/>Act to prescribe the conditions for the importation, et cetera, of these products.  This may include the 
<br/>special prescription and record keeping procedures to be followed. This role of the Board continues 
<br/>and we are not proposing that, that be changed at all.  It is because we recognise that the Board has 
<br/>the expertise to vet what medicines and drugs can be imported and dealt with in Fiji and under what 
<br/>conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  once  again  the  business  end  of  this  process,  the  licensing  that  follows  after  a 
<br/></span><span>product has been registered and the conditions have been prescribed does not have to be remain with 
<br/>the  Board  because  the  Board  does  the  first  part.    In  fact  allowing  the  Board  to  also  regulate  the 
<br/>business end of this industry allows for exploitation and indeed unfair advantage. That is why the 
<br/>Bill seeks to transfer this aspect to the Board’s functions to FCCC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  seeks  to  broaden  the  availability  of  medical  and  dental  services  by  as 
<br/>compliment to the objection of PPP Scheme empowering General Practitioners and dentists engaged 
<br/>under  PPP  Scheme  to  store  and  distribute  medicinal  products  with  devises  approved  by  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for Health and Medical Services, provided that the nearest pharmacy is not in 
<br/>operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some of the introductory remarks for the six Bills.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.A.R. SENILOLI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regards to Bill No. 40 of 2022 for an Act to amend the Telecommunication Act 2008, section 24 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2013 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amendment is after subsection (3) by inserting the following subsection –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(3A) Notwithstanding subsection (3), the Minister may prescribe a percentage of 
<br/>the  charges  and  fees  collected,  which  is  to  be  paid  to  the  Telecommunications 
<br/>Development Trust Fund.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amendment  gives  the  power  to  the  honourable  Minister  to  take  a 
<br/>percentage of the fees to Telecommunications Development Trust Fund.  Sir, I just want to ask for 
<br/>some clarifications.  Who is going to be in control of the Trust Account?  What are the terms of which 
<br/>this Trust Account will be governed and administered?  Who is going to audit this Trust Account to 
<br/>ensure transparency and good governance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  make  a  brief 
<br/>contribution to the debate on the motion before this august Parliament and I wish to speak on Bill 
<br/>Nos. 43 and 44, more so of  seeking clarification from the honourable Minister with regards to some 
<br/>of the clauses within the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Bill  No.  43,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  rightly  mentioned  by  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span><span>Economy, the Bill seeks to address the indirect limits on the competition in the Act by removing of 
<br/></span><span>the Fiji Pharmacy Professions Board’s role in authorising the operations of pharmacy businesses and 
<br/>the premises and location of these businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me if I can mention the members of the Board.  The components of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Pharmacy Profession Board is nine members appointed by the Minister: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Permanent Secretary of Health – Chairperson; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two registered pharmacists appointed by the Fiji Pharmaceutical Society; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Chief Pharmacist - Deputy Chairperson 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>One registered pharmacist from the Society of Hospital Pharmacy; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>One who shall be appointed as a representative from the Fiji School of Medicine; and  
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three shall be appointed by the honourable Minister who have a role to play in expertise in 
<br/>law, medicine, health care and consumer affairs in the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My point  of concern or  clarification to  the honourable Minister is  that, does the Act  itself 
<br/>already have provisions for FCCC in it with regards to one of the three appointed by the honourable 
<br/>Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is to increase the number of pharmacists from two to five.  At the moment with 
<br/>regards to General Practitioners (GPs), I am sure there are some GPs who have more than two or 
<br/>three GP clinics available mostly in this side of the country and with regard to pharmacy, personally 
<br/>I have to declare my interest as well. I  do not see anything wrong with this, just except if FCCC is 
<br/>going  to  be  issuing  the  okay  for  them  to  open  the  pharmacy,  with  regards  to  young  pharmacists 
<br/>coming up and also if an area is condensed and full of pharmacists, will they be still allowed to operate 
<br/>their pharmacy within that area.  That is another concern.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like I said, I declare my interest with regards to the availability of GPs under PPP to dispense 
<br/>medication after hours, usually one or two doses at the most and thereafter they can get their full dose 
<br/>from the required pharmacy when needed.  My only concern is that it is only with PPP doctors, not 
<br/>all patients are covered under PPP and how could they go about doing that if the need arises?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will essentially confine my remarks to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>three Bills: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>2014 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 42/2022);  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Pharmacy Profession (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 43/2022); and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Medicinal Products (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 44/2022); 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before that, Sir, I just wanted to respond to my friend, honourable Minister for Defence who 
<br/>is fond of describing the National Federation Party as the spider in the web because precisely that is 
<br/>the web in which he caught when he was talking about what happened after 1997. In fact five years 
<br/>after that, even before he mentioned, the number of farmers, the production actually went to $4.6 
<br/>million and we produced about 517,000 tonnes.  So I just wanted to correct you on that, honourable 
<br/>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Bills especially on the Pharmacy Profession (Budget Amendment) 
<br/>Bill  and  the  Medicinal  Products  (Budget  Amendment)  Bill,  there  are  a  number  of  questions  and 
<br/>perhaps doubts.  Of  course, the honourable Attorney-General  will translate it as a conspiracy but 
<br/>these are important questions, important issues, it is about transparency, it is about accountability, it 
<br/>is  about  conflict  of  interest  and  these  issues  need  to  be  raised  in  Parliament  no  matter  how  the 
<br/>Government feels about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question I pose is, what medicinal products our pharmacies were dispensed with as well 
<br/></span><span>as doctors and dentists under the PPP scheme which is going to be regulated and determined by a 
<br/>body?  As you are saying there will be a list with no real time, professional or medicinal expertise 
<br/>and the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) will be looking at that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is important for the Minister to clarify the fact that FCCC will also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>determine how many pharmacies can now operate or have interest in five pharmacy outlets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No more than five. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, that is what I am saying - have interest in five pharmacy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outlets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  FCCC  will  now  relegate  or  eradicate  the  role  of  professionals  as  it  is  because  the 
<br/>Medicinal Products Board and the Fiji Pharmaceuticals Board have professionals there.  It does not 
<br/>make sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but before I proceed further, I think people on the Government side 
<br/>should declare their interest, in particular, honourable Maharaj because he is not only a pharmacy 
<br/>owner but also the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights whose 
<br/></span><span>report, may I say, on the Code of Conduct Bill has still been gathering dust since April 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to ask the question whether 
<br/>FCCC is in the best position to determine what is going to be imported and sold in our pharmacies 
<br/>in surgeries of doctors and dental practitioner clinics. These issues are not very clear.  If it is about 
<br/>promoting competition and eradicating anti-competitive behaviour, then I am not sure what this Bill 
<br/>is intended to do.  In fact, the Bills stand out like a sore thumb in relation to all the questions that we 
<br/>still have to ask.  The Medicinal Products (Amendment) Bill totally takes away the powers of the 
<br/>Medicinal Products Board and gives it to FCCC - that is what is coming.

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well you explain that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I have already explained it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  The Bill bases this so called conflict of interest because two 
<br/>out  of  twelve  as  pointed  out  by  my  honourable  colleague,  representatives  from  the  total  Board 
<br/>composition out from the private pharmaceutical sector, only two.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two out of twelve, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not about anti-competitive behaviour.  I was listening 
<br/>to the honourable Attorney-General and I have seen this in the past as well that whenever there are 
<br/>incidences of organisations, Boards or processes not working and people actually deviating from that, 
<br/>we change the law.  Changing the law always does not solve the problem, you have to look at what 
<br/>is the problem.  Why is it not being done properly?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  what  is  likely  to  happen  is,  these  pharmacies,  the  bigger  ones,  can  have  complete 
<br/>monopoly over the pharmaceutical industry, effectively destroying any competition and the desire 
<br/>for  would  be  pharmacist  currently  studying  or  completing  or  planning  to  venture  into  pharmacy 
<br/>businesses, because the Pharmacy Act now allows ownership of only five pharmacies instead of two 
<br/></span><span>and we know that it is for the big boys, the big boys will get in there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There are girls too.  There are boys and girls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know who these people are right now in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this country and we know many of them are supporting FijiFirst and we know their names. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Unlike on Wednesday when the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>started naming names, I will not do what he did, I will not embarrass them and I will not abuse my 
<br/>parliamentary privilege.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many pharmacists already operate multiple pharmacies.  The pharmacy licences are under 
<br/>the names of pharmacists running the individual pharmacy.  But two owners of such pharmacies, 
<br/>while not being pharmacists, their spouses have been closely linked to FijiFirst for the last eight years 
<br/>through financial donations and raising of substantial amounts of funds.  Here we saw an act of a bit 
<br/>of drama by the honourable Attorney-General when he was questioning the method of fundraising.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know, he even complaint to the Supervisor of Elections without actually providing a single 
<br/>thread of evidence against other political parties.  I have in my possession, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact 
<br/>I have  got  documents  that detail  how two persons,  I have mentioned  who manage this pharmacy 
<br/>chain, and when I say financial donations and fundraising I am not making a wild and unsubstantiated 
<br/>allegation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From financial records of FijiFirst, a sum of $50,000 was receipted on 15</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2018.  
<br/>The names include the said businessman, his wife and three other family members.  However, on 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>November, 2018, another sum of $50,000 is receipted in the names of five pharmacists associated or 
<br/>employed with the businessman’s pharmacy chain on a single day alone.  The question we are asking 
<br/>is, have we ascertained the sources of funds for those donations?  These are legitimate questions as 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General is very keen always to tell others these are legitimate questions that 
<br/>need to be answered, because this report here establishes the direct link between the businessmen 
<br/>and the pharmacist, this report here, that I have in my possession, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the pretext of deregulating the pharmaceutical industry, ownership per pharmacist has 
<br/>been extended from two to five and we now have a body which will have no medical knowledge, 
<br/>usurping the authority of medical professionals and determine how these industries should function. 
<br/>From Parliamentary records Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last Annual Report by FCCC to Parliament was 
<br/>the 2017-2018 Report and that is for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2017 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 and we still have 
<br/>not  seen  the  Annual  Reports  for  2018-2019,  2019-2020  or  even  2020-2021  and  we  know  the 
<br/>independence of this organisation and we have raised questions before Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important for us to understand that what this Bill is actually doing is destroying the future 
<br/>of pharmacists and those that are perhaps about to enter the industry for those who have chosen as 
<br/>their  career  path  to  eventually  operate  and  own  pharmacists.    In  fact  the  Bill  Sir  is  crushing  the 
<br/>aspirations  of  current  students  undertaking  Pharmaceutical  Programmes.  These  students  are 
<br/>undoubtedly concerned at how the pharmaceutical industry in this country is going to be exploited 
<br/>by some and how this exploitation will be assisted by an agency funded by taxpayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  received  this  online  petition  and  it  says,  there  are  130  signatures 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already and what it says, this is … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- They are drinking party students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We are not using any students, this is what someone has just 
<br/>send me now while I am speaking Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is on the </span><span>Facebook,</span><span> and I want to read this, it 
<br/>says, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We  the  students,  family  and  friends  associated  with  the  Bachelor  of  Pharmacy, 
<br/>Programme of the Fiji National University strongly believe that the proposed Bill 43 of 
<br/>2022 which suggests amendments done to the Pharmacy Profession Act 2011 should not 
<br/>be  passed.  Our  two  main  concerns  include  the  increasing  of  the  maximum  number  of 
<br/>pharmacies, a registered pharmacist can own from two to five and the changing of power 
<br/>of authorisation of pharmacy business in Fiji from the Pharmacy Professions Board to the 
<br/>Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission. We believe that we, as young pharmacists, 
<br/>should be given a fair chance to open our own businesses, become employers and not just 
<br/></span><span>employees and if the Bill is passed, we will not stand a chance with older pharmacists, with 
<br/></span><span>better financial backgrounds and buying powers. This would also mean that we would have 
<br/>to wait for these pharmacists to sell their businesses or wait until they pass before we can 
<br/>take over”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is from the students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“With regards to the power of authorisation of pharmacy businesses we believe that 
<br/>the board which is comprised of different members including the Permanent Secretary for 
<br/>Health and not just pharmacists should retain its power.  Pharmacists should be included 
<br/>in decision making regarding the profession itself and FCCC has no pharmaceutical interest 
<br/>therefore  we  vote  against  this  amendment.    Please  we  urge  you  to  sign  this  petition  in 
<br/>support of the concerns that are being raised now because prior consultation on the Bill 
<br/>was not made with important bodies including the Pharmacy Student Association”.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a petition floating on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So what we have said in the 
<br/>past  quite  legitimately  that  some  of  these  laws  should  not  be  rushed.    In  fact  this  law  is  not  a 
<br/>Consequential Bill, it could have gone to the Committees, it could have gone to people and I have 
<br/>received a lot of messages since the Bill was tabled in Parliament from pharmacists concerned about 
<br/>what is likely to happen, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have talked about this before that the nature of law-making, the objective 
<br/>that is to be derived from a particular law, you know cannot be based on certain incidents or certain 
<br/>deviations from good practices that might have been there before.  Laws need to be very carefully 
<br/>considered and consulted with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the FNPF, Mr. Speaker, in fact what this Bill should have done was to have or should 
<br/>have restored the contribution of eight and 10 percent, eight for the employees and 10 percent for the 
<br/>employers.  In fact, we might be the only country in the world during the pandemic where the workers 
<br/>of  this  country  subsidised  the  employers.  The  workers  were  helping  the  employers  during  the 
<br/>pandemic and they are still helping until we restore the full contribution of 8 percent to 10 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  biggest  beneficiary,  Sir,  of  this  policy  was  the  Government,  and  the  employees 
<br/></span><span>themselves, not only they were contributing, they were forgoing 5 percent and now they will still 
<br/></span><span>forgo 3 percent from the employers and 1 percent from their own salaries.  Not only were they helping 
<br/>themselves by taking a 3 percent cut on their FNPF contribution but they were also taking a cut of 5 
<br/>percent out of the 10 percent from the employers to help the employers and to help the Government 
<br/>which was the biggest beneficiary and if you extrapolate this, I mean we know Mr. Speaker, that a 
<br/>large majority of the workers in this country do not accumulate big balances by the time they reach 
<br/>55 - a very small percentage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even if someone, Mr. Speaker, earns $20,000, even now, if they are earning between $15,000 
<br/>to $20,000, they could be losing $600 to $800 a year in their retirement funds.  Forget  about the 
<br/>interest that they would have lost on the contribution, so I am very surprised Mr. Speaker, why the 
<br/>Minister for Economy still thinks that you know after we are experiencing the so-called Bula Boom, 
<br/>you know we are projecting a 12.4 percent recovery in the economy.  Why are we not restoring the 
<br/>full FNPF contribution from the employers?  Why are we still asking employees to use one percent 
<br/>of their contribution?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is because many people in this country, and I know many people, many 
<br/>civil servants who retire at 55 do not accumulate the kind of savings that would be required to pay 
<br/></span><span>off their mortgage, some of them still have mortgages when turn 55.  I met a school principal.  He 
<br/></span><span>said, “I have two kids, both of them are not married.  One is working, one is still studying.”  He has 
<br/>retired and the FNPF pension is probably not enough or if he withdraws the full amount, it is probably 
<br/>not enough to cater for his or her own sustainable living over the next several years, so I would urge 
<br/>the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  to,  please,  make  the  amendment  now  or  we  can  make  the 
<br/>amendment to restore 8 percent and 10 percent because it is not right now.  I know they were arguing 
<br/>about helping the employers and all that but we were asking the employees to help our employers. They 
<br/>can argue at least, they had their jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I mean, all those arguments we can understand, even at that time but why now? Why are we not 
<br/>restoring the full amount?  So, I urge the Government to consider this seriously because the low income 
<br/>people with low wage earners families, Mr. Speaker that is their only source of savings that they probably 
<br/>rely on that they hope that would be there when they retire so this is not right.  We need to restore the 
<br/>amount as soon as we can.

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- I fully support the motions before Parliament,  specifically I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be talking about the two: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pharmacy Profession (Amended) Bill; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Medicinal Product (Amendment) Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would like to again read first on the two and then make comments in general about what 
<br/>this Government and the Government of the honourable Ratu Voreqe Bainimarama is wanting to do, as 
<br/>we move forward in our progression. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Pharmacy Profession Act, as we have heard from the honourable Minister for Economy, 
<br/>the Bill seeks to transfer the role of approving pharmacy businesses and premises to conduct the business 
<br/>from the Fiji Pharmacy Profession Board to the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission. Nothing 
<br/>to do with the regulations around their qualification, competency, the standards of a pharmacist nothing 
<br/>to do with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There you go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- It just a business part of it.  The Board at the moment decides 
<br/></span><span>when will the  retail pharmacy opens and the member is anticipate to expedite the process for approving 
<br/>pharmacist and improving access to medicine by our customers and patients.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Economy has talked about how at the moment, there is no private 
<br/>pharmacy in small towns. There was a particular case and I want to bring it again the case in Rotuma. In 
<br/>Rotuma, a private pharmacy wanted to open but a board member booked that spot and by booking at that 
<br/>spot, that pharmacist was not able to open in Rotuma. We have Nabouwalu, Korovou, Rakiraki and many 
<br/>small towns, for example in Seaqaqa where pharmacist can actually open but because of the nature of 
<br/>gatekeeping that the board is doing at the moment, that is not going to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also  provision  in  the  new  amendment  to  allow  General  Practitioners  and  Dental 
<br/>Practitioners engaged under the Public Private Partnership Scheme to  dispense  a  24 hours supply  of 
<br/>medicines to patients who visit that place at odd hours where the nearest pharmacy may be unable to 
<br/>provide the service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Dr. Lalabalavu and again, he has a conflict of interest because he is a General 
<br/>Practitioner  himself,  so  do  not  talk  about  honourable  Alvick  only.    He  also  has  it.    He  is  a  General 
<br/></span><span>Practitioner. He will actually benefit from this because the way it is at the moment, when you go to the 
<br/></span><span>Emergency Department in Nausori at 3.00 o’clock in the morning, the pharmacy is not open. If the Doctor 
<br/>looks after you and you are well, he gives you panadol and flucloxacillin from their cupboard to cover 
<br/>you until the pharmacy opens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not doing something new.  It is precedent and it is already been done. When you go, for 
<br/>example, to Korovisilou, someone gets an accident in the middle of the night with a small cut and they 
<br/>came there and had a stitch, the doctor gave them some panadol and antibiotics and told them “please go 
<br/>home and rest.  Tomorrow morning, go to the nearest pharmacy and pick up your medicine”.  That is the 
<br/>way it is, it is happening in public practice, we are just aligning it into general practice.  You know that, 
<br/>honourable Dr. Lalabalavu knows that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this improves the reach and access to medicines at any time a patient seeks 
<br/>medical or dental care, irrespective whether they are in the GP Subsidy Scheme with Government or not.  
<br/>If you go to a GP in the middle of the night, you need medicines, you are given medicines.  You do not 
<br/>go home without a medicine because no pharmacy is opened.  It happens in the health centres, hospitals 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why should it not happen in general practice?  The way the law is designed at the moment, it prohibits 
<br/>the general practitioner from giving medicines to them after hours.  They do it (I am telling you this) 
<br/>because the patient needs it but it is illegal.  We are trying to protect them also because they are doing 
<br/>something to save a patient’s life in the middle of the night. That is what this is all about.  There is nothing 
<br/>mysterious, no conspiracy, honourable Professor Prasad and the problem is, you are reading something 
<br/>that someone has written for you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have General Practitioners on the General Practitioners (GP) Subsidy Scheme and General 
<br/>Practitioners who are not on the Scheme, who will both benefit from it.  If the honourable Dr. Lalabalavu 
<br/>is on the Scheme, he benefits, if he is not on the Scheme, he still benefits.  I know for sure, he will give 
<br/>medicines in the middle of the night.  Yes or no, see he is laughing, he gives medicines because patients 
<br/>need it, to be able to save their lives.  Does he have to wait till the morning, of course not!  It is a lifesaving 
<br/>medicine, this is to be able to protect that practice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  seeks  to  allow  a  registered  pharmacist    to  expand  his  or  her  service  wherever 
<br/>pharmacy’s service is needed by increasing the number of pharmacies.  A pharmacist can own up to five 
<br/>pharmacies.  This improves the reach, accessibility or medicines to the general public providing more 
<br/>options to access affordable medicines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Medicine Products (Amendment) Bill, the Bill seeks to transfer the role 
<br/>of  licensing  of  importers,  wholesalers  and  pharmacists  which  import,  distribute  or  retail  medicinal 
<br/>products from the Fiji Medicinal Products Board to the FCCC.  It has nothing to do with the quality of 
<br/>the product, the quality and the regulatory part of the products still remain with the Board.  All FCCC is 
<br/>doing is the business part of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been working with FCCC throughout COVID-19.  The COVID-19 
<br/>safe measures that we were doing with the return to the new normal way where you had to go to the bank 
<br/>and  you have to make sure that  you mask up and you did physical distancing, where we had people 
<br/>coming in and making sure that your business was ready to be able to protect itself from COVID-19. That 
<br/>was  being  done  for  us  by  FCCC.  Was  it  the  doctors,  health  inspectors  or  nurses  going  to  check  the 
<br/>businesses?  It was FCCC doing it for us, we worked very well with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are not being asked to check if this is flucloxacillin or amoxicillin that is the part of the 
<br/>Board.  They are not being asked to check whether this is a real pharmacist or not, that is the Board’s 
<br/>function.  That still remains the Board’s function, just like the Fiji Medical and Dental Practitioners Act, 
<br/>their role is to make sure whether the doctor is a real doctor or is not a doctor that remains with them.  
<br/></span><span>Just like the Allied Health Councils Act, to see whether someone is a physiotherapist or health inspector 
<br/></span><span>that still remains with them.  The only thing that is changing here is the business component of it because 
<br/>we want all Fijians to have access, whether you are in Nabouwalu or Seaqaqa or in the middle of the 
<br/>night and you need medicine, you will get medicine.  That is what this Government is trying to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a very short contribution to Bill No. 41 on the 
<br/>amendment.  On 32A, I note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the burden of proof of the concentration level, if it 
<br/>exceeds 1 percent, it moves to the person.  This is what it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That the plant is cannabis and that the </span><span>Tetrahydrocannabinol </span><span>concentration exceeds 1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent until the contrary is proved by the person.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, even if it is less than 1 percent, what we need clarity here is how the person is expected to 
<br/>prove that because the testing, I believe, is done here at Koronivia and at the Fiji Police Force.  We know 
<br/>when cannabis gets confiscated, it is in the exhibit room.  How then does the offender and the Legal 
<br/>Counsel have access to that for testing? Normally, all testing apparatus is regulated and approved, how 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do we get access to that; so that we know when we are testing, it is tested on an apparatus that is also 
<br/>approved by the Court and also by law.  How private citizens is expected to access a confiscated plant 
<br/>that is in the hands of the Police?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my contribution towards Bills No. 43 
<br/>and 44, especially the two Bills that are going to have a huge positive impact on the Pharmaceutical 
<br/>Industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I do, I would actually declare my interest, as I am a Pharmacist and a 
<br/>pharmacy owner as well.  Just responding to honourable Professor Prasad, I would also like to declare 
<br/>my interest that when we amended the Bill back in 2018, the hospitals were allowed to open a pharmacy.  
<br/>I was the only pharmacy in Fiji that was going to be affected, still having Fiji at heart, I voted for that 
<br/>particular amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overnight, I lost at least a million dollars in revenue and this is what we say, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what we have when we say we have Fiji at our hearts that is the declaration, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for decades, registered pharmacists have been registered to own only two retail 
<br/></span><span>pharmacies.  While Pharmaceutical Industry around the world has evolved to be the leading economic 
<br/></span><span>sector in Fiji, the Pharmaceutical Industry is still restricted to day to day dispensing of medication.  The 
<br/>increase in the number of pharmacies that can be owned by registered pharmacists will not allow the 
<br/>pharmacists to expand their business.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having allowed the Pharmacists to open new pharmacies will allow them to 
<br/>capture a larger market share, thus giving more buying powers.  I do understand the sentiments of some 
<br/>pharmacists but the increase in the number will only allow a level playing field, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I have 
<br/>received numerous calls and messages from pharmacists around Fiji supporting the Bill and the new 
<br/>vision Government has for the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the same note, I request pharmacists not to use pharmacist students as a tool 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to promote their own personal agenda.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is not about you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The honourable Member is lying and saying that we are using 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am not referring to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I said to him that I was reading a petition that is on circulation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I am saying, I can also hold my phone over here  
<br/>and read what Reshnika sent 27 minutes ago. It says “Hi there, the Pharmacy Students Association is 
<br/>collecting signatures against the Bill in Parliament”. Yeah, so they are using pharmacist students.  You 
<br/>people have messed USP using students.  Please, do not enter FNU, keep the students out.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, they should keep the students out, please, and I will be explaining in my speech what the Board has 
<br/>in store for these students once they are actually get registered.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having pharmaceutical background and vested interest in the industry, I very 
<br/>well know what the issue is within the industry. The industry needs to unite and work together rather than 
<br/>being at the forefront in just objecting Government policies and also working against each other, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  The industry has not been able to come together to discuss professional fee commonly known 
<br/>as “dispensing fee”.  The industry still charges 49 cents VIP, compared to a flagfall of $1.52 to $2 when 
<br/>you are actually sitting in a taxi and get out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We call ourselves professionals over here, charging 49 cents as professional fee, just because 
<br/>there is no unity within the industry.  If a group of pharmacists are working together to open a chain of 
<br/>pharmacies it is not breaking the law - they are just working smartly.  Had it been illegal, the Pharmacy 
<br/>Profession Board would have been able to close them down for breaching the law.  They are just working 
<br/>smartly.  A group of five pharmacies come together - I open two, the others open two and altogether we 
<br/>are operating 10 pharmacies like that - there is nothing illegal about it.  The industry should have lobbied 
<br/>this way back, so that small players can have a level playing field.  But certain people in authority in the 
<br/>industry instead of thinking about smaller operators and empowering them, they were continuously trying 
<br/>to crack down on the bigger operators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a common saying that “If you are coming second in the race, we should focus on winning 
<br/></span><span>the race rather than focusing on how you can make the person who is leading, lose the race”.   This is the 
<br/></span><span>common attitude within the industry that needs to be changed.  The industry needs to think big and have 
<br/>a  bigger  vision.    Government  has  already  announced  tax  initiatives  if  pharmacies  want  to  go  into 
<br/>manufacturing through free tax zone.  Unfortunately, the pharmacists are still involved in just counting 
<br/>the pills behind the counter and serving the patient on day-to-day basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pharmacy  Board  and  the  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  Society,  the  only  recognised  body  to  the 
<br/>pharmacy  profession  Act,  needs  to  start  working  on  a  proactive  approach  rather  than  having  a 
<br/>retrospective approach.  In Ease of Doing Business we have been asking the Board to make it easy to do 
<br/>business in Fiji along with enhancing the profession, but it seems like it was falling on deaf ears.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Board and the Society needs to needs to look into rescheduling of medication from Schedule 
<br/>4 to Schedule 3, allowing pharmacies to prescribe certain medications and treating minor cases in Fiji, 
<br/>along with that, vaccinating people in the pharmacy.  The pharmaceutical industry around the world is 
<br/>changing.  Pharmacists are already prescribing certain antibiotics in Australia, England and New Zealand.  
<br/>Pharmaceutical industry and practice in Fiji needs to evolve as well.  We need to start doing this in Fiji 
<br/>and get into preparatory programme offered by the Government to assist Fijians.  This will remove the 
<br/>huge burden on the public hospital and health centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we see that lots of pharmacists are the owners of the retail pharmacies and it is 
<br/>very important that FNU should review its pharmacy programme and incorporate business management 
<br/>units the pharmacy programme.  A pharmacy graduate is not a business person.  Knowing that majority 
<br/>pharmacists in Fiji are venturing into business, FNU should train pharmacists as to how to operate and 
<br/>manage a business.  I know certain pharmacies that has taken them at least few generation to venture into 
<br/>five pharmacies.  Without naming anyone, a father opened the first one years ago and then years later, 
<br/>the son became a registered a pharmacist and expanded into four pharmacies and then when the younger 
<br/>brother became a registered pharmacist, they ventured into another one.  We all know that this is not 
<br/>smart way of doing business but, unfortunately, the law never allowed them to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am a pharmacy owner for a while.  I started it 12 years ago, but could not open or venture into 
<br/>any more branches as law never allowed me to open more than two pharmacies, so, the growth was 
<br/>restricted.  I also heard over the week that pharmacists who are not even business owners commenting 
<br/>that this Bill is here to just favour the bigger operators.  Those bigger operators are already big, we need 
<br/>to empower the small operators to become big.  Pharmacists who are commenting, trust me, the day when 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are an owner and face the hurdle to open more branches to increase your businesses and having a 
<br/>better  buying  power  to  compete  with  the  bigger  operators,  you  would  realise  how  important  this 
<br/>amendment is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to share my personal experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There was a time when I 
<br/>was single operator in Suva City in between the bigger operators.  I at first thought I would not be able to 
<br/>compete with the bigger operators, but I survived, having positive attitude towards doing business and I 
<br/>am still surviving and I am still running my pharmacies in Suva City.  On that same note, there was an 
<br/>amendment made to allow pharmacists to open more pharmacies in areas where there is a need of a 
<br/>pharmacy.  The problem with this was, if I have two pharmacies and I want to open a third one, for 
<br/>example, in Pacific Harbour.  Once I have done my feasibility studies, arranged for the space and start 
<br/>paying rent to secure the place, I write to inform the Board that I want to open a new pharmacy in order 
<br/>to service the people as there is no pharmacy in that area.  The irony with this is the Board will then 
<br/>advertise to see if there is anyone else who can express their interest to open a pharmacy in that same 
<br/>area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I as an owner of two pharmacies, I am being victimised and someone else can just come and open 
<br/>a pharmacy.  How is that justified, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  I know for a fact that a pharmacy operator went 
<br/></span><span>through this when he or she wanted to open a pharmacy in Korovou.  This is the very reason why Rotuma 
<br/></span><span>does not have a pharmacy today. I will give another example where certain guidelines were set by the 
<br/>Board that they would not allow young registered pharmacist to open a pharmacy for three years after 
<br/>getting registered Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I know some members tried to justified this but the basic fact is 
<br/>pharmacist  go  through  a  rigorous  internship  programme  and  sit  an  Australian  standard  exam  before 
<br/>getting their registration certificate to practice in retail pharmacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no mentorship programme after getting registered, this is a simple guideline stating that 
<br/>they need three years of experience to open a pharmacy.  No rationale behind it.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>is how they are going to treat the students whom they are using to sign on this petition. Once they get 
<br/>registered, they will be told by the same people that they need to practice for another three years under 
<br/>someone else before they can open a pharmacy.  In the pharmacy industry all ethical and legal binding is 
<br/>with the registered pharmacist on duty and not on the owner.  So, our young registered pharmacists can 
<br/>be taken to task under the two Acts governing the pharmacy industry while he or she is working for 
<br/>someone but the same pharmacists cannot own his or her own pharmacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  having  such  condition,  the  Board  was  putting  a  huge  question  mark  on  the  standard  and 
<br/>integrity of its own internship programme Mr. Speaker, Sir, so why have such a bureaucratic process?  
<br/></span><span>Now, that the licence will be provided by FCCC all these bureaucratic processes and obstacles shall be 
<br/></span><span>removed.  Having  moved the licensing process to  FCCC  will  give the  Board more time to  focus on 
<br/>enhancing  pharmacy  profession,  ethical  consideration  and  also  work  on  improving  the  system  with 
<br/>regards to the internship programme, as takes at least two to three years in certain cases for a pharmacist 
<br/>graduate to get registered.  Once the students graduate from the university, it takes them three years to 
<br/>get registered.  How is that justified, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I would like to reiterate to the young students who are signing this particular petition, the 
<br/>Board is independent, we cannot interfere with what they do but we have been asking the Board to work 
<br/>in line with the government policies and vision.  We have actually told the board now and then Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, had we any control over the Board as the Opposition is claiming, we would have actually 
<br/>brought this change but the Board is independent we do not interfere with the Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That also brings me to another issue where some pharmacy owners who sit on the Board would 
<br/>request for financials from pharmacy owners.  If I want to open a pharmacy, why should I be providing 
<br/>my financials to my competitor who is sitting on the board Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Having access to business

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financials can be abused.  Interesting thing is, Sir, that these Board members would not even excuse 
<br/>themselves from the meeting while they make a decision on a competitor’s application - again conflict of 
<br/>interest and breach of code of conduct.   Why does the Board want to see a financial and decide if a 
<br/>pharmacy will survive?  That risk is on the pharmacists willing to open a pharmacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, that is not the process.  That is the guideline that is set by the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Change that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It is not in the law, it is a guideline that is set by the members of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out a conversation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, systematic change was needed whereby the Board 
<br/>looks into the professional and ethical aspect, while the independent agencies look into the issuance of 
<br/></span><span>licences to operate a pharmacy.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I fully support the Bill.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief.  First of all, let me say that I support 
<br/>all the Bills that have been put before us, Sir.  Specifically I wanted to just talk about the amendment to 
<br/>the Pharmacy Profession Act.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pharmacy Profession Act actually protects the health 
<br/>and safety in relation to practices of pharmacies in Fiji.  I think we have heard quite comprehensively 
<br/>from honourable Maharaj that as time progresses, new concepts, new ideas are actually introduced to 
<br/>make  work  safer  and  easier  to  undertake  and  there  needs  to  be  a  shift  in  the  manner  in  which  the 
<br/>governments actually operate now, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, includes  changing the overall  policies  and regulatory  framework that  will 
<br/>improve these particular processes and procedures.  So, there is a point in time when there was a need to 
<br/>regulate and restrict the number of pharmacies a registered pharmacist could operate, however, today, 
<br/>honourable Speaker, the regulation has led to restriction in the service that is provided to the people of 
<br/>Fiji.  Therefore, an increase in the number of pharmacies that registered pharmacists can operate to five 
<br/>is allowing the pharmacy operators to reach out to areas which need a pharmacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an investor, pharmacists are in a position to reinvest in different regions in Fiji, so whilst 
<br/></span><span>opening this segment, Mr. Speaker, we are also removing the power that certain pharmacy operators have 
<br/></span><span>in terms of limiting operating hours and services that they have actually provided to the people of Fiji.   
<br/>This is why we are ensuring that such practices and market power is monitored by the appropriate and 
<br/>rightly skilled organisation.  The transfer of the business and the market regulation responsibility from 
<br/>that Pharmacy Profession Board to the FCCC is a timely and a correct move, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FCCC is the appropriate agency that regulates and monitors the anti-competitive behaviour 
<br/>of corporates and the amendments have created a clear demarcation, Mr. Speaker, of roles and removes 
<br/>any provisions that are irrelevant to maintaining standard of the services provided.  FCCC through the 
<br/>respective provisions of the FCCC Act on restrictive trade practices and consumer protection will actually 
<br/>ensure accountability and transparency in the industry.  By removing business-related aspects from the 
<br/>Board, it will allow the Board to focus on professional standards in the sector and concentrate on how to 
<br/>fill the current gap in the skills.  There are currently 91 registered pharmacists and over 77 pharmacies 
<br/>operating in Fiji and for these pharmacies to operate extended hours, Fiji actually needs 154 registered 
<br/>pharmacists.

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Skilled  Professionals  Evaluation  Committee,  under  the  Registration  of 
<br/>Skilled  Professionals  Act  2016,  has  established  over  the  years  that  there  is  a  skills  gap  in  the 
<br/>pharmaceutical sector especially of qualified pharmacists.  We have been plugging this particular gap by 
<br/>allowing for temporary skills to enter and work in Fiji.  However, this is not a long-term solution but is a 
<br/>solution which we are using to build some local capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By allowing general and dental practitioners engaged under the PPP scheme to dispense only 
<br/>approved medicines, we are actually creating one-stop shop for our patients especially when they are 
<br/>visiting a doctor or a dentist in an area where there is no pharmacy or the pharmacy is not actually open.  
<br/>We want all Fijians to have access to the best services and by making these amendments to the Act, we 
<br/>are ensuring that the relevant regulatory agencies are focused on their specific responsibilities and are 
<br/>working to lift standards in the pharmacy sector, Sir.  I fully support the Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the five amendment Bills before the House and 
<br/>I will speak specifically on Bill 43 and 44 – both related to medicine.   Before doing that I would like to 
<br/>share  that  recently  (that  is  in  2020)  when  I  was  in  Korovou  having  a  public  consultation  with  the 
<br/>community there, they specifically raised their concerns and requested for assistance and they requested 
<br/>for a pharmacy to be set up in Korovou as well as a private medical practice.  This was reported by the 
<br/></span><span>media and when this information came out in the media, a pharmacist very much interested in opening 
<br/></span><span>a pharmacy in Korovou secured a place. She put in her application. Her application was rejected by 
<br/>the board. Till today, people of Korovou are denied having a pharmacy just because it was left to the 
<br/>board to make this decision and that is why these two legislations are so important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These two amendment legislations are specifically from consumer perspective, giving choice 
<br/>to the people.  We have also come across cases where people have to walk or drive place to place 
<br/>looking  for  a  particular  medicine.  They  are  not  able  to  find  those  medicines  because  there  is  no 
<br/>competition.  It is a very restrictive business and by opening up and giving this regulatory aspect of 
<br/>the business to FCCC will definitely improve the availability of medicine and of course it will deal 
<br/>with anticompetitive behaviour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the board is the judge jury and the executioner. They do all 
<br/>three  roles.    We  need  separation  of  powers  and  by  putting  FCCC  to  look  at  the  anti-competitive 
<br/>behaviour  that  will  definitely  improve  this  particular  profession.    It  is  an  essential  service  but 
<br/>currently  it  is  not  operating  as  an  essential  service.    We  have  seen  that  mainly  the  small  growth 
<br/>centres as mentioned earlier on like Rotuma, Korovou and other places, people of these areas are 
<br/>denied of essential service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And coming back to honourable Professor Prasad, let me just say it is not about politics. It is 
<br/>about people. They need this service. We need to amend this legislation and you are not supporting 
<br/>this Bill. What you are trying to say is that the people of Korovou and Rotuma should never have a 
<br/>pharmacy. That is what you are saying whereas the Government here is trying to open up so that all 
<br/>these people can have a pharmacy and they can take care of their health. Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we 
<br/>support the Bill before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Since the two speakers on my list are not present in the House, I give the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor to the honourable Attorney-General for his Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I would just like to pick up on what the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Education said about honourable Professor Prasad.  He did politicise it because he started to talk 
<br/>about who are pharmacists or the families that gave donation to FijiFirst, that is, politicising issue. It 
<br/>has got nothing to do with He got nothing to do with donations, it has actually to do with people, Sir. 
<br/>It  has  to  do  with  creating  a  level  playing  field.  It  has  to  do  with  the  fact  they  want  to  create  a 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2025 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>competitive market and through competition we will be able to provide services to members of the 
<br/>public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to reiterate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I said earlier on in respect of the first Bill to do with 
<br/>pharmacies,  it  says  and  I  said  in  my  introduction  that  the  board  will  continue  to  regulate  the 
<br/>professional standards of pharmacies.  Every pharmacy will need to be registered with the board, we 
<br/>will still need to meet the qualifications and training required by the board in order to practice and 
<br/>we will still be subject to investigations and discipline proceedings where misconduct is alleged. The 
<br/>board’s role in regulating the profession will continue as it is the board’s mandate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is only the business arm of it where there is anti-competitive behaviour, which we have 
<br/>already seen, demonstrated a number of times by the previous speakers, that will in fact move across 
<br/>to  FCCC.    Similarly,  Sir,  with  the  second  Bill  regarding  the  board  itself,  the  board  will  still  be 
<br/>responsible for registering all medicinal products, poisons and devices under Part 7 to Part 10 of the 
<br/>Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If a medicinal product has been registered by the board, it can be then imported and dealt 
<br/>with.  The Minister which is the Minister for Health and the board may then work together under 
<br/></span><span>Section  34  of  the  Act  to  prescribe  the  conditions  for  the  importation  of  these  products.  This  will 
<br/></span><span>include the special prescription and record keeping procedures. This role of the board continues and 
<br/>we are not proposing that this be changed, this is because we recognise the board has the expertise to 
<br/>vet what medicines and drugs can be imported and dealt with and under what conditions can you 
<br/>keep in your pharmacies, there are certain medicines you have to keep in a separate box, not with the 
<br/>other drugs.   When all those conditions have been set aside, then it becomes the business side of 
<br/>things and the business side of things then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once those things are established then 
<br/>FCCC can do that.  Because at the moment, that same Board is then saying to various pharmacies, 
<br/>no you cannot do it.  They do not necessarily give a reason as honourable Minister for Education 
<br/>highlighted, it is very anti-competitive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I just wanted to also highlight is that, we had in fact said it 
<br/>during the Budget and the honourable Minister for Health has already said what the list of medicines 
<br/>that the doctors can issue at night time are; amoxicillin capsules, flucloxacillin capsules, ibuprofen 
<br/>tablets, paracetamol, Oral Rehydration Salt (ORS).  These are the ones that they can do so and the 
<br/>dentist also can issue, for example, pain killers, ibuprofen tablets and paracetamol; that is what is 
<br/>issued.  The reason why I have got it under the PPP scheme is because we are actually paying for 
<br/>those medical services.  If honourable Dr. Lalabalavu is not in the scheme, please, join the scheme 
<br/></span><span>because then you can also be able to issue these drugs and that is what this provision caters for in the 
<br/></span><span>particular Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue I just wanted to highlight again and I echo the sentiments. I again want to 
<br/>publicly acknowledge that the previous amendment actually resulted and he was the only one who 
<br/>got affected - honourable Maharaj.  He got booted out of Dr. De Asa’s Surgery, which is where he 
<br/>was and then we allowed hospitals to have their own pharmacy setup, he lost his pharmacy there.  He 
<br/>is the only one who suffered, but he still voted for the Bill.  For others to think otherwise that we 
<br/>present these Bills and these amendments to the law, simply because we have individuals who we 
<br/>want  to  cater  for  is  completely  nonsensical.    I  actually  acknowledge  him  for  that,  but  he  has 
<br/>persevered, he has got other business ventures now where he is doing distribution of medicine, et 
<br/>cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here we are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where we have, for example, students are currently being used 
<br/>by these people and the lady’s name has been highlighted, Reshnika.  She is the one who has been 
<br/>going around doing this.  These students do not know what they are signing up to.  They are being

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>told, “You will not be able to set up business”, but the logic is this, if we have more pharmacies 
<br/>throughout Fiji, what does that mean?  Those pharmacies need to be run by registered pharmacists, 
<br/>in other words, these students will have more jobs available for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there are more pharmacies going to be in Kadavu, Rotuma, Lau, Ovalau and everywhere 
<br/>else  in  Taveuni,  who  will  have  to  run  them?   Registered  pharmacists.    Where  will  the  registered 
<br/>pharmacists come from?  From the pharmacy school who are currently signing this petition because 
<br/>these people who are already in the business, are actually telling them to sign it. They are being given 
<br/>misinformation.  My appeal to the students is, please do not listen to these people. Look at the long-
<br/>term, what does this do for you?  It actually gives you the opportunity to get a job or better opportunity 
<br/>to set up more businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wish to make in this respect, the last point regarding 
<br/>pharmacies  is  that  as  honourable  Minister  for  Education  highlighted,  currently  you  can  go  to  a 
<br/>number of pharmacies in a day where they will not have certain drugs.  They simply will not have it 
<br/>because there is not enough competition, they are not really interested in what the range of medicine 
<br/>products  needs  to  be  available so they restrict themselves and they  do  not  do the  actual business 
<br/>investments themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Seniloli  raised  the  issue  about  the  Telecommunications 
<br/>Development Trust Fund.  It is actually established under Regulation (4) of the Telecommunications 
<br/>Trust Fund Regulations 2016, it gets audited that is why it is there, the account is held publicly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Waqanika, I am glad that she corrected herself when I pointed 
<br/>out to here that the burden of proof is reversed when you claim that you have less than 1 percent.  At 
<br/>the moment, the law is such, what the police actually does, they test the plants which is suspected to 
<br/>be  cannabis,  they  do  not  have  to  say  1  percent,  10  percent,  15  percent  or  Tetrahydrocannabinol 
<br/>(THC), they simply have to prove that it is cannabis, that is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now we are given an opportunity to a person who may be arrested for this particular offence 
<br/>that if you are saying that it is not actually cannabis, but is in fact industrial hemp, then you can go 
<br/>and prove it yourself, the burden of proof is on you.  At the moment, the law is very simple, very 
<br/>archaic; cannabis in, you have committed an offence.  But what we are saying now, if it is a THC 
<br/>level less than 1 percent, agriculture is available, police are available, it does not mean that they will 
<br/>not be able to access that, they can access that.  They have lawyers, whether it is legal aid or any 
<br/>other lawyer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  the  burden  of  proof  is  changed  in  that  perspective,  it  is  the  burden  of  proof  of  the 
<br/>prosecution to prove that you have actually committed an offence under this specific Act.  But then 
<br/>now  we  have  got  an  additional  leg  where  it  gives  the  person  who  is  being  arrested,  or  is  being 
<br/>prosecuted I should say, to say “look, if you think that it is less than 1 percent, you prove it to us and 
<br/>then the burden of proof is on you and therefore in fact that is a defence now.”  Previously, as you 
<br/>know, possession there is no defence.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the comments in respect of this 
<br/>amendment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One last one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad, I do not know where he gets his 
<br/>logic from.  He is saying that the employers are subsiding their employees. They are not subsiding, 
<br/>in fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, .… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Employees are subsiding the employers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2027 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sorry, thank you for that.  He said that the employees are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subsiding the employers.  Does not make any logical sense?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Sir, during COVID-19 when we had about 110,000 Fijians who lost their lost jobs, a 
<br/>lot of people said, “We do not want to contribute 8 percent, we want more money”.  In fact, a lot of 
<br/>submissions were received from members on the public saying, “do not deduct our FNPF at all, we 
<br/>want all the cash, we do not care about the savings at this point in time, we just want the cash now 
<br/>because we have live day to day. I used to work five days a week, now I am working only two days 
<br/>a week, I need more cash”.  Some employers were also saying, “if you continue to give us this 10 
<br/>percent deduction then we will find it very hard”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has to remember nearly 60 percent of the businesses in Fiji are MSMEs. They are not 
<br/>large, not everyone is a large employer - five people here, seven people there, three people there. 
<br/>Those businesses need to survive also.  The tyre repair shop, someone has got a small canteen, small 
<br/>bread outlet, et cetera, they have to survive also. So we reached a comprise.  We said, “okay, we will 
<br/>continue  to  do  superannuation  deduction  or  FNPF  deduction;  5-5.”  The  employers  wanted  less 
<br/>deduction, the employees wanted less deduction. In that way a lot of people still had their jobs, they 
<br/>still were able to cling on to it.  We reduced the cost of business, we put more dollars, whether it is a 
<br/></span><span>$1.50, whether it is $10 into the pockets of the employees.  He forgets to think about that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and then of course, we increased it from 5 percent to 6 percent. Now, we 
<br/>are saying it is going to go 7 percent. He also forgets that this is the only Government that said that 
<br/>the employer deduction should be more than the employee deduction. Before it used to be 6-6 percent, 
<br/>7-7 percent, 8-8 percent, 9-9 percent or whatever it was.  We are the ones, Sir, who said “employees 
<br/>contribute 8 percent and employers contribute 10 percent.”  When you go to other countries, you go 
<br/>to  Singapore,  the  actual  employers  pay  far  less  than  the  employees.  I  think  in  Singapore  it  is  18 
<br/>percent or 10 percent; that is the combination. In fact the superannuation deduction in Singapore is 
<br/>more than 30 percent altogether combined.  That is why there are very high levels of savings, they 
<br/>have done it since 1960s; very high level of deduction but the employees deduction is far more than 
<br/>the employers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  inform  Parliament,  there  are  already  employers  who  are 
<br/>deducting  10  percent.  If  he  wanted  to  be  honest  about  it,  if  you  see  the  law,  Sir,  in  the  previous 
<br/>Budget, we said that any employer that contributes more than the mandatory 5 percent or 6 percent 
<br/>and now 7 percent from January and pay up to 10 percent, we give them a tax deduction, we will 
<br/>help them; you pay 10 percent instead of the 7 percent from January, for that 3 percent we give you 
<br/></span><span>a tax deduction.  A lot of employers are already paying 10 percent, in fact some of them are not even 
<br/></span><span>claiming the tax deduction.  So again, if you go out and really talk to the right people and want to 
<br/>ascertain the correct information, you will know that a lot of people are already doing that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the points that I wanted to make in FNPF, I think they did not 
<br/>mention the other positive aspects about the sole nominee, et cetera is there to essentially protect 
<br/>them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  are  the  comments  I  have  and  also  the  responses  in  respect  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>matters that have been raised by members from the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.  There are two Members 
<br/>voting by virtual means, the honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterway and Environment and
