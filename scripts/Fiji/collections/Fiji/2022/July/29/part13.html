<h3>CONSIDERATION OF BILLS</h3>
<div><span>CONSIDERATION OF BILLS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on Tuesday, 26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the following Bills be debated and voted upon and be passed - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Media Industry Development (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 45/2022); and  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Water Authority of Fiji (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 46/2022).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, on the first Bill which is Bill No. 
<br/>45 of 2022 under the Media Industry Development Act (MIDA), it provides for amongst other things 
<br/>the regulation and registration of media organisations in Fiji.  Under Section 33 of the Act, every 
<br/>media organisation that provides or intends to provide media services in Fiji must be registered under 
<br/>the Act.  The media organisation is registered on the proprietors of the media organisation deposited 
<br/>with  the  Media  Industry  Development  Authority  duly  sworn  and  sign  affidavit  or  affidavits 
<br/>containing the required information as specified under the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 38 of the Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides that in the case of a company, all directors 
<br/></span><span>of the media organisations must be Fijian citizens, permanently residing in Fiji.  In the case of any 
<br/></span><span>other legal entity, the person or persons with analogous power in the media organisation must also 
<br/>be Fijian citizens permanently residing in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 38 of the Act Mr. Speaker, Sir, also provides the limits of beneficial ownership of 
<br/>shares in the company or any other interest in the nature of the ownership of the media organisation.  
<br/>Accordingly, up to 10 percent of the beneficial ownership or interest in the nature of ownership for 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2029 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  media  ownership  is  allowed  for  any  foreign  person  holding  such  shares  or  interest  while  90 
<br/>percent of any beneficial ownership of shares or any other interest in the nature of ownership of the 
<br/>media organisations must be owned by Fijian citizens permanently residing in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Media Industry Development (Budget Amendment) Bill 2022 seeks to 
<br/>amend  the  Act  to  ensure  that  those  who  are  directly  in  charge  of  a  media  organisation  and  its 
<br/>operations  are  shielded  from  any  outside  influence  that  may,  by  a  formal  agreement  or  other 
<br/>arrangement, essentially take over or control the provision of services that deal with the day-to-day 
<br/>operations of the media organisation including its finances, staffing, productions or publications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, for example Mr. Speaker, Sir, a media organisation maybe in compliance with Section 38 
<br/>of the Act which is the composition of ownership and being Fijians but may then circumvent this by 
<br/>essentially  allowing  a  foreign  company  or  any  other  person,  foreigner  to  carry  out  its  operations 
<br/>through a side arrangement or make decisions which can actually mean anything from what is being 
<br/>published, broadcast who is hired and who is financed.  Which in fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, gives them 
<br/>the power to run the organisation and we understand that it is actually happening already with one 
<br/>organisation where they have a company, that is now deciding that media organisation, how many 
<br/>journalists they will hire, how much they will pay them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of them Mr. Speaker, Sir, had people where they are paying their taxes, they are just 
<br/>bringing in staff, getting them to fill in the weekend supplements.  One of them was a pregnant lady 
<br/>just finished her maternity leave has been injured on site and these decisions are not being made by 
<br/>the media organisations or by the board of the organisation, are being made by another company, the 
<br/>directors of which does not reside in Fiji so they are actually circumventing the foreign ownership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I could remind honourable Members of this Parliament, in fact, people like Rupert Murdoch 
<br/>changed  his  citizenship  and  became  an  American  so  he  could  buy  media  organisations  to  be  in 
<br/>compliant with American laws which says only Americans could own those media organisations.  So 
<br/>it is not something peculiar to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember when this law was changed, that only majority of the shareholding, at least 90 
<br/>percent of the benefits of ownership should be Fijians and the moment some people raised heckles 
<br/>about this, we in fact reminded them to this particular story or incident and they all were quietened 
<br/>down.  There is nothing wrong in requiring in particular in a developing country that  your media 
<br/>organisation must be owned by Fijians.  They have an interest in the organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Media plays a very pivotal role of course in the development of any country, Sir, so essentially 
<br/></span><span>what this amendment seeks to do is to ensure that the actual day to day running of the organisation 
<br/>is  not  carried  out  by  some  other  entity  that  is  in  fact  not  registered  as  a  media  organisation  to 
<br/>circumvent the law, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  amends  the  Act  to  prohibit  a  media  organisation  from  entering  into  any 
<br/>agreement  which  allows  any  other  person  from  managing  the  affairs  or  operations  of  the  media 
<br/>organisations without the prior approval of the Authority.  This would ensure that control over media 
<br/>organisation remains with the media organisation.  More importantly the proposed amendment, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  would  prevent  a  person  from  circumventing  the  safeguards  of  media  organisations 
<br/>provided for under the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  amends  the  Act  to  require  media  organisations  to  notify  the 
<br/>Authority where any such agreement exists at this point in time and to provide those details of the 
<br/>agreement within the three days of the Act coming into force, Sir.

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  amendment  which  is  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  (Budget 
<br/>Amendment) Bill 2022, Bill No. 46 of 2022, Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) was promulgated in 
<br/>2007 to make provision for the effective management and administration of the water and wastewater 
<br/>systems in Fiji.  In fact, the law was formulated in 2006 and promulgated in 2007.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Section 37 of the Act,  Sir, the Authority  may institute and conduct  prosecutions in 
<br/>respect of offences alleged to have been committed against the Act itself subject to the powers of the 
<br/>Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), DPP does the prosecution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 36 of the Act  deals  with  offences of wilful  destruction of assets  of the Authority, 
<br/>obstruction, et cetera.  With the increased cases of wilful destruction, people just going and tampering 
<br/>with water pipes, damaging water pipes, interference with the assets of the Authority and other related 
<br/>offences, the Authority seeks to immediately penalise the alleged offender by issuing infringement 
<br/>notices as opposed to going through the long process.  It is like, if today you go and throw some litter 
<br/>out, there is a Litter Act and you get fined and in the same way for example, if I am speeding, I get 
<br/>what we call a Traffic Infringement Notice (TIN) and I have to pay the $90 or $40 or whatever the 
<br/>case is depending on how fast I am going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way if someone is going to go (honourable Seruiratu has got a water pipe and I 
<br/></span><span>go and sort of break it down, do a joinder and illegally take it into my property), WAF should be able 
<br/>to issue an infringement notice. Some of the examples of damaging and tampering, interfering with 
<br/>the  assets  of  Authority  are  illegal  connection  to  water  and  wastewater  systems,  storm  water 
<br/>connection to the Authority’s wastewater assets, water meter tampering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total cases from 2015 to June 2022 is 1,092 cases which costs the Authority approximately 
<br/>$425,000 for detection and rectification works.  Building over the Authority’s assets, we have water 
<br/>pipes, main water pipes going, people go and put something on top of it and discharging rubbish into 
<br/>manholes - wastewater management, people lift up the manholes they put their rubbish inside there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The inability of the Authority to expeditiously take action against the alleged offenders and 
<br/>to deter them from damaging its assets has resulted in the Authority incurring substantial costs in 
<br/>rectifying the damages to its assets and huge loss to its revenue.  This costs approximately half-a-
<br/>million dollars annually and include damages to water mains with varying sizes.  Damages to water 
<br/>meters,  damages  to  wastewater  infrastructure  such  as  manhole,  major  trunk  mains,  blockages  to 
<br/>wastewater pipes or mains.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an urgent need to provide for more efficient regulatory 
<br/></span><span>framework which allows for the issuance of infringement notices for offences committed under the 
<br/>Act or any subsidiary legislation made under the Act, Sir.  This streamlines enforcement measures.  
<br/>Additionally, Sir, instances of serious offences related to interfering Water Authority assets are mainly 
<br/>committed by companies.  A lot of companies do damage, not necessarily individuals.  The Bill seeks to 
<br/>provide for Director Office, office and liabilities for such offences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Section  42(3)  of  the  Act,  the  honourable  Minister  responsible  for 
<br/>infrastructure may make regulations to prescribe fines not exceeding $2,000 or imprisonment for a term 
<br/>not exceeding 12 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, to ensure the Authority’s assets are protected that there are severe 
<br/>penalties against the alleged offenders, it is pertinent through this Bill to amend the Act to allow the 
<br/>honourable Minister to make regulations prescribing fines in the case of a natural person not exceeding 
<br/>$10,000  imprisonment,  not  exceeding  two  years  or  both,  and  in  the  case  of  a  company,  fines  not 
<br/>exceeding $100,000.

<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2031 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have no issues really with the Bill on the Water Authority but I 
<br/>am seriously concerned, Sir, with respect to the media by the amendment Bill.  To me, it seems I was 
<br/>listening to the honourable Attorney-General very carefully as to the rationale and the objectives behind 
<br/>the Bill.  It is sort of convinced me more what I have been thinking since the Bill was put before this 
<br/>Parliament.  It is like adding salt to injury on top of the draconian Media Industry Development Act from 
<br/>a Decree to an Act, and we all know how that was done.  I think every journalist in this country knows 
<br/>what this Bill is about.  Let me try and share that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the honourable Attorney-General will say that I am trying to politicise this but this has to 
<br/>be said.  It seems to me that everything in Government is actually falling apart.  This Bill suggests that 
<br/>even it is a 10 year romance with the owner of the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>, C.J. Patel, even that is falling apart.  For years, 
<br/>Sir, the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> has been the FijiFirst Party’s biggest fan.  They call the honourable Prime Minister the 
<br/>messiah. They filled the pages with pictures of Government Ministers. They praised the Government for 
<br/>everything, even its mistakes. They talked about the FijiFirst Party and attacked the Opposition and we 
<br/>all know that they are a national joker.  They know it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2013, even the year before the formation of the FijiFirst Party, Sir, before the 2014 General 
<br/></span><span>Elections, I remembered one of the senior personnel within the </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span> during a panel discussion, I think 
<br/>it was World Media Freedom Day in May, declared that </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> actually supported the Government of 
<br/>the  day  at  that  time.    It  was  the  Bainimarama  Government  and  later  on  and  now  under  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution,  the  FijiFirst  Government.    When  the  same  Government  retained  power  in  the  2014 
<br/>Elections, that support was consolidated and it reached phenomenal heights for the last eight years, it 
<br/>literally seems that the sun rises and sets upon the command of the FijiFirst Government, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We should not forget, Mr. Speaker, that for more than a decade, </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> has enjoyed exclusive 
<br/>newspaper advertising from Government and we have raised this before. Advertising with Ministries, 
<br/>statutory organisations, even independent bodies for a while were directed it seems to do so.  Even now, 
<br/>some of them are exclusively advertised in </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span> I note that the Fijian Elections Office (FEO) does 
<br/>advertise in both newspapers.  Until now, Government has not disclosed the dollar value of advertising 
<br/>with the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> because it involves taxpayers’ money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know and I know that a lot of people out there know that the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> has 
<br/>become an embarrassment to the owners themselves; C J Patel &amp; Co. Ltd.  I know they must be worried 
<br/></span><span>about the reputation of the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> and its impact on the other businesses.  Obviously, they would be 
<br/></span><span>worried about the change of government and we know that C J Patel &amp; Co. Ltd is being rumoured around 
<br/>the place that he wants to sell </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> and they are really trying to disassociate with the paper being the 
<br/>owners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What it seems to me from this Bill is that, they have decided to sideline someone in the </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span>
<br/>maybe the Managing Editor News, whom everyone in Fiji knows is the FijiFirst Party’s number one 
<br/>cheerleader in the news media when that Managing Editor is not happy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- What about you, </span><span>Fiji Times? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Obviously, they would be running to the Government and to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the real motive behind this Bill (and I have the right to say that) is to ensure that some 
<br/>people who are running the </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span> including the Managing Editor News are shielded from any attempt 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the owners of the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> to ask someone else, maybe an experienced person in the news media to 
<br/>manage the </span><span>Fiji Sun.</span><span>  It seems to me for the Government that means losing control of the people in the 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> who do Government’s propaganda there, using taxpayers’ money.  What does the Government 
<br/>do?  They come to this Parliament and they want to pass the law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, they are saying if a media organisation wants to make an agreement with the Manager or 
<br/>anyone  else,  then  the  Media  Industry  Development  Authority  must  approve  it.    If  you  look  at  the 
<br/>commentary on the Bill, it is kind of laughable because I have just been reading a draft of the analysis of 
<br/>the Media Industry Development Act.  I think when that Report comes out, it is actually going to be quite 
<br/>a devastating commentary on the state of the Media Industry in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Paragraph 1.5, for example, in the commentary we were told its purpose is to shield the owners 
<br/>from any outside influence.  What is the truth?  The Bill is there to shield or protect one person or two 
<br/>people  in  the  </span><span>Fiji  Sun?</span><span>    Under  this  law,  when  the  </span><span>Fiji  Sun’s</span><span>  owners  tried  to  contract  with  the  new 
<br/>management company, they will have to go to the Media Industry Development Authority for approval 
<br/>and obviously, we all know the Media Industry Development Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at what is in the Act itself and the powers of the honourable Attorney-General, you 
<br/></span><span>can expect that if there is any hint, that those who might be contracted to manage </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> and if they are 
<br/></span><span>to have their own stance on what state of the media and what they want to do with Government advertising 
<br/>and Government propaganda, then obviously, they will not get the approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel that there is no need for this law change because it 
<br/>does not change the legal accountability of the owners of the media organisation.  It does not matter who 
<br/>manages the media organisation, it is the owners who must be accountable if the Managers breach the 
<br/>law; the owners still have to face the consequences.  If the Editor breaks the law or is deemed to have 
<br/>broken the law then the whole media organisation is responsible.  It only make sense if you try and analyse 
<br/>this Bill that is it there to protect some people within the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> or within that media organisation to 
<br/>equip that power within that group and be shielded from many attempt to change the stance they have 
<br/>right now with respect to how they deal with Government.  I feel that is the law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is 
<br/>what it is about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that, this law is not even a Budget Amendment and it is not 
<br/>a Consequential Bill.  I think if there is an overwhelming need or objective right now to amend this and 
<br/>to make it even more draconian.  Then what is it to the whole Media Industry Development Act?  This is 
<br/>not good for media freedom and media independence in this country, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that this law is really not about anyone, I think it is about the FijiFirst Party.  How they 
<br/>want to control certain media organisations. This Bill, in my view, Sir, is unnecessary, is misplaced and 
<br/>in fact, it should be withdrawn and this Parliament should not entertain this Bill at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity. I just like to 
<br/>thank everyone who are here, it is about 4.30 p.m. and it is Friday and I would like to thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy for all the Bills. I think there are 18 Consequential Bills that are being discussed 
<br/>today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the fact that we reflect back in the last four years, we had about six Budget 
<br/>Estimates, two are revised, given there are 18 Consequential Bills and we go over to the six we may have 
<br/>passed, given the average of 120 Consequential Bills and changes of law (it is amended).  Even most 
<br/>them have not gone outside for consultation, honourable Khaiyum and that is what we are saying.  I have 
<br/>asked honourable Naulumatua during midday today, “Are you going to speak?” She said “No, I have not 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consideration of Bills 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2033 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had the time to look into the Consequential Bills” so that is the problem we have on this side of the 
<br/>Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had complained over here a couple of days ago, in regards to the Bill on Water Authority. Thank 
<br/>you for the infringements.  He talks more on infringements whereby a company infringes on this, he has 
<br/>a $500,000 penalty and not exceeding 10 years.  If a person infringes this, he has about $20,000 penalty 
<br/>and a five years imprisonment.  I think the people should know in the changes of this Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji Act 2007.  If we had consultation and it comes over here then the public are made aware prior to 
<br/>come in here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we are going to change this, it is going back to them for consultation. It seems to be reversed 
<br/>but anyway, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stood up for Bill No. 45/2022.  I think most of the Opposition Members 
<br/>have spoken on many of the Consequential Bills and they come to detail.  Our input, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 
<br/>a credible input, people always say, “when you want to build a house, you build it on a rainy day because 
<br/>you can see leaks and cracks in there.” That is why we are talking to you, there are cracks in things you 
<br/>are  presenting  here.  It  is  not  personal  but  that  is  our  professional  and  credible  input  into  all  the 
<br/>Consequential Bills that have been placed in front of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution will be confined to Bill No. 45 of 2022 to amend the Media 
<br/></span><span>Industry Development Act 2010.  What is its relevance to the Budget?  I do not see any relevance of the 
<br/>Bill being part of the Consequential Bill and I therefore request the honourable Attorney-General to do 
<br/>the most honourable thing and consult with the stakeholders in the media industry.  The Bill is a direct 
<br/>attack on media freedom in Fiji.  How long will the FijiFirst Government continue to gag media freedom 
<br/>in Fiji?  Stop being selfish and stooping low to make a personal vendetta.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 8</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022, a decision by the Supervisor of Elections, Mr. Mohammed 
<br/>Saneem removed former honourable Nawaikula from the Voter Register on the grounds that he had not 
<br/>registered under the birth name.  Former honourable Nawaikula was forced to vacate his seat but was 
<br/>reinstated in August by Fiji’s Chief Justice, who criticised the Supervisor of Elections for extending his 
<br/>authority.  The honourable Attorney-General expressed frustration that the Government’s lawyers did not 
<br/>successfully defend the Supervisor of Election’s decision and the Solicitor-General was suspended and 
<br/>fired  in  November.    Following  the  former  honourable  Nawaikula’s  reinstatement,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government passed an amendment to the Electoral Act in September requiring citizens to use the names 
<br/>specified on their birth certificate on the voter registry and this has disproportionately affected women 
<br/>voters whose birth names differ from their marital names. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Member, we are on these two Bills and that has got nothing to do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with what you are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Let us be cautious on some key findings… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You strayed all over the place so stick to the Bills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Let us be cautious on some key findings of media freedom which has 
<br/>been deteriorating around the world over for the past decade.  In some of the most influential democracies 
<br/>in the world populous leaders have overseen concerted attempts to throttle the independence of the media 
<br/>sector.  While the threats to global media freedom are real and concerning in their own right, they impact 
<br/>on the state of democracy and that is what makes them truly dangerous.  Experience has shown, however, 
<br/>that  press  freedom  can be bound  from  even lengthy stints of repression  when  given the  opportunity.  
<br/>Honest  and  fact-based  journalism  can  never  be  extinguished.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  asking  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General again to please undertake wide consultation with all stakeholders in the 
<br/>media industry.  We reserve our support for this Bill and I thank you for your indulgence.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity, just to talk very briefly 
<br/>on the Bills.  Firstly, I was just reading the definition here that was shown to me on paranoia.  Paranoia 
<br/>is the feeling that you have been threatened in some way, such as people watching you or acting against 
<br/>you, even though there is no proof that that is true.  This is something that we see every time, if something 
<br/>is proposed from this side of Parliament.  There is this feeling that there is some huge conspiracy, paranoia 
<br/>and every time those sentiments have been expressed in this Parliament, they have been obliterated every 
<br/>time we have a response.  That is what we are seeing today - paranoia.  Get over it.  If there is a conspiracy 
<br/>by this side of Parliament, it is the conspiracy to do the best for the people of this country.  That is our 
<br/>conspiracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was trying to understand the issue with this Media Industry Development Bill.  I read this point 
<br/>there in the background (1.5) says that the Bill would ensure that those who are in charge of a media 
<br/>organisation and its operations are shielded from any outside influence that may, by formal agreement or 
<br/>other arrangement, essentially taking over control the provision of services that deals with the day-to-day 
<br/>operations of the media organisation, that is what we want.  That is what this Bill tries to do to make sure 
<br/>that there is transparency and freedom.  That is why I support Bill No. 45 of 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, to get to the Bill that I wanted to talk about which is on the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF).  
<br/></span><span>I welcome this particular Bill Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This year in my earlier address I talked about the WAF 
<br/></span><span>Budget, we have an increase in the WAF budget, there is a lot of good money that is being put into that 
<br/>WAF budget to address intermittent supply, to address the leakages and we have the $60 million that is 
<br/>being allocated for the Rewa River Water Scheme to try to address a lot of the problems.  But, one of the 
<br/>important things that we have while we are trying to address the problems with water, is to address these 
<br/>unnecessary issues which hamper the ability of Water Authority of Fiji to be able to supply water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Attorney-General has pointed out, there are a lot of things that go on that just 
<br/>hamper the ability of Water Authority of Fiji to carry out its role.  Some specific examples have shown, 
<br/>for instance, there was damage to a trunk main in Solovi by one of the developers in 2019 when they 
<br/>were carrying out civil works for a new subdivision.  The total damage was $20,000, that means the 
<br/>$20,000 that could have been used to help provide water, had to be used to address this particular problem.  
<br/>Mechanical faults to wastewater assets due to blocked pumps mostly caused by people littering into these 
<br/>pipes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2021,  in  one  year,  there  were  approximately  650  incidents  which  cost  the  Authority 
<br/>approximately $4,000 to identify and repair which comes to a total cost of $2.6 million.  When people do 
<br/>the wrong thing and they are not taken to task, these sorts of unnecessary thing means they take away the 
<br/></span><span>resources from the Water Authority of Fiji.  Damage to wastewater assets are approximately 200 incidents 
<br/></span><span>annually and the cost for this is around $2 million.  Damaged air valves costing $6,000 to $7,000, directly 
<br/>disposing litter  in the  Authority’s  wastewater system, cleaning the  sewers around  $2,000.  There  are 
<br/>approximately 680 cases of such offences in the Western Division alone and the cost of clearing of that 
<br/>is more than $1.3 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the kinds of issues that come up and then you have the illegal water connections.  In 
<br/>2015 – 189 cases, 2016 – 136 cases, 2017 – 208 cases, 2018 – 139 cases, 2019 – 101 cases - total number 
<br/>of cases from 2015 to 2022 amounts to 1,092 cases which cost the Authority approximately $425,000 for 
<br/>detection  and  rectification works.   Damage to our  water-mains  in  Foster Road in July  2022  cost the 
<br/>Authority $29,000 - money that could have been spent to try and address water issues has to be taken out 
<br/>to address these sorts of things.  Over and above this, as has been expressed in the past, Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji is an organisation which costs about $1.02 to get out a unit of water.  To produce a unit of water 
<br/>and bring it to the customer and the lowest level at which we charge water is 0.15 cents per unit. So, it is 
<br/>$1.02 here and it is charged this much.  There is obviously a need for us to be making sure that the money 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>that  has  been  given  to  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  is  used  to  distribute  the  water  and  to  address  the 
<br/>wastewater services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we welcome this because it will make sure that it gives some more ammunition to Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji to address these sorts of issues and hopefully to make sure that they can use the money 
<br/>that is given to Water Authority of Fiji to get water to people where it is needed, so I fully support this 
<br/>particular Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately in my last presentation of the 
<br/>Bills, there were couple of things I missed out which I would just like to state for the records.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it is to do with the Bills itself, honourable Tuisawau had mentioned that the debt for students is placing 
<br/>enormous burden on them, honourable Gavoka went on about someone selling their body.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just for the record Sir, no government prior to this government had offered free 
<br/>education from early childhood to Year 13.  No government had offered the scope, the type and the 
<br/>number of scholarships for toppers.  No government had offered in fact in a loan system.  As a result of 
<br/>that, Sir, today …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There was always a loan system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, there was not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- No, PSC had loan there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is PSC and it was only restricted under PSC.  I talked about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the extent and number of scholarships available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  point  is  that  we  are  paying  literally  close  to  $200  million  a  year  in 
<br/>scholarships.  There was never an amount to that amount, please, you know this.  Sir, the point is that 
<br/>today we find more girls in schools and high schools than ever before.  More females in universities than 
<br/>ever before.  Unfortunately they had talked about forgiving all the debt but they do not talk about the 
<br/>future.  Honourable Gavoka is saying we will forgive all the debt.  Tuisawau said that.  What about the 
<br/>future?  So when people say we will forgive the debt, what they are trying to do is appeal to the voters.  
<br/>Those people who have debts, saying we will forgive your debt, just vote for us and I am talking about 
<br/>the future.  There is no sustainability model that is being built into that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I just wanted to also clarify was the definition of resident.  What is the definition 
<br/></span><span>of resident?  The definition of “resident” under the Income Tax Act is someone who is domiciled  in Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>whether a Fijian citizen or not, for a period of 183 days out of 12 months and that is when you are actually 
<br/>deemed to be a resident in Fiji, Sir.  A capital gain  made by a resident person or Fijian citizen on disposal 
<br/>of shares of course held by before 1 May, 2011 -  that is caught under that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in respect of the matters that have been raised now regarding these two bills, I just wanted to 
<br/>very quickly highlight that this particular Bill, again contrary to what honourable Prasad is suggesting, he 
<br/>always thinks that every single Bill we bring before Parliament, there is some hidden agenda.  He never 
<br/>actually understands that there is a principled position taken and the principle in this is, as I highlighted 
<br/>Sir, about ensuring the principle that the ownership and control of the media organisation, is with Fijians.  
<br/>Simple!   That is  what it  is all  about  and  all we  are saying is that,  that  could be  circumvented by  an 
<br/>organisation, by individuals who are not registered as a media organisation or who are indeed foreigners.  
<br/>That is all there is to it.  It could be </span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>tomorrow, it could be </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> tomorrow, it could be </span><span>MaiTV</span><span>, 
<br/>it could be </span><span>FBC</span><span>, it could be anybody.  It is a principled position, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again he got his facts wrong and obviously he is talking to some people from 
<br/>whichever organisations or other lawyers whatever, CJ Patel does not own </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>.  CJ Patel is not a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shareholder of </span><span>Fiji Sun. </span><span> There are two individuals who own </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> - gentleman called Ashok Desai 
<br/>and a Mrs. Patel, who owns 85 percent.  Not CJ Patel, so he got his facts wrong.  The reason why he said 
<br/>CJ Patel, Sir, was because that was his narrative previously.  That because CJ Patel got to buy Fiji Dairy, 
<br/>in fact it was not CJ Patel, it was Southern Cross Foods, they got to buy it and that is why we are giving 
<br/>them all the money – it is a big whole conspiracy theory that he has got, Sir.  So he stands up on the floor 
<br/>of Parliament and says that CJ Patel is the owner of </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>.  CJ Patel is not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, and honourable Rasova, you are a nice guy outside Parliament but your level of contribution, 
<br/>actually  it  is  quite  lacking,  went  on  about  the  media  decree,  honourable  Nawaikula,  not  honourable 
<br/>anymore, now Niko Nawaikula, nothing to do with this.  Sir not a single journalist, has been prosecuted 
<br/>under MIDA.  Not a single media organisation has been prosecuted under MIDA for supposedly having 
<br/>editorial  problems  -  not  a  single  one.    Yet,  the  narrative  by  the  Opposition  in  particular  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad has been that this is a draconian Act.  If it was draconian Act, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it would have been used to stop nearly every publication of </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and CFL on a daily basis 
<br/>because of the level of bias that has been demonstrated by them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  he  had  bothered  to  look  at  the  Media  Industry  Development  Act,  the 
<br/>schedules, these schedules were borrowed directly from the Media Council that existed prior to MIDA 
<br/></span><span>that was made up of media organisations.  Code of Ethics, let me read that out, Sir, and see how many 
<br/></span><span>people would agree that all media organisations actually follow this.  It says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any reference to media organisations should include reference to any journalist, 
<br/>editor,  publisher,  producer  and  employee,  officer,  servant  or  agent  of  any  media 
<br/>organisation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is borrowed verbatim from the Media Council.  It says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1) Accuracy, balance and fairness 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Newspapers  and  magazines,  radio  and  television  broadcasting  organisations, 
<br/>websites and internet newsletters and journalists working for them shall report and 
<br/>interpret news and current affairs honestly. They shall aim to disclose all known 
<br/>relevant facts and shall take care and not to publish material which is inaccurate, 
<br/>misleading or distorted by wrong or improper emphasis or any other factor; 
<br/>If  a  significantly  inaccurate  misleading  or  distorted  statement  is  published  or 
<br/>broadcasted,  it  must  be  corrected  promptly  with  due  prominence  and  where 
<br/></span><span>appropriate an apology must be published or broadcast; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Media  organisations  must  distinguish  clearly  between  the  news,  comment, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Media organisations have a duty to be balanced and fair in their treatment of news 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and current affairs and their dealings with members of the public;

<br/>them and have an obligation to publish or broadcast without diluting the finding 
<br/>any adjudication or by the Media Tribunal or complaint made against them.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of these are all about how do you actually report children. They hear the 
<br/>standards  about  discrimination,  victims  in  sexual  cases;  is  this  draconian?    They  have  not  even 
<br/>bothered to read it, about sexual relations and conduct, crime, payment for articles, innocent relatives, 
<br/>religion,  strong  language,  grief  and  bereavement,  advertising,  personal  interest  and  influence, 
<br/>financial  journalism,  taste  and  decency,  impartiality  imbalance,  deceptive  practices,  interviews,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>See the media standards, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Media Standards, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 
<br/>United Kingdom (UK), see the media standards set in New Zealand.   He walked away from a radio 
<br/>interview and his mates in New Zealand ….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is the only comeback you have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  No,  no,  there  are  many  comebacks.    His  mates  in  New 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Zealand, Sir, lodged a complaint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are being selective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Listen to what I am saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His mates in New Zealand lodged a complaint with the media organisation. There is actually 
<br/>a media organisation there to deal with media complaints and they had their own findings.  Every 
<br/>country has this, that is the point. We have mechanisms to lodging complaints.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you see they are going about draconian penalties but not a single person has 
<br/>been  charged.    What  draconian  penalty?  He  cannot  even  point  out  to  me  what  are  the  draconian 
<br/>penalties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially, Sir, there was some amendments made to actually get rid of the 
<br/>culpability of journalists.  That has all been removed. I do not know what report he writing, some 
<br/>joker is probably writing that because of the influence by him.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you read the laws, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in countries like Samoa, there has been analysis.  They 
<br/>are saying it is draconian, depending on who is reading it, depending on the context but the proof is 
<br/>in the eating of the pudding. And the proof is that since the introduction of this Act, not a single 
<br/>journalist has been convicted, let alone prosecuted.  Let us move away from this narrative you have 
<br/>which is completely incorrect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the other point that I wanted to make is that honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad seems to have an obsession over Jyoti Pratibha, that is who he is referring to.  He first accused 
<br/>her of skirt journalism, he was berated for that and today he is now going on about.  I think there 
<br/>seems to be some kind of unrequited affection for her.  I do not know what this affection is, I really 
<br/>do not know.

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point is, he comes here, does all these metaphorical language and you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know I know this person, someone told me this because you are doing this for one person.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Jyoti  Pratibha  will  actually  may  resign  tomorrow  or  she  may  migrate 
<br/>tomorrow  but  this  is  an  important  piece  of  legislation.    We  do  not  make  laws,  in  the  same  way 
<br/>honourable Maharaj, when we made the amendment to the Pharmacy Profession Act, we did not do 
<br/>it, “oh, he is a member of our group therefore let us not do it.”  I know he was upset, but we did it for 
<br/>the good, on a principle basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, this is a principle approach.  If anyone independently assess the amendment 
<br/>that we have made, Sir, it is to do with the control of the media organisation.  They can do whatever 
<br/>they like.  Frankly, the way that Communications Fiji Limited (CFL) and Fiji Times Limited</span><span> </span><span>reports, 
<br/>they just blatantly do not report anything that we say positive.  The lead story will always start with 
<br/>them and they will come to us for comments just as the tick off on the box, we will make it right at 
<br/>the last paragraph, we are living with it.  We have not reported them, we are just living with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, Sir, we respond to their questions.  They are completely biased even the Editorial 
<br/>is biased, but we are living with it; let it be.  But he comes here, talks about media freedom but openly 
<br/>says here, “I do not respond to </span><span>FBC</span><span>, I do not respond to </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>”.  </span><span>Areh, </span><span>be a man! Respond, we 
<br/>respond to everyone, sometimes </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> will send us something at 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m. wanting a 
<br/>response and tick the box.  We stood there the other day and responded to everyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, getting back to the amendment, the amendment itself is about ensuring that 
<br/>the media organisation that is registered is in fact sticks to the spirit of the law.  The spirit of the law, 
<br/>Sir,  is  that  the  media  organisation  must  be  run  by  those  people  who  are  registered  to  run  the 
<br/>organisation.  It must not be run by any outside organisation that could not be registered as a media 
<br/>organisation or is foreign-based.  That is all they are used to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point about Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), I think honourable 
<br/>Usamate very succinctly summarised the issue and the point is, we need to protect WAF assets.  One 
<br/>of the issues that we found also that companies are breaching a lot of these, not individuals </span><span>per se,</span><span> a 
<br/>lot of companies.  Wastewater management is becoming a big issue in Fiji and we need to be able to 
<br/>ensure that for WAF to be able to carry out its job, in particular, wastewater, I mean we were in Nadi 
<br/></span><span>in fact the people from Narewa complained about the Navakai Wastewater Treatment Plant and how 
<br/></span><span>the smell comes around from the water treatment and these are real issues.  We have to address these 
<br/>issues  and  wastewater  management  will  become  a  lot  more  critical  in  particular  when  you  have 
<br/>densely  populated  areas  and  when  we  have  a  lot  more  development,  therefore  the  wastewater 
<br/>treatment systems of WAF needs to increase substantially. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot have people dumping stuff in it that they should not be dumping stuff into.  These 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provisions regarding the offences and indeed the penalties hopefully will become a deterrent, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will vote on the motion.  Two Members will be 
<br/>voting  virtually  -  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  and  the
