<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Minister for Agriculture, Waterways and Environment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has given notice to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 40. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister may speak for up to 20 minutes.  After the honourable Minister, I 
<br/>will then invite the Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the statement for no more 
<br/>than five minutes.  There will also be a response from the Leader of the National Federation Party 
<br/>or his designate, to also speak for five minutes.  There will be no other debate.

<div><span>Impact of Ministry of Agriculture’s Direct Initiatives to Farmers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to share with this 
<br/></span><span>august  Parliament  an  update  on  the  impact  of  direct  initiatives  implemented  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  years,  the  Ministry  through  its  capital  programmes  have  implemented  direct 
<br/>assistance for farmers through various incentives that ensures food and nutrition security, improved 
<br/>livelihood  by  employment  creation,  sustainable  income  generation  and  increased  export  income 
<br/>through enhanced production and consistent supply of agriculture produce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, guided by the 5-Year Ministry of Agriculture Strategic Plan aligned to the 
<br/>20-Year National Development Plan, the Ministry has implemented a series of programmes that 
<br/>will  ensure  creation  of  surplus  to  be  distributed  to  all  those  who  participated  in  this  process  of 
<br/>surplus creation by providing the various factors of production such as the landowners, farmers, 
<br/>labourers, households, financial sector and other input suppliers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our staff in the Ministry of Agriculture have worked extremely hard with 
<br/>farmers  to  expand  agriculture,  improve  efficiency  and  productivity,  build  resilience  and  raised 
<br/>output and export earnings to prioritise in certain activities such as land clearing, land preparation, 
<br/>provision  of  planting  material,  fencing  material,  supply  of  improved  variety  of  seeds,  supply  of 
<br/>improved breeds of livestock to farmers and establishment of critical based infrastructure such as 
<br/>establishment of farm roads or agricultural infrastructure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  this  financial  year,  the  Ministry  has  implemented  another  eight 
<br/>initiatives  to  scale  up  ongoing  programmes.  These  initiatives  include  support  to  women  in 
<br/>agriculture,  establishment  of  hydroponic  systems,  protected  agriculture,  irrigation  kits,  Orchard 
<br/>Development  Programme,  Small  Farming  Equipment  Programme,  Land  Clearing  Farming 
<br/>Programme and provision of fencing kits to livestock farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry also includes in this financial year, for the first 
<br/>time, a Commercial Farmers Equity Package (CFEP) to boost commercial agriculture development. 
<br/>This initiative and with collaboration of Fiji Development Bank for the first time, any farmers who 
<br/>want to take loan from FDB, let us say to construct  a warehouse or to buy a tractor or an excavator, 
<br/>the Ministry will contribute 20 percent of equity to the grant of that loan. For example, if the farmer 
<br/>wants to take $100,000 loan from FDB, the Ministry will provide $20,000 as an equity contribution 
<br/>and farmers does not have to pay upfront that particular deposit as a grant.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of today, seven commercial farmers have received their loan equity and 
<br/>they have drawn down money from FDB to establish their commercial venture.  For example, a 
<br/>farmer in Lautoka who have established a manufacturing plant to produce cassava flour and took 
<br/>out  a loan of close to  quarter million  dollars from  FDB and we have provided 20 percent  as an 
<br/>equity contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the above initiatives, to ensure transparency and accountability on the 
<br/>selection  of  recipients  considered,  we  considered  that  online  process  in  order  to  select  the 
<br/>appropriate beneficiaries in order to get them to apply.  The benefit of the online portal ensures that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everyone gets the opportunity to apply, no matter where they are, whether they are in 
<br/>Kadavu, Cicia, et cetera, as long as they have access to internet connection. 
<br/>the process of update is you enter the data on the online portal, the data immediately on 
<br/>real time is received at the Headquarters. 
<br/>application data is transferred without any delays.  Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you fill 
<br/>up an application form, you leave it with the Agriculture Extension Office then it goes to 
<br/>the Regional office and from there, it comes to the Head of that particular section, from 
<br/>there it goes to the Policy and Research Committee who will then set up the Committee. 
<br/>So in the process, applications were lost, et cetera, all these complaints have now been 
<br/>removed with this online system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, all these systems when the new technologies were introduced, 
<br/>there are certain issues and we dealt with them. For example, some farmers that do not access to 
<br/>internet, we ensured that our officers take the tablet down, get them to apply online or there are 
<br/>some officers who said that they do not know how to fill the application so they come to the nearest 
<br/>Agriculture Extension Office where they sat down and our officers will enter the data in the tablet 
<br/>and then it is submitted.  Sir, all this have been done to ensure efficiency and service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  year, as outlined above, we rolled out a number of programmes to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meet the strategic objectives of the Ministry:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span> 2.  
<br/>3.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ensure food and nutritional security for households; 
<br/>to expand commercial agriculture; and  
<br/>to bring in more and more export in tonne, and take advantage of the brand image of 
<br/>our products in the export market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to the ongoing natural disaster and the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we had accumulated a programme where we would provide and support the provisions of this input 
<br/>to  farmers  at  a  very  minimal  cost.  First  of  all,  to  deal  with  the  pandemic  and  the  fear  of  food 
<br/>insecurity, we provided seed packages to 238,599 households.  These packages consisted of five 
<br/>individual seeds, the basic vegetables, such as, eggplant, tomatoes, cabbages and beans, so different 
<br/>packages will have different combination of five seeds pack.  On an average, 9,000 households per 
<br/>year benefitted from 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, we had provided, in the farm response package, the planting materials to 
<br/></span><span>farmers to boost the production, whether they require for one acre, two acres or three acres.  The 
<br/></span><span>previous ones that I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the target group was households mostly in the 
<br/>urban areas who would want to do gardening behind or around their homes.  So, in that way, we 
<br/>were able to deal with lots of household members who lost their jobs and their food security was 
<br/>under  threat.    So,  we  really  mobilised  the  entire  urban  households  in  Fiji  and  got  them  to  start 
<br/></span><span>planting vegetables for their households. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Simultaneously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we mobilised the farmers to expand production so that in 
<br/>their own interest in the interest of raising additional income and to boost exports.  We were able 
<br/>to, in this period, over the last three  years, raise vegetable production at an average rate of 19.8 
<br/>percent, that is, the impact we are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  simultaneously,  in  the  same  period,  we  were  able  to  reduce  vegetable 
<br/>importation  by  2.6  percent  in  volume  and  3.2  percent  in  value.    While  we  were  expanding 
<br/>production for export, which I am going to come to in a second, we also simultaneously reduced 
<br/>importation of vegetables substantially and 3.2 percent in value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now talk about substantive crops that we are targeting. Mushroom 
<br/>production - we have noted that we have a niche market in mushroom production, there is a growing 
<br/>demand for mushroom by upper income households, tourism sector as well as export market.  We 
<br/>have to-date, trained 2,000 interested farmers in mushroom production, and we have established 
<br/>five  commercial  farmers  in  mushroom  production.    I  just  launched  one  commercial  mushroom 
<br/>production outlet in Votualevu, Nadi, and I must say, that we are quite pleased with the outcome in 
<br/>terms  of  production.    Over  the  last  three  years,  mushroom  production  have  increased  by  39.5 
<br/>percent, with the total volume at the moment of 20 metric tonnes.  Simultaneously, by doing that, 
<br/></span><span>we have reduced importation from 46 metric tonnes in 2020 to 32 metric tonnes in 2021, with the 
<br/></span><span>value of $325,000 in 2020 down to $299,000 in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, copra remains one of the most traded commodities in the country.  Fiji has 
<br/>around 10 million coconut trees scattered in areas of approximately 65,000 hectares.  Our challenge 
<br/>is  to  replace  some  of  those  senile  trees.    So,  currently,  25,000  farmers,  with  the  support  of  the 
<br/>Ministry,  are  replanting  and  replacing  the  existing  senile  trees.    We  are  distributing  planting 
<br/>materials also through the support of Fiji Copra Millers Limited to replace these senile trees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, copra  prices have  gone down substantially because of the competition.  
<br/>We are also expanding the establishment of coconut farms in the Western Division.  At the moment, 
<br/>when we talk about coconut farms or plantations, you will only see it in Cakaudrove in Taveuni.  
<br/>We want to establish coconut farms in the Western Division and take advantage of the increasing 
<br/>copra price in the export market.  We have got two dedicated research stations, the Mua Research 
<br/>Station  and  the  Dobuilevu  Research  Station  where  we  are  establishing  coconut  seed  nuts  for 
<br/>distribution to farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, we are doing extremely well from 2019 to 2021.  Fiji exported 
<br/>to New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia and other Pacific Island Countries fresh coconuts and coconut 
<br/>products worth $14.8 million, which is supported by 9 percent growth in the coconut industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other very important crop is rice, not for export purpose, but to reduce 
<br/>importation, increase our self-sufficiency and ensure that we are in control of our key staple food 
<br/>produce.  Rice has now become a staple diet in every Fijian household, unlike 30 or 40 years ago.  
<br/>Under our ‘We Rice Up’ Programme, we have supported farmers in the sugar industry by asking 
<br/>them to plant at least one acre of rice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are expanding production in the Western Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I must say that 
<br/>from 2019, we have made substantial inroads in increasing production.  We have raised our self-
<br/>sufficiency from 15 percent in 2019 to 17.5 percent in 2021, and for the volume of production this 
<br/>year, I have a feeling we would reach 22 percent of self-sufficiency by the end of this year, Sir.  At 
<br/>the same time, we are reducing the rice importation bill.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to other key important crops, there is an increase in kava production.  From 
<br/>all the activities that we are undertaking, not only from the last three years but from previous years.  
<br/>Kava production increased from 12,000 tonnes in 2019 to 14,000 tonnes in 2021.  Last year, our 
<br/>export of kava was $42 million, the highest ever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dalo</span><span> production increased from 51,000 tonnes in 2019 to 54,000 tonnes in 2021, with last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year’s export being the highest ever of $30 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth largest export crop – turmeric production, increased from 367 tonnes – very little 
<br/>but within three years, the production has gone up to 3,000 tonnes.  This year, export earnings from 
<br/>turmeric, a new crop on the block, is $22.9 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There is massive demand for 
<br/>turmeric in the US market and everyone is asking for Fijian turmeric. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ginger  production  increased  from  9,000  tonnes  in  2019  to  14,000  tonnes  in  2021,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  The export earnings of ginger is $14 million.  Everyone in the Australian market is 
<br/>asking for the Fijian ginger.  We need to maintain that brand image, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are the four top crops that we are exporting in large amounts and 
<br/></span><span>production  has  substantially  increased  over  the  last  three  years,  given  our  public  infrastructure 
<br/></span><span>development, et cetera, that we have undertaken, and the support and leverage that we are giving to 
<br/>the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  livestock  sector,  we  are  also  working  to  ensure  that  we  take 
<br/>control of the importation of livestock products.  The key industry that we have made substantial 
<br/>investment in and we have done extremely well, is poultry.  At the moment, we are pretty much 
<br/>close to 100 percent self-sufficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, to get there, we have made substantial investment over the last three  years of 
<br/>close to $1 million.  We have invested three-quarter million dollars ($750,000) in this industry, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and we are 89 percent self-sufficient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  production  have  increased  substantially,  given  that  we  are  nearly  at  the  plateau  of 
<br/>production, increase will be at lower number. From 2020, we went up by 1.4 percent in terms of 
<br/>broiler production, and we have reduced our importation by 1.2 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also increasing support to our piggery industry, given its economic 
<br/>and traditional importance.  We are supporting our piggery farmers.  We have reduced our imports 
<br/>from 47.1 percent in 2019 to 45.8 percent in 2021.  We have now taken over 80 percent of the local 
<br/>market in terms of self-sufficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a sector that bothers us is sheep.  We are importing close to 99 percent of 
<br/>lamb meat  and we are putting in  measures on the ground.  This  year, we have provided a large 
<br/>number of farmers with  fencing material, and we have an annual  growth  rate of 10.3 percent of 
<br/>sheep meat production locally in 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there is a lot to do on that.  There is a close substitute which is goat, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. We are also supporting goat farmers and we have also seen goat production rising substantially.  
<br/>From 2020, we have increased by 16.25 percent in terms of goat meat production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also supporting the beef sector.  We are importing close to $11 
<br/>million worth of beef meat, and we want to ensure that given that we have a strategic advantage in 
<br/>raising and producing beef cattle within Fiji, we need to take over this market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got about 6,498 farmers engaged in beef cattle farming and we have assisted them 
<br/>in providing of fencing material.  We see this as a binding constraint.  If we want to transit, migrate 
<br/>the small holder subsistence farmers into medium or large holder farms, we need to provide them 
<br/>with fencing material and later on the successful farmers we want to provide them with the stock 
<br/>yard.  So this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we provided 260 farmers with fencing materials and we said 
<br/>that out of this 260, all those who were successful, progressively from next year, we will construct 
<br/>a stock yard on their farms.  In this way, we will be able to reduce the importation of beef meat and 
<br/>in fact we can export beef meat in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, dairy sector is an issue.  Even though we have done substantial amount of 
<br/>work in  terms  of eradication of Tuberculosis (TB) and Brucellosis, Australia spent  a substantial 
<br/>amount of money and it took them 40 years to eradicate TB.  We have just started about a decade 
<br/>ago and we can see the results of improvement in diary production.  The number of dairy cattle 
<br/>recorded increased by 2.8 percent in the last three years while annual meat production also grew by 
<br/>3.5 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also supporting the beef and dairy cattle through the provision of improved breed.  
<br/>We will be giving all the TB free farms the improved sample breed which can give them much 
<br/></span><span>higher milk production.  At the moment our milk production is about 6 litres to 7 litres per day.  
<br/></span><span>And the improved breed that we want to give them, it could yield up to 20 litres per day.  There 
<br/>could be a substantial increase in milk production but only when we are able to eradicate TB and 
<br/>Brucellosis from these farms.  Brucellosis is pretty much under control but TB is because of the 
<br/>nature of the disease and the migration that is happening, is taking time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a leader of a political party kind of attacked us saying that we are giving 
<br/>horses, et cetera.  What the Ministry needs to give to the farmers is tractors.   This is the problem 
<br/>when they do not look at all the activities we are undertaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  mechanisation  is  high  on  the  agenda  of  the 
<br/>Ministry  and  we  have  provided  tractors,  rice  harvesters,  livestock  feed  shredders,  shaft  cutters, 
<br/>biogas digesters and honey extractors.  We have 90,000 farmers but we cannot give 90,000 tractors 
<br/>to each of these farmers.  This is the kind of people we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also ensuring that we address all the points of the supply chain and 
<br/>one of the aspects is, farm road.  At the moment on our books, we have to construct 170 kilometres 
<br/>of farm road.  We have now acquired increased machinery and progressively we will construct all 
<br/>these farm roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the agriculture sector is continuously subjected 
<br/>to shocks.  Just last year, the floods affected our agriculture sector.  We had assisted 12,000 farmers 
<br/>with $250 cash.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, all these have resulted in a major increase in production.  We are 
<br/>supporting 70,900 farming households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our non-sugar cane agricultural GDP grew at a compound annual growth rate of 4.9 percent.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This increased from a FJ$686.8 million in 2018 to FJ$756 million in 2020.  The 2020 crop sector 
<br/>alone achieved a total value of $1.7 billion with nominal GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the return on investment, for every dollar that we spent from 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture, we got 9.2 percent worth of output.  For the first time ever in 2020, we 
<br/>crossed  the  export  of  non-sugar  agriculture  over  $100  million-$106  million,  and  for  2023  our 
<br/>exports should be $121 million.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  increase  in  output,  increase  in  export 
<br/>income, more money is transferred to the farmers. In 2019, AMA alone transferred $1.5 million.  In 
<br/>2021 AMA alone transferred $5.8 million to the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  supporting  70,000  farm  households  and  about  10,000  vendors 
<br/>directly to the agricultural growth.  The money that we have in the Budget for Agriculture we do 
<br/></span><span>not treat it as an expenditure, we treat it as an investment.  Thank you for the time.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you Mr. Speaker, Sir, before  I respond to the Ministerial 
<br/>Statement,  I  again  express  my  concern  and  disappointment  in  the  timing  of  this  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement as we are not given enough time to analyse the agriculture reports or agriculture strategic 
<br/>plan so that we can provide a better response for the people who are listening in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have got five minutes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I thank the Minister for this Ministerial Statement but how can we 
<br/>agree to what he is saying?  How can we measure the success of his story when he himself and his 
<br/>ministry have not been able to provide Annual Reports since 2017? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is telling us all the achievements but how can we say that he is telling the truth here?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because he has not been able to provide the Annual Reports since 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is lying!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, up to 2020 the Annual Reports are with Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Sir, have those reports been presented in Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Yes.

<br/>but according to the agriculture sector GDP growth the agriculture’s contribution to GDP growth 
<br/>has continued to decline from 2014 until 2021.  So, what is he talking about?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker. Sir, I believe that the ministry has not done enough 
<br/>to revitalise our economy to improve the standard of living, put food on the table for the poor and 
<br/>the underprivileged and the pensioners.  They are not doing enough.  This is reflected in the amount 
<br/>of money that has been allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture, it has continued to reduce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been telling them in this Parliament that this is a most important ministry that Fiji 
<br/>needs to rely on to improve our economy, improve the standard of living and yet this Government 
<br/>continued to reduce its budget.  Look at the Revised Budget that we just have last five months ago.  
<br/>It was reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, yesterday the honourable Prime Minister just mentioned that 40 percent of cane farmers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are producing less than a hundred tons.  What has the ministry done about that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- In one of his statements he said and I quote, “we will be providing 
<br/>rice seeds up to 30 kilogrammes for one acre of farm to every sugarcane farmer.  We will assist 
<br/>them to mill their rice for home consumption by providing small portable rice mills down to the 
<br/>area where a rice paddy is ready for milling”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Have they done that?  How many sugarcane farmers have been supplied with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  There is a Point of Order.  Take your seat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just read out in my Ministerial Statement for…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  He  misled  Parliament.  Let  me  correct  him  that  for  sugarcane 
<br/>farmers we have allocated 30 kilogrammes of rice seeds equivalent to one acre of rice planting (we 
<br/>went and gave to them); he mentioned about portable rice mills, Mr. Speaker, I am saying to the 
<br/>Honourable Member now to show me any cluster group of 10 rice farmers, we are ready to give a 
<br/>portable rice mill today.  We have given out 88 portable rice mills.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ask him not to mislead Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- According to the Ministry’s Strategic Plan 2019-2023 there needs 
<br/>to be some improvements on Quarters and Research Stations of the Ministry of Agriculture. Have 
<br/>they done that? You go to Nacocolevu Research Station, I believe, Sir, all those quarters right now 
<br/>across the country are not OHS compliant. They are in rundown conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI-. They also mentioned that the Yalavou Beef Scheme will be revived. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Yalavou is still lying idle and nothing has been done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Road is very poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is this another Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Yes,  Sir.  He  has  again  misled  Parliament  by  saying  that  the 
<br/>Yalavou Beef Scheme is lying idle.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said in this Parliament that we are 
<br/>doing a major renovation of the Yalavou Beef Scheme.  We will be opening it again, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- That is the problem when you join PAP Party.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Sir,  also  disappointing  to  note  that  the  Ministry  especially  the 
<br/>honourable Minister giving over-worked stray horses to farmers.  I also deplore, Sir, about the five 
<br/>initiatives that they did during COVID-19.  For farmers to apply for all these initiatives they need 
<br/>to apply online.  What about the farmers that are living in the highlands of Naitasiri and Navosa?  
<br/>What is the use of field officers that are serving them, why can they not just approve that on the 
<br/>spot? This is a crisis stage so they need urgent attention and you will see again application online - 
<br/>it is ridiculous.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the Leader of the National Federation Party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF  B.C.  PRASAD.-  In  fact,  this  Ministerial  Statement  is  really  a  very  good 
<br/>example of a juvenile attempt to pre-empt the motion that we have tomorrow where we were going 
<br/>to  discuss  the  effectiveness  of  some  of  the  assistance  that  we  have  seen  that  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture is providing to the farmers.  What the honourable Minister has initially done, in a very 
<br/>juvenile way, again, is to put out what the Ministry has been saying all throughout in his opening 
<br/>speeches and distribution so we know what the Ministry is trying to do.  I would have thought, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that he would have taken just like the juvenile attempt by some of the backbenchers to ask 
<br/>questions, you know what I call “Dorothy Dixer” questions and the ministers instead of giving a 
<br/>genuine Ministerial Statement, you know take 10 to 15 to 20 minutes to answer questions without 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>giving  us  an  opportunity  to  respond  to  substantive  issues.    So  these  are  all  like  misuse  of 
<br/>parliamentary system, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But what I thought, Mr. Speaker, he should have done was to perhaps look at this IFC Report 
<br/>which just came out in May 2022 and it actually talks about the challenges in the agriculture sector 
<br/>and this is a May Report, Mr. Speaker, and I want to just highlight some of the issues.  I mean he 
<br/>talked about $100 million worth of exports but he did not say that we are importing $100 million 
<br/>worth of just beef and sheep meat, apart from all the other imports amounting to about $700 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also talked about the rise in production of some of the crops in the last two years.  We 
<br/>all know Mr. Speaker, that 150,000 people who lost jobs, had no income, who actually moved to 
<br/>farming so there has been a natural increase in production, in </span><span>dalo</span><span>, in ginger and also the legacy 
<br/>effect on kava production, so I mean those are not things that suddenly has come about as a result 
<br/>of the initiatives that the Ministry of Agriculture has put out but this Report is very interesting, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know it talks about the challenges.  It talks about for example, what is the state of the 
<br/>farming  situation  in  the  country,  it  talks  about  farming  households  -  71,000,  it  talks  about 
<br/></span><span>subsistence, semi-subsistence, commercial farmers and it talks about overreliance on a few markets 
<br/></span><span>and few export crops like kava, taro, turmeric, ginger and a mixture of spices.  This increase in the 
<br/>production  of  some  of  these  crops  can  be  purely  seen  as  more  people  actually  entering  the 
<br/>agriculture sector in the last two or three years.  Then Mr. Speaker, it talks about productivity and 
<br/>competitiveness in the sector which says is continued mutant I know for many reasons.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  talks  about  access  to  land,  lack  of  risk  insurance  financing,  poor  infrastructure,  low 
<br/>proximity  to  storage  and  processing  facilities.    All  these  have  negative  impact  on  the 
<br/>competitiveness.    Then  it  talks  about  Mr.  Speaker,  key  contributor  to  competitiveness  of  the 
<br/>agriculture sector is a well-functioning agri-logistics sector which has critical gaps.  It talks about 
<br/>weak domestic inter-island logistics, high maintenance cost, fuel cost, and uncertainty due to delays 
<br/>et cetera tracking information gaps – a whole lot of things that this Report talks about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also talks about poor road and transportation infrastructure and maintenance.  You know 
<br/>it talks about the cost that those who are transporting agricultural produce, retrofitting et cetera, you 
<br/>know it is a taking a lot of time.  It talks about absence of critical post-harvest heat removing (pre-
<br/>cooling) infrastructure, absent across Fiji.  It is estimated that 33 percent, Mr. Speaker, 33 percent 
<br/>of agricultural produce is wasted due to lack of required warehousing and storage infrastructure.  
<br/>These near farm facilities are important to reduce food loss and extend shelf life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  it  talks  about  Mr.  Speaker,  deficiencies  in  storage  and  warehousing  in  specific 
<br/>locations.  It talks about the fact that you know we might have some of those in Viti Levu but is 
<br/>almost non-existent in Vanua Levu and I know, I met farmers in Vanua Levu.  One farmer said to 
<br/>me that he had six tonnes of cassava but the Agriculture Officers were telling them that the AMA 
<br/>did not have any storage facility so they could not take his cassava.  A lack of substantial perishable 
<br/>cargo services at the international airport, you know like Nadi Airport.  It talks about high …

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… port cost and shipping rates relative to competitive countries, Mr. Speaker.  I will give 
<br/>you an example.  It says storage charges at Fiji ports are expensive and exceed the rates charged in 
<br/>other ports by an average of 200 to 215 percent for the storage of a full 20 to 40-foot container.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wharfage charges, Mr. Speaker, are estimated to be higher by an average of close to 200 
<br/>percent.  These are the things that the Ministry of Agriculture should be doing.  I know what they 
<br/>are  doing,  they  are  all  around  the  country,  the  honourable  Minister  himself  is  running  around, 
<br/>photogets, opportunities, staff instead of planning and addressing some of these fundamental issues, 
<br/>gaps in the regulatory environment, for example, many commercial farmers.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Many commercial farmers have complained about regulatory 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you should tell them that they are not the 
<br/>Speaker.  The final two points in this Report which are very important - limited data availability 
<br/>and lack of access of information and this is what he should know.  It says, ‘while the Minister of 
<br/>Agriculture collects annual data, there are concerns about his accuracy’ and we all know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it says, ‘lack of systematic dialogue with the private sector and 
<br/>the  impact  of  a  dominant  role  of  the  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority  (AMA).    Here  is  our 
<br/>honourable Minister, first of all he uses his juvenile technique - he wants to have a one-upmanship 
<br/>just because the motion is tomorrow, pre-empting what he wants to say.  He had all the opportunity 
<br/>to come tomorrow and talk about or even get all of them who are dancing over there, yelling, who 
<br/>could speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have had your time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will have an opportunity tomorrow to 
<br/>say  a  little  bit  more,  but  these  are  really  juvenile  attempts  to  pre-empt  what  we  should  have 
<br/>discussed tomorrow, but that was good because it gave me an opportunity to say a little bit more 
<br/>than what I would have been able to say tomorrow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Leader of the National Federation Party for his contribution, 
<br/>but  do  not  go  out  of  the  agreement  that  was  done.    We  made  the  agreement  in  the  Business 
<br/>Committee  that  there  would  be  that  motion  tomorrow,  but  that  there  would  be  a  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement.  I went out of my way to do that, so I accommodated that, and that is the privilege of the 
<br/>Speaker.  Follow that, I do not do that lightly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, take note of the following.  We will take the next agenda item listed 
<br/>in today’s Order Paper after Questions, so there is a change in the Order.  Questions will come next 
<br/>and we will take the next item on the agenda paper after Questions, so those of you who are going 
<br/>to  be  asking  questions  today,  be  prepared  after  morning  tea.    I  am  telling  you  now  so  you  are 
<br/>prepared.  Honourable Members, on that note, we will take an adjournment for half an hour for 
<br/>morning tea.
