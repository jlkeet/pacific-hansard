<div><span>STATE LANDS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move the motion, I would like 
<br/>to  thank  you  for  your  indulgence  in  accommodating  the  presentation  of  this  particular  Bill  to 
<br/>Parliament after lunch.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>State Land (Amendment) Bill 2022 be considered by Parliament without delay; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament;  
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 and 
<br/>(e)</span><span> </span><span>one hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, without going into too much detail, just by 
<br/>way  of  introduction  to  this  particular  amendment  Bill,  this  Bill  is  all  about  State  lands  and  has 
<br/>nothing to do with iTaukei land or freehold land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it says under Section 16 that once a person makes an application for State 
<br/>land lease they must essentially, in simple terms, come to the Director for Lands with clean hands.  
<br/>You should not be making an application for lease if you are going to immediately transfer the lease 
<br/>to someone else or you have some form of arrangement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most State leases have a condition in that if,  for example, I obtain a 
<br/>state lease, and if I am going to subdivide the land, sell the land or sell part of the land, I need to get 
<br/>the consent of the Director for Lands.  Sir, over a number of decades in Fiji this has actually not 
<br/>happened nor has the Lands Department, as the honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu knows and 
<br/>also honourable Bulanauca (who I understand was also a Minister for Lands), that this has not been 
<br/>strictly enforced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular after 1987, Sir, a lot of people who were dispossessed of their land, the leases 
<br/>that they had or whose leases were not renewed, essentially became refugees in their own country 
<br/>in terms of displaced people,  so a lot of farmers or people who owned State land made arrangements 
<br/>with them.  They said “you give me $1,000 and you can put up your house in that corner of the 
<br/>land.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will find a lot of them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Nadi area and there are other parts of 
<br/>Fiji too where we have had public consultations.  In particular, I was there about six or eight weeks 
<br/>ago, for example, in the Malolo Transmitter Road area where a person owned a vast tract of Crown 
<br/>land and he then subsequently sold portions of it.  Some people, in some instances, may have a bit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1322 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Crown land and then gives it to his brothers’ son who does not have any lands to build a house 
<br/>in the corner and share the lease payments with him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In many of these instances, Sir, because this happened 30 to 40 years ago, some of the people 
<br/>who actually owned the lease have died off or have actually migrated.  So the Director of Lands, 
<br/>under the current arrangements under the law, has to give notice to the person who has the lease in 
<br/>terms of them breaching it.  The notice either cannot be served because the person is nowhere to be 
<br/>found or it has to be passed on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, obviously it would be extremely unjust if you have an entire generation or 
<br/>a generation and half of people who have been living on the State lands for them to be booted out 
<br/>overnight  if  we  were  to  strictly  follow  the  requirements  under  the  existing  law.    What  this 
<br/>amendment seeks to do, for example, is to give the Director of Lands the ability to cancel the head 
<br/>lease or the lease itself, and be able to issue separate leases for those people who have been living 
<br/>there </span><span>bona fide</span><span> since the land was given to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a particular system that has been put in place in the amendment that there is going 
<br/>to be a Committee chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Housing and Community Development, 
<br/></span><span>and consists of the Permanent Secretary for Lands, Solicitor-General and anyone else they wish to 
<br/></span><span>for example to include into that Committee, for example, Town and Country Planning Director, et 
<br/>cetera.  Once they have actually, for example, established that in this particular area so and so had 
<br/>actually sold off their land to these people, albeit illegally under the law technically speaking, and 
<br/>they have been occupying this land now for the past 30 to 40 years, then they will be able to then 
<br/>cancel the original lease and be able to then issue them with the leases and the Director of Lands 
<br/>can actually do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is essentially what this provides for.  Obviously, we cannot cancel 
<br/>lease if there is encumbrance on the lease. If for example, there is a mortgage on the lease or if there 
<br/>is a caveat on the lease.  Those legal issues need to be taken care of before any such new leases are 
<br/>issued.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the areas for example, you have in Nadi  – Naidovi, Navo, Nasau, 
<br/>Solovi, Malolo Transmitter Road (vast areas) and also there are other places around Fiji where there 
<br/>are similar situations so the idea is to regularise this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if we do not, these people essentially are living there without any title.  They 
<br/>do not build permanent homes because they think that they may be booted out at any time so they 
<br/>do not actually go to the banks to build a nice concrete home.  When there is a cyclone, we have to 
<br/>go and help them because they do not have a nice concrete home with a proper roof so in this way 
<br/>we will be able to address, for example, remove the uncertainty, be able to get revenue for the State 
<br/>because then they can start paying proper lease monies to the State.  We will be able to get proper 
<br/>subdivisions done and Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course these people will get certainty.  They can then go 
<br/>to  banks,  mortgage  their  leases  and  build  concrete  homes  and  of  course  that  creates  a  lot  more 
<br/>economic activity, so that is what this Act seeks to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been having a lot of consultations with many of these groups in the past few number 
<br/>of  months  where  they  have  made  various  submissions.   Some  of  them  are  extremely  frustrated.  
<br/>They have been there for decades without any proper title being issued to them.  The Director of 
<br/>Lands, her hands are tied.  She cannot move on it because the current law does not allow her to do 
<br/>so.  A lot of the people who actually sold them the land, they are nowhere to be found or they have 
<br/>passed on.  Some of them in fact actually live on the land themselves but they have allowed these 
<br/>people to build all these homes around them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1323 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  bring  about  the  certainty  to  carry  out  proper  subdivision,  to  get 
<br/>proper drainage because a lot of these areas do flood because the town and country planning does 
<br/>not want to give the zoning or does not want to do the boundaries because no one knows where the 
<br/>boundaries are but this will get it all pegged out and that creates of course, Mr. Speaker, a lot more 
<br/>certainty and of course in terms of the State land, it increases the value of the State land.  Thank 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I thank the Attorney-General.   Honourable Members, the floor is  now 
<br/>open for debate on the motion.  At the end of the debate we will have the right of reply from the 
<br/>mover. Anyone wishing to take the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion at hand.  As 
<br/>we have stated in the past, we have always been consistent in terms of Standing Order 51 and again 
<br/>in this case, this is a substantial bill which has quite far-reaching effects and honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy, the Attorney-General has mentioned that consultations have been going on but with 
<br/>whom, that is the question and whether all stakeholders have been consulted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also concern that these lands are not clearly identified given the various interest at 
<br/></span><span>hand and stakeholders including iTLTB, landowners, those who might have interest and that is very 
<br/></span><span>important that consultations are done and by going through Standing Order 51, this will not be done 
<br/>so again we express our concern that this is coming through that and then tomorrow we will discuss 
<br/>or debate on the Bill itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  of  the  view  that  this  should  go  to  a  standing  committee  of 
<br/>Parliament in order to thoroughly discuss it.  I mean there are various issues there, for example, they 
<br/>mentioned there the subdivision of land and there is a committee to be chaired by the permanent 
<br/>secretary.  These are issues which you know involve good governance and transparency, not only 
<br/>regarding stakeholders I have mentioned, but there might be people or other stakeholders or original 
<br/>landowners who have claims to this so there are no details on which parcels of land are involved 
<br/>here.  Going to a Committee will enable us to thoroughly discuss it, consult all the stakeholders and 
<br/>go through the details that this Bill relates to that are in the parcels of land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  Anyone who has served in 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands &amp; Mineral Resources knows the problems that happens for this particular sort 
<br/>of issue which is happening all the time, so I support this because it will address the ongoing issue 
<br/>in relation to State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute on a few issues 
<br/>that have been raised in the introduction of the motion by the learned Attorney-General, and that is 
<br/>to do with this particular Bill in trying to amend and provide probably areas of redress for people 
<br/>that are already there or to check out how they have come upon that piece of land, if it is a State 
<br/>land and in particular for the State land or State freehold land that has been mentioned by the learned 
<br/>Attorney-General, the Malolo areas, Navakai - these are areas that were part of the impact of the 
<br/>Agricultural Landlord and Tenants Act (ALTA) legislation on this type of agricultural use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the land as you approach before reaching the Qeleloa Bridge in Nadi to the right 
<br/>that is known as Malolo, the area that is mentioned by the learned Attorney-General is occupied by 
<br/>people who have cane land at the bottom that is their marginal lot for housing, on top of that they 
<br/>are given a marginal lot for planting rice.  It all comes under ALTA and that involves Navakai as 
<br/>well which has become renowned squatter area as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>1324 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these marginal lot owners are the ones who have been doing all 
<br/>this business of letting off some of their parcels of land to other users to come and build upon that 
<br/>and in the process, these people are protected under ALTA, because ALTA lease recognises the 
<br/>occupation as such.  If the predominant use is agricultural or which is the cane farm at the bottom - 
<br/>their marginal lot for cane farming, that covers them, that makes them be the kind of landlord even 
<br/>though they have not been issued proper ALTA leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under ALTA they are allowed another 20 years extension, but again this Committee that 
<br/>has been set up under this Bill will certainly find their task a bit of ‘wrinkle’ so to speak, because it 
<br/>will be charged, the lawyers out there in this particular area Sir right down to Ba, they are well-
<br/>renowned for protecting the interests and the rights of the people that own the marginal lot.  But 
<br/>again, it has been subdivided and that is the very crux of this Bill to try and address that, to try and 
<br/>put a stop to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first thing that the Committee has to do as noticed in this agreement is to confirm or 
<br/>ascertain whether a breach of whatever rise that they are trying to claim over those parcels of land 
<br/>need to be ascertained and they could be taken to task according to what they would come up with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But it is in the Standing Order and I also agree with the honourable Minister for Lands in 
<br/></span><span>saying that when one goes to occupy the office, he is always confronted with this kind of land issues 
<br/>and it has become a good playing ground for lawyers as well to fight cases saying that there is a 
<br/>case.  But  in  going in  this particular direction,  I  hope that it would be of full effect  in  trying to 
<br/>address these problems and it has to be an outstanding problem for quite some.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  his  contribution.  Honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mitieli Bulanauca, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Sir, as far as I am concerned, it is good 
<br/>to give us time to properly go into the proposal year before we debate it.  While we would like to 
<br/>encourage and ensure that people have security of tenure rather than just being a part of the family 
<br/>on that list and employment staying on that lease or whatever, to provide them with the security of 
<br/>tenure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we have a good look at the status of that Crown land before we make 
<br/>certain such decisions, particularly giving that power to the Director of Lands to cancel the lease, 
<br/>and ready for sub-division and issue more direct leases to whoever is occupied. Maybe also we need 
<br/>to offer some of the pieces of land to others not related to the tenant relations.  What I am just trying 
<br/>to say is that we need more time to properly delve into this proposal before the debate. Thank you, 
<br/>Mr, Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his contribution to the debate.  There 
<br/>being nobody else wishing to take the floor, I give the floor to the honourable Attorney General for 
<br/>his right of reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad that honourable Lalabalavu has 
<br/>actually agreed that it is actually an issue.  I think some of the issues that he did raise regarding 
<br/>ALTA, not all the leases actually were granted under ALTA, some of them were given not under 
<br/>ALTA. But if I can also read the provision under ALTA that is clause 37(1): 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A landlord may terminate his contract of tenancy and may recover possession of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an agricultural holding- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1325 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span> </span><span>without notice where the tenant deserts such holding and leaves it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>uncultivated and unoccupied for a period of not less than twelve months and 
<br/>owes rent for a period of twelve months or more; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by one months' written notice to quit - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span> </span><span>where  the  tenant  sublets,  assigns  or  subdivides  such  holding  without 
<br/>having previously obtained the consent in writing of the landlord which 
<br/>consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(ii)   where  the  tenant  commits  a  breach  of  any  term  or  condition  of  the 
<br/>tenancy which is not capable of being remedied and the interests of the 
<br/>landlord are materially prejudiced thereby;…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  you  can  see  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  of  it  actually  falls  squarely  within  this  particular 
<br/>provision  but  we  have  made  an  amendment  to  the  State  Lands  Act  because  State  Lands  Act 
<br/>obviously covers all State lands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honorable Tuisawau tried to sneak in again about the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land issues. It has got nothing 
<br/></span><span>to do with the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land, and as I said in the introduction that it is clearly only on land - that is 
<br/></span><span>clearly State-owned land which falls under the State Lands Act.  Again, this is one of the sneaky 
<br/>ways of introducing ethnicity into it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  also  want  to  make  is,  I  also  highlighted  in  the 
<br/>introduction that should there be any encumbrance, in other words if somebody is challenging the 
<br/>ownership, if there is a matter before the courts, if there is a matter before the tribunal - it cannot go 
<br/>ahead and I have made it clear right from the beginning. So please, stick to what we have said and 
<br/>stick to the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point he said ‘consultations with whom’? I highlighted also in 
<br/>the introduction that we have had consultations with the people who are actually affected by this 
<br/>and they are the people who are occupying this land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other main part in this is the Director for Lands.  Is the landlord which is the Director 
<br/>for Lands, Ministry of Lands, the tenants and the lessees so in case they disappeared? They are the 
<br/>main people who we need to  consult and they are the main stakeholders in this. So again, he is 
<br/>misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu I think again, is showing his wisdom 
<br/>by  saying  that  the  Committee  will  need  to  do  a  lot  of  investigation.    Again,  if  you  look  at  the 
<br/>amendment, it does say that there will be regulations around this for the Committee.  So they need 
<br/>to have those findings, in some case it is quite clear, is quite evident that the person is gone, has 
<br/>died, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had a number of meetings, a lot of records over the town and country planning, 
<br/>they have not moved, they have it with the subdivision because they are then bound by the law itself 
<br/>to say ‘ you must get the consent of the landowner to do this’.  Now it is used to be in the agricultural 
<br/>lease, now you want to have only residential lease so they are bound by that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What this does, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the amendment is very simple actually, you 
<br/>have a number of lawyers on your side, they can tell you about it, it gives the Director the ability to 
<br/>issue them with any other lease.  So, those people, for example, this is the parcel land that different 
<br/>people are occupying it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>1326 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> State Lands (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the law because the person who owns this parcel of 
<br/>land or owns this lease under the law they have to cancel the lease.  So no one can actually occupy 
<br/>the land, they all have to be chased away and then the Director for Lands will have to then issue 
<br/>another lease over that parcel of land or go ahead and subdivide it. For this, he is saying, is that 
<br/>when  the  Director  for  Lands  actually  cancel  the  lease,  Sir,  those  people  will  still  be  protected 
<br/>because it does say in the Bill itself: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“For the avoidance of doubt,  any occupant  of land referred  to  under this section 
<br/>including the lessee shall remain on the land subject to any terms and condition of any 
<br/>lease,  licence  approval  notice  of  lease  granted  after  the  enactment  of  the  State  land 
<br/>amendment Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, the Director for Lands will make sure that these people do not get booted out but 
<br/>give them separate leases.  So that is what is going to do, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again honourable Bulanauca I think was off the mark. Honourable Ratu 
<br/>Naiqama Lalabalavu raised Navakai. There are two types of State land occupation, one is where 
<br/>people have actually simply gone in becomes squatters, there was no lease, Navakai is a classic 
<br/></span><span>example, State land, no more sugarcane farming is owned by the State, they have simply gone and 
<br/></span><span>built homes and no one have checked on it.  For example, Omkar is just squatters.  Over here what 
<br/>we  are  talking  about,  Sir,  is  State  land  that  were  actually  leased  out  to  an  individual  and  that 
<br/>individual went in, subsequently sold the land without the consent of the Director for Lands, that is 
<br/>what we are dealing with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not dealing with State land where we have squatters. It is the same here, for example, 
<br/>if an </span><span>itaukei</span><span> land where you have people who are squatters and they simply go in and build their 
<br/>houses without anyone’s consent or in some cases, there are ‘</span><span>vakavanua</span><span>’ arrangement. That is the 
<br/>different matter too if someone is issued a proper lease by iTLTB and then they go and sell the land 
<br/>without the consent of iTLTB. This is a similar situation where we have actual leases being issued 
<br/>by the State by the lessee then they subsequently go and sell those lands without the consent of the 
<br/>Director for Lands.  As opposed to Navakai where people are just simply squatters, no one ever 
<br/>checked on them, for example, Omkar.  So there are two different issues, we are not talking about 
<br/>the  squatters,  we  are  talking  about  those  people  who  actually  have  gone  and  occupied  the  land 
<br/>because the original lessee allowed them to go there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  hope  that  clarifies  those  issues  that  have  been  raised  by  honourable 
<br/>Members from the other side and we are looking forward to their contribution tomorrow afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  we  have  had  some  delays  today  over  the 
<br/>rearrangement of our Agenda items but we have gone through the day and it comes now to that hour 
<br/>where I have to adjourn until tomorrow, so we have an early adjournment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We adjourn to tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.   
<br/></span></div>
