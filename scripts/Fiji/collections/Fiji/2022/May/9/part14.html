<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I as the Chairperson on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts who 
<br/>move the motion, take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the Review of the 2017-2018 Whole 
<br/>of Government Audit Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Consolidated Report provides the Committee’s review findings on the 
<br/>2017-2018 Whole of Government Audit Reports of the Office of the Auditor-General. The Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General established under Section 151 on the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and 
<br/>the  Audit  Act  1969,  further  specified  the  powers  of  the  Auditor-General  to  audit  the  Whole  of 
<br/>Government Financial Statement and the report of all entities of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report summarises the audit issues found in the Whole of Government 2017-2018 Audit 
<br/>Report and also outlines the responses from the relevant Ministries and Departments.  The review of 
<br/>the Whole of Government  Audit  Report had focused on five Volumes by  sector, inclusive of the 
<br/>remaining 2018 Audit Report.  The Whole of Government Audit Report included all the budget sector 
<br/>agencies in a consolidated financial statements. This Audit Reports include: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Financial Statement of the Ministry of Economy </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 186 of 2020</span><span>); 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Volume 2 – 2017-2018 Audit Report on the General Administration Sector </span><span>(Parliamentary 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Volume 4 – 2017 – 2018 Audit Report on the Social Services Sector </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No. 149 of 2019)</span><span>; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Volume 5 – 2017-2018 Audit Report on Infrastructure Sector </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>150 of 2019)</span><span>; and  
<br/>The remaining of 2018 Audit Reports on General Administration Sector, Social Services 
<br/>and Economic Sector </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 187 of 2020)</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was noted in the Audit Report that there were no acquisition or disposal 
<br/>of control entities during the financial year. The Auditor-General’s audit opinion highlighted that the 
<br/>accompanying financial statement of the Government of the Republic of Fiji which were prepared 
<br/>had all material aspects, in accordance with the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and the 
<br/>Financial Management Act 2016 and the Audited 1969.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  OAG  had  issued  37  Audit  Opinions  on  the  2018  Financial 
<br/>Statement of Ministries and Departments, out of which 24 or 65 percent were unmodified opinions,  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while 13 or 35 percent were modified opinions.  This indicated that most agencies financial statement 
<br/>did not contain material misstatement individually or inadequate.  The Committee noted in its review 
<br/>that  there  were  matters  highlighted  by  OAG  which  were  matters  of  concern  in  which  relevant 
<br/>Ministries and Departments should have addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an ongoing process that the OAG audits Ministries and Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so that issues are identified and rectified to improve the system and service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted the Audit findings and it requires serious consideration by 
<br/>the  relevant  stakeholders  to  expedite  the  implementation  and  facilitation  of  the  Committee’s 
<br/>recommendations.  Recommendations include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Whilst majority of the Government Ministries and Departments have complied with their 
<br/>reporting  timelines  on  the  submission  of  their  financial  statements  to  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy, appropriate measures, however, should be placed to ensure compliance from 
<br/>those  Ministries  and  Departments  that  continuously  delay  submitting  their  end  of  year 
<br/>financial statements.  Permanent Secretaries are to ensure that their Finance Department 
<br/>prepares the financial statement on time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  Ministry  of  Economy  to  provide  oversight  on  the  implementation  of  the  relevant 
<br/>recommendation.  The Ministry of Economy should work together with other Ministries to 
<br/>ensure that Recommendation No. 1 is implemented because delay from Ministries delays 
<br/>the work of the Ministry of Economy in formulating Volume I of the Whole of Government 
<br/>Audit Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  should  take  the  lead  role  in  conducting  regular  and  timely 
<br/>training for all Ministries and Departments Accounting Officers in the area of FMIS, Trust 
<br/>Account, Stores, et cetera.  The Committee noted that the Ministry of Economy has the 
<br/>structure in place, and conducting training for other Ministries and Departments will build 
<br/>their capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministries and Departments should perform their reconciliation on a timely basis on their 
<br/>main  Operating  Account  and  Trust  Fund  accounts  to  ensure  their  internal  control 
<br/>mechanisms are in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee notes the work carried out by the Internal Audit and Good Governance 
<br/></span><span>Division of the Ministry of Economy and recommends that adequate support be provided 
<br/></span><span>for efficient and effective audit conduct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  in  conjunction  with  other 
<br/>Ministries, work with OAG for the reconciliation of the main Trust Account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges the progress made by relevant Ministries and 
<br/>Departments in addressing the issues identified through the audit measures that are put in place, to 
<br/>ensure that they are not repeated in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall the Committee commends the effort of the Ministry of Economy in trying to address 
<br/>issues highlighted by the OAG.  Most importantly, other relevant Ministries and Departments should 
<br/>consider those issues as  priority, take appropriate action and take their cues  from  the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy.  This is one of the reasons why the Committee, in its recommendations, has focussed on 
<br/>the Ministry of Economy to help build capacity for other Ministries and Departments.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  before 
<br/>Parliament, that Parliament debates the review of the 2017-2018 Whole of Government Consolidated 
<br/>Report which was tabled on 8</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022, and compiled by the Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>(PAC), despite the challenges and limitations confronting Fiji during the COVID-19 period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start by saying that the PAC was limited in carrying out its roles 
<br/>when we requested responses from Government Ministries and Departments, instead of conducting 
<br/>face-to-face interviews and making visitations so that the PAC are not misled into believing what 
<br/>have been provided to us on face value. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has been observed during the PAC review of the Whole of Government Report is that, 
<br/>in most instances, the Auditor-General has continuously highlighted similar issues that were assured 
<br/>by the Permanent Secretaries of various Ministries and Departments during previous interviews to 
<br/>have been resolved or attended to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when these incidents keep recurring in the Auditor-General’s Report, in this 
<br/>Report or previous Reports and future Reports, it signifies that the Government processes may have 
<br/>a weak control system which often questions whether the right people are holding the positions in 
<br/></span><span>the various entities.  What could be summarised, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the Government reform 
<br/></span><span>system  is  not  achieving  its  intended  purposes.    One  can  only  imagine  the  bizarre  result  that  the 
<br/>Government Ministries and Departments are achieving during this reform period.  As highlighted in 
<br/>this Auditor-General’s report, the Auditor-General gave a qualified audit opinion on the whole of 
<br/>Government report and that is not a good sign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government cannot be allowed to compromise the services it is expected 
<br/>to be giving to the people of Fiji when reforms introduced, is creating more confusion than good, 
<br/>especially,  I  will  just  highlight  few  Ministries  -  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts, 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Civil Service, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry 
<br/>of Waterways, Ministry of Fisheries and Forests to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee,  after  reviewing  the  audit  report  and  the  responses  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy in relation to the audit issues, have come up with recommendations, and I will be speaking 
<br/>on  three  of  the  recommendations.    Firstly,  whilst  the  majority  of  Government  Ministries  and 
<br/>Departments  have  complied  with  their  reporting  timelines  on  submissions  of  their  financial 
<br/>statements to the Ministry of Economy, appropriate measures, however, should be in place to ensure 
<br/>compliance from those Ministries and Departments that continuously delay submitting their end of 
<br/></span><span>year financial statements.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to allow the Auditor-General to conduct its work on a 
<br/></span><span>timely basis, the Office of the Auditor-General has highlighted that the Permanent Secretary of the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy signed off on this whole of Government report on 30</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  we  all know that timing is  critical  in the entities  operation, when the 
<br/>whole of Government financials are late in its tabling in this august Parliament, not only Permanent 
<br/>Secretary should be taken to task, but the Minister for Economy should also be held to account, and 
<br/>it is a question of accountability provided in Section 127(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji that states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The permanent secretary of a ministry is responsible to the Minister concerned for 
<br/>the  efficient,  effective  and  economical  management  of  the  ministry  or  any  department 
<br/>under the ministry.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the line Minister being the main authority in the Ministry, the 
<br/>bugs stop with him.  As I have already highlighted, the Office of the Auditor-General needs to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>1178 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowed to  fully conduct  its role to  allow for better improvement in  the civil  service operations.  
<br/>Hounding them and accusing them of being anti-government does not serve any government and 
<br/>our people any good whether now or in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  second  recommendation,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  to  provide  oversight  on  the 
<br/>implementation  of  the  relevant  recommendation.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Public Accounts have taken note of these responses from the various Ministries and Departments 
<br/>regarding the audit issues highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-General.  One cannot discount 
<br/>the fact that this is the Office of the Auditor-General’s report for the year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 for 
<br/>the period August 2017 to July 2018, and the timing of its discussion today, may be considered by 
<br/>some as a bit of an archaic issue, given the lapse of time.  But as I have already highlighted, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, most of the audit issues had been repeated and have been recurring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  we  take  for  example,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the  audit  issues  highlighted  a  lot  of 
<br/>control and compliance issues, which are very concerning, and I am forced to highlight one of the 
<br/>issues  that  has  been  highlighted  by  the  Auditor-General,  progress  report  on  dairy  development 
<br/>programme not provided.  We asked the question, what is the reason for not providing this progress 
<br/>report, and what has been done to ensure the report is given on time?  This question was raised by 
<br/></span><span>the Committee after receiving this 2017-2018 Report.  The Ministry in its response, stated that it 
<br/></span><span>has started receiving the Fiji Dairy and Cooperative Limited quarterly progress report and the last 
<br/>was received in quarter two, 2019 of 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, the Ministry should be implementing the following measures to ensure that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it receives consistent reports: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Regular check on meetings with Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited (FCDCL) on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the progress of their work with monthly progress report submitted for perusal by the PS; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>All reporting requirements to be put in a cycle calendar for delivery by the management of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the FCDCL; 
<br/>The Compliance Review Team to be used to further review business processes and make 
<br/>recommendations for improvement to streamline a way of working and achieve process 
<br/>efficiency going forward; and 
<br/>FCDCL to be included in the scope of work of the Compliance Review Team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the responses that were forwarded to the Public Accounts Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Ministry of Agriculture fails to do a timely follow-up on the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Dairy Quarterly Project Progress Report and it raises a lot of questions on the policy decisions taken 
<br/>by the Government, specifically the Ministry of Agriculture relating to Fiji Dairy Industry in Fiji. 
<br/>This is very concerning, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, may be the honourable Minister on that note can update Parliament on whether 
<br/>the importation of milk from abroad has reduced and the local production of milk has increased as 
<br/>these are some of the issues that should be addressed by way of reacting to the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report on the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, without timely reporting it is no wonder that the dairy industry in Fiji is a 
<br/>far cry from what it used to be in terms of local milk production.  It appears that the Rewa Dairy 
<br/>Corporative Limited is begging a lot of questions in terms of whether it is achieving its intended 
<br/>reform objective 10 years or so after.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General has highlighted the anomalies in the Free Medicine Programme where an amount of $9.4 
<br/>million was actually spent out of the $10 million budget.  When the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/>Services  records  97,000  medicines  as  free  when  they  are  not  listed  under  the  Free  Medicine 
<br/>Programmes and there is no agreement in place with those private pharmacies no wonder, Sir, the 
<br/>general public has always raised their concerns about the accessibility to this programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the OAG conducts its review on an annual basis in which they highlighted these 
<br/>anomalies.  Imagine the pain and suffering that the general public go through because someone is 
<br/>sleeping on the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Accounts Committee is  limited from  asking questions on the 
<br/>merit of expenditures and therefore I request the honourable Minister to update Parliament on how 
<br/>his Ministry has attended to this free medicine anomalies highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, on the infrastructure there is a great incident been highlighted by the OAG on 
<br/>the failure of the Fiji Roads Authority which Government has not shared in this august Parliament 
<br/></span><span>for our people to understand.  The Fiji Roads Authority, as an implementing agency for the Suva 
<br/></span><span>Arterial Roads Upgrading Project (SARUP 1) under the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector 
<br/>Project ADB Loan No. 3210 FIJ, did not comply with the implementation arrangements set forth in 
<br/>the project administration manual stated in the loan agreement.  The project manual administration 
<br/>required that the Asian Development Bank Procurement Guidelines be followed for the procurement 
<br/>of goods and works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Authority  prepared  the  contract  agreement  for  Contract  Number 
<br/>FRA/TIISP/16-01 Suva Arterial Roads Upgrading Project (SARUP 1) under FRA general terms and 
<br/>conditions  but  ADB  has  determined  a  mis-procurement  as  some  amendments  were  made  to  the 
<br/>Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs–Conseils (FIDIC) clauses.  As a result, the SARUP 1 Project 
<br/>has been noted in the OAG Report that it will no longer be funded by the ADB and World Bank and 
<br/>the Government of Fiji will incur the full cost of the project totalling $30.4 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The funds have been disbursed by ADB as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 totalling $5.7 million and the 
<br/>World Bank totalling $3 million  will be submitted too  with  the  FRA Road Diesel  Programme of 
<br/>roads  in  the  Western,  Central  and  Northern  Divisions  of  Fiji.  The  Government  of  Fiji  will  be 
<br/>responsible to pay the full remaining balance of $20.4 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this in-action has burdened the people of Fiji and it is unacceptable, the 
<br/>Minister for Economy should take the line Minister to task for this blunder done under his watch.  
<br/>On the Ministry of Waterways the OAG has highlighted that the Sigatoka River Dredging which was 
<br/>given to China Railway First Group at a cost of $5.1 million was closed due to the use of a rate of 
<br/>compensation which was 20 years old and not the current market rate amongst others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when consultations with landowning unit are not performed by the Ministry 
<br/>on this particular project, one can imagine how many other similar projects that the Ministry have 
<br/>bulldozed their actions over without conducting proper consultations with the landowning units, the 
<br/>Free Soul Project comes to mind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, what makes it worse is that this project together with Navua River Bank protection at 
<br/>Vunivau, Serua and the Nakauvadra River Channel Improvement do not have insurance covers like 
<br/>workers’  compensation,  public  liability  and  insurance  in  relation  to  work  performance  were  not 
<br/>provided and therefore increases the risks of losses to Government.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister is requested to provide an assurance in this august House on this 
<br/>issue Mr. Speaker, Sir.  On Recommendation No. 3, the Ministry of Economy should take the lead 
<br/>role in conducting regular and timely training for all ministries’ and departments’ accounting officers 
<br/>in the areas of FMIS, Trust Accounts, Stores et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OAG has highlighted in all ministries and departments that have Trust 
<br/>Accounts that there are records of anomalies in terms of proper administration and reconciliation.  
<br/>Included in the Trust Fund Account balance of $197.7 million in the statement of assets and liabilities 
<br/>is the Main Trust amounting to $161.2 million.  The Main Trust Fund Account balance amounting 
<br/>to $78.4 million was not supported with detail listings of claimants of the monies held in the Trust.  
<br/>Hence, audit was not able to confirm the accuracy and the completeness of this Trust Fund balances 
<br/>of $197.7 million as at 31 July 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look through the Report the Ministry of Health on Sahyadri Trust 
<br/>Fund Account receipt of $1. 1 million and paid $1.5 million without supporting receipts and payments 
<br/>and  reconciliations.    The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  a  balance  of  $261,000  in  its  books  without 
<br/>supporting documents.  Likewise for Ministry of Forestry amounts to $2.2 million remained in the 
<br/>Trust  Fund  Accounts  without  proper  explanation  and  supporting  documents.    This  is,  apart  from 
<br/></span><span>anomalies noted in the REDD+, unreconciled variances of $247,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then the Ministry of Land is noted to have a Trust balance of $6.6 million without supporting 
<br/>documents.    In the Judicial  Department  the Judicial  Trust  Fund amounting to  $32 million  has no 
<br/>listing of beneficiaries.  In the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the Overseas Mission Bank Reconciliation 
<br/>continue to be unreconciled to date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Infrastructure, Energy Trust Account with a balance of $2.4 million with no 
<br/>proper records and details maintained.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the above anomalies highlighted is the 
<br/>lack of due attention given by the various ministries and department  over  the  years in  the proper 
<br/>maintenance and upkeep of Trust Fund accounts.  So, when no proper Trust Fund records are kept at 
<br/>the various ministries and departments, there is a sense of disservice been given to the people of Fiji 
<br/>on the proper and timely utilisation of their money.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  leave  the  rest  of  the  recommendations  to  the  other  members  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee who will take time to make comments on the Report before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for 
<br/></span><span>its deliberation and Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seven areas which the Ministry of Health was asked 
<br/></span><span>to go back and look at with the modified audit opinion. I just want to assure you, Sir, and Parliament 
<br/>that the Ministry of Health since 2018 has done so and a few of the areas I want to touch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one was, it was noted in the statement that there were receipts on capital construction, 
<br/>totalling up to $17 million and since then I have a letter here from the Permanent Secretary of Health 
<br/>the following year we have been able to reconcile further receipts which totalled $4,435,000 to add 
<br/>on  to  those  that  were  already  reconciled.    As  you  know  that  these  things  do  have  a  process  and 
<br/>unfortunately during the time of the audit those receipts were not at hand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, also the Sahyadri Trust  Fund Account has been successfully closed with the 
<br/>agreement of the Ministry of Economy, the due diligence has been done in that area.  I think that is 
<br/>something that the honourable Radrodro had raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have continued to strengthen our internal controls.  One thing that has been very helpful 
<br/>is also the fact that we now have new team members in our finance department.  We have been able

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  also  engage  a few  from  the private sector and we believe that  this will actually strengthen the 
<br/>internal controls that we have, given that we have now the OMRS system that is in place so we can 
<br/>be  able  to  attract  those  that  have  meet  the  merit,  to  be  able  to  support  us  in  maintaining  internal 
<br/>controls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the other thing that was raised by the audit and I just want to bring to hand, is 
<br/>the issue of oxygen.  We had been asked (and this is something that the auditors had been asking us 
<br/>for several years) why is there no other competitor?  There is no other competitor in Fiji.  The only 
<br/>oxygen company that is there is the only one that is working in Fiji.  So what we have done also, you 
<br/>must  have  heard  that  during  the  COVID-19  outbreak,  we  have  been  able  to  bring  in  oxygen 
<br/>concentrators so they now are a source of oxygen and actually reducing the amount of oxygen that 
<br/>we are using.  We are now in a project which includes us and Cure Kids where we want to be able to 
<br/>make all our small outlying health centres and nursing stations, being able to make their own oxygen, 
<br/>with electricity either from the grid or through solar so that they are not dependent on oxygen being 
<br/>brought across in cylinders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, lastly I just want to touch again on another issue that was brought to hand by 
<br/>the Public Accounts Committee – the Bulk Purchasing Scheme.  I want to assure you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>that we have done regular reviews and that as part of our logistics supply chain management reform, 
<br/></span><span>we have included that in there.  Honourable Radrodro, just before I sit down, also raised the issue of 
<br/>Free Medicine Programme.  If he was reading the news, he would have seen that about one month 
<br/>ago we just relaunched a reformed Free Medicine Programme in which we have done several things 
<br/>including making sure that there were better controls, making sure that the agreements between the 
<br/>pharmacies that were going to be working with us were vetted through the Solicitor-General’s Office, 
<br/>making  sure  that  prices  were  agreed  on,  on  the  140  medicines  that  are  on  the  Free  Medicine 
<br/>Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also involved many more Fijians on the Free Medicine Programme and other things 
<br/>we have changed around.  The first time around that we ran this, we actually stocked the shelves of 
<br/>the participating pharmacies with our own medicine.  We have gone away from that.  We realised 
<br/>that in some instances that did not work very well but we do now know is that of the agreed medicines 
<br/>that they have, they issue their own stock and government then pays them.  That is the reform that 
<br/>has  been  done  and  that  came  out  in  the  news  and  also  in  the  media  release  about  a  month  ago, 
<br/>honourable Radrodro and I hope that next time he would look at the news because that will keep him 
<br/>informed.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for the Report.  I also 
<br/></span><span>thank honourable Aseri Radrodro for laying out all the issues in a number of Ministries.  But before 
<br/>I say a little bit more, Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to respond to honourable Vijay Nath.  He said ‘I 
<br/>was kicked out of the Public Accounts Committee’. He is probably not aware that his government 
<br/>was the one that changed the standing orders of the Public Accounts Committee which always had 
<br/>an Opposition Member to chair the meeting and obviously they did not like the work that  I was doing 
<br/>and the Committee was doing under me as the Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, and they 
<br/>brought  a motion  to  change the Standing Orders so  that their Government  Member can chair the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee and all committees and they have the majority of the Members, I was 
<br/>not kicked out. Once they changed the Standing Orders, I resigned from the chairman of the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee so get that right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  respond  to  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  I  think  he 
<br/>mumbled somewhere that there was an investigation.  Yes, there was a crook who rented my house, 
<br/>did not pay rent for more than 12 months, I was generous enough to keep him there then he falsely 
<br/>went …

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I will tell you what my point of order is.  The Point of order is very 
<br/>simple,  we  are  debating  a  Public  Accounts  Committee’s  Report.    The  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Economic Affairs Report has been debated.  Please if you want to speak, stick to the report.  Thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He just does not understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they spoke 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, you the one who does not understand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Such a crazy Point of Order, so I just wanted to respond to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Attorney-General, obviously the crook took away more than $10,000 ....  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I think you are going crazy with Rabuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and when he got convicted, he falsely went and complained 
<br/>that he was charged higher rent and obviously, the Commerce Commission found that it was a false 
<br/>allegation.  He did not say that Mr. Speaker, Sir, but it was interesting that he got the text message 
<br/>from the CEO, that is the point that I was making that independent organisations need to be careful 
<br/>how they communicate with Government Ministers because they are also politicians, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>not only us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Speak on the Report … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  So,  thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  but  let  me  come  back  to  the 
<br/>Report.  As I said, I want to thank honourable Aseri Radrodro for pointing out all the anomalies in 
<br/></span><span>the different Ministries, but I am not going to repeat all those specific issues and he has also talked 
<br/></span><span>about the recommendations which I support.  I think the recommendations Mr. Speaker, Sir, make a 
<br/>lot of sense, but what honourable Radrodro highlighted shows how these things happened and why 
<br/>they happened. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can tell you Mr. Speaker, Sir, the year 2017 and year 2018 (which was the Election year) 
<br/>saw  probably  one  of  the  most  reckless  economic  governance  and  government  expenditure 
<br/>management ever in the history of this country.  Because what happened in 2017 and 2018, just prior 
<br/>to  the  Elections  (and  this  is  why  it  is  very  important  for  us  to  understand  the  role  of  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee and the role of the Auditor-General) what happened was, this Government, in 
<br/>its drive to remain in power went overboard in their expenditure, so a lot of the controls, policies, 
<br/>adherence to proper practices were set aside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You had home care, agriculture care, you had the housing assistance, the health ministry and 
<br/>a lot of things that the Auditor-General picked up are really because of the recklessness and the nature 
<br/>of control that they had of the expenditure. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The quality of spending in fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, all Public Accounts Committees around the 
<br/>world do not ignore the quality of spending.  They spend some time, what we call Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>be  affirm  value  for  money  examinations  are  vital  because  if  you  do  not  have  value  for  money 
<br/>examinations by a Public Accounts Committee which reports to Parliament, you are bound to create 
<br/>a situation where the public expenditure or the taxpayers funds will be wasted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have said this in Parliament before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the way the Government 
<br/>went on borrowing and spending spree in between 2015 and right up to 2018, you would see, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, the level of wastage through pilferage, mismanagement and you can go on and on.  I have 
<br/>said that some of the estimates that we can make in about six years between 2015 and 2020, we have 
<br/>probably wasted on average about $5 million a year.  A total of about $3 billion wastage based on 
<br/>the allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If this Government has the courage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they 
<br/>would  have  an  independent  inquiry  into  the  quality  of  spending  and  wastage.    Do  that,  get  an 
<br/>independent inquiry and come back to the Parliament and say what I am saying is wrong. This is the 
<br/></span><span>level of wastage that has happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue with respect to this Report, the financial control is at the apex of the Parliament 
<br/>system and basically what we see in this Report and the result that had been mentioned by honourable 
<br/>Radrodro,  we  have  made  this  Public  Accounts  Committee  weak  because  we  have  changed  the 
<br/>Standing Orders. We have basically reduced them to looking at where the money has gone, how it 
<br/>has gone and the sort of spending.  In the Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need a quality debate on 
<br/>policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They say we cannot question policies. The Public Accounts Committee which comprises of 
<br/>Members of the Parliament must have the ability to make recommendations, bring questions about 
<br/>policy  which  they  see  that  has  led  to  wastage,  which  has  led  to  pilferage  and  not  led  to  quality 
<br/>spending. There are a lot of examples out there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is very clear, that we have not 
<br/>been able to take steps to reduce.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Accounts Committee is an exposed thing.  Once the expenditure is done, why the 
<br/>Auditor-General has then produced the Report and that too maybe two or three years later. When the 
<br/>expenditure have been undertaken, comes to the PAC and PAC can only look at what is exposed, 
<br/></span><span>what had happened and make recommendations.  I know right now what has happened to the Office 
<br/></span><span>of the Auditor-General and how the Government has interfered. We had a case of a Report which 
<br/>was presented to Parliament by the Auditor-General which then got changed through the interference 
<br/>of the Government by the Ministry of Economy.  If the Report was wrong, it still should have gone 
<br/>to the Public Accounts Committee.  It is the job of the Public Accounts Committee to come back to 
<br/>the Parliament and say this was wrong, this aspect of Auditor-General was not correct after a proper 
<br/>enquiry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we get and I would be talking about this tomorrow when we will 
<br/>look  at  the  assessment  of  the  Auditor-General  Report  itself  but  what  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro 
<br/>highlighted is the result of lack of control, lack of teeth by the Public Accounts Committee, lack of 
<br/>resources by the Public Accounts Committee which we will discuss tomorrow which had resulted in 
<br/>this and the political interference is the biggest thing because under this constitution, the Ministers 
<br/>interference in the work of Permanent Secretaries once and Mr. Speaker, Sir, you know this very 
<br/>well.  Once the Budget is passed by the Parliament and all the expenditure is allocated, the Ministers 
<br/>have no role.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know in the past, there was a Minister who went to the Permanent Secretary and said, can 
<br/>you do this? The Permanent Secretary actually told the Minister that he does not have any role in 
<br/>this. The Budget has been approved by the Parliament and the Permanent Secretary is  the Budget 
<br/>controller but what is happening is that, the Ministers are interfering in the way the Ministries run 
<br/>and there is evidence of that.  Some may not be doing it but I know there are Ministers who do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I can name all of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You know who they are.  You have interfered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know tender processes have been interfered too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Tender processes have been interfered too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not ask me, honourable Attorney-General… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Have  an  Independent  Inquiry,  if  they  have  the  guts,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, they should have an Independent Inquiry, get the Independent Inquiry into the way that 
<br/>is  political  interference in  the expenditure of Government.   Then come out  with  a report and say 
<br/>whether it is true or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who let the dogs out? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They think it is a joke but the people … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are a joke. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But the people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, know because what they did 
<br/>in 2017 and 2018 showed up in 2019 after the Election there was a total lack of confidence, they 
<br/>were hiding on Level 9 that destroyed the confidence… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1185 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the reports by international 
<br/>organisations showed that we had actually negative growth in 2019, because Government went on a 
<br/>spending spree and there were so much wastage basically the physical space was already reduced to 
<br/>2019.  So that is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very, very important for us to understand the role, the 
<br/>Constitutional watchdog that needs to look at every aspect of Government expenditure because $1 
<br/>that goes to waste is a taxpayers money, $1 that is wasted could go to someone who needs it, could 
<br/>provide free medicine where honourable Aseri Radrodro talked about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So this is the link, Mr Speaker, Sir, and we must as a Parliament, as Members of the Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee and others take this very, very seriously and have investigations where it is 
<br/>appropriate to ensure that all the recommendations, all the policies and all the processes are adhere 
<br/>to  so  that  we  do  not  waste  money.    I  mean  we  cannot  control  everything,  there  has  always  been 
<br/>wastage,  there  is  always  been  Auditor-General’s  Report  in  the  past  that  attacked  Government 
<br/>Ministries and Government that is correct.  So, we are not  going to  get  100 percent of it but, Mr 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it is still important that we keep striving to make sure that we do not spend or waste a 
<br/>single dollar of the tax payers money in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the debate.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee and the Chairperson for scrutinising the Report.  The Report 
<br/>of the 2017  –  2018 Whole of Government  and the Committee that compiled this  report were the 
<br/>Public  Accounts  Committee  Members  appointed  in  the  2014  –  2018  Parliamentary  Team  and 
<br/>therefore majority of the issues mentioned in this report has been addressed across all the ministries.  
<br/>For instance, I would like to speak on those under my portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I have looked at some of the issues raised for the Department of Immigration now 
<br/>known as Fijian Immigration Department. On Page 21 of the report where it talks about the internal 
<br/>control measures of the Department.  I would like to assure this august House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>these control measures have been strengthened.  The Department has since improved its adherence 
<br/>to the Financial Instruction 2010, it worked with the Minister of Economy in 2019 to create separate 
<br/>revenue collection accounts in the FMIS system for the different types of revenue collection namely; 
<br/>Passports, Permits, Citizenship, Visa and Search Fees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, importantly the amendments of the Immigration Act 2003 in 2020 ensured 
<br/>totality of the fundamentals of the Immigration Regulation for its day to day application.  And you 
<br/></span><span>will agree, Mr. Speaker, that the Department has since improved its service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Speaker, I focus my attention now to the Ministry’s 
<br/>key  initiatives  that  were  developed  and  implemented  in  response  to  the  recommendations  which 
<br/>include the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Ministry of Economy’s Finance Manual in 2019. 
<br/>Issues of the first ever overseas Missions’ Finance Guidelines in 2019 with the intent to 
<br/>provide clear guidance to Diplomats with limited financial background. 
<br/>Set up of a framework for timely feedback to Missions regarding monthly acquittals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Use of financial checklist for any payment made. 
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conduct of internal audit, both in Headquarters and Missions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am confident that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ discussions with the Ministry of Economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will resolve the unreconciled variance-related issues by the end of the current 2021-2022 financial 
<br/>period. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is particularly important to note that whilst this has been a longstanding issue, 
<br/>there has been no financial loss.  The variance is purely an issue related to book adjustment that needs 
<br/>to be carried out to correctly reflect the Missions’ bank balances against the General Ledger balances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  case  of  the  Ministry  of  Forestry,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  acknowledges  the 
<br/>recommendations by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and has addressed the issues raised in 
<br/>the Report in the following manner: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revolving Fund Account outstanding balance from previous years of $351,087 has been 
<br/>progressively cleared, and we now have only $21,934 to be cleared by this month – May 
<br/>2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reconciliation of salaries and wages are carried out weekly and submitted to the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy weekly.  There are no more variances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Mispostings  in  the  REDD+  account  have  been  cleared.    The  Trade  and  Manufacturing 
<br/>Account (TMA) has been resolved with the Ministry of Economy, approving the closure 
<br/>of the TMA by the end of July this year.  The balance of $1.4 million will be transferred to 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry of Economy by end of July 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Whole  of  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  a  generic  issue  that  was  raised  in  the 
<br/>Consolidated  Audit  Report  is  the  management  of  various  Trust  Fund  Accounts  held  across 
<br/>Government Ministries, such as the Ministry of Fisheries, Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government and the Ministry of Environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  embarked  on  the  review  of  all  Trust  Fund 
<br/>Accounts  to  determine  eligible  trust  accounts  and  has  worked  closely  with  various  Ministries  to 
<br/>ensure  they  perform  their  reconciliations  on  a  timely  basis,  and  to  safeguard  internal  control 
<br/>mechanisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure this august House that many of the issues 
<br/>raised  in  the  Report  have  been  addressed.    Various  Ministries  have  since  implemented  risk 
<br/>management  policies  through  the  prudent  Financial  Management  Act  and  embedded  these 
<br/>improvements in their individual ministerial strategic policies and operational plans. Based on those 
<br/>remarks, Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, on that note, I intend to now adjourn for lunch and 
<br/></span><span>we will resume debate on this motion after lunch.  This is the order of the speakers after lunch, so be 
<br/>ready when we resume: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for  Economy,  Civil  Service  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you want to speak, put your name on the list.  You know the procedure, you have a Whip, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so put it on the list.  If it is not on the list, you will not speak. We adjourn for lunch.

<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  Member  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/>Accounts, I take this opportunity to speak in support of the motion on the review of the 2017-2018 
<br/>Whole of Government Consolidated Audited Report.  To reply to some of the issues raised earlier 
<br/>today, I rise to make a few contributions towards the social services sector, namely, the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services and the Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General had highlighted a number of issues in his report at the time of the audit 
<br/>however the Committee was advised of the following action plans that the Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services is currently undertaking in their efforts to ensure that in future audits, its financial 
<br/>statements will be issued with an unmodified audit opinion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has established a forum for all 12 accountants from the 12 different centres to 
<br/>meet and discuss accounting issues relating to their cost centres, accounts preparation and finalisation 
<br/>of  the  Ministries  Financial  Statements.    Before  the  financial  year  end  a  series  of  discussions  and 
<br/></span><span>verifications are made which also includes the verification of the Ministries growing reconciliations.  
<br/></span><span>The late submission and finalisation of the Ministries growing reconciliations has been a contributing 
<br/>factor for the delay in the finalisation of the Annual Financial Statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently the Ministry has been submitting the draft financial statements on a timely manner 
<br/>as dictated under the Ministry of Economy finance circular on closing of accounts.  It is important to 
<br/>note that the Ministry is conducting regular follow-ups with the respective responsible officers in 
<br/>order to submit comments in relation to the audit queries raised and ensure that it reaches the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General in a timely manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of safeguarding and record keeping the Committee was advised 
<br/>that the Ministry has adequate space for safekeeping of documents however the maintaining of very 
<br/>old  records  was  a  challenge  as  these  records  occupied  a  lot  of  space  within  the  Ministry.    The 
<br/>Committee was further informed that the Ministry has now destroyed old records dating from 2000 
<br/>to 2012 as per the approval provided by the National Archives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has again submitted its request to the Ministry of Economy to discard records 
<br/>dating from 2013 to 2014.  Once approval from the Ministry of Economy is granted the prospective 
<br/></span><span>approval is also sought from the Office of the Auditor-General, the Fiji Independent Commission 
<br/></span><span>Against Corruption (FICAC) and the Public Accounts Committee before the National Archives can 
<br/>give the final approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of the capital purchases and capital construction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OAG had 
<br/>highlighted that capital construction expenditure had decreased by $3.5 million in 2018 compared to 
<br/>2017.  Where funding was allocated to certain projects, payments were only made when the Ministry 
<br/>projects  were fully completed.  The slow supply of building materials  from  the suppliers and the 
<br/>adverse weather conditions during the period under review were the main challenges that affected 
<br/>the utilisation of the capital construction budget.  Furthermore capital purchases increased by $1.7 
<br/>million in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the increase in cost of equipment, ICT infrastructure and 
<br/>networking materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was informed that the Ministry usually requests for budget 
<br/>on best case scenarios on execution of projects, however majority of the time is not feasible due to 
<br/>the various factors which leads up to the delay of the projects including unfavourable weather, supply

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  materials,  labour  rework  or  defects  noted,  delays  in  approval  processes  and  shipping  delays 
<br/>amongst other factors.   The Ministry has now plans to complete part of the planning and procurement 
<br/>processing before the new budget cycle particularly for SEG 9.  For the information of this august 
<br/>Parliament,  capital  construction  budget  is  usually  determined  through  the  project  consultants  and 
<br/>project administrators that is the construction implementation unit of the Ministry of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 28 Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee  questions  that  were  raised  to  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  and  I  am 
<br/>pleased to report that the statements provided by the Ministry were satisfactory in terms of addressing 
<br/>the audit anomalies and strengthening the Ministries internal controls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed that the current practice is that the Ministry notes the timelines 
<br/>mentioned in  the closing of accounts circular.  The Manager Finance coordinates with  respective 
<br/>units in finance to  ensure team  leaders are well informed and frequent  meetings  are scheduled to 
<br/>update the progress, challenges and the way forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is ensuring that timely processing of documents to offset any negative balances 
<br/>in  the  Financial  Management  Information  System  (FMIS)  so  that  correct  expenditure  could  be 
<br/></span><span>reflected for every item. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Transport Service Agreement and Transport Assistant Policy Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the time 
<br/>of the scrutiny of the Audit Report as well as the Ministry’s written response, the Transport Draft 
<br/>Service Agreement was under consultation with Vodafone Fiji Limited as the electronic transport 
<br/>provider.  Once the consultation process concluded the Agreement was sent to the Solicitor-General’s 
<br/>office  for  final  vetting.    Implementation  followed  as  soon  as  the  approval  was  sought  from  the 
<br/>Solicitor-General’s Office.  The tentative time for the implementation was July 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Policy and Standing Operating Procedure (SOP) will be implementing processes that will 
<br/>strengthen the internal controls around the transport assistance of the ministry and will outline regular 
<br/>reporting  and  monitoring  of  e-transport  services  and  confirmation  on  income  eligibility.    The 
<br/>Committee was further informed that the Ministry has drafted the Transport Assistance Policy and 
<br/>SOP for Transport Assistance and once the policy is approved and implemented the SOP will then 
<br/>be implemented accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) - the recruitment 
<br/>took  place  between  2017  to  2018  during  which  there  was  transitioning  period  to  the  OMRS 
<br/></span><span>guidelines.  A reform for the Human Resources Department was underway during that period.  It was 
<br/></span><span>understood that very few staff were fully trained on the OMRS procedures and therefore the work 
<br/>done was not verified as much as it is done now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ministry had ensured that the HR Department staff should be given priority to take up 
<br/>OMRS Training in the first three months of their appointment of service.  Furthermore Sir, additional 
<br/>training in-house and through the Ministry of Civil of Service is done under necessary equipment 
<br/>and selection tools and procedures.  Panel members are briefed and thoroughly advised by the HR 
<br/>representative,  who  undertakes  accountability  for  each  vacancy  process  as  opposed  to  prior 
<br/>September 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  minimum  qualification  and  experience  are  identified  prior  to  advertisement  of  a  role 
<br/>through  an  approved  role  description  to  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  Education  along  with  the 
<br/>selection panel interview and short listing is based on this minimum qualification and experience in 
<br/>a form of a marking criteria approved by the panel and filed by the responsible HR representative.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1189 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper  record  keeping  is  practised  by  respective  HR  officers  through  timely  filing  and 
<br/>updating of shared drives.  A recruitment register is updated every week and reports can be generated 
<br/>through the current process.  Every recruitment process is verified by the Officer-In-Charge.  The 
<br/>Senior HR Officer, the Manager, Team Leader Recruitment and Selection and Head of HR, before it 
<br/>is despatched to the Permanent Secretary and the honourable Minister for approval and endorsement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of the ministry vacancies are now given provision for online application, therefore, the 
<br/>documentation can be found online such as Curriculum Vitae (CV), certificates and transcripts.  This 
<br/>came into operation since 2019.  The Ministry has formed an internal qualification and audit team 
<br/>that verifies the qualifications of recruitments prior to 2019.  As for the missing documentation about 
<br/>panel agreement, the manager responsible at that time of the audit had left the post without any proper 
<br/>handovers in August 2018.  The current document are securely filed and are available for audit and 
<br/>future reference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  without  proper  handover  in  such  scenarios,  the  reform,  replenish, 
<br/>recruitment and selection team with a set of new officers in 2018 have ensured that standards are 
<br/>achieved  in  line  with  OMRS  guidelines.    All  officers  in  the  Recruitment  and  Selection  Unit  are 
<br/>OMRS certified and are graduates with minimum Degree qualification in HR and relevant experience 
<br/></span><span>in  HR  roles.    OMRS  refresher  course  is  done  very  often  and  all  processes  are  followed  as  per 
<br/></span><span>favourable responses from recent audit by the Ministry of Civil Service in April 2021 and no appeals 
<br/>being upheld in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  advised  that  the  contract  renewal  process  requires 
<br/>verification  of  teacher  registrations.    This  process  has  been  in  place  prior  to  2020.    Continuing 
<br/>teachers whose contracts are expiring are reminded by HR to renew their registrations.  Due to the 
<br/>volume of teacher contract renewals and all efforts not to cause disruptions in the teachers’ salaries, 
<br/>the Ministry does not hold the contract renewal process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Continuous  reminders  by  HR  for  teachers  to  renew  their  registrations,  the  remaining 
<br/>processes in terms of administration of registrations and update of Fiji education staff appointment 
<br/>are  completed  by  Fiji  Teachers  Registration  Authority  (FTRA)  after  all  necessary  documents  are 
<br/>received.  It is to be noted that teachers lodge their FTRA registration at the education office located 
<br/>in the nine districts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the event where documentation does not reach FTRA office for processing, these are not 
<br/>registered by FTRA and thus are not reflected in education staff appointment records.  In view of 
<br/></span><span>this, Sir, some factors that may have contributed to the late registrations whilst the Committee was 
<br/></span><span>reviewing the Ministry’s response are that FTRA may have received the documentation and due to 
<br/>oversight in filing administration work, some renewals may not be processed and not reflected on 
<br/>Fiji education staff appointment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, incomplete applications received in other centres including FTRA Office, in some 
<br/>cases  resulting  in  applications  being  put  on  hold  without  any  follow-ups  leading  to  the  non-
<br/>processing  of  these  applications  in  the  Fiji  education  staff  appointment  by  FTRA.    In  order  to 
<br/>strengthen the above processes, the Ministry has also placed a notice on Fiji Education Management 
<br/>Information  System  (FEMIS)  as  a  reminder  to  teachers  that  they  need  to  have  valid  teacher 
<br/>registration in order to teach in classrooms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of all honourable Members, there is an email disclaimer that accompanies 
<br/>all contracts that are renewed.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this disclaimer is part of the email only and not 
<br/>incorporated in the contract document.  The actual contract is a standard document used across all 
<br/>government ministries.  The Committee has also noted that FTRA registrations are for three years as

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per  the  Fiji  Teachers  Registration  Authority  Act  whereas  the  teacher  remuneration  policy  allows 
<br/>teachers  to  have  five-year  contracts  so  there  would  be  teachers  with  valid  contracts  whose 
<br/>registrations expire within the contract period.  It is understood that IT provides reports on such cases 
<br/>and FTRA has been following up with these teachers to renew their registrations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the OAG in carrying out a total of 39 audits for the ministries 
<br/>and  departments  including  the  remaining  audits  at  the  end  of  the  2017-2018  financial  year.    The 
<br/>Committee  has  taken  note  of  the  various  improvements  and  action  plans  of  these  ministries  in 
<br/>ensuring that they will strengthen their internal control processes, alleviate financial mismanagement 
<br/>and  uphold  Fiji’s  requirements  for  the  Financial  Management  Act  2014  and  its  regulations.    Mr.  
<br/>Speaker, Sir, with those words, I support the motion that is before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  this  motion  before  the  House  is  on  the  2017-2018 
<br/>Whole of Government Audit Report which was tabled before the House on 8th February this year 
<br/>and I am just looking at the recommendations, Sir, which are 3, 4 and 6 and these recommendations 
<br/>touch on trust accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Aseri Radrodro spoke on a few issues that I have here so I will not repeat those, 
<br/></span><span>however, just on the first paragraph here, Mr. Speaker, one of the key recommendations or findings 
<br/></span><span>of this Report which was a basis for qualified audit opinion, was in regard to trust fund accounts, 
<br/>included in the trust fund account balance of $197.7 million in the statement of assets and liabilities 
<br/>is the main trust amounting to $161.2 million.  The main trust fund account balance amounting to 
<br/>$78.4 million was not supported with proper documentation to include detailed listing of claimants 
<br/>of  the  monies  held  in  the  trust.    Therefore  the  audit  was  unable  to  ascertain  the  accuracy  and 
<br/>completeness of the trust fund account balance of $197.7 million as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> of July, 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  can  you  imagine  if  this  was  a  law  firm,  unable  to  properly  and  accurately 
<br/>account for this amount of money - $197.7 million?  It would have been struck off the register and 
<br/>the lawyers jailed.  How come Government and those responsible for it are allowed to get away with 
<br/>mismanagement of trust funds year after year?  For trust funds and the Ministry for Employment, 
<br/>Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations,  the  Ministry  receipted  service  fees  of  $60,000  from  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Civil  Service  under  the  shared  services  agreement  with  the  OHS  Consultancy  Trust 
<br/>instead of the consolidated fund account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is highly improper Mr. Speaker, Sir, as pointed out by the office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>as trust funds’ terms and conditions are mandated to operate within very strict guidelines.  For the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, included in the Trust Fund Account and received from 
<br/></span><span>Rural Housing Scheme $1.74 million; one third was on self-help projects ($553,661), there was no 
<br/>listing and no breakdown given and no idea Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next one Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force receipts totally $84,542 and payments 
<br/>amounting to $66,485 were made during the period ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> of July, 2018.  There was no record 
<br/>of this in the FMIS General ledger as the Fiji Police Force did not include the Trust Fund Account, 
<br/>Statement of receipts and payments for the Force’s trust fund account as part of its agency financial 
<br/>statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport’s trust account balance of 
<br/>$2,445,195 as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 on which the closing balance comprised refunds for FEA grid and 
<br/>house wiring, and bond payment for projects and revenue bills collective from solar home systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry again was a bit slack here Mr. Speaker, Sir, because detailed information was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not given which was relevant to the details of this trust fund account.  Those are just a few of the  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1191 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ones that I have which were not mentioned this morning by honourable Aseri Radrodro.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the trust accounts held by some ministries, but very worrying is the fact that some issues 
<br/>with these trust accounts is the internal control of ministries were even though OMRS is supposed to 
<br/>realise the best fit between the staff member and the job, it does not seem to be working so well.  A 
<br/>lot of training honourable Minister, monitoring and supervision still need to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outsourcing may look on paper to be cost-effective but in the long run the Civil Service is 
<br/>going  to  be  the  poorer  for  it  as  it  could  give  the  impression  that  the  Ministry,  through  OMRS  is 
<br/>getting highly qualified experienced people from overseas for example Permanent Secretaries.  At 
<br/>the end of the day, it is the local staff weigh down the salary scale who end up teaching these hot 
<br/>shots from overseas many of whom do not stay long and then shortly after they sight personal reasons 
<br/>for  their  sudden  departure.    Then  those  lower  down  the  scale  on  short  contracts  are  not  given 
<br/>opportunity for relevant training besides which there is no institutional knowledge because no one 
<br/>stays long enough, no wonder Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a common thread running through the various 
<br/>ministries audit reports which sight weak internal controls as the main issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So in conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, trust accounts up to this audit period 2017-2018 were the 
<br/></span><span>responsibilities of the various ministries.  It is however now in a main trust fund in the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Economy, is that a new policy of the FijiFirst Government?  Since when has it become a policy of 
<br/>Government meaning that if it is a government policy, the merits of that policy according to Standing 
<br/>Orders 109(2)(d) that it cannot be questioned either by the Committee or by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  the  Auditor-General  cannot  question  the  merits  of  this  policy,  who  can  question  it,  Mr 
<br/>Speaker?  Why is the Fiji Government weakening the Public Accounts Committee and the Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General? Why are they taking away the independence of the Auditor-General? Where 
<br/>has the autonomy of the OAG gone? Why have they taken away that independence? What are they 
<br/>afraid of Mr Speaker, Sir? Who will then audit the main trust fund? (We are looking for this item) 
<br/>Where in the Budget is this main trust fund?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So in terms of good governance, accountability, checks and balances, who gives the oversight 
<br/>that is needed there?  How can we be certain that there is nothing untoward that is happening there?  
<br/>It makes people very suspicious as it raises more questions than answers especially where there is 
<br/>main trust fund account being in the Ministry of Economy that cannot be audited as according to the 
<br/>Standing Orders, the Committee and the OAG must not examine the merits of the underlying policy 
<br/></span><span>so that is where some of the difficulties are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of these Audit Reports with 
<br/></span><span>the Committee and the Auditor-General not being able to really fulfil the task that has been given to 
<br/>it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as with my other colleagues, we do welcome the 
<br/>comments  from  the  Auditor-General’s  Office  with  the  view  to  improve  service  delivery.  As  the 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad has alluded to earlier on for Value for Money (VFM). Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>in the process of service delivery there can be at times lapses, sometimes it is a perception on the 
<br/>other side and those perceptions need to be clarified and sometimes our staff do in the process when 
<br/>under pressure do make mistakes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, in terms of governance issues, it is a continuous process. We need to ensure that 
<br/>every year when we get Reports, we action or deal with it immediately. Secondly, we also have now 
<br/>appointed internal audit team so that we do not get audit reports at the end of the year, we get them 
<br/>on a regular basis, on a monthly basis so that we deal with it immediately. Following the 2017 and 
<br/>2018 Report, the Ministry began fresh by undertaking an overall reorganisation of the structure. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>1192 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>functional heads, now following the organisational restructure have much clearer accountabilities, 
<br/>control and governance issues as part of their core delivery.  So it has been made very clear to the 
<br/>functional heads that the buck stops with you and therefore you need to ensure that regularly you talk 
<br/>to your staff, regularly you get updates on service delivery because that is where at times audit issues 
<br/>come up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key roles within are within the Head of Finance, Head of Operations, Head of Research, 
<br/>Head of  HR, and Head  of Economic Development  under the new structure. So Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>following that there is a separate Audit and Compliance Team reporting directly to the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary.  This Audit and Compliance Team no longer reports to the Head of Finance.  For example, 
<br/>there  is  a  procurement  being  undertaken  independently.    The  Compliance  and  Audit  Team  will 
<br/>examine the procurement process whether it confirms with the Ministry of Economy’s Procurement 
<br/>Guidelines, whether they are any lapses and reports directly to the Permanent Secretary for immediate 
<br/>action to  be undertaken, not  that  we  wait at  the  end of the  year or 18 months when the  Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report comes in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that account, a new procurement function has been setup under the new 
<br/>structure  to  strengthen  the  internal  control  processes.    For  example,  part  of  the  internal  control 
<br/></span><span>processes  is  that,  we  must  ensure  that  before  authorising  any  payments  every  aspect  of  the 
<br/></span><span>procurement is delivered to other supplier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also had issues with vacant positions.  At that particular point in time, 
<br/>during  that  year,  to  some  reasons  or  the  other,  it  was  quite  a  number  of  vacant  positions  in  that 
<br/>particular year.  So these had been now filled appropriately and every officer are given a particular 
<br/>checklist on the key governance issue that they must comply in their service delivery process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also undertaking a regular training of our staff, apart from the new 
<br/>recruits who came in immediately in the first week, they have been undertaken through a regular 
<br/>training process, particularly on governance issues checklist that we have developed for them to deal 
<br/>with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also established a new format of how our clientele would apply for 
<br/>the various programmes that we have in the Ministry. There were issues raised in terms of clienteles 
<br/>not being aware or not been given the chance to apply for various programmes.  We have taken a 
<br/>major democratisation of our government grants through the Ministry of Agriculture where anyone 
<br/>can apply through the online application process, there is no restriction and there is a separate team 
<br/></span><span>at the Head Office to receive data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, immediately, the data will be compiled and then it will be sent to various districts where 
<br/>our Agriculture Assistant Officers will verify these applicants.  For example, if someone is applying 
<br/>for fencing material for goat and sheep, the officer will verify whether they really have a farm, a land 
<br/>and they do have the minimum required number of goat and sheep to meet the first requirement to 
<br/>be eligible to go into the shortlist.  This is in response to complaints we have received, that this farmer 
<br/>receive a fencing material but the farmer does not have any goat and sheep, et cetera and the material 
<br/>was sold. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the final decision of who will get those grants are made by the Chaired PS 
<br/>and  the  two  other  PS’s  or  their  nominees  the  PS  -  Economy  and  PS  -  Rural  and  Maritime  and 
<br/>Development and our Director-Policy who sits in that particular Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  number  of  changes  have  been  made  to  ensure  that  the  Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resources are put to the best use and to get the maximum value out of it, everyone has an equal

<div><span>opportunity to apply and to improve the efficiency of service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue that was  raised earlier on by honourable Aseri Radrodro 
<br/>regarding the Trust Fund in the Ministry of Environment.  By law, we have a Trust Fund, it is called 
<br/>the Environment Trust Fund. The primary objective of the Trust Fund is to hold Government.  As all 
<br/>of us know that the money held in the trust does not belong to us.  We accept the money, paid as 
<br/>bond and it is kept there, should there be any rehabilitation work that needs to be undertaken, that 
<br/>work should be undertaken by the investor, if not then this money will be utilised to undertake the 
<br/>rehabilitation work and then the remaining money will be refunded. So that money is held in the 
<br/>Trust Account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an issue raised by the Auditor-General that it was not reconciled.  
<br/>It was not reconciled because the updating of the trust account money was not undertaken on time 
<br/>due to staffing issues.  As I speak now, there is a proper reconciliation of the trust account money.  
<br/>All the money that was paid into the trust account for bond purposes, all those are in the trust account 
<br/>except those which have been refunded to the investors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue that was raised by honourable Aseri Radrodro about compensation of staff 
<br/></span><span>who were engaged in dredging works at Sigatoka River and Nakauvadra River, et cetera, that is not 
<br/></span><span>our responsibility, Sir.  Dredging companies are hired to undertake work.  They have a fleet of staff, 
<br/>it is their responsibility to look after them, in terms of compensation, fair wages and all the other 
<br/>requirements under the Industrial Relations Act.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure this Parliament 
<br/>that the Ministry today is doing an excellent job in terms of ensuring that Government resources are 
<br/>utilised for the intended purposes is number one, number two in a most efficient manner and number 
<br/>three, with all governance requirements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to contribute briefly to the motion before 
<br/>the House.  Like my fellow colleagues who have spoken before me, the Committee has made an 
<br/>excellent work </span><span>to</span><span> improve the systems and processes.  I would like to commend the Chairman and 
<br/>the Committee Members for this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have witnessed the existing anomalies in the report and of worthy to 
<br/>note are the six important recommendations that are reflected and moving forward relevant issues 
<br/>that are identified must not be repeated in future.  The recommendations as stated must be actioned 
<br/>and implemented.   The report, especially on Heads 21 and 26 with a modified audit opinion for 2018 
<br/>is an indication of laxity on the part of the Ministry. A classic example is the issue of expenditures 
<br/></span><span>amounting to $2.1 million and also $1.4 million for Established Staff and Wage Earners and have 
<br/></span><span>not been included in the Statement of Receipts and Expenditure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the performance of reconciliations on a timely basis, this can only be successful if the 
<br/>rules of the game in terms of compliance are carried out as failure to do so will affect the timely 
<br/>deliverance of Government services.  Further, Sir, these expenditures are included in Head 50 under 
<br/>Miscellaneous  Services,  Appropriate  Financial  Statements,  and  as  a  result,  the  Established  Staff 
<br/>amount of $315 million and Government Wage Earners expenditures of $5 million for the Ministry 
<br/>are understated by the said amount.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Included in the operating grants and transfers, the account balance of $107 million is the Bus 
<br/>Fare Assistance Programme amounting to $27.6 million.  The Ministry was not able to provide a 
<br/>detailed  background  of  payments  made  to  the  supplier  amounting  to  $3.8  million.    As  such,  the 
<br/>Committee noted that the audit could not confirm the accuracy and completeness of operating grants 
<br/>and transfers, account balances reflected in the Statement of Receipts and Expenditure.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further,  Sir,  internal  controls  over  payroll,  revenue  and  free  education  grant  which  were 
<br/>generally found to be weak during the audit made by the Office of the Auditor-General and this is a 
<br/>matter of concern as a taxpayer.  This relates to overpayments in payroll, maintenance of recruitment 
<br/>documents, misallocation of revenue and the utilisation of free education grant in accordance with 
<br/>the prescribed allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted,  Sir,  that  if  these  matters  were  not  addressed  promptly,  these  weak 
<br/>controls may result in material mis-statements and financial implications in future and may lead to 
<br/>mismanagement of funds and corrupt practices.  The Public Accounts Committee had rightly pointed 
<br/>out  the  weak  internal  controls  which  is  highlighted  in  their  fourth  recommendation  and  hope  the 
<br/>Ministry will take this on board in order to improve their financial performances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education should put in place measures and strategies to 
<br/>address such issues that were highlighted by the Audit Office.  Most importantly, Sir, the Fiji Higher 
<br/>Education Commission and the Ministry of Education should work together in carrying out research 
<br/>on  the  review  of  all  its  processes  on  how  to  address  the  issues  of  surplus  or  supply  of  graduate 
<br/>teachers and the low demand of the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  solution  should  be  implemented  and  highlighted  through  to  tertiary 
<br/></span><span>institutions  who  are  offering  education  programmes  for  our  children.    The  Ministry  should  do 
<br/>something about this.  To ensure that our schools are adequately staffed, the Ministry should work 
<br/>closely and consult with the education officers around the country in identifying members or teachers 
<br/>to fill the necessary vacancies in schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that the Ministry of Education is not sleeping on the job in relation 
<br/>to the issue just been raised and do something about it and not lie to the people of this country, as 
<br/>some may have been waiting months and even years.  With those contributions, Sir, I thank you for 
<br/>this opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>contribute to the debate on this report from the Standing Committee on Public Accounts on the 2017-
<br/>2018 Whole of Government Audit Reports.  I think the role of the Auditor-General in reviewing the 
<br/>work of the Government, is  very important  for our role as Parliamentarians to  make sure that all 
<br/>Government agencies do their jobs well.  I take, in particular, note of the recommendations that are 
<br/>made on page 7 of the Report.   I would like to focus on some of the issues that have been brought 
<br/>up in relation to some of the Departments that I am the Minister for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, I think the honourable Aseri Radrodro has talked about some of the issues with 
<br/>FRA  that  are  highlighted  on  page  9  of  the  Report.    Basically,  in  relation  to  the  money  that  was 
<br/>provided by the World Bank and ADB for the Suva Arterial Roads Upgrading Projects (SARUP 1), 
<br/>which he noted that in the report it said that SARUP 1 will no longer be funded by the ADB and the 
<br/>World Bank, and the Government of Fiji will incur the full cost of the project totalling $30.4 million.  
<br/>I confirm that, that is actually what happened.  What happened at that time was that the FRA changed 
<br/>some of the terms and conditions of the contract with the advice from their in-house legal counsel 
<br/>before the contract was signed by both parties.  Because of that, it did not mean that SARUP 1 project 
<br/>was not  completed, it was completed  and the Government  had to  fund it,  the Government  did  it, 
<br/>because that is what happened here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  part  of  the  audit,  FRA  has  learnt  from  this  and  now  they  have  changed  the  way  they 
<br/>addressed this contract.  To mitigate any further issues like this into the future, the FRA has now 
<br/>adopted the standard form of contract with changes made to safeguard FRA liabilities.  This is in line 
<br/>with the ADB and the World Bank loan covenants.  Since that time, SARUP programmes continues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1195 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be funded by the ADB and the World Bank under the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector 
<br/>Project.  As part of that project, the loan amount that has been made available under the project from 
<br/>the World Bank and ADB is around $350 million, of which, $121 million has already been drawn 
<br/>down, and the work continues to be done utilising these funds from the World Bank and the ADB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rest of the fund is now committed to the upgrade of the Kings and Queens Roads.  If you 
<br/>go onto the Kings and Queens Roads, you will see the substantive work is being  done to upgrade the 
<br/>roads, you go from Korovou or you go all the way from Nadi to Lautoka, as you drive around Viti 
<br/>Levu, you will see that the work is being undertaken to upgrade the roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other portion of that fund is now being used, as mentioned a few times in Parliament, to 
<br/>design of the 40 critical bridges that we have identified from the hundreds of bridges in Fiji that need 
<br/>to be fixed.  The portion of that money is being used for the design of those 40 bridges and the design 
<br/>of three jetties that we need to improve immediately, which is Nabouwalu Jetty, Natovi Jetty and 
<br/>Savusavu Jetty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the issues that have been highlighted on page 9 of the Report, there has been some 
<br/>learning that has taken place, and we continue to improve on the way it is managed within FRA.  At 
<br/></span><span>the same time, I add that the work itself continued and it was not stopped. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  page  66  of  the  Report  talks  about  some  of  the  issues  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources in terms of the trust accounts.    In response to the issues 
<br/>that have been stated on Page 66 I would like to highlight that the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources has now satisfactorily opened a Trust Account with the prior written authority of the Head 
<br/>of Treasury and has also satisfactorily recorded in a separate cash book or a set of ledgers, the receipts 
<br/>and payment of trust money for the financial period year from 2017 to 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in terms of the recommendations that we should get the list of names and balances of 
<br/>each account held in the Trust Account - that work is now being done by the current finance team 
<br/>within the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last issue that was been 
<br/>addressed to the Ministry has been in relation to some of the comments about Head 40 in terms of 
<br/>the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in particular the unreconciled variance of $1.4 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is before the court.  It is currently before the court. 
<br/>There  are  people  being  prosecuted  for  these  things,  so  the  current  staff  that  we  have  had  in  the 
<br/>Ministry have had to deal with anomalies that were passed on to them from previous fraud cases. 
<br/></span><span>There has been ongoing attempt by the Ministry to try to address those unreconciled variations.  There 
<br/></span><span>has been discussions with the Ministry, with the Office of the Solicitor-General to seek approval for 
<br/>writing-off of some of the unsubstantiated variances. It also held discussions with the Ministry of 
<br/>Economy - Asset Management Unit and with the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruptions 
<br/>(FICAC).  So there is an ongoing emphasis to try to clear up these variations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Minister, all of us Ministers, when we walk into a Ministry one of the things that we tell 
<br/>all our ministries is that we want unqualified opinions.  Some of the cases that we have in our Ministry 
<br/>have been going on for 10 years.  In some of these cases we just have to get some of these things 
<br/>written off because we have to move on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  some  of  these  cases  people  are  being  prosecuted  and  those  people  will  continue  to  be 
<br/>prosecuted but it is all part of the ongoing process of making sure that we continue to improve the 
<br/>processes within the Ministry.  At the same time one of the problems that we have had in the past is 
<br/>that  we  have  had  the  wrong  people  doing  this  financial  work.    A  lot  of  people  without  the 
<br/>qualifications and experience were put into positions where they had to do that work.  The OMRS

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we are putting in place now is designed to address precisely this - to make sure that we have the 
<br/>right people and have the right processes. No one is a magic maker or is going to wave a magic wand 
<br/>and abracadabraca it happens in the night.  It is a continuous process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing that this Government did not do was to lose a National  Bank. 
<br/>There are other people now trying to come into Government that have lost National Banks but we 
<br/>know that there is always room for continuous improvement. We never reach perfection but there is 
<br/>continuous improvement all the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to debate the motion 
<br/>by the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee on the Consolidated Review of the 2017-2018 
<br/>Whole of Government Audit Reports which was tabled on 8</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.  I would just like to 
<br/>thank  everyone,  especially  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro  and  all  those  that  have  participated  in  the 
<br/>debate of this motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report itself is way back in 2017 and 2018 - I think the Honourable Prime Minister did 
<br/>an update that everything is alright now but then that was five years ago.  I think on 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 
<br/>2010, he gazetted the Financial Management Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Financial  Management  Act  says  that  within  two  weeks  after  each  month  or  any  time 
<br/>specified by the Finance Manual the Permanent Secretaries must provide with the management report 
<br/>which focuses on the following areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Services delivery performance; 
<br/>Financial performance; 
<br/>TMA performance; 
<br/>Internal controls; and 
<br/>Other significant issues for the Permanent Secretaries’ information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the financial management  reports on Part 12  reporting of every  Annual  Report.  
<br/>The reporting within two weeks after the end of each quarter, the Permanent Secretary must submit 
<br/>to his or her Minister a report on the financial operations of the agency as compared to the budget 
<br/>and the progress on the implementation of the output specified in the Annual Corporate Plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  was  gazetted  by  the  honourable  Josaia  Voreqe  Bainimarama  at  that  time,  before  we 
<br/>changed the Budget to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July.  We used to have it on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December and the report was supposed 
<br/></span><span>to be submitted to the Minister by 30</span><span>th</span><span> May every year.  But since then we have moved it to 31st July 
<br/></span><span>so every Report is supposed to be reported to the Minister by 31</span><span>st</span><span> December every year.  This is a 
<br/>2018 report, after five years and all gentlemen on the other side are saying “We have done this, we 
<br/>have done this!” - wait for the report of 2019. What did you do there?  Wait for the 2020 report, what 
<br/>did you do there?  Wait for the 2022 report, what did you do there?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are talking about today, what they are doing today - this year!  This is 
<br/>the report for all the honourable Ministers.  The way it is going, the financial management board are 
<br/>not following the gazette authorised by the honourable Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama 
<br/></span><span>on 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2010.  They are not following your orders - tell your Permanent Secretaries, tell the 
<br/></span><span>Ministers to do this.  It is unethical, it is irrelevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These things are irrelevant.  Stop - what are you doing?  It is you honourable Aiyaz Sayed-
<br/>Khaiyum; you are supposed to be telling these people, the Permanent Secretaries and the Ministers 
<br/></span><span>over there.  Fire them!  Fire those people for not honouring what was gazetted by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister, Josaia Bainimarama on 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2010 - that was before the first Election of

<div><span>2014.  I came into this Parliament in 2018 and four years later, 2017 has never been debated until 
<br/>today.  Five years later, everything that we hear is excuses, excuses - this is a Government full of 
<br/>excuses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank everyone from this side of the House for pinpointing 
<br/>the in a transparent manner in the way the Government has been operating over these years and they 
<br/>are already talking about what happened this year! They are supposed to be talking about the things 
<br/>that happened in 2017, 2018 and next year hopefully they will be on this side and we will be on that 
<br/>side when we will be debating. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thought my name was in the list but I thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Whip for including me and I thank you for allowing me to participate.  I will be short. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- If I have made a mistake I can take it off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- I will be short Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The review of the 2017-2018 
<br/></span><span>Whole of Government Consolidated Audit Report is very important particularly on internal controls 
<br/></span><span>which are generally found to be weak. We have heard some explanations from the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister about $2.2 million in Forestry and the $6.6 million now been rectified by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands.  All the records have been straightened but what have they been doing in the last 
<br/>five years?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been a recurring problem and when is there going to be strong and 
<br/>effective  internal  controls?    It  is  important  to  have  strong  internal  controls  of  finance  in  various 
<br/>ministries.  Has there been laxity on the part of Permanent Secretaries, or the Ministers concerned?  
<br/>Someone must be sacked Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly when it is a recurring matter.  We are talking 
<br/>about $260,000 with Fisheries, $2.2 million for Forestry and $6.6 million for Ministry of Lands - we 
<br/>have heard that they have corrected all that; that is good but it remains to be seen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be looking at other Annual Reports lately Mr. Speaker, Sir, significant audit matters in 
<br/>ministries and departments were also reported in the other Sector Reports and the Annual Report for 
<br/>the Whole of Government.  The Ministry of Economy has not tabled in  Parliament the Whole of 
<br/>Government annual report for the financial year ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 and 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  stated  that  it  has  taken  note  of  the  comments  and  the  audit 
<br/></span><span>recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but has not submitted an annual report to date.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, when is it going to be done.  It is now five years.  I should ask the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>sack the Minister for Economy.  If not, Sir, the new government will sack him in the election this 
<br/>year.  It is important that these annual reports are done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also on ageing reports not maintained for VAT and income tax refunds outstanding - FRCS 
<br/>did not maintain the aging reports for income tax and VAT refunds outstanding as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018.  
<br/>This limits the ability of a government to keep track of long outstanding dues.  So it is important, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, these dues need to be determined and either refunded or collected from the business 
<br/>people; it is important that this is done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Economy has indicated that it will liaise with the FRCS on maintaining and 
<br/>submitting aging reports for VAT and income tax refunds outstanding.  But the Ministry itself is still 
<br/>not  producing  any  annual  report.    It  has  not  been  done  but  it  is  better  that  you  should  have  an 
<br/>independent inquiry into all these things particularly on the Lautoka swimming pool - $12 million;

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>digger scam of $33 million; FNU Complex in Labasa - $16 million or more than that.  It is better to 
<br/>have an independent inquiry into all these things to be able to ensure that things are properly done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  to  provide  oversight  on  the  implementation  of  the  relevant 
<br/>recommendations there. Why? They themselves have not produced an annual report for the last five 
<br/>years.    And  they  are  conducting  regular  and  timely  training  for  the  ministries  and  departments, 
<br/>accounting  officers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir;  I  think  they  know  the  job  and  it  is  the  laxity  and  the 
<br/>irresponsibility of the permanent secretaries and ministers concerned to ensure that these things are 
<br/>done.  It must be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Operating accounts and trust funds accounts will ensure 
<br/>that internal control mechanisms are in place; these are very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  already  explained,  it  is  important  that  the  lists  are  kept  because  these  are  customers’ 
<br/>monies, these are public’s money in the various ministries, Mr. Speaker, Sir - it is important to keep 
<br/>good records rather than no list of customers’ payments, so it is important for agriculture, forestry, 
<br/>the  issue  of  lands  and  so  on  so  forth,  plenty  there.    It  is  important  for  the  Ministry  of  Economy 
<br/>particularly with a centralised structure, to ensure all this is in good form but it is important to ensure 
<br/>the independence of the OAG rather than trying to get  all that to the Ministry of Economy.  It is 
<br/>important to ensure that the independency of the OAG to remain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just very quickly before I respond to some 
<br/>of the comments that have been made from the other side,  in respect of the recommendations by the 
<br/>Committee, the Ministry of Economy has implemented mechanisms that have increased efficiencies 
<br/>and effectiveness in addressing the issues that had been raised.  At the end of each financial year, the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy issues a closing of accounts circular to  all respective permanent  secretaries 
<br/>outlining  the  mandatory  procedures  and  timelines  that  ministries  and  departments  must  follow to 
<br/>fully regularise all accounting transactions at the close of the financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministry of Economy constantly monitors compliance with 
<br/>the circular and provides guidance and advisory  services to  all ministries with  matters relating to 
<br/>accounting  and  financing  management  issues.    Significant  improvements  in  the  submission  of 
<br/>financial statements to the OAG have been noted from the ministries and departments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG currently, Mr. Speaker, is auditing the financial year 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 
<br/>accounts to ensure backlog is addressed.  Section 28(1) of the Financial Management Act specifies 
<br/>the responsible authority of the Permanent Secretary is responsible for preparing the agency financial 
<br/>statements.    All  Permanent  Secretaries  (PSs)  have  been  advised  of  this  and  their  performance  is 
<br/></span><span>monitored against these key deliverables through the Public Service Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the majority of the issues  highlighted in  the  Auditor-General’s report to 
<br/>Parliament had been addressed.  In fact the 17 matters they were raising in fact are outdated.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Economy will continue to work closely with the ministries and departments to ensure 
<br/>proper internal controls are in place to prevent such issues from recurring in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, legacy issues and locating information and source 
<br/>documents have been the major challenge for ministries and departments causing delays in resolving 
<br/>audit issues.  These issues are highlighted in every audit report who also needs solutions from the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General on the best way forward.  If you know documents cannot be obtained, 
<br/>it cannot continuously keep on reporting, you need to find a solution to move along.  The honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands was highlighting earlier on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  a  robust  training  programme  which  runs 
<br/>through the financial year.  In addition, the Ministry of Economy has been closely working with the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Civil Service in identifying the training needs of different ministries and departments in 
<br/>creating  awareness  in  such  areas  such  as  FMIS,  reconciliations  of  accrual  accounting  et  cetera.  
<br/>Training  in  these  areas  have  improved  their  knowledge  and  skillsets  of  the  civil  servants  in  the 
<br/>ministries and departments allowing them to carry out their daily responsibilities and deliver quality 
<br/>outputs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 28(1)(a) of the Financial Management Act specifies the responsible 
<br/>authority  of  Permanent  Secretary  is  responsible  for  the  effective,  efficient  and  economical 
<br/>management of the agency.   The Ministry of Economy has delivered sufficient trainings which have 
<br/>improved the knowledge and skillsets of employees in the ministries and departments allowing them 
<br/>to carry out their daily responsibilities and deliver quality output.  Furthermore, stringent monitoring 
<br/>and  follow  ups  have  been  undertaken  by  the  Treasury  Department  to  ensure  reconciliations  are 
<br/>submitted on a timely basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ministries are working towards further strengthening the internal audit 
<br/>and  good  governance  division  in  the  Financial  Management  Act  which  none  of  the  honourable 
<br/>Members mentioned, 2021 internal audit has now been incorporated into the Financial Management 
<br/>Act, mandating internal audits and setting frameworks to improve internal audit service delivery such 
<br/></span><span>as the requirement for the creation of internal audit charter and internal audit committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Financial Management Acts No. 13 came into force on the 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 
<br/>2022.  The revision to the Act will ensure effective management of the Trust Accounts which has 
<br/>been highlighted in the report by Budget Sector agencies and to address audit issues raised by the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General in relation to trust accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be amiss of me not to respond to some of the other issues that have 
<br/>been  raised,  but  I  just  want  to  also  highlight  and  inform  Parliament  that  we  have  just  had  press 
<br/>conference during lunch time as mandated under the Financial Management Act.  There is now a 
<br/>requirement by Government or the incumbent going into Elections to actually issue a pre-Election 
<br/>economic and fiscal update which we have just launched on the website which is available now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it carries the fiscal update and master outline for example the current 
<br/>fiscal  performance  and  outlook  of  the  economy  for  the  medium  term,  the  level  of  debt  stock, 
<br/>contingent  liabilities,  major  fiscal  risks  and  other  socio-economic  indicators.    All  of  them  are 
<br/>included in these documents and is available on the website.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also just to remind honourable Members of Parliament, that going into the Elections, we are 
<br/></span><span>now in the campaign period that if a political party attended for election to Parliament, or any person 
<br/>representing  or  acting  under  the  direction  of  a  political  party  or  candidate,  makes  the  financial 
<br/>commitment  whether  orally  or  in  writing  the  political  party  candidate  or  other  person  must 
<br/>immediately provide a written explanation setting out the following information: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How revenue for the financial commitment is to be raised;  
<br/>How expenditure for the financial commitment is to be made; 
<br/>How expenditure is to be allocated to different sectors and budget sector agencies; and 
<br/>If expenditure exceeds revenue, how the deficit is going to be financed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Gavoka,  when  you  go  around  next  time  saying  that  you  are  going  to  make 
<br/>university education completely free, you have tell us how much it is going to cost you and where 
<br/>you are going to get the money from, that is the requirement now Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Act.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Great, wonderful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please tell the others to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do the same too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  all  available  here  and  it  will  be  great  because  none  of  you  have 
<br/>produced an alternative budget.  The other point that I also wanted to make, honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad in his rather kind of capricious manner so just articulates and said, ‘There has been economic 
<br/>contraction in 2019, Sir, it was a contraction of 0.6 percent’.  He does not mention that prior to that, 
<br/>there was 9 years of economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He pulls out figures and I do not know which part of the 
<br/>anatomy he pulled those figures from, but  he says,  ‘$500 million  of wastage’.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>absolutely no accountability of it. When we say ‘Pull out the data’, he said ‘Let us have a Committee’. 
<br/>He makes all these claims but there is absolutely nothing there to back those claims.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that the Opposition went on 
<br/></span><span>a lot about the Public Accounts Committee again.  I really think sometimes he needs counselling on 
<br/>this because he seems to be very psychologically affected by the fact that he is no longer the Chair 
<br/>of the Public Accounts Committee. Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone since Independence, every Opposition 
<br/>or whenever an Opposition person has to be Chair of the Public Accounts Committee has actually 
<br/>held that particular position with a lot of poise, decorum and indeed professionalism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Professor  Prasad,  unfortunately,  did  not  do  that.    If  you  look  at  the  Standing 
<br/>Orders  and  Erskine  May  on  Parliamentary  Procedure,  it  says  that  Parliamentary  Committees  are 
<br/>actually quasi-Judicial Committees. In other words they have the ability to call people before it and 
<br/>get people to give evidence to it. At the end of the hearing, so to speak, then they actually give a 
<br/>report  and  then  that  Report  is  tabled  to  Parliament.  Honourable  Professor  Prasad,  unfortunately, 
<br/>failed to recognise the importance and the level of professionalism that is required of the Chair of the 
<br/>Public  Accounts  Committee  because  he  was  on  a  daily  basis  giving  a  running  commentary  to 
<br/>everyone outside the room.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is like a judge sitting and hearing a trial 
<br/></span><span>or  carrying  out  an  investigation  and  every  three  hours  at  morning  tea  time  going  and  making 
<br/>assumptions and giving opinions. That is not how a quasi-judicial system operates and unfortunately 
<br/>he failed to recognise the enormity of the task and the level of independence that is truly required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again I have to say that since then he has not participated in any Committee 
<br/>meetings.  He is a permanent Member of the Business Committee meeting and he does not have the 
<br/>level of professionalism to even turn up to any of these meetings in the past number of months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the level of importance that he is actually giving to this Committee, 
<br/>Sir.  He also then went on to berate some of the Government policies like the Home Care Initiative 
<br/>and Help for Homes Initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we had </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 36 hours which wiped off one-third of the value of our GDP. Tens 
<br/>of thousands of Fijians were affected by the cyclones. People’s homes were completely demolished 
<br/>and  they  were  obliterated.  There  were  people  who  had  no  food  and  shelter.    Obviously,  as  a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1201 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  that  is  responsible,  rolled  out  for  the  first  time  an  Assistance  Programme  at  such  a 
<br/>massive scale of over $125 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Subsequently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had </span><span>TC Cody</span><span>, </span><span>Josie</span><span> and </span><span>Gita</span><span> and $110 million we rolled 
<br/>out because people did suffer. What I want to tell the Fijian public is that honourable Prasad is saying 
<br/>that we should not have helped them because he is calling that a handout. He is saying Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we went on a spending spree. He then pulls out a figure from another part of the anatomy saying 
<br/>that poverty is 50 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World  Bank says 24.1 percent  again,  this is the kind  of shenanigans and the level of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intellectual dishonesty and data.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have got it changed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- See, he is saying that I have got it changed. What a stupid 
<br/>comment to make as if the Minister of Economy from Fiji can go running after the World Bank and 
<br/>say,  please  change  the  figures.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  you  see,  the  same  thing  with  the  other 
<br/>economists: Nilesh Goundar, Wadan Narsey and when we actually did a response to it in this 24-
<br/></span><span>page paragraph response to it with facts and figures, they only commented on the last paragraph. 
<br/></span><span>Three pages were completely ignored.  What he said was, “Oh do not attack them personally, they 
<br/>might get hurt”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, then one of their other lackey says, “Oh, the Minister should not be making 
<br/>a comment, only an economist should be making a comment.” When the Permanent Secretary of 
<br/>Economy  makes  a  comment,  they  said,  “Oh,  he  should  not  be  making  a  comment,  he  is  a  civil 
<br/>servant.” What is it? Are you an Arthur or Martha? You do not even know where you are coming 
<br/>from. So for them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, any organisation, any analysis, any media organisation, if it is 
<br/>completely critical of Government then it is good.  If it says anything positive of our Government it 
<br/>is not independent, that is the narrative.  They failed to understand also, Sir, for example, Government 
<br/>should be able to analyse policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Westminster System of democracy which we inherited from the British the political party 
<br/>that wins the majority of the seats, they form Government. They are called the Executive; they make 
<br/>the policies, people vote for people on their policies. That is what we assume that they would do and 
<br/>then they set the agenda for the country through their policies, not for the Opposition to come and 
<br/>tell them to change this policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  get,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  the  policy,  the  Cabinet,  the  Prime  Minister  as  the  Leader  of 
<br/>Government decides those policies.  They can be questioning, they can be critical of it, that is their 
<br/>right but we set the agenda, that is what an elected Government does, Sir.  They need to understand 
<br/>the fundamental difference, they have their absolute right to question it, absolute right to criticise it 
<br/>with intellect, not pulling strings out of anywhere else.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we set the agenda, we have 
<br/>the policies, if the people do not like the policies they vote you out in the next elections: that is how 
<br/>the system works, they need to understand that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I wanted to make was that this whole issue about debt 
<br/>accumulation.  None of them have said that prior to the pandemic, our debt to GDP ratio is far below 
<br/>50 percent, only after the pandemic did it go over 50 percent. The other point that you would think 
<br/>that they would appreciate is that when you have debt, you need to be able to understand the cost of 
<br/>debt.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2017-2018 WOG Audit Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have said continuously on the floor of this Parliament, Sir, that $900 million has been 
<br/>given  to  us  as  concessional  financing,  0.01  percent  interest  rate,  40  year  term  and  10  year  grace 
<br/>period.  If you had people borrowing say, $10 million at that rate and someone else borrows the same 
<br/>amount of money with the interest rate of 5 percent and only to pay it in 10 years, obviously, your 
<br/>cash outlay will be far more demanding for those who ask you to pay at 5 percent and within 10 
<br/>years.  They do not have the nuance approach nor do they have that level of sophistication to be able 
<br/>to understand that or they are deliberately ignoring that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about Civil Service Reforms, honourable Gavoka said, ‘expatriates’.  I want 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>him to tell me, how many expatriates are there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, precisely he is the man who pontificates 
<br/>about Qantas all the time, ignoring Fiji Airways and now he is talking about ‘let us get expatriates’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, expatriates come they build capacity, in 
<br/>the same way and I have said this before, you have rugby coaches who are expatriates, they do not 
<br/>seem to have a complaint about that so we can have expatriates everywhere else.  He worked for an 
<br/>expatriate company for years at the Shangri La, owned by a foreign company, no problem with that.  
<br/>All the banks in Fiji until recently are all expatriate banks, no one has a problem with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the continuous level of hypocrisy and obfuscation by the Opposition, it will 
<br/>not  go  away.    Honourable  Gavoka  by  saying,  “Oh  no”  because  the  ordinary  Fijian  people  are 
<br/>watching this, they know what is happening, they know we built capacity, there are far more Fijians 
<br/>now in those positions that were held by expatriates and there is nothing wrong with that.  We have 
<br/>doctors  who  are  expatriates,  we  do  not  have  the  skillsets  in  Fiji  available,  we  are  going  to  get 
<br/>expatriates  who  do  open  heart  surgery,  we  have  people  who  have  gone  overseas  for  medical 
<br/>treatment.    The  leader  of  Paapi  who  went  to  India  for  knee  replacement,  the  Honourable  Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua  when  he  was  a  civil  servant  went  to  China  for  medical  services  facilitated  by  the 
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister and then they have the audacity to come here and make a public statement 
<br/>and say. “Oh, they went overseas”, this is the level of hypocrisy. I understand you may be going 
<br/></span><span>again for medical treatment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we come to Parliament, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … exactly, that is your people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we come to Parliament, we need to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be upfront  of course.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Getting  back  to  the  report  itself,  Sir,  the  fact  of  the  matter  is,  there  have  been  issues, 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad did say, “these things will never be 100 percent fixed.”  The idea is to 
<br/>try and get it 100 percent.  We need to improve the systemic issues which we are working upon.  We 
<br/>need to appoint the right people in the right positions to do the right job and that is critically important.  
<br/>That is where OMRS actually helps too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also like to make, there were statements made about 
<br/>OAG.    Honourable  Prof.  Prasad  said  there  was  a  report  that  was  tabled  which  was  wrong.    Sir, 
<br/>independent bodies have a fiduciary duty to ensure that they fulfil their mandate professionally.  It is 
<br/>not a blank cheque to say and do whatever they like.  They need to stick to the standards, they need 
<br/>to stick to the international standards and unfortunately, in this case, it has not been done; that is all 
<br/></span><span>we are saying, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have never questioned the independence nor have we in any stopped it but there is nothing 
<br/>stopping us from questioning if there is a lack of professionalism and that is all we are simply saying.  
<br/>When reports are tabled in Parliament, as we know through the audit process, you need to have an 
<br/>entry  interview,  you  need  to  have  the  audit  findings,  then  they  are  sent  to  the  respective 
<br/>ministry/department  to  provide a response  and then they  actually publish  the accounts.  We have 
<br/>found in instances, where they had the findings without even going back to the ministry/department 
<br/>to give a response, they publish the reports.  That is not being transparent, that is not being upfront.  
<br/>That is precisely what happens in so many instances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  a  number  of  issues,  there  are  some  issues,  of  course, 
<br/>internally.  We have had people who nicked money also.  The Ministry of Education, under the Free 
<br/>Bus Fares Subsidy where we in certain areas, there is no permanent bus services that run, we have 
<br/>the  minibuses  (RSL)  running,  there  is  one  particular  person  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  nicked 
<br/>$300,000  over  a  period  of  time,  cooked  up  the  books  with  the  various  providers  mainly  in  the 
<br/>Nadroga area, unfortunately, and they were able to steal $300,000 from the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now  the  Minister  for  Education  cannot  be  held  accountable  for  that,  sometimes  the 
<br/></span><span>Permanent Secretary cannot be held accountable for that, if it is one-off, but if it continuously happens 
<br/>then they should be responsible; the Permanent Secretary should be responsible.  We had a person 
<br/>who stole a $1 million from the Official Receiver’s Office over a period of time, cooking the books.  
<br/>So  these  things  need  to  be  picked  up,  these  things  need  to  be  dealt  with  and  system  need  to  be 
<br/>improved so we can continuously ensure that we get, as we said, “unqualified reports”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker,  I would just  like to  take this time to  thank all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers who have responded and taken the recommendations in a very positive manner.
