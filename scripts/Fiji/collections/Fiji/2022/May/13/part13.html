<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, with regards to End of Week Statements, each Member may speak for 
<br/>up to 10 minutes with a 10 minute response given by the Minister or Ministers responsible for the 
<br/>subject matter of the Member’s speech.  No seconder is required and there will be no other debate.

<div><span>Jetties and Waiting Facilities for Maritime Travellers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on my 
<br/>End of the Week Statement on jetties and passenger shelters in regards to the maritime and inter-
<br/>island travellers and also in the process, to highlight the need for the Government to put in more 
<br/></span><span>concerted effort and action for the construction of new jetties and passenger shelters and also for the 
<br/></span><span>renovation  and  proper  maintenance  of  existing  ones,  to  ensure  the  wellbeing  and  safety  of  our 
<br/>interisland and maritime travellers and that, indeed, no one is left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am speaking on this issue, as I am very much aware of the problems faced 
<br/>by the maritime and inter-island travellers, as I am also one of them and have experienced the same 
<br/>risks, dangers and frustration that one has to go through during that time.  Sir, we on this side of the 
<br/>House,  continue  to  highlight  the  need  to  improve  the  infrastructure  on  our  jetties  and  passenger 
<br/>shelters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2015, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, for one, have continued to raise those issues. Having said 
<br/>that,  we  acknowledge  that  the  work  has  been  undertaken  by  the  Government  but,  unfortunately, 
<br/>despite the huge budgetary allocation given to the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) that has the mandate 
<br/>on this work, we note that the budgetary allocations specifically for jetties and passenger shelters 
<br/>have been very minimal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at some budgetary allocations for the Natovi, Nabouwalu and Lomaloma Jetties.  
<br/>For Natovi Jetty new ramp in 2015, $238,360 was allocated but no actual work was carried out.  For 
<br/></span><span>Nabouwalu Jetty in 2015, $2, 526,613 was given but only $1.2 million was used in the actual work.  
<br/></span><span>For Nabouwalu Jetty in 2016, $710,000 was allocated but no work was carried out.  For Natovi Jetty 
<br/>in 2016, $1,096,330 was allocated but no work was carried out.  For Nabouwalu Jetty in 2017-2018, 
<br/>$2,752,294  was  allocated  but  no  work  was  carried  out.    For  Natovi  Waiting  Shed  in  2017-2018, 
<br/>$550,459 was allocated but no work was carried out.  Likewise for Lomaloma Jetty in 2017-2018, 
<br/>$22,936  was  allocated  but  no  work  was  carried  out.    As  a  matter  of  interest,  those  figures  were 
<br/>extracted from their respective annual reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that for a waiting shed, it will cost about $250,000 and I got 
<br/>that  from  one  of  the  mainstream  media  reports.    We  must  note  the  heavy  use  of  Natovi  and 
<br/>Nabouwalu Jetties and these posed subsequent safety issues that travellers face on a daily basis.  For 
<br/>example,  on  a  daily  basis,  the  Natovi  and  Nabouwalu  Jetties  can  only  accommodate  one  vessel 
<br/>berthing to undertake all their operational activities within the time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Boats now have 24 hours turnaround, as we know, Parliament approved the additional routes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that was given to the shipping services providers, and right now Goundar Shipping and </span><span>MV Ohana
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>1422 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have two turnaround trips, Natovi to Nabouwalu daily and furthermore, there are Goundar Shipping 
<br/>trips between Nabouwalu and Ellington and between Natovi and Levuka.  Therefore, as alluded to 
<br/>by the honourable Minister Kumar in one of her interviews with the media, she said that almost 1,000 
<br/>passengers go through Natovi and Nabouwalu.  I can believe that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In addition to that, there are also heavy vehicles, particularly, the logging vehicles, the pine 
<br/>trucks, the buses and the transport trucks that transport goods across the islands on a daily basis.  I 
<br/>believe there will be about 100 or more heavy vehicles and small passenger cars.  So, that scenario 
<br/>helps us to appreciate the heavy usage of Natovi and Nabouwalu Jetties, and yet, there has not been 
<br/>really any major improvement in the infrastructure with regards to jetties and passenger shelters to 
<br/>be able to accommodate the heavy use on the facilities right now, because those jetties and passenger 
<br/>shelter designs and the capacity, were designed years ago, may be decades ago, and it does not have 
<br/>that capacity to accommodate the heavy usage right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is still a great need for improved lights around the jetty and the passenger shelters, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  The Government had promised in 2017 that there will be a new passenger shelter at 
<br/>Natovi but, unfortunately, right now that has not been done and the Government side is well aware 
<br/>of that, as they also continue to travel between Natovi and Nabouwalu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in regards to the public facilities like the toilets, there is only one for the women and one 
<br/>for men in both Natovi and Nabouwalu and unfortunately, the one at Natovi can remain closed from 
<br/>about 11.00 p.m. to the early hours of the morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, the facilities are not disabled persons friendly.  We acknowledge the 
<br/>increased trips provided by the shipping service providers and also the franchise which has benefited 
<br/>the travelling public. The main issue that I would like to highlight that the government has been slow 
<br/>in the provision of corresponding services in the construction of new jetties and passenger shelters, 
<br/>the renovation and maintenance of the existing ones, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on to the maritime islands, for those of us that have travelled to small islands that do 
<br/>not have jetties where we have to offload to small fibre-boats, the risk is huge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>it is  sad when we see senior citizens particularly women and nursing mothers with  their children 
<br/>having to have some kind of skills to be able to offload safely on those moving fibreglass boats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Lomaloma Jetty, it was promised in this Parliament that it will be permanently repaired 
<br/>in  2015.  Somehow,  it  has  not  been  done  until  to  date  and  also  there  is  still  no  passenger  shelter 
<br/></span><span>constructed there and you will recall Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I also raised in this Parliament about the 
<br/></span><span>Lakeba passenger shelter which still has not also been constructed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to echo the words of the honourable Seruiratu 
<br/>in his contribution yesterday with regards to the debate on the State Land Bill that the government is 
<br/>pragmatic and always fixing problems when they see it, it is common sense and logic and also out of 
<br/>necessity that it must be done and it is also done with empathy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  plead  to  the  honourable  Members  to  honour  those  words,  particularly  the  Minister  for 
<br/>Infrastructure to ensure that those works are carried out for the jetties and passenger shelters to ensure 
<br/>the safety and well-being of our travelling public and also for the government just to stop playing lip 
<br/>service, to stop talking and do some real action and repair, maintain the existing jetties.  Construct 
<br/>new ones, for example, in Karoko as promised in 2019 that it is still in the pipeline and it is still in 
<br/>the pipeline.

<div><span>End of Week Statements

<div><span>1423 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable Member for her End of Week 
<br/>Statement.  I think, firstly, the Government pays the utmost important to the travelling public, not 
<br/>just to the travelling public in urban areas but also those that go out into our rural maritime areas.  By 
<br/>way of background, initially jetties and landings were constructed in our islands to enhance inter-
<br/>island trade and development.  They were initially designed to accommodate small boats that brave 
<br/>our waters to deliver supplies to the islands and also to trade produce and products to the mainland. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the  years with  the increase in  trade and economic activities, the size of the boat  has 
<br/>increased. The service of our maritime islands have increased, which have required jetty upgrades to 
<br/>accommodate bigger boats such as the Roll-on-Roll-Off vessels that were not used initially when 
<br/>those jetties were put in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been, as the honourable Member has said, an increase in the frequency of shipping 
<br/>services bringing more passengers in their islands and this regards there is always a high demand for 
<br/>public conveniences and waiting facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  a  total  of  28  jetties  in  the  list  of  FRA  assets  of  which  24  are 
<br/>operational  with  four  remaining either beyond repair or not  safe  for public use.  After inspection 
<br/></span><span>carried out by FRA Engineers we found that of these 28 jetties all of them needed maintenance and 
<br/></span><span>nine jetties needed an upgrade.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, recommended works were recommended for safe berthing of commercial vessels and safe 
<br/>access for pedestrians and the jetty services have a wide range of users - passengers, vehicles, police, 
<br/>Customs, Navy, Fishing Vessels, Government supply ships so, through this period FRA has been 
<br/>maintaining our jetties nationwide.  In the past seven years a total of $25.6 million was allocated for 
<br/>jetty routine maintenance and rehabilitation works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Members talked about why some funds were sometimes put into the budget 
<br/>not used?  I just want to tell you that from the year 2016  the amount of money that FRA had for 
<br/>projects had to be withdrawn to deal with the emergency responses that we had for cyclones and 
<br/>flooding.  In 2016 they had to take out $28.4 million from existing projects and move it to those 
<br/>things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016 to 2017 $35.5 million from projects planned were taken out for emergency response; 
<br/>2017  to  2018  another  $35  million;  2018-2019  another  $22.7  million;  2019-2020  another  $11.7 
<br/>million; 2020 to 2021 another $24.8 million and 2021 to 2022 another $26.8 million.  Over this period 
<br/></span><span>there has been a total of $185 million that we had targeted for projects but because a cyclone or flood 
<br/></span><span>happened in this country, we had to put some of those projects aside and take that fund and use it for 
<br/>something that was critical at that point in time.  There is always a focus on doing this but we always 
<br/>hope that disasters do not happen so that we can continue to provide services. The commitment is 
<br/>there but the circumstances that we find ourselves in are that such funds have to be used for something 
<br/>else at that particular point in time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, for our waiting facilities while responding to the oral question by the honourable 
<br/>Aseri Radrodro on a similar subject this week, I have highlighted the current works and the future 
<br/>planned works by Government.  I wish to reiterate that currently for the three main jetties in the North 
<br/>namely;  Nabouwalu,  Savusavu  and  Taveuni,  have  proper  waiting  sheds  with  electricity,  water 
<br/>supply,  waiting  area  and  public  convenience  facilities.  The  waiting  shed  facilities  are  currently 
<br/>maintained by the respective tenants and vendors who also sell tea and food parcels in the areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  Natovi-Nabouwalu  as  the  busiest  route  between  Viti  Levu  and  Vanua  Levu  at  the 
<br/>moment, FRA has now facilitated a request received from the Savusavu Town Council which looks 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>1424 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>after Savusavu and Nabouwalu to maintain the daily operation for the waiting shed areas in the three 
<br/>jetties.  FRA hopes to finalise this agreement soon with the Savusavu Town Council so that they can 
<br/>maintain the standard of service throughout.  There are issues also like in the market that we have in 
<br/>Nabouwalu  -  the  issue  of  vandalism  so  hopefully  through  that  partnership  these  issues  will  be 
<br/>addressed also in the waiting shed area and especially with the public convenience facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to further improve our jetties in waiting facilities upgrading of our outer 
<br/>island  jetties  have  been  programmed  under  FRA.  This  will  allow  better  movement  of  cargo  and 
<br/>people and this includes plans for the Koro Island - Roll-on Roll-off (Ro-Ro) type jetty; Makogai - 
<br/>Ro-Ro type jetty; Moala - Ro-Ro type jetty; Nabukeru Yasawa-i-Rara - pedestrian jetty; Vanuabalavu 
<br/>or Lomaloma, Lau - Ro-Ro type jetty; and Vunisea -  Ro-Ro type Jetty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  planned  improvement  on  these  jetties,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  includes  essential  public 
<br/>convenience  facilities  such  as  parking  where  necessary,  waiting  shelter  with  restrooms  and 
<br/>stakeholder offices.  The physical construction is expected to commence within the next two years 
<br/>and  it  will  take  five  years  to  complete  the  programme.      Also  in  the  Nabouwalu  new  township 
<br/>development, there will be a passenger terminal building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  you  know,  there  is  a  great  development  of  a  township  going  on  in  Nabouwalu  at  the 
<br/></span><span>moment – this is something that has been close to the honourable Prime Minister’s heart, and it is 
<br/>something that he has been pushing for.  There is a lot of work and all the different agencies are 
<br/>working together to develop the township and also, we hope to have a passenger terminal building 
<br/>that will house a waiting area, an ablution block, office space for the Fiji Police Force, kiosks and 
<br/>parking area.  Overall, we are hoping that with the partnership of the DCCP, Ministry of Economy, 
<br/>FRA and all the other agencies, we will make Nabouwalu a climate-resilient town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned before, the two jetties that we are looking to upgrade initially now are 
<br/>Natovi Jetty and Nabouwalu Jetty because of the high volume of traffic, as well as in Savusavu.  So 
<br/>with all those things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are still challenges.  I travel on these boats myself - I 
<br/>visit facilities there and there has been some gradual improvement over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FRA is working slowly in partnership with those whom we can work together 
<br/>to continue to upgrade.  We put things in the Budget and we hope that disaster does not strike because 
<br/>when disasters do strike, funds have to be moved to other areas.  As I have mentioned before, the 
<br/>total amount of money that we have to take out from the existing project (this is just for FRA) over 
<br/>the past years from 2016 has been $185 million.  That is why now also, when you are talking about 
<br/></span><span>the  Climate  Financing  Strategy,  there  is  emphasis  on  more  resilient  infrastructure  which  is  more 
<br/></span><span>expensive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When things are more expensive, that means it takes more time to build them and it absorbs 
<br/>more resources.  That means that you will not be able to do as many as quickly as possible, but in the 
<br/>long term, it is of benefit to us because we save maintenance and repair costs in the future.  That is 
<br/>the vision of Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, keep focussing on more resilient infrastructure.  I want 
<br/>to tell all the people in the maritime areas, you will find difficulties at the moment, but we have also 
<br/>experienced those.  Please, be rest assured that this Government is focussed on making sure that we 
<br/>will make your travelling experience as pleasing as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we move on to the next speaker, I would just 
<br/>like to acknowledge the presence in the House of two visitors from Canada and Australia.  They are 
<br/>Riyaz and Frank Dean, former Fiji citizens who are visiting.  You are most welcome.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dispossession of iTaukei Land to the State 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to discuss the topic of land and the State, 
<br/>in particular the issue of historical dispossession of indigenous Fijians or iTaukei land to the State or 
<br/>Crown.  There has been increasing grievances on the sale of Native land from landowning units from 
<br/>the Colonial days to now, and many remain unresolved.  The iTaukei understand that most valuable 
<br/>lands in Fiji are owned privately and by the State, and are seeking the return of these lands where 
<br/>they see that there has been dispossession, in the sense that the original acquisition of such lands has 
<br/>been unfair, unjustified and without equitable compensation.  I again raise, in particular, the case of 
<br/>the people of Suva now residing at  a small  hill  outside of the Suva City  called Suvavou Village.  
<br/>Suvasuva is a mark of ownership, yet it is a name we use today without knowing the owners of those 
<br/>land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within the bounds of these land, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the residence of the three </span><span>yavusa</span><span> and 
<br/>10 </span><span>mataqali</span><span>.  The </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> of Suva today can still identify the boundaries of their land.  They began 
<br/>to lose their land due to no fault of theirs, but the action of a shop at Nukulau catching fire during the 
<br/>July  American  Independence  Celebrations  of  the  American  Consul  on  the  island.    The  Consul 
<br/>claimed recompense for natives taking away his trade goods while his house was burning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Americans demanded that Ratu Seru Cakobau as the most visible chief of these lands, to 
<br/>pay  compensation  or  feel  the  brunt  of  offshore  naval  bombardments.    Ratu  Cakobau,  after  a 
<br/>champagne breakfast on board a boat at Levuka, sold 200,000 acres of land in Fiji to an Australian 
<br/>company called the Polynesian Company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The then British Council objected that Ratu Seru Cakobau did not own those lands; amongst 
<br/>them  were  the  lands  in  Natewa,  Ra,  Beqa,  Waimanu,  Navua.    After  the  Cession,  the  Crown 
<br/>disallowed the sale and returned all land sold by Ratu Cakobau, except the Suva block. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first Governor, Sir Arthur Gordon, with instruction to set up the capital of Fiji found land 
<br/>to  be  expensive  in  the  capital  of  Levuka  with  no  room  for  extension  on  the  hilly  terrain.    In  the 
<br/>meantime, there were some purchases of land warrants when the Polynesian Company had settled in 
<br/>Suva, and the Colonial Secretary at that time, while recognising that the settlers had no claim of rights 
<br/>to the land, sold those land to them as Crown grants out of grace of the Crown. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Crown did not own the land to give and in breach of its obligations to the natives of Suva 
<br/>gave some freehold titles to some white settlers on the land.  The Crown was also compromised by its 
<br/></span><span>conflict  of interest in  wanting lands to setup its capital by  taking over  disallowed claimed lands  and 
<br/></span><span>required the people of Suva to vacate their lands on the made-up excuse that they had agreed to surrender 
<br/>all their rights and interests to the Suva Peninsula.  On being asked to move, the Tui Suva refused and 
<br/>asked to move his people to Samabula.  The Crown refused and came up with a story that a Ra Provincial 
<br/>clerk and the Native Land Commissioner had entered into an agreement with a</span><span> kai</span><span> Suva in 1882 to move 
<br/>to where they live today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  agreement  was  never  found  despite  a  number  of  searches  over  the  years  and  a  pay 
<br/>voucher was manufactured as being rent for Suva land.  On legal advice, that land still belonged to 
<br/>the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva, the amount was termed “annuity” without any reference to land value.  How much is 
<br/>being  paid  today  and  does  it  relate  to  current  value?    That  is  the  question  despite  the  sale  to  the 
<br/>Polynesian company being invalid, the Crown relied on plans drawn up by the company to call 300 
<br/>acres of land which is to be reserved land for which rent and later annuity was paid by the Crown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Later the Crown claimed that the annuity was for the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva to quit all their land on the 
<br/>peninsula from Tamavua to the sea rather than just reserve it.  The Tui Suva and his people from after

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cession of 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, 1874 had been seeking justice for the land claims over the years and over a 
<br/>number of generations till today.  From the executive to the courts, their pursuits of justice have not 
<br/>been fulfilled and we need to see this being fulfilled and this will be part of the strategy of the new 
<br/>government as we take over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  executives</span><span> </span><span>have  not  been  able  to  settle  it  because  today  they  rely  on  the  judgement 
<br/>adopted by Justice Inoke sitting at the High Court in Lautoka.  Justice Inoke’s judgment saying that 
<br/>chiefs  had  reserved  powers  to  sell  land  and  once  land  was  sold  by  chiefs,  the  natural  title  was 
<br/>extinguished and applauded by the honourable Attorney-General. This shows bias against iTaukei 
<br/>land claims.  The judgement has been appealed but cannot be proceeded with because the transcripts 
<br/>of  the  hearing  before  Justice  Pathik  and  relied  on  by  Justice  Inoke  could  not  be  certified  before 
<br/>writing the judgement.  The Tui Suva, Ratu Epeli Kanakana and some claimants who had launched 
<br/>the case in 1999 are now dead.  They went to their graves without getting justice from the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament of Australia passed the Native Title Act that an extinguished title must be 
<br/>compensated and land in the hand of the Crown must be returned to the Aborigines.  This honourable 
<br/>House represents Fiji.  In this House resides the repository of justice in our lands that we may move 
<br/></span><span>forward, not only for the living but for those who will be born.  The FijiFirst Party promises a fair 
<br/></span><span>and just society but has it done justice to the people of Suvavou?  The Suva land claims must be 
<br/>settled, claims filed in court or on appeal can be settled at any time before or even after judgement.  
<br/>We do not have to look far for precedence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  New  Zealand  there  are  a  number  Tribal  Claim  Settlement  Acts  which  starts  with  the 
<br/>recitement of historical errors that has been done by the Crown on the tribe, the State inheriting the 
<br/>obligations of the Crown then apologises to the Crown and sets out monetary recompense or benefits 
<br/>for land which could not be returned to the tribe, and some land in the State which could be returned.  
<br/>This can be done for Suva.  Obviously in Suva freeholds, public roads and land on which public 
<br/>facilities cannot be returned and for these, monetary compensation by budgetary provisions can be 
<br/>done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  were  talks  with  the  Indian  Embassy  being  built  on  the  botanical  land.    When  the 
<br/>botanical ground was initially established, the Director of Lands could not show any right to those 
<br/>land.  It had to rely on what they called “strict interpretation of the Deed of Cession”.  Going back 
<br/>into history, Ratu Seru Cakobau on being explained by the interpreter, Wilkinson on 8</span><span>th</span><span> October, 
<br/>1874 that they were ceding all land in Fiji to the Crown and their successors, told other chiefs that 
<br/></span><span>they could only seek their </span><span>lewa</span><span> or sovereign power but not the </span><span>qele</span><span> or land as this belonged to the 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span>.  This was</span><span> </span><span>explained to the Queen’s representative so the land on the Suva Peninsula was 
<br/>not ceded to the Crown and its successor, the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The high courts of North America, Australia and New Zealand jurisdictions now hold that 
<br/>radical title only taken, once take by the Crown but beneficial ownership remained with the native 
<br/>peoples.  Therefore, my contention is that Suva land is still owned by the Suva people and any taking 
<br/>by  the  Crown  and  its  predecessor,  the  State,  must  be  lawful.    Land  loss  to  the  Suva  people  was 
<br/>widespread and severe.  A study by a sociologist shows that the alienation of Suva’s people from 
<br/>their ancestral  land deprived them of economic, spiritual,  cultural  autonomy, generations of Suva 
<br/>families have suffered and incalculable loss.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Suva land settlement agreement or Bill which I would be proposing and pursuing would 
<br/>address historical grievances which include having to bear the brunt of the burning of the house on 
<br/>Nukulau, which they know nothing about; the burden of settlers to whom they never sold their lands

<div><span>to; the discrimination; the disallowance of the sale by Cakobau; and the discrimination of the Crown 
<br/>in favouring settlers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The natives of Suva have become, by law, the equal of an English man bearing the burden of 
<br/>having the capital of this country residents on their lands at the time when the country had no money 
<br/>to purchase their lands, taking lots from lands in Suva to raise funds for the fledgling colony.  Suva 
<br/>lands were rented from </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva where no such lease agreement existed and resorting to unlawful 
<br/>interpretation of the Deed of Cession contrary to the law that these must be understood as the ceding 
<br/>chiefs understood then and having rent changed to annuity  and the inability of the executives and 
<br/>the court to give justice to the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other issues regarding their mangroves fisheries, spoilers of their fisheries and other 
<br/>issues regarding sewerage and pollutions by current occupants of the Suva peninsula.  If Suva Land 
<br/>Settlement Agreement is settled then the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva can move forward in a positive relationship with 
<br/>government and the people of Fiji to rebuild, restore and thrive again.  Today, the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva has the 
<br/>highest migration statistics because the land given to them is not enough and it is traumatising to look 
<br/>across Suva Harbour at the land of their fathers now reach a new splendour as the capital of Fiji.  
<br/>Most prefer to live out of sight of their lands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  has  spoken  ill  of  past  Governments  in  this  House  but  these  past  ills 
<br/>committed on the </span><span>kai</span><span> Suva has not been mentioned.  In this House we call ourselves ‘honourable’, 
<br/>shame on us as we do not honour the native owners of Suva lands.  Where is our sense of justice?  
<br/>Where  is  the  sense  of  fairness?    Today  we  continue  the  unlawful  taking  of  Suva  lands  by 
<br/>Government’s actions in dishing out State leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the situation with the State land in Raiwai?  This was originally awarded to a Chinese 
<br/>investor but resold due to problems here including links to organised crime in China.  This land is 
<br/>basically reclaimed land on mangrove wetlands.  Then we have the current development in Nasese 
<br/>on  reclaimed  mangrove  areas  for  high-end  residential  residence.    In  this  whole  process,  the 
<br/>Government has totally ignored the people of Suva, shameful and sad state of affairs.  Why should 
<br/>we push the knife giver?  Why should we have a country where courts have championed protection 
<br/>of human rights bill on lands stolen by the Crown with a fictitious agreement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the botanical gardens, this as the Indian Government has stated that it is no 
<br/>longer interested.  So why has there been no process to revert this to the people of Suvavou under 
<br/>section 8 of the State Lands Act which state – ‘when any native land has been acquired by the crown 
<br/></span><span>for public purposes under the provision of the Crown Acquisition of Lands Act, any other written 
<br/></span><span>law, where it is no longer required for such purposes, the Minister after consultation with Cabinet 
<br/>may order, declare such land to be native land, et cetera’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the FijiFirst </span><span>coup</span><span> of 2006 - Which State lands have been declared Native land under 
<br/>section 8?  Hardly or nil.  They have gone to sleep or more likely they do not want to see the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>really progress in terms of real development and a greater share of the economic pie.  They have done 
<br/>peanuts  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  and  formulated  laws  which  are  anti-</span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.    I  pay  tribute  to  Mr.  Niko 
<br/>Nawaikula today, a victim of political manipulation where he is tried for being the indigenous Fijian.  
<br/>I am best rest-assured that the battle will continue.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is your End of the Week Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That is what I am doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It has got nothing to do with Mr. Nawaikula’s case so stick to that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Sir.  I was just going to say that, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- This FijiFirst Government seems to have not acted on Section 8 
<br/>because they have been  nullified by their own imposed 2013 Constitution where in  Section 22  it 
<br/>states – any </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land acquired by the State for a public purpose after the commencement of this 
<br/>Constitution or under any written law shall revert to the customary owners if the land is no longer 
<br/>required by the State.  Why only land acquired after the commencement of this Constitution in 2013?  
<br/>What about acquisitions before 2013?  Which lands are these?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Virtually  none  as  most  State  leases  are  99  years  and  therefore  under  the  Constitution  any 
<br/>lands to be returned under section 8 of the State Lands Act will only be returned in the year 2112 
<br/>which is a farce and insulting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My reading of Section 22 of the Constitution is that it is designed to permanently block all 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land claims on State land.  However, justified or credible that claim is and under </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>Land Trust Act section 18 says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“18.-(1) If the Governor-General (President) is satisfied that the land belonging to any 
<br/></span><span>mataqali </span><span>is insufficient for use, maintenance or support of its members it shall be lawful 
<br/>for the Governor-General (President) by proclamation to set aside such Crown land or 
<br/>land acquired for or on  behalf of Fijians (</span><span>iTaukei</span><span>) by purchase, (et cetera) [as in  his 
<br/>opinion may be required for the use, maintenance or] for the support of </span><span>mataqali </span><span>…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Has any such land been set aside by Government?  I doubt it because as he said, this has been 
<br/>progressed by past governments and disrupted by the FijiFirst Government.  Some lands identified 
<br/>for section 8 purposes including those in Naitasiri, Sabeto, Lauwaki, et cetera, and we can give you 
<br/>the  list.    That  is  why  I  am  asking:  is  this  Government  really  serious  about  iTaukei  economic 
<br/>development?  I do not think so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have mentioned millions of dollars spent in provinces but what about the projects that 
<br/></span><span>they are supposed to complete in terms of the iTaukei land development?  We note that they have 
<br/></span><span>promised $10 million a year for the iTaukei Development Fund but from 2014-2015 budget to 2021, 
<br/>this $10 million should have resulted in $70 million but in Year 1 to 2 they have failed to approve a 
<br/>single development project and $20 million was lost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the third year, only $503,000 was approved and, again, the balance were at a loss, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have exceeded your time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- The iTaukei Development Fund has not been used, Suva land 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>claims settlement is long overdue and there should be enough of this injustice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  legal  matter  and  this  is  why  I 
<br/>would like to take the honourable Member.  He focussed only on one or two legal issues, he already 
<br/>knows that there is a case that was decided by the High Court which is, </span><span>Ratu Epeli Kanakana and 
<br/>others and Native Land Trust Board vs Attorney-General and Native Lands Commission</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1429 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This matter has been decided by the High Court of Fiji but I would like to take the honourable 
<br/>Member back to the Deed of Cession that they all think was a great thing.  They all think the 1970 
<br/>Constitution was a great thing, they all think the 1990 Constitution was a great thing, they all think 
<br/>the 1997 Constitution was a great thing and I will take them back to that and what actually prevails 
<br/>legally speaking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under clause 4 of the Deed of Cession (this is the original script of the Deed of Cession), I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will read the one that is a bit more legible.  It says under clause 4: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That  the  absolute  proprietorship  (listen  carefully  honourable  Tuisawau)  of  all 
<br/>lands not shown to be now alienated so as to become bona fide the property of Europeans 
<br/>or other foreigners or not now in the actual use or occupation of some chief or tribe or not 
<br/>actually required for the probable future support and maintenance of some chief or tribe 
<br/>shall be and is hereby declared to be vested in Her Said Majesty her heirs and successors.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the legal foundation of the three types of tenure or land systems in Fiji.  The first: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alienated to Europeans or other foreigners which is freehold; 
<br/>Native title; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Whatever is left is Crown land or State land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, then fast-tracking on a legal basis, they all think this is a wonderful thing 
<br/>when we became independent in 1970, and we all think Prince Charles was wonderful for coming to 
<br/>Fiji giving us the order through the Court of Balmoral and the 1970 Constitution which is here says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Whereas on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October 1874 Cakobau styled </span><span>Tui Viti </span><span>and </span><span>Vunivalu</span><span> and other high 
<br/>chiefs  signified  their  loyalty  to  Her  Most  Gracious  Majesty  Queen  Victoria  and  their 
<br/>dedication to God and to the rule of law by the solemn agreement known as the Deed of 
<br/>Cession  made  and  concluded  by  them  of  the  one  part  and  Sir  Hercules  George  Robert 
<br/>Robinson representative of Her Majesty of the other part:  And Whereas in November 1879 
<br/>the  chiefs  of  Rotuma  similarly  signified  adherence  to  such  principles  by  the  Deed  of 
<br/>Rotuma Cession.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  this  legally  does  and  this  is  why  there  was  no  such  provision 
<br/>specifically in the Constitution sets out that the land system that was set up in the Deed of Cession 
<br/>thereby continues.  Honourable Tuisawau said this Government has not done anything.  He does not 
<br/></span><span>talk about what the other governments did not do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 1997 Constitution does not or did not likewise for the 1990 Constitution does not or did 
<br/>not specifically prohibit (I should say) the alienation of  </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land.  This is why, when we talk 
<br/>about it in the floor of this Parliament, how? By using the State Lands Act, the SVT Government and 
<br/>the SDL Government permanently alienated </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land into freehold land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allowed only the alienation of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land to State land. It did not 
<br/>allow the alienation of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land to freehold land but they know that, what they do is a clandestine 
<br/></span><span>approach to this, they converted </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land to State land and immediately the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land that was 
<br/></span><span>converted to State land was immediately transferred to freehold title; he does not talk about that.  He 
<br/>says, “FijiFirst Government is anti-</span><span>Ttaukei”,</span><span> what a preposterous thing to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- He is mixing up the issue with the land in Denarau, that is nothing 
<br/>to do with it, the settlement is what is being proposed, it is nothing to do with what you are talking 
<br/>about.  You have not done any settlement, which is what I am saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General, you have the floor.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, his interjection demonstrates his lack of 
<br/>honesty. He has been intellectually dishonest, he has been selective.  He knows what I am saying is 
<br/>correct, but he wants to evade that.  He is only focussing on one particular area and I will come to 
<br/>that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I am showing and answering in response to what he claims that the FijiFirst 
<br/>has not done anything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the only Constitution … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- … in the history of Fiji …

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-… that says, “the ownership of all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land shall remain 
<br/>with the customary owners of that land and </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land shall not be permanently alienated” whether 
<br/>by sale, whether by grant, transfer or exchange. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is precisely that none of these Constitutions allowed for that particular 
<br/>prohibition. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under these former Constitutions, </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land was permanently 
<br/>alienated. He is talking about Section 27, on a completely different note for public purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he went on to talk about section 8 of the State Lands Act which has been in 
<br/></span><span>place since 1945.  He did not talk about how the previous Governments could have used section 8; 
<br/></span><span>the Alliance government, the Rabuka five years of decree-led governance…

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I obviously hit a very raw nerve.  I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>got people who can testify to your presence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  digress.  Honourable  Tuisawau, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>section 8 of the State Lands Act says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“… where any iTaukei Land which has been acquired by the State for public purpose under 
<br/>the provisions of the State Acquisition of Lands Act 1940 or any other written law is no longer 
<br/>required for such purpose, the Minister may, after consultation with Cabinet, may, by order, 
<br/>declare such land to be iTaukei land and such declaration shall be recorded in the name of the 
<br/>unit from which it was acquired in the Register of iTaukei Lands kept under the provisions 
<br/></span><span>of section 8 of the iTaukei Lands Act.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 1945, all those governments had the opportunity to do that, what he is saying that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should have done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 28(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji 2013 says that the 
<br/>law “shall revert”, in other words, it must and that is what he is saying.  He does not understand the 
<br/>difference.  One,  they  have  the  option,  this  one,  you  actually  have  to  do  so.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>honourable Tuisawau went on about the </span><span>Kanakana </span><span>case.  The </span><span>Kanakana</span><span> case I have here where the 
<br/>court  quite  lucidly  went  on  to  describe  specifically  what  had  happened  and  what  the  legal 
<br/>implications  were  of  those  three  types  of  land  systems  I  had  mentioned  as  stated  in  the  Deed  of 
<br/>Cession.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tuisawau  is  correct,  Ratu  Seru  Cakobau  gave  away  the  land.    If  he  were  to 
<br/>actually be genuine about it, the Fijian Administrator who worked in Fiji for a number of years, Peter 
<br/>France (Sir, you may know him).  He worked at the then Lands Commission and he was also a staff 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the then Ministry of Fijian Affairs. Very clearly, he gives a historical account of how the Native 
<br/>Lands Commission went around Fiji establishing ownership of land and the entire process that was 
<br/>involved in that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so therefore the honourable Member, in the interest of time, I would like to 
<br/>highlight to him, he knows that the land tenure was set in place by the Deed of Cession.  He also 
<br/>knows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the independence, the total </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land or native title at that time was about 
<br/>81 percent to 83 percent. Today, 91 percent of all the land in Fiji is </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a no minor feat. The Constitution itself under Section 28 provides for the 
<br/>maintenance of that percentage of land ownership, if anything, it can be increased. This is why and 
<br/>he  fails  to  address  Parliament  on  this,  the  previous  governments  had  started  the  Land  Buy  Back 
<br/>Scheme. Why are they buying back land?  Because they know that the titles of the land are preserved.  
<br/>So, in order to get land that has already gone into freehold, you actually just simply cannot convert 
<br/>it, you have to buy it back to be able to preserve the titles of the land that had been put in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also know, Sir, which he fails to mention and honourable Saukuru knows this, Schedule 
<br/>A and Schedule B were also returned.  In some instances, the actual </span><span>mataqali</span><span> went extinct.  In other 
<br/></span><span>cases, they could not establish who the actual owners of the land were.  As a result of the return of 
<br/></span><span>Schedules A and B, as a result of some of the Buy Back Schemes, we today have 91 percent of all 
<br/>the land in Fiji is iTaukei land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he compared New Zealand, as I mentioned yesterday, only 5.6 percent of 
<br/>the  land  in  New  Zealand  is  actually  native  titled.    The  rest  of  it  is  freehold  or  Crown  grant.  In 
<br/>Australia, they did  not  recognise the  Aborigines  as human beings  until  1966 or 1967. They were 
<br/>counted as part of flora and fauna.  Only Mabo which then said, the land was not </span><span>terra nullius </span><span>in 
<br/>other words, the land was not empty. This is why they kept on classifying them as non-human beings 
<br/>because they said, we can take every piece of land. Mabo established that, he does not talk about that.  
<br/>There  is  no  way  that  you  can  compare  the  New  Zealand  and  Australian  experience  to  the  Fijian 
<br/>experience. They also know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member and again, like most of the Members from the other 
<br/>side have come to this Parliament with no clean hands and it is only for political motivation. His 
<br/>leader who is going to join very soon, only a few years ago said iTaukei land should be converted to 
<br/>Crown grant - 50 percent.  That is what he said, Rabuka said that and we know he is going to join 
<br/>him. So he should relook at what he is stating over here for his own political purpose. Stop trying to 
<br/></span><span>create uncertainty in our economy and stop trying to create political mischief just for your own short 
<br/></span><span>term political gain!

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  we  go  on  to  the  next  End  of  the  Week 
<br/>Statement, I just want to inform Parliament that the response to Written Question No. 137/2022 by 
<br/>honourable Saukuru has been handed in by the honourable Prime Minister and you will be informed 
<br/>of that and it can be uploaded on the Parliament website.  I commend that response and I urge all 
<br/>other Ministers who have Written Questions to get it in promptly.

<div><span>Contribution of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> in Fiji</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers 
<br/>and honourable Members, before I start, I would like to show my respect to all the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>, whose 
<br/>souls are resting in heaven.  Shall their soul rest in peace.  A number of months before 14</span><span>th</span><span> May, 
<br/>1879, a group of British Indians were deceitfully enticed by the British to board </span><span>Leonidas</span><span> to come to 
<br/>the land of milk and honey, known as Fiji.  These people came to be called </span><span>Girmitiyas,</span><span> a word that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>came out from the word “</span><span>girmit”.</span><span>  These British Indians could not say ‘agreement’ referring to an 
<br/>agreement to work, they said </span><span>girmit</span><span>, therefore, became known as “</span><span>Girmitiyas”</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, estimate shows that about 1.2 million British Indians were exported to 19 
<br/>colonies  in  those  times.    Over  61,000  British  Indians  were  imported  by  Fiji  from  1869  to  1916.  
<br/>Moreover than a century, Indians now recognised as </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>, worked day-in-day-out to build and 
<br/>contribute to the development of Fiji.  Though at that point in time, they were treated as slaves, they 
<br/>left no stone unturned and gave their 100 percent to ensure that the sugar cane industry flourishes in 
<br/>Fiji, which later became the backbone of Fiji’s economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they came in, they also had issues with food as supplies they were carrying in ships 
<br/>lasted only for a few days.  Some of the ships they came in did not even have space to sit.  So one 
<br/>can only imagine without proper meal and water, how they would have survived the journey from 
<br/>India  to  Fiji.    Whilst,  61,000  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>  made  it  to  Fiji,  not  all  were  fortunate  to  complete  their 
<br/>journey.   Fighting  against  disease outbreak  and  no proper hygiene and no medical  supplies, their 
<br/>bodies were thrown overboard.  While those who made it through, came to learn that their struggle 
<br/>on the ship was just the beginning.  Ladies were raped by the British and Australians, most ladies did 
<br/>not  conceive  as  they  had  to  work  the  same  amount  as  their  husbands  and  pregnancy  was  an 
<br/></span><span>inconvenience, which they tried avoiding most of the time.  You know what that led to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the five years, </span><span>girmit,</span><span> could pay their way back, of course, they could not do so.  
<br/>The condition was, to do another five years and they would pay their passage back.  The British left 
<br/>our shores giving the independence to our beloved Fiji.  The dynamics of </span><span>girmit</span><span> system that imposed 
<br/>political and social separation, the electoral system were set in stone by the British Colonial System.  
<br/>The trickery prevailed in the Alliance Party.  Parties like the NFP at that point in time, not the NFP 
<br/>that is in Parliament today, were streaks ahead as far as national building and called for common and 
<br/>equal citizenry and opened franchise without ethnic demarcation while independence was granted 
<br/>under British divide and rule system. There were changes for the better being brought about in the 
<br/>new independence of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, in 1987, one man rose only to be the reason for the downfall of our nation.  I will 
<br/>come back to it, as to how one man, one selfish man, one self-centred person, one egoistic person, 
<br/>for his ambition for the throne thrashed the work and efforts of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> that helped Fiji to be 
<br/>potentially in par with countries such as New Zealand and Singapore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> first placed their foot in Fiji, majority places in Fiji were nothing else but 
<br/></span><span>jungle.  What we see in Fiji today is certainly resulted from the foundation laid by </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>.  Were 
<br/></span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> recognised for the contribution towards nation building?  Government came and went, no 
<br/>one recognised the contributions of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> in Fiji.  It was not until 2006, when the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister started a movement, when for the first time, the descendants of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> were given 
<br/>the equal rights and recognised as Fijian, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first time, after all these number of years what </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> dreamed about finally third 
<br/>or fourth generation saw it eventuating under the Bainimarama Government.  Do I need to tell what 
<br/>the Bainimarama Government and how the FijiFirst Government has been doing in recognising the 
<br/>hard work and the contribution of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>?  Maybe, yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I need to emphasise: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Bainimarama Government gave us all the 2013 Constitution. 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Equal citizenry, we are all call Fijian now; and the honourable Prof. Biman Prasad from 
<br/>NFP has difficulty calling us Fijian until to date.

<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  realise  the    hardship  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>  went 
<br/>through in building the roads, clearing the land for farming, making railways to cut sugarcane.  Can 
<br/>we imagine how hard it would have been for them to do all that without any machine?  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the recognition that the FijiFirst Government gave to the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> should have been done 50 
<br/></span><span>years  ago.    As  I  said,  FijiFirst  is  a  movement,  the  foundation  was  laid  in  2006.    The  FijiFirst 
<br/></span><span>movement is here to stay and will continue to recognise the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> and their contributions.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, ever since </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> step into Fiji, their struggle 
<br/>started.    First,  at  the  hand  of  the  British  who  brought  them  to  Fiji  and  their  descendants,  they 
<br/>continued to suffer at the hands of the people like Rabuka.  Every bit of effort was pursued at the foot 
<br/>of one person and his supporters when Rabuka carried out the 1987 </span><span>coup. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The </span><span>coup</span><span> that took Fiji into dark days, when the self-respect and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dignity was totally destroyed, when ladies were raped in front of their families.

<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The topic is “Contribution of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>” but he is touching on 
<br/>a totally different issues without substantiating and he has gone off the topic.  Please let us focus on 
<br/>the positive, the positive is the contribution of the </span><span>Girmitiyas.</span><span>  If you are happy about it, you can 
<br/>outline it. Thank you.  It is a great contribution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, do not carry on a conversation with the other side.  If 
<br/>you want to speak, come through the Speaker.  That is the format.  Do not argue with the other side.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the </span><span>coup</span><span> that took Fiji into dark days when the 
<br/>self-respect and dignity was totally destroyed, ladies were raped in front of their families and this is 
<br/>the fact.  Husbands had to literally hide their wives and daughters in </span><span>dalo</span><span> and cassava plantation just 
<br/>to safeguard them from rapists. This is a fact, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Some parents were beaten up whole night but would not tell the 
<br/>whereabouts of their daughters.   Ladies were made to stay naked in the cell during 1987 coup.  Males 
<br/>were made to remove their pants and undergarments and sit on hot mill mud and tarsealled roads.  
<br/>People were made to empty water from one 44 gallon drum to another using teaspoon.  Torture, rape 
<br/>and bloodshed became a routine after the 1987 coup and was repeated in 2002. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 1987, Rabuka justified his actions on the basis of ethnic difference. </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> nor their 
<br/>descendants did not come here to take the land from iTaukei people  - not then and not now, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  We are here as human beings, exploited by the Colonial system and are citizens of Fiji.  
<br/></span><span>We are Fijians. We have no other home. We do not associate any other country as our home other 
<br/></span><span>than Fiji. This is totally against what the leaders of 1987 and 2000 </span><span>coups</span><span> have been preaching that 
<br/></span><span>Girmityas</span><span> and their descendants are here to snatch the land from iTaukei  landowners.  This is so 
<br/>wrong, Mr. Speaker.   Unfortunately, SODELPA, PAP and other parties are still preaching this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land is well protected in the 2013 Constitution. The descendants of </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> were treated 
<br/>as slaves, tortured then left Fiji in 1987 which was the start of the downfall of Fiji’s economy.  Apart 
<br/>from some elite Fijians no one else benefitted from 2000 and 1987 coup.  They could have started a 
<br/>fair share of lease money distribution but they never did for iTaukei landowners because again only 
<br/>some elites benefitted from it.   Such discrimination and nepotism against our iTaukei brothers and 
<br/>sisters even forced them to leave Fiji, thus leading to further brain drain in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a hypocritical statement was made by the People’s Alliance Leader when he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioned….. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Point of Order.  He has gone out of topic.  He is now talking about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners.  He should talk about the </span><span>Girmityas</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- It definitely shows that the truth hurts and some people are in real 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pain on that side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, a hypocritical statement was made by the People’s Alliance Leader when he 
<br/>mentioned that no one was forced to leave the country and that he was grateful to those countries that 
<br/>received those who fled Fiji after suffering from the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>.  No-one wanted to leave Fiji. All 
<br/>those who left Fiji, left Fiji unwillingly. They were forced out because of violence, discrimination 
<br/>and blatant racism.  What he did cannot be forgotten.  No explanation from him is enough to justify 
<br/>his doing, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  add  to  this  insult,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  said  that  we,  the  FijiFirst  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament are instilling fear upon Fijians on what transpired in 1987.  I must tell him it is not us, it 
<br/>is the suffering and torture back in 1987 and 2000 that has embedded fear in the people’s heart.  The 
<br/>honourable  Professor  Prasad,  the  National  Federation  Party  and  supporters  of  the  NFP  should  be 
<br/>ashamed that they hold Rabuka’s hand.  Rabuka destroyed Fiji.  He destroyed SVT.  He destroyed 
<br/>SODELPA.  He is on the verge of destroying NFP and now his eyes are on Fiji again, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>Everything that FijiFirst has achieved he wants to bring it down to ruins and NFP supports him.  What 
<br/>a shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlighting the significant  contribution made by the  </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> to Fiji’s 
<br/>economy and society, it is encouraging to see the descendant’s continuous input towards the country 
<br/>progress  and  prosperity.  This  is  especially  important  at  the  present  moment  as  the  international 
<br/>community is looking at how Fiji and its people move forward to build a better and stronger Fiji.  We 
<br/>dedicate ourselves towards the decisive leadership to keep this spirit alive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It can truly be said that because of the </span><span>Girmitiya’s</span><span> sacrifices, we are where we are today.  To 
<br/>conclude  I  would  like  to    take  this  opportunity  to  acknowledge  </span><span>Girmityas</span><span>  who  are  suffering  as 
<br/>individuals  or  collectively,  despite  the  toils  and  tears,  exploitation,  beatings,  suicide,  sexual 
<br/>exploitation, humiliation, inhumane treatment that laid the economic foundation of our modern State 
<br/>of Fiji.  I salute the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> for their contribution.  I convey my well-wishes to everyone as we 
<br/>remember the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> this week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to honourable Maharaj’s End of 
<br/>Week Statement.  He has shared a lot of information which I support.  The hard work, sacrifices and 
<br/></span><span>struggles  of  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>  contributed  to  building  the  Fiji  of  today.    Despite  the  struggles,  they 
<br/></span><span>survived and thrived to become an integral part of Fijian society, living side by side with their fellow 
<br/>Fijians who kindly accepted them in  their midst.    It was in  the brutal  fields,  nothing short of the 
<br/>killing fields of war when we look at infant mortality, suicide rates and overall deaths due to violence 
<br/>or disease that the foundation of modern Fiji were laid.  However, to escape the horrors of their life 
<br/>and to progress, </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> focussed on education, something they believed and invested in.  Short 
<br/>term leases would end one day with no guarantee of renewal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Colonial  regime  and  CSR  could  do  anything  –  jobs  which  were  at  the  mercy  of  the 
<br/>company or other Europeans could be taken away at will but education, Mr. Speaker, was something 
<br/>that  could  never  be  taken  from  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>.    It  was  that  one  thing  that  would  remain  in  their 
<br/>possession.  It was this simple truth that drove the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span>s through unimaginable sacrifice and 
<br/>struggles  to  establish  schools.    This  includes  early  leaders  like  Badri  Maharaj,  who  during  the 
<br/>indenture period, spearheaded the early education revolution for  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> and their descendants 
<br/>and even used his own funds to establish the then Wairuku Indian School in 1898 in Rakiraki which 
<br/>is now known as Wairuku Primary School.  The alumni from this school was none other than the 
<br/>pioneering iTaukei leader and statesman, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, today there are 
<br/>180 schools, a university and a nursing institute setup by the descendants of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we celebrate the Girmit legacy, it is important for all of us to remember that the fight for 
<br/>education  was  also  a  fight  for  a  better  life  for  all  citizens  of  Fiji  including  the  iTaukei  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> under the British Colonial rule.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, even in education, the British divided 
<br/>us by saying, “schools needed to be setup based on ethnicity.”  They, of course, divided us even in 
<br/>sports.  We must not forget that this journey to the united Fiji of today which was based on love and 
<br/>ethnic harmony had its share of opponents, vile people who could not tolerate the progress our nation 
<br/>was making, because they could not see beyond their bigotry and racial hate.  In fact, their hatred ran 
<br/>so deep that it spilled into violence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am referring to the brutal and racially motivated </span><span>coups</span><span> of 1987 and 2000.  
<br/>It was a cruel reflection of the pain and suffering of </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> during the 37 dark years of the Girmit 
<br/>period.  One could say that the 1987 and 2000 </span><span>coups</span><span> was a second Girmit with </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants 
<br/>relegated to a status below that of non-citizens. It was during this period that racism and provincialism 
<br/>was institutionalised and these racial tensions, discrimination and double-standards made life very 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1437 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>difficult  once  again.    The  2000  </span><span>coup</span><span>  that  followed  saw  further  brutality  and  the  loss  of  their 
<br/>fundamental human rights - freedom of thought, action, assembly and religion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the trauma of the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span> and the establishment of a regime that brutally 
<br/>oppressed </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants created a generational trauma.  Their wounded psyche, the tears 
<br/>shed, the families broken, the individuals brutalised in the name of race and religion or both, they 
<br/>will never get back the lives they built in the land that they loved and still love.                       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the perpetrators of these coups cannot say sorry and wash their hands off 
<br/>the evil deeds.  The goal of a fundamentalist ethno-nationalist State not only directly targeted the 
<br/>descendants of the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> in Fiji but it also caused severe harm to our nation as a whole.  Many 
<br/>of the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants lost their ties to the land on which they were born.  Families are still 
<br/>fractured due to the forced exodus of many of the</span><span> girmitiya</span><span> descendants.  The economic and social 
<br/>cost that resulted are borne by all Fijians to this day.  No amount of apologetic tokenism and self-
<br/>proclamations of change by perpetrators like Sitiveni Rabuka, who took Fiji 50 years back in a single 
<br/>day, will provide restorative justice for the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> legacy and the lives of their descendants in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, restorative justice for the descendants of </span><span>girmitiyas</span><span> has only come about by 
<br/></span><span>the visionary leadership of our Prime Minister, honourable Voreqe Bainimarama.  It was his honest 
<br/></span><span>vision that has  done more for restorative justice for the  </span><span>girmitiya</span><span> legacy.   Visionary in  seeing an 
<br/>equitable and united Fiji for all Fijians and that makes the coup of 2006 different, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>The true identity of all Fijians came with the 2013 Constitution that allows everyone who is born in 
<br/>Fiji to earn the right to be a Fijian regardless of race, religion, colour, gender or socioeconomic status 
<br/>and this is the Fiji of today.  It takes someone like our Prime Minister to protect every citizen and 
<br/>give us all a fair and equal treatment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  restorative  justice  at  work  in  providing  the  rightful  place  for  the 
<br/></span><span>girmitiya</span><span> legacy and their descendants on a footing of equity and inclusivity.  Since last week, we 
<br/>have paid tribute to the </span><span>girmitiyas</span><span> at various events on the occasion of 143</span><span>rd</span><span> anniversary of the arrival 
<br/>of the first indentured labourers.  We highlighted the struggles of </span><span>girmitiyas</span><span> and how it was reflected 
<br/>once again through the coup of May, 87.  Everyone knows what followed.  It devastated our economy.  
<br/>It fuelled racial and religious hatred and Indo-Fijians were discriminated in all walks of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Alvick Maharaj just highlighted this and so did the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>a few days ago.  We also highlighted that the descendants of </span><span>girmitiyas</span><span> continued the good work of 
<br/>their fore-parents in building a modern and progressive Fiji together with all other Fijians including 
<br/></span><span>the indigenous people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of mentioning these facts was to ensure that this important part 
<br/>of our history is not forgotten as this is part of Fiji’s rich history and our current and future generations 
<br/>should know about this.  Those who were born in 1987 are 35 years old.  They do not know what 
<br/>happened in this country and why Fiji is the way it is today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rabuka denied that his 1987 coup forced the </span><span>girmit</span><span> descendants to leave 
<br/>the country.  Instead he shamelessly said that his coup facilitated their departure to greener pastures. 
<br/>None left Fiji for India and some have now returned to Fiji.  People left Fiji because of instability 
<br/>and insecurity caused by him.  The only reason why people are coming back to this country was 
<br/>because of the stability and security provided by FijiFirst Government under the leadership of our 
<br/>Prime Minister.  What an insult and disrespect to those who were marginalised, discriminated against, 
<br/>beaten up and raped during 1987?  And when we talk about  rape,  you just say, “ooh, ahh.” That 
<br/>means you do not even know that this happened in this country.  You do not even know what the

<div><span>Can we trust him?  Has he changed?  I do not think so.  There is no remorse shown by him 
<br/>with such utterances.  Now, to remedy that, he will declare public holiday to mark </span><span>Girmit </span><span>Day.  What 
<br/>a hypocrite, Mr. Speaker, Sir!  May 14</span><span>th</span><span> was not only the arrival of first indentured labourers but also 
<br/>the  day  he  committed  the  </span><span>coup</span><span>  of  1987.    Every  </span><span>girmit</span><span>  celebration  should  always  remind  the 
<br/>descendants of </span><span>girmitiya</span><span> the atrocities of the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Rabuka  had  the  audacity  to  say  that  Indo-Fijians  were  safer  under  his 
<br/>Soqosoqo Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) Government.  During the SVT Government, as claimed by 
<br/>Rabuka, he gave civil servant jobs to the people of Cakaudrove just so he could get their votes.  What 
<br/>he actually did was take jobs away from capable and qualified people by institutionalising race and 
<br/>provincialism in the Civil Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  echo  the  words  of  honourable  Attorney-General  that  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad has always been silent on the sufferings of Indo-Fijians brought upon them by the 
<br/>actions of Rabuka through this </span><span>coup</span><span> of 1987. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been sitting here for the last 
<br/>30 minutes, both interventions by honourable Maharaj and the honourable Minister, if they do not 
<br/>realise he is  creating and inciting ethnic tensions today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  say  one  thing  also,  the  honourable  Minister  is  misleading  Parliament  about  the 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad not taking any interest in the Indo-Fijian cooperation of Fiji, that is a lie 
<br/>and she should withdraw the statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I must add also Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many goodwill people in Fiji today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- And I am saying this on the ethnic part the tone is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The Opposition  believes  that  I should be sanitising the history and 
<br/></span><span>presenting it the way they want to hear it, but that is the history and we have to accept the history.  
<br/></span><span>Let me remind honourable Professor Prasad on what Rabuka said and, of course, the Opposition and 
<br/>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Hindus and Muslims are pagans who must be converted to Christianity.  It 
<br/>will be a big challenge for us to convert all Indians, those who do not choose to become 
<br/>Christians can continue to live here but they will probably find that it is a difficult place 
<br/>to  live  in  and  we  are  trying  to  make  this  place  perfect  for  the  Fijian  people  meaning 
<br/>iTaukeis and if it is not perfect for others, then that is too bad and they will have to go.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a comment by Mahendra Chaudhary caught my eyes this week which needs 
<br/>to be corrected.  He has manipulated the remarks I made.  Firstly, he completely ignored that I had 
<br/>shared my own story which was probably the case with many Indo-Fijians.  I said that I had no family 
<br/>connection in India and it is a fact.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  grandfather  came from  a place  called  Basti,  I do not  even know where  Basti is.   The 
<br/>connection is simply as a tourist or a visitor, that is how I feel when I go to India.  I never said that 
<br/>we have no cultural, economic, or spiritual ties, there is a huge difference between having cultural 
<br/>and spiritual ties and having family ties and you all understand that.  You all understand the difference 
<br/>between that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we understand that Mr. Chaudhry’s experience is different, perhaps like me, 
<br/>others too might not have connections like Chaudhry had with the State of Haryana in India after the 
<br/>2000 </span><span>coup</span><span>.  </span><span>Girmityas</span><span> had done a lot to develop Fiji that we see today, their sacrifice and struggles 
<br/>laid the foundations for Fiji’s economy.  Their legacy has been continued by their descendants to the 
<br/>present day, the sugar industry which has been the mainstay of our economy for over 100 years has 
<br/>been the contributor to our foreign exchange.  It is still a source of livelihood for thousands of Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today  we  pay  homage  to  the  </span><span>Girmityas</span><span>  and  the  foundational  contribution  to  Fiji’s  past, 
<br/>present and future descendants for whom Fiji is home like all other Fijians live and seek to live in 
<br/>peace, security, justice, compassion and under the rule of law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to once again share my story.  My grandfather came from a place 
<br/></span><span>called Basti in India and this is my great grandfather and my grandfather.  He was a small boy when 
<br/></span><span>he came, ever since he came to Fiji, he worked in the sugarcane plantation then they started a small 
<br/>business and that is how we build our life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then,  of  course,  the  </span><span>coups</span><span>  of  1987  destroyed  my  family.  My  family  were  separated,  my 
<br/>brothers and sisters migrated because of instability, insecurity and they left.  But when I go to India, 
<br/>I have been there many times, I love the country, I enjoyed the food, I buy clothes, I buy Bollywood 
<br/>movies, I do everything just like a tourist does but that is not home.  M home is Fiji and that is where 
<br/>I belong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wage Rates in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  and  the 
<br/>privilege to deliver my Statement on wage rates in Fiji.  Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations and Youth and Sports and his team for the 
<br/>tremendous work done to ensure that the National Minimum Wage and the sectoral-base minimum 
<br/>wage rates are reviewed in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the payment of wages according to the minimum stipulated rates are very 
<br/></span><span>crucial  to  ensure  that  the  workers  are  given  the  social  justice  process  by  implementation  of  the 
<br/>minimum terms and conditions of employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Section 33(1) of the 2013 Constitution stipulates ‘the State must take 
<br/>reasonable measures within its available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the rights 
<br/>of every person to work and to adjust minimum wage’. Our Government has continued to implement 
<br/>the changes (it is important to be in par with the news.  So if you read the news, if you know the 
<br/>report, if you were in Parliament during Budget day you would know so you need to understand, do 
<br/>not sleep in Parliament, wake up and listen to the deliberations, continue to implement the changes 
<br/>to review minimum wages and terms and conditions of employment of all workers in Fiji.  This is to 
<br/>ensure that no one is left behind in this process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2013 Constitution further stipulates ‘that every person must have the 
<br/>right to fair employment practices including humane treatment and proper working conditions’. This 
<br/>is embedded within the Employment Relations Act 2007 to ensure workers are given fair and just 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working conditions in all sectors of our economy.  The process of ensuring fair working conditions 
<br/>is done through employer, employee consultation with the intervention of Ministry of Employment 
<br/>in cases where workers and employers have disagreements.  This is done through fair process and 
<br/>good faith approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the great leadership and vision of our Prime Minister and the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, the FijiFirst Government has made sure to fulfil all commitments made to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current progressive minimum wage increase in four tranches will not 
<br/>only improve lives of all Fijian workers but also  their families to enjoy a decent livelihood.  The 
<br/>progressive wage increase will enable families to comfortably meet their daily needs and prepare for 
<br/>the welfare of the children in the near future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  increase  in  national  minimum  wage  will  also  assimilate  consumer 
<br/>spending, help business to maximise their profits and grow the economy. A modest increase would 
<br/>improve the work of productivity and build the morale of workers and also reduce employee turnover 
<br/>and  absenteeism.    It  will  also  boost  the  overall  of  our  economy  by  generating  an  increase  of 
<br/>consumers’ participation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  studies  and  research  have  found  that  employee  morale  and  work  ethics 
<br/>increase when employees believe that they are paid fair wages.  Economists (not the one that we have 
<br/>here)  economists  have  also  linked  higher  wages  to  better  physical  and  mental  health  and  reduce 
<br/>decisions for the team leading to higher productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary argument advanced in favour of raising the minimum wage is 
<br/>that the higher earnings would improve the overall standard of living for the minimum wage earners 
<br/>by providing them with more appropriate income level to handle the cost of living increases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Oh, it is too late! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- No, we have been progressively doing it. No other Governments including 
<br/>that of the father of coups and the coup culture in Fiji who now claims to be messiah of all Fijians 
<br/>have  ever  implemented  minimum  wage  rate  in  Fiji.  It  is  the  Fiji  First  Government  and  the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government that had the courage to implement minimum wage in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a great insult to the workers of Fiji that the de-facto leader of PAPI and the leader of NFP 
<br/></span><span>dares to question why the Fiji First government is revising the minimum wage rate. In his political 
<br/></span><span>mileage smokescreen he has forgotten that the workers need a just wage to sustain themselves and 
<br/>their families. Shame on him for questioning the increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I would like to thank the honourable Minister for Employment, 
<br/>Productivity,  Industrial  Relations  and  his  team  for  the  marvellous  work  done  in  increasing  the 
<br/>minimum wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, honourable Prasad was quoted saying that the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>
<br/>would be turning in their graves. For once, I agree with his statement. Yes, the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> would be 
<br/>turning in their graves and their descendants who have departed would be turning in the graves due 
<br/>to the honourable Professor Prasad and NFP colluding with the person who caused so much suffering 
<br/>to the </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> descendants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  father,  I  am  talking  about  the  personal  suffering.  My  father  suffered  in  the  hands  of 
<br/>Rabuka and his thugs.  He was forced to do press-ups on the road just because he was five minutes

<div><span>away from home and he had to go to the hospital because of that.  In the second coup in 2000, he 
<br/>passed away. I have personally suffered because of his culture that this person has started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Very poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I know of numerous other accounts of people being thrashed by Rabuka’s 
<br/>thugs  just  like  what  was  done  to  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>  there  is  no  difference.  Yet,  Rabuka  has  the  sick 
<br/>audacity of saying that he has done the favour to the Indo-Fijians. Shame on him and more shame on 
<br/>honourable Prasad and NFP for partnering with him.  He and NFP have wilfully ignored what Rabuka 
<br/>did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- He and NFP have wilfully ignored what Rabuka did and continues to do 
<br/>by taunting us through his false and wild comments. Shame on him and more so shame on honourable 
<br/>Prasad who in is blind and egoistic quest to gain political mileage has compromised all the values, 
<br/>principles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you were talking about wage rates in Fiji and you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were going well but now you are starting to stray. Stick to your End of the Week Statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is just that the suffering was unbearable for us and the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>. Once 
<br/>again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Minister and his team for a great work 
<br/>done in revising the minimum wage in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be very  humble  and  simple  today.    I  rise  to 
<br/>respond to the Statement given by the honourable Nand on the wage rates in Fiji.  The compliance 
<br/>and enforcement of minimum terms and conditions, together with the enforcement of the minimum 
<br/>wage rates in Fiji is one of the key responsibilities of my Ministry, which is undertaken through the 
<br/>various sectors of the economy by the labour standard officers.  As a measure of the priority given to 
<br/>fair wages, even in times of crisis, such as the war in Ukraine and the continued effects of COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic, the Internal Labour Organisation continues to maintain that we must ensure not only 
<br/>fair wages, but also decent wages.  This is the principle which this Government is invoking to ensure 
<br/>that we provide the best to all our Fijians, despite the global challenges we face today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In setting the National Minimum Wage, we must ensure that vulnerable workers are provided 
<br/></span><span>with decent wage.  It has not been an easy balancing act, so that to set the minimum wages, do not 
<br/></span><span>discourage  productivity  and  competition  for  employers.    This  required  a  well  balanced  approach 
<br/>adopted  by  the  FijiFirst  Government  for  a  fair  and  just  wages  for  all  workers  covered  under  the 
<br/>National  Minimum  Wages,  and  sector  based  minimum  wages.    This  also  required  that  all 
<br/>stakeholders come to the table during the National Minimum Wage Rate consultation.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  this  was  not  followed  by  the  major  stakeholders,  in  particular,  the  political  parties  and  trade 
<br/>unions, apart from a lone representation by one political party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, consultation participation means representation of your interest and those 
<br/>who  you  claim  to  lead.    The  failure  of  the  trade  unions  to  attend  the  National  Minimum  Wage 
<br/>consultation, which I have earlier outlined in this Parliament, now that we are back on the National 
<br/>Minimum Wage topic, it is timely that the National Minimum Wage matter be put to rest by the so 
<br/>called politicians from that side.  In doing so, they have clearly demonstrated their lack of interest 
<br/>and advocacy on behalf of the workers of Fiji.  So, they have no right now to come to this Parliament 
<br/>or to go out in public and claim to represent the interest.  Where were they when this Government 
<br/>provided  them  with  an  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the  review  of  the  National  Minimum  Wage?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Instead, they chose to spit fire from the sidelines and come here under the Parliamentary Privilege 
<br/>and make big empty statements on the National Minimum Wage and its process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, honourable Professor Prasad made a personal attack that I attend 
<br/>funerals and weddings with the hidden agenda of campaigning.  These personal attacks on me, only 
<br/>one thing I can understand of honourable Professor Prasad, is a complete failure of leadership and 
<br/>integrity  on  the  part  of  honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  an  inability  to  deal  with  issues.    As  a 
<br/>community worker and now as an MP and Minister, I have had a lifetime of attending these events 
<br/>for the right reasons, and I will continue to do so, for the right reasons, that is to serve the people.  
<br/>This leadership role based on community services in a humble and a material role has been my way 
<br/>of contributing to the society.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he forgot, I also attended his brother’s funeral.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be within their joys and in times of their sorrows and you will find me with 
<br/>them in my Ministerial shoes or in flip-flops. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now let me turn to the good deals of the FijiFirst Government.  The new 
<br/>National Minimum Wage that is being implemented for the good of the workers of Fiji as we speak 
<br/>and we do not short-changed them or short-sell them like some others do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the ILO recommendation on the minimum wage fixing states that minimum 
<br/></span><span>wage rate should be adjusted from time to time to take account of change in the cost of living and 
<br/>other economic conditions and that is exactly what the FijiFirst Government has done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  completed  the  review  of  the  National  Minimum 
<br/>Wage and also the 10 sector based minimum wages that is being implemented in four stages.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, since the first ever National Minimum Wage was conducted in 2013 and 2014 and since 
<br/>then, under the Fiji First Government, we have ensured the gradual rise in the minimum wage rates 
<br/>in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  not  forget  that,  Mr  Speaker,  Sir.    The  National  Minimum  Wage  was  implemented 
<br/>under the profound leadership of our honourable Prime Minister.  He had the courage to deliver his 
<br/>promise to the people of Fiji and more so, to the thousands of workers who have directly benefited 
<br/>from  more  to  take  home  pay  and  more  FNPF  contributions  in  their  accounts  with  an  increase  of 
<br/>minimum wage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the roll-out  of the National  Minimum  Wage will ensure a more  gradual 
<br/>increase that will enable all stakeholders to meet their obligations. By the end of the implementations, 
<br/></span><span>real wages under the National Minimum Wage will rise on the calculation based on a worker who is 
<br/></span><span>employed for 48 hours per week from $128.64 per week to $192 in January 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the International Labour Organisation, the proper application 
<br/>of labour legislation including the implementation of wages, rates depends on an effective labour 
<br/>system.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government is committed to sustaining the system, to ensure 
<br/>that the labour law applies equally to the employers and workers in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the primary intent of the Employment Relation Act 2007 is to empower 
<br/>both  the  workers  and  employers  on  their  rights  and  responsibilities  during  an  employment 
<br/>engagement.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the minimum social protection afforded to our workers are to keep 
<br/>with their needs and the policies that are implemented to promote good, faith employment relation 
<br/>and ensure that best business and management factors are implemented in workplaces to improve 
<br/>productivity in a sustainable manner.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this of course, also includes review of wages rates to ensure decent wages 
<br/>for our workers while balancing the employers ability to pay.  This is part of the Balancing Act, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that has led to the implementation of a sustainable and a fair national minimum wage 
<br/>under the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of the National Minimum Wage is a high priority area, 
<br/>the Labour Standard Services of my Ministry will ensure its correct implementation as part of an 
<br/>outreach conducting proactive labour inspection.  The Labour Standard Services of my ministry from 
<br/>August 2016 until 2020 has conducted over 18,000 proactive labour inspection to ensure compliance 
<br/>with minimum terms and conditions of employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Finance, earlier this week, the honourable Professor Prasad made a lot 
<br/>of noise on the appointment of the Public Accounts Committee chairmanship.  He was talking about 
<br/>the practice, the norm and the rule but he should also tell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under which rule he was 
<br/>nominated as Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  reliably  told  that  he  presented  a  </span><span>tabua</span><span>  to  the  then  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and in return, he was offered Chairmanship.  Mr. Speaker Sir, this is the truth and this 
<br/></span><span>man can do anything for power.
