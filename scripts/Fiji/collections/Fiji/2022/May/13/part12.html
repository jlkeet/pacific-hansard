<div><span>Update on Child Protection Programme  
<br/>(Question No. 122/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  Child  Protection  Programme,  which  has  an  allocation  of  $50,000  in  the 
<br/>Revised 2021-2022 Budget?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  The 
<br/>Fijian  Government  is  obliged  to  protect  the  rights  of  our  children  as  per  our  commitment  to  the 
<br/>Convention on the Rights of Children.  Children in this context are those between the ages of 0 to 
<br/>18.  Fiji’s proportion of the population between zero to 18 is approximately made of 34 percent or 
<br/>300,000 children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The care and protection budget of $300,000 in the Revised Budget will enable Government 
<br/>to facilitate advocacy and outreach programmes on the prevention of child abuse and neglect which 
<br/>is done annually.   Secondly, the allocation will also allow the Ministry to facilitate wide and inclusive 
<br/>consultations on two national policies on children, namely; the National Child Protection Strategic 
<br/>Framework  and  the  National  Child  Safeguarding  Policy.  Work  progress  in  this  area  include; 
<br/>consultations with faith-based organisations, Civil Society Organisations and Government agencies 
<br/>at national level.  The Ministry will be formalising its submission and finalisation of the policy within 
<br/></span><span>the fourth quarter of this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to the National Child Safeguarding Policy, the Ministry continues 
<br/>to meet with relevant Government agencies to consult widely on the framework.  Once the policy is 
<br/>endorsed, every Government agency engaged in activities that involves contact with children will be 
<br/>required to adopt the National Child Safeguarding Policy or to develop their own safeguarding policy 
<br/>aligned to the National Child Safeguarding Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry as per its legal mandate under the existing legislation related 
<br/>to  child  protection  also  requires  the  State  to  provide  for  the  needs  of  children  as  and  when  child 
<br/>placements are being facilitated by Ministry Officials.  These would include meeting expenses of 
<br/>travel,  meals  and  accommodation  accordingly.  Today,  the  Ministry  works  with  a  total  of  11 
<br/>residential care homes and children across the country which has a total of 156 children.  Existing 
<br/>legislations that guide the work of welfare officers in the frontline of child protection include; the 
<br/>Adoption of Infants Act (Cap 58), the Child Welfare Act 2010 and the Juveniles Act (Cap 56).

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1407 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  inform  this  august  Parliament  that  the  Government 
<br/>investment  for  child  protection  is  not  limited  to  this  $50,000  annual  year  alone,  there  are  other 
<br/>budgetary allocations that serve to resource the service platform.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  last  four  years,  the  Government  has  provided  a  total  investment  of  $45.6  million 
<br/>towards child protection initiatives and Government which includes social protection, institutional 
<br/>grants  as  well  as  the  child  protection  programmes.    This  equates  to  an  average  of  $11.4  million 
<br/>annually in the past four years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  conclude  by  saying  that  the  child  protection  allocation  in  the  Revised 
<br/>Budget is an enabling allocation for the welfare officers to facilitate according to the requirements to 
<br/>meet the best interests and protection of our children who come to our service terrains across the four 
<br/>national  Divisions.    This,  of  course,  is  part  of  the  bigger  allocation  towards  child  protection 
<br/>resourcing that Government invests annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for that statement 
<br/>on  child  protection.    My  question  is  on  child  beggars  and  also  on  the  mental  health  of  children, 
<br/>particularly  in  regards  to  the  effect  or  the  kind  of  trauma  that  children  went  through  during  the 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19 pandemic.  What kind of programmes and how much of this allocation is going to be 
<br/></span><span>allocated for those two specific programmes that I have mentioned in regards to mental health and 
<br/>also child beggars as these are rising problems right now with our children?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  I 
<br/>will answer your first question.  When it comes to child welfare and when it comes to education, 
<br/>mental  health  and  looking  after  the  aspects  of  our  children,  I  think  parental  responsibility  is 
<br/>paramount, given the fact that we have children begging on our streets.  I would like to pose a question 
<br/>to all of us; where does the responsibility lie?  Children, when they are in school, they are looked 
<br/>after by the teachers - the education system.  When they are at home and during after school hours, I 
<br/>strongly believe that they should be at the responsibility of their parents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Ministry has profiled child beggars and the sad part is that, most of these children are on 
<br/>the streets at the knowledge of their parents.  The parents know that their children are selling pies 
<br/>and  coconuts  and  begging.    It  is  not  only  dangerous  for  the  child  but  they  can  be  prey  to  other 
<br/>activities, like drugs, et cetera.  So, I would first and foremost urge all the parents across the country 
<br/>to be aware of where their children are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  look  after  your  children  when  they  are  in  school.    Schools  have  counselling  services.  
<br/></span><span>After COVID-19 and even during COVID-19, there were services provided by various counselling 
<br/>agencies that the Ministry of Education engages, my Ministry engages and, of course, the Ministry 
<br/>of Health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In cases of mental health, we are not going to go out on the streets looking for children.  If 
<br/>parents  have  issues  and  if  they  need  assistance,  all  the  three  Ministries  work  together  to  provide 
<br/>services.  On a daily basis, my Ministry has parents and children come in and we provide them with 
<br/>assistance.  Some of them even come to us for food.  We understand that times are hard but getting 
<br/>your children to beg is not a solution.  It is an adult responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If all adults carry out their responsibilities well, I am sure we will not have any child beggars. 
<br/>We come across children begging, knocking on the windows in heavy traffic areas, this is a danger 
<br/>to their lives.  What if someone does not stop at the traffic light when the child is knocking on the 
<br/>window?    So,  late  hours,  there  is  no  excuse  for  any  child  to  be  on  the  street  begging.    It  is  the 
<br/>responsibility of the parents.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health has mental awareness programmes, they have assistance available, 
<br/>support available in terms of mental and Ministry of Education has counselling services available.  
<br/>We have engaged Empower Pacific, Medical Services Pacific – services are there but the parent has 
<br/>to actually bring the child to us.  We do not expect the children to come to us directly.  It is parental 
<br/>responsibility.  So, if you have a problem, please, seek assistance from us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- I thank the honourable Minister for her response.  In terms of young 
<br/>teenagers  who  are  roaming  the  streets  at  night.    During  normalisation  of  life  and  the  opening  of 
<br/>nightclubs, we see young teenagers roaming around at night.  What sort of assistance can be given to 
<br/>parents and guardians in terms of workshops or other programmes that can be put together because 
<br/>some parents  and guardians really need help  in  terms of bringing up their children post-COVID?  
<br/>How can they be assisted?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, again the question is about teenagers roaming the streets 
<br/>at night.  Yes, we admit it is very dangerous but we need to look at the factors that push them out.  
<br/>As I have mentioned in my earlier response, if the parents provide proper disciplinary guidelines to 
<br/>their children when they are growing up, that is one thing.  Yes, if they need help I have just said that 
<br/>there are thousand services available and if you do know that there are certain communities that need 
<br/></span><span>assistance, we are ready to send our officers for assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to ask the honourable Minister, 
<br/>what is her Ministry doing about children that are mothers?  There is a whole lot of them out there.  
<br/>What is your Ministry doing about them?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, the question should be related to the initial question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Delay in Re-Opening of Govind Park  
<br/>(Question No. 129/2022)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inform Parliament of the reasons for the delay in the re-opening of Govind Park, Ba? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for his  question.  
<br/>Govind Park is well known to many soccer fans locally and internationally.  Govind Park has hosted 
<br/></span><span>many soccer events catering more than 13,000 spectators.  Unfortunately, the strong winds of  </span><span>TC 
<br/></span><span>Winston  </span><span>in  February  2016  did  not  spare  the  40  year  old  pavilion.    The  two  pavilions;  A  and  B 
<br/>sustained substantial damage as the strong winds tore apart the pavilion structures and the roof. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ba  Town  Council  engaged  a  consultant  to  carry  out  a  preliminary 
<br/>assessment of the pavilions.  The damage assessment report revealed that the steel and timber pavilion 
<br/>structures were in a very poor condition and it will not be able to hold spectators during sports event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The report further provided that the pavilions are to be prohibited from any usage or public 
<br/>seating.  Based on the Report, Ba Town Council had no other option but to consult the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government and Ministry of Infrastructure to assist in the preparation and advertisement of a 
<br/>public tender to reconstruct Govind Park.  On 22 January, 2018, Ba Town Council signed a contract 
<br/>with the contractor to carry out the re-development of Govind Park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is worth noting that from the years 2016 to 2020, the Government has 
<br/>invested approximately $4.9 million towards this project.  The funding has been used to pay for the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assessment  report,  demolition  of  the  two  existing  pavilions,  rebuilding  of  the  fence  and  the 
<br/>construction of the new pavilion and associated structures.  The pavilion structure has been completed 
<br/>in accordance to the scope of work.  The specifics include a 9,000 seating capacity pavilion, two 
<br/>restroom,  four  change  room,  one  conference  room,  two  dormitories,  a  corporate  box,  two  media 
<br/>rooms and two kiosk outlets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the project completion.  Due 
<br/>to  the  COVID-19  restriction  for  the  safety  of  Fijians  and  to  contain  the  spread  of  the  virus,  the 
<br/>construction work was stopped. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are some works that remain pending and must be completed to get the 
<br/>stadium ready for local and international sporting events.  This is Phase II which includes installation 
<br/>of  the  EFL  transformer,  floodlights,  ground  upgrade,  drainage  work,  ticket  booth  and  transport 
<br/>management study.  The contractor also needs to fix the defects picked up by the Project Manager 
<br/>and CIU in the first phase for example, the cupboard sink bench counter, sink for the two big kiosks 
<br/>were not done, incomplete tiling work, incomplete painting work, non-compliance, disabled toilets’ 
<br/>specification, plastering work and some works done but not as per the scope hence, all these need to 
<br/>be rectified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Construction  and  Implementation  Unit  and  Ba  Town 
<br/>Council  are  coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  second  phase  including  the  addressing  of  the 
<br/>defects  that  were  found  by  the  Project  Manager.  The  Ba  Town  Council  with  a  team  of  Special 
<br/>Administrators are targeting to reopen Govind Park early next year which is 2023.  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Benefits of Bus Fare Programme – Social Welfare Recipients 
<br/>(Question No. 130/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that the revised budget provided an increase in allocation of $6 million under the 
<br/>Bus  Fare  Programme,  can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation  update  Parliament  on  how  Social  Welfare  recipients  will  benefit  from  this 
<br/>programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government’s Bus Fare Scheme was initially introduced in 2011 (11 years 
<br/>ago)  by  the  Bainimarama  Government  with  the  total  beneficiaries  of  22,928.    The  scheme  was 
<br/>designed as a 50 percent concession targeted at older persons aged 60 plus and persons living with 
<br/>disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2018, consistent with the Fijian Government’s commitment to digital transformation and 
<br/>modernising the transport industry the Bus Fare Scheme transition to the E-Ticketing platform with 
<br/>a  $40  monthly  top-up.  With  effect  from  May  2022,  the  Ministry  has  also  revised  its  payments’ 
<br/>schedule to make quarterly payment of $75.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2018  to-date,  the  Government  had  allocated  more  than  $36  million  towards  this  great 
<br/>initiative.    Due  to  COVID-19,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  the  COVID-19  movement  restrictions, 
<br/>Government saw it prudent to reduce the top-up to $20 and as least as $10. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government’s rationale on this programme is essentially aimed 
<br/>at  promoting  a  culture  of  appreciation  for  our  elders  and  the  recognition  of  the  rights  and 
<br/>empowerment of persons living with disability.  The appreciation of our elders for their contribution 
<br/>to Fiji’s development as a nation is very much a conscious choice, recognising the rights of persons 
<br/>living with disability and empowering them is rather a conscious choice of the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today the Bus Fare Programme assists 41,457 Fijians comprising 38,980 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>older persons aged 60 plus and 2,527 persons living with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last five years the FijiFirst Government has provided $35.2 million 
<br/>towards ensuring that our elders and persons living with disabilities are not left behind.  Some have 
<br/>argued that the cost of living has increased and therefore the support for the elderly and persons living 
<br/>with disabilities need to increase.  I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>will certainly do all it can to support all Fijians in it.  Our ability to assist of course depends on the 
<br/>strength of our economy right now and the prudency in which we manage our finances as a nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  for  the  revised  budget  of  March  2022  Government  has  increased  its 
<br/>allocation to $6 million for the Bus Fare Scheme.  This will allow every entitled citizen to receive a 
<br/></span><span>$25 top-up monthly.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is made possible with the strengthening of our economy, 
<br/></span><span>as we have managed to contain the COVID-19 virus, opened up our borders as early as possible and 
<br/>allowed our tourism sector to grow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to also advise the august House that in recognition of a more efficient 
<br/>and less administrative service.  Government will administer the next three months’ top-up as a batch 
<br/>payment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji First Government will continue to ensure that every 
<br/>older person and person living with disability will age and live with dignity. Before I take my seat, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to acknowledge all the citizens, all the school children and all organisations 
<br/>that  have  organised  their  own  events,  muftis,  concerts,  character  parades,  literature  reviews  and 
<br/>competitions, et cetera to commemorate the 147</span><span>th</span><span> year of the arrival of indentured labourers in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a proud descendant of the </span><span>Girmitiyas,</span><span> I wish to take this time to say to my fellow Fijians, 
<br/>that we must always hold their sacrifices, struggles and contributions of our </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span> close to our 
<br/>heart. Their sweat, blood and tears are engraved in our history and we must honour that because they 
<br/>were indeed a massive part of building the Fiji we know.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I pay my utmost respect 
<br/></span><span>to all our </span><span>Girmitiya</span><span> ancestors.

<div><span>Progress of Rehabilitation - Laucala District School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 131/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on the progress of rehabilitation of Laucala District School? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  Laucala District School is a primary school situated 
<br/>on Qamea Island. The Laucala District School was established in 1947.  Today, only 44 students are 
<br/>enrolled in this school. This school services Dreketi Village which is one of the four villages on the 
<br/>island and the other villages are being served by three other schools. The school was initially located 
<br/>on the island of Laucala and it was relocated to Qamea Island after Laucala Island was purchased by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a multimillionaire from America.  The </span><span>Tui Cakau</span><span> at that time, Ratu Sir Penaia Kanatabatu Ganilau, 
<br/>then gave villages a portion of land to relocate the school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school sustained damages when there was a landslide in Qamea Island 
<br/>due  to  continuous  downpour  and  tropical  depression  in  December  2016.  The  landslide  caused 
<br/>massive damages to the houses, buildings structures of the Laucala District school and completely 
<br/>destroyed the nursing station.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The multiple mudslides also caused extensive damage to the community of Dreketi, Togo, 
<br/>Kocoma, in the Tikina of Laucala and Wainikeli.  During the time of the disaster, 1 x 4 classrooms, 
<br/>Head  of  School’s  quarters  and  the  school  water  tank  sustained  damaged  while  the  three  other 
<br/>teachers’ quarters were deemed unsafe to be occupied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after the disaster, a collaborative approach was taken by the Government 
<br/>where relief supplies such as tents, shelter kits, first-aid and wash kits were all supplied to all the four 
<br/>villages.  Given the nature of the landslide, it was necessary to carry out a geotech study which was 
<br/>done by the Mineral Resources Department (MRD). The detailed damage assessment report revealed 
<br/>that  the  long-term  solution  to  Dreketi  Village  was  relocation,  however,  the  two  relocation  sites 
<br/></span><span>suggested by the village were also not suitable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the report by the MRD concluded that one of the proposed relocated site 
<br/>behind the village at the ridge was not enough to cater for the village, school and the nursing station. 
<br/>Therefore, this site could not be considered for relocation. The second site was on the west of the 
<br/>village towards the Solove Creek, passed the nursing station but these two were not suitable because 
<br/>the area is prone to flooding and landslides.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on the report and considering the safety of students and non-availability of a suitable 
<br/>site, the Ministry provided two alternatives and, in my view, they were two very good alternatives:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To relocate the students to Kocoma Village School which is 5 kilometres from Laucala 
<br/>District School. The Kocoma Village School had 80 students roll at that time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  Ministry  would  have  provided  RSL  tickets  to  a  boat  service  provider  to  transport 
<br/>students  or  could  have  given  a  boat  and  engine  to  the  school  for  the  transportation  of 
<br/>students from Laucala District School, which takes only 10 minutes to 15 minutes boat ride 
<br/>to Kocoma Village School.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the school management and the community insisted that they wanted the children 
<br/>to study in the village.  Laucala District School students could have attended another school, which 
<br/>was  seven  kilometres  away,  and  this  is  Vuanicau  Primary  School,  and  it  takes  approximately  30 
<br/>minutes by boat.  Again, in both the situation, we would have provided RSL boat fares and boat with 
<br/>an engine.  Currently, the school is using a church and a makeshift shed for classes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  informed  that  school  management  identified  a  place  one 
<br/>kilometre away from the current location, where they want to build the school with the help of some 
<br/>donors who have shown interest to support and build the school, but they need to solve the land lease 
<br/>issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even if the land issue is resolved, the Ministry will ensure that necessary 
<br/>geo-tech study is also taken on the site so that whatever we build can last longer, and again it is a 
<br/>matter of putting a permanent structure and we want this permanent structure to last many years and

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not that in the next cyclone or by next flood, the structure goes down.  So geo-tech study is very 
<br/>important  and  based  on  the  geo-tech  study,  we  need  to  engage  the  architect  who  can  design  the 
<br/>building to withstand some of the findings that come out in the geo-tech study.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also noted, as I had mentioned earlier, the decline in the student roll which indicates 
<br/>that it is not viable to invest in building another school, especially, when there are other alternatives 
<br/>available which my Ministry is willing to support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question;  do  you  have  any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percentage of the schools that have been fully restored that were damaged by the cyclone? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not a supplementary question, it is a complete 
<br/>new question so if you want the statistics, I need lead time.  You may like to bring this question in 
<br/>the next Parliament Sitting.

<div><span>Update on the Teachers’ </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform 
<br/>(Question No. 132/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/>update Parliament on the Teachers’ </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform which was launched on 8th September, 
<br/>2021? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  launched  the  Teacher’s  </span><span>Talanoa</span><span>
<br/>Platform last year in September to serve a professional group of 13,000 teachers.  We find that often, 
<br/>it is very difficult to communicate with all 13,000 teachers because they are all over the place in the 
<br/>different parts of the country.  Therefore, this Teacher’s </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform was the most ideal way of 
<br/>connecting with the teachers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This online platform was created by the Ministry to allow teachers to communicate with one 
<br/>another and with the Ministry.  This platform allows teachers to share their ideas, views and vision 
<br/>which will help the Ministry to transform education for the future of our children.  We felt that as 
<br/>educators, teachers have a critical role to play in shaping the lives of our children, therefore, they 
<br/>should have a say in what the Ministry does.  It is, therefore, important that the teachers get a chance 
<br/>to have their say on the curriculum, they should have their say on the resources that we provide or 
<br/></span><span>the changes that are being introduced in the school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  envisaged  that  the  Teachers  </span><span>Talanoa</span><span>  Platform  will  strengthen  our 
<br/>partnership with the teachers.  This platform has created a dynamic information eco-system in which 
<br/>teachers come together to engage in thought provoking discussions, innovative ideas, best classroom 
<br/>practices and student behaviour after COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This platform was developed in-house by our team in the Ministry using Moodle which is an 
<br/>open  source  software  and  has  no  licence  and  costs.    The  Teachers  T</span><span>alanoa</span><span>  Platform  is  for  three 
<br/>groups of teachers that is Primary, Secondary and Early Childhood Education (ECE).  The reason for 
<br/>setting up separate groups were to facilitate discussions in a more focused manner relevant to the 
<br/>teacher and the team at the Ministry that looks after three levels of education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the inception of Teachers </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform, the level of engagement from the teachers 
<br/>have increased which is very encouraging. The Teachers </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform is set up in such a manner 
<br/>that all Heads of Sections in the Ministry is automatically part of the forum and receive first-hand

<div><span>information on all the discussions that take place.  For regular monitoring, the Manager E-Learning 
<br/>constantly goes to the discussion forum and informs the relevant Heads of Sections if any intervention 
<br/>or response is required, including the Permanent Secretary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, examples of some of the discussions that have been going on in the Teachers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial management in schools;  
<br/>Challenges faced by teachers in remote schools;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Game base learning;  
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Years 12 and Year 13 tablets for e-learning;  
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Psycho-socio imbalance;

<br/></span><span>9.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>Digital learning; and  
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Outcome-based curriculum and assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Student behaviour; 
<br/>Teachers’ welfare; 
<br/>Building better student teacher relationship;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it gives us a lot of confidence that our teachers are not only sharing good 
<br/>practices but they are also engaged in pertinent discussions such as the future for education in  the 
<br/>post COVID-19 period.  Apart from those discussions, Headquarters has also shared information on 
<br/>this platform, such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Videos on new classroom practice; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Curriculum revision for feedback; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Learning and development opportunities; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>School circulars and information; and  
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>School plans including teacher transfer posting to bring spouses together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Teachers </span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform is set up in such a way that all discussions 
<br/>that takes place on the platform also get emailed  to all the teachers, hence, they never miss out on 
<br/>the  discussions.  Teachers  can  read  the  discussions  at  their  leisure  and  then  log  into  the  Teachers 
<br/></span><span>Talanoa</span><span> Platform to contribute to the discussions, if they wish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very good example that  I  can share is  the recent  initiative to  expedite 
<br/></span><span>teacher transfers to bring spouses closer within the teaching district so that families are not separated.  
<br/></span><span>Through  this  platform,  teachers  provided  the  relevant  information  which  assisted  the  Ministry  to 
<br/>handle teacher transfer by using data-driven process.  Through this process, the Ministry managed to 
<br/>bring 156 teacher families together and we continue to bring families together as vacancies arise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  commend  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education for that initiative.  It is very good but in terms of connectivity, what measures are there for 
<br/>rural and maritime schools or teachers regarding this Platform?  What will the Ministry do, if there 
<br/>is a problem, especially in the rural and maritime areas?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think in this Parliament we have discussed many 
<br/>times about connectivity.  That connectivity has improved over the years and more than 92 and if I 
<br/>recall 95 percent of the schools are already connected and just last year, I remember the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General going to the rural area because we managed to connect the schools to internet as 
<br/>well.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, do note that the internet cost is also met by the Free Education Grant that the Ministry 
<br/>provides.  Now,  we  do  understand  that  we  cannot  provide  the  service  to  all  100  percent  schools 
<br/>because of the infrastructure issues but then they can always call the Ministry and the Ministry also 
<br/>sends information, for example, we talked about the circulars for learning opportunities.  Some of 
<br/>the courses that are available abroad we package that and we send it to the schools as well, so there 
<br/>are two modes through which we communicate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  I  thank  the  Honourable  Minister  for  her  response.  In  terms  of  my 
<br/>earlier question on young teenagers, kids roaming the streets at night, could you bring this up at the 
<br/>Teachers  Talanoa  Platform  and  maybe  they  might  have  some  solutions  to  this  as  it  could  be 
<br/>happening elsewhere in Fiji and not only Suva? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  I  think  we  all  need  to  understand  what  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation just mentioned. When it comes to a child, it is everyone’s 
<br/>responsibility.  I think teachers are doing their bit in the school and for that reason, we have also 
<br/>introduced the citizenship education that I was talking about  - moral and civic education that has 
<br/>been introduced from Year 1 to Year 3, notifying the teachers, yes, they are very much aware of the 
<br/>current situation and we can have this discussion on the platform.  But if children are roaming the 
<br/></span><span>streets during school hours, then obviously the Fiji Police Force and other stakeholders step in to 
<br/></span><span>help the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anything that happens in the school is the responsibility of teachers but when the school ends 
<br/>and  when  the  students  go  home,  that  becomes  the  responsibility  of  the  parents.    I  hope  you  all 
<br/>understand that you cannot push the parental responsibility on the State, you should not do that.

<div><span>Implications of Breteau Index of Mosquitoes - Dengue Fever 
<br/>(Question No. 133/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/>the Breteau Index of mosquito and its implications in the transmission of dengue fever in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker the mosquito that causes dengue fever is from 
<br/>a species called </span><span>Aedes aegypti</span><span> specifically for dengue fever.  The Breteau Index is one of the indices 
<br/>that we use to actually see whether a community has the likelihood of transmission of dengue or is 
<br/></span><span>going to have the likelihood of transmission of dengue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What it is, Sir, is the number of positive containers.  As we know that these dengue fever (</span><span>Aedes 
<br/>aegypti</span><span>) mosquitoes only reside in containers, any manmade container whether it be an old bath tub, 
<br/>tyre or container.  These are places where the </span><span>Aedes aegypti</span><span> mosquito will be incubating and growing.  
<br/>These containers or the number of containers infested with the larvae times a 100 percent over the 
<br/>total number of containers so when it is more than 20, there is a high risk of disease transmission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, from February to April this year, a total of 22 subdivisions and municipal councils 
<br/>carried out larvae surveys in their respective jurisdictions where a total of 2,473 households were 
<br/>inspected.  During this larvae survey,  awareness  on mosquito breeding sites were carried out and 
<br/>persons  harbouring  immature  stages  of  mosquitoes  at  their  premises  were  given  notices  for  mere 
<br/>presence of mosquitoes and prosecuted.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  routine  surveys  we  noted  that  the  Breteau  Index  for  Nausori  Sub-Division  had 
<br/>crossed the threshold of 21 and Taveuni had a Breteau Index of 18 which indicated the high risk of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>viral  disease  transmission  on  Dengue  Fever.    The  teams  were  alerted  and  immediate  clean-up 
<br/>campaign of mosquito breeding containers from 23 sampling sites, together with perifocal spraying, 
<br/>was recommended for immediate removal of adult gravid mosquitoes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were also similar services done in Nausori and Ba, and they had a team each, so they 
<br/>were at a high-risk status and also the clean-up campaigns were done.  Because the said indices and 
<br/>the early warning systems for Fiji were indicative of high mosquito prevalence, the Ministry through 
<br/>its Environmental Health Unit, had implemented clean-up campaigns.  To-date, apart from the clean-
<br/>up campaigns that is present, there is a further 12 proposals that have caught us at the moment with 
<br/>a budget of about $76,000 in which our teams are going through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at this juncture, you must have remembered that two years ago, I had discussed 
<br/>the Wolbachia Project that we had in place.  This is where a bacteria known as </span><span>Wolbachia</span><span>, infects 
<br/>the </span><span>Aedes aegypti</span><span> mosquito.  This </span><span>Aedes aegypti</span><span> mosquito which has the </span><span>Wolbachia</span><span> is then unable 
<br/>to transmit dengue, </span><span>Zika</span><span> or </span><span>Chikungunya</span><span> virus.  We have actually launched this in 178 sites along 
<br/>the  Suva-Nausori  corridor,  and  also  between  Nadi-Lautoka.    This,  we  know,  will  help  contribute 
<br/>towards the lessening of the dengue transmission data that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we participate in the clean-up campaigns.  The 
<br/></span><span>mosquitoes are known to fly up to 400 metres in a day, so when we go out to communities we tell 
<br/>them that the clean-up campaign has to involve everyone in the community, because if one household 
<br/>does not do a clean-up campaign, the </span><span>Aedes aegypti </span><span>can incubate in the containers in that household 
<br/>and fly within the 200 metres to 400 metres, and then cause Dengue Fever in  another household.  
<br/>Therefore, I, urge everyone and the public who are listening in that when clean-up campaigns are 
<br/>being done in their community that everyone must participate.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  supplementary  question  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister; does the Ministry have sufficient supply of dengue kits available now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, off the top of my head I would remember but 
<br/>I know that we have had sufficient supply of dengue kits, but if there are places and in particular, if 
<br/>you know of a place that does not have a dengue kit, please, let me know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, to the honourable Minister; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what sort of connection is there between Dengue Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, there is  no direct connection between RHD 
<br/></span><span>and Dengue Fever.  Before I sit down, I must say that throughout floods and cyclones, initially after 
<br/>that there will be a lot of mosquitoes, often called ‘nuisance mosquitoes’, within the first two weeks.  
<br/>Often those nuisance mosquitoes may not necessarily be the ones causing Dengue Fever because the 
<br/>Dengue Fever mosquitoes will come within the next two to four weeks.  The honourable Vosanibola 
<br/>will know that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We get called straight after a flood that there is plenty mosquitoes.  It is important during that 
<br/>time to do the clean-ups and also alert us and also the spraying will only be effective if a clean-up 
<br/>campaign has been done because if there is still a lot of rubbish around and the spraying is done, it 
<br/>will not be sufficient to be able to extenuate the larvae or the adult mosquitoes that are in that area.

<div><span>Changes to Fiji’s Border Entry Conditions 
<br/>(Question No. 134/2022)

<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice:

<div><span>1416 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Revised  2021-2022  Budget,  the  Government  announced  changes  to  Fiji’s 
<br/>border entry conditions.  Can the honourable Minister update Parliament on how this has 
<br/>eased international travel? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the floor to respond to the 
<br/>question by the honourable Member.  Like every other country, every other tourist destination for 
<br/>the past odd two years, we have given our all to reopening our borders as safely as we could.  For 
<br/>service driven economies like Fiji, it was actually a matter of necessity and we did so, and now we 
<br/>are on a good course towards our economic recovery by equally valuing our health and economic 
<br/>objectives with the right balance to actually mitigate the risk.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the revised 2021-2022 Budget, we announced important measures that 
<br/>actually met health reasoning and aided in our competitiveness as a tourism destination.  We removed 
<br/>the need to stay three nights at a careFIJI commitment hotel and strengthened our in-country rampant 
<br/>antigen testing.  We also removed the travel partner classification system and this meant Fiji was 
<br/>open to fully vaccinated travellers from anywhere in the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these changes were only possible because we actually closely monitored 
<br/></span><span>and considered the health risks and mapped them with the best mitigating measures.  We established 
<br/></span><span>the Fiji  entry test  portal  to  allow travellers in  any  part of the world  to  actually pre-book their in-
<br/>country COVID-19 test before coming to Fiji.   To support our in-country testing system, we worked 
<br/>closely with the Ministry of Health and Medical Services to establish a private sector wide network 
<br/>of testing facilities.  Today we have over 55 town and cities testing centres and over 170 CFC hotels 
<br/>and resorts as testing facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this month we actually further eased our entry requirements in favour 
<br/>of not only tourists but also for our returning Fijians.  We widened our vaccination requirement for 
<br/>entry into Fiji from 18 years and above to 16 years and above and we did so considering that more 
<br/>children  globally  were  being  granted  access  to  vaccines.    This  gave  us  the  flexibility  to  drop  the 
<br/>requirement for vaccinated travellers to produce a pre-arrival negative COVID-19 test prior to entry 
<br/>into Fiji, again, a move that actually reduces cost and lends greater convenience to those travelling 
<br/>to the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  impact  in  numbers,  this  international  travel  has  definitely  become  hassle  free, 
<br/>easier and unrestrictive and we can see this in our tourism numbers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first 
<br/>quarter of 2022, we have had a total of 48,906 international visitors compared to just over 4,223 in 
<br/></span><span>the same quarter last year.  If we look at numbers since our December border reopening in 2021, Fiji 
<br/></span><span>has actually welcomed over 72,132 visitors.  What these figures tell us is that we are on track to 
<br/>regaining a portion of our market share and already capturing approximately 30 percent to 35 percent 
<br/>of the 2019 numbers.  Now, that we are in our peak season, we expect these numbers to grow.  We 
<br/>are already seeing near pre-COVID levels of occupancy across some of our major brands and some 
<br/>have actually recorded high sales and profit.  The average occupancy recorded in the last week of 
<br/>April 2022 was 4 percent more than the 2019 level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just the day before yesterday, we held the first in-person Fijian Tourism 
<br/>Expo two years - it was hosted in Denarau.  Room occupancies were near pre-pandemic levels and 
<br/>people were moving to  and from, restaurants were busy and beaches were filled with families, et 
<br/>cetera.  We had 91 odd international buyers and media from over 10 countries as far as Italy and 
<br/>Spain back in Fiji and ready to take us to the world.  If that is not something we should be grateful 
<br/>for, Sir, then I am not sure what is.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  national  carrier  too,  Fiji  Airways  also  earlier  this  week  announced  direct  flights  to 
<br/>Adelaide from July and this, of course, will bring in  more South Australians to Fiji.  It would be 
<br/>remiss of me to not mention this, Sir, I want to take this opportunity also to thank the frontliners for 
<br/>their commitment and courage during this particular containment period that we had  – the health 
<br/>workers, tourism workers who serviced the quarantine hotels, transport drivers who drove COVID-
<br/>19 positive Fijians to and from their quarantine hotels to their homes, all of their collective efforts 
<br/>has brought our industry to where we are able to proudly announce to the world that Fiji is open for 
<br/>happiness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reports from all the tourism operators are that the corporate group travel also has recovered 
<br/>sooner than expected and we have back-to-back corporate groups from Australia and hundreds are 
<br/>arriving for five to six-day itineraries and during their stay they are actually engaging in local tour 
<br/>attractions and operators including local  villagers, handicraft, restaurants,  hire of local  serenaders 
<br/>and cover bands so the spread of the tourism benefits, Mr. Speaker, is for real in real dollar terms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am aware of an Australian corporate group that is visiting a village in Sigatoka Valley today, 
<br/>Sir and they will be donating a substantial amount towards the village church.  Almost $5,000 and 
<br/>that has been organised by one of our local tour operators so that is what we mean by spreading the 
<br/></span><span>benefits of tourism as a result of the safe re-opening of our borders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact that these corporations are actually bringing their employees and suppliers in large 
<br/>numbers  to  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  a  testament  to  their  faith  and  confidence  in  Fiji  being  a  safe 
<br/>destination  and  these  endorsements,  Mr.  Speaker,  are  actually  priceless  and  these  are  the 
<br/>endorsements that will continue to propel our industry towards a gradual recovery, however, we must 
<br/>again remain alert and be cautious to ensure that our safe protocols are adhered to at all times.  I hope 
<br/>that answers her question, Sir.

<div><span>Government Plans to Improve Water Supply - Namara, Tailevu 
<br/>(Question No. 135/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.A.R. SENILOLI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services,  Lands  and  Mineral 
<br/>Resources update Parliament on plans to improve water supply to Namara District in Tailevu? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Ratu  Jone  Seniloli  for  his 
<br/></span><span>question. The district of Namara is one of the three red zones in terms of water in Tailevu.  The other 
<br/></span><span>two being Vugalei and Verata.  The </span><span>tikina</span><span> of Namara consists of a number of villages: Naisausau, 
<br/>Nakorolevu, Matamaivere, Tubalevu, Naikawaga and Nakalawaca.  These villages of </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Namara 
<br/>are located outside the extents of WAF’S reticulated system that ends at Kasavu - 71.1 kilometres to 
<br/>the South and Nailega Village - 11.6 kilometres to the North.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The area has an approximate population of around 2,000 people and it has schools, nursing 
<br/>stations and located by the coastline.  These villlages have faced difficulties with access to drinking 
<br/>water as suitable surface water sources in the immediate area are non-existent in terms of rivers and 
<br/>streams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Currently, most of the homes there have been using rainwater harvesting.  I think there is one 
<br/>borehole  at  Tubalevu but  the others, the WAF has been providing  rainwater tanks, as part of the 
<br/>rainwater harvesting programme and when there are problems, when they still have problems, the 
<br/>WAF has been providing water carting for the villages and the communities every two weeks and 
<br/>when things get really bad, the Commissioner Central has his emergency water programme that also 
<br/>helps in carting water to schools, health and the community.

<div><span>But into the future, Mr. Speaker, Sir and based on the review of the options available, there 
<br/>are some things that government is doing at the moment.  Apart from the work that is being done by 
<br/>WAF with its rural area services, there is also an inter-agency committee in existence, run by the 
<br/>Commissioner Central that includes agencies such as the WAF, the Water and Sewerage Department 
<br/>of the Ministry of Infrastructure and also the Mineral Resources Department that looks at boreholes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the short term, we will continue to focus assistance through WAF, through the provision 
<br/>of water carts and also for the fortnightly rural  water carting schedule as well as the provision of 
<br/>assistance through the Rainwater Harvesting Programme.  To date we have 53 tanks with 5,000-litre 
<br/>capacity have been delivered to the Namara District.  In the medium term, it is recommended that 
<br/>since there is a lack of service water sources in the immediate area of the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Namara, that we 
<br/>continue to look at groundwater services and this needs to be addressed by the Mineral Resources 
<br/>Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had mentioned before, the Tubalevu Village borehole is the one that is working, it is 
<br/>producing  good  amount  of  water,  there  is  a  possibility  of  other  sources  being  investigated  there.  
<br/>There is another borehole at Naikawaga that also has water but is not fit for human consumption but 
<br/>can be used in other ways.  In the long term, the extension of the Viria Water Supply System shall 
<br/></span><span>be the long term plan for this area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a good potential for the expansion of the Viria System, it will be dependent on the 
<br/>successful commissioning and operation of the Viria System to bring that water all the way from 
<br/>Viria, hopefully, down to Namara.

<div><span>Update on National Climate Finance Strategy 
<br/>(Question No. 136/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the recently 
<br/>launched National Climate Finance Strategy? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for the question.  On 3</span><span>rd</span><span> May, the Fijian Government launched the Fiji Climate Finance 
<br/>Strategy at the Fiji National University, immediately after the announcement of the signing of the 
<br/></span><span>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Monash University and Fiji National University. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Climate Finance Strategy (NCFS) serves two vital roles.  
<br/>Firstly,  it  fulfils  the  requirements  of  our  recently  enacted  Climate  Change  Act,  to  develop  and 
<br/>implement  a  National  Climate  Finance  Strategy.    Secondly,  it  is  a  comprehensive  blueprint  that 
<br/>details the priority policies, interventions, targets and projects across 12 sectors that require climate 
<br/>finance and keep us on track to meeting our ambition and making our islands a case study in carbon 
<br/>neutrality and sustainable and resilient development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The  NCFS  integrates  the  policies,  targets  and  projects  for  Fiji’s  development  and  climate 
<br/>strategies and prioritises them based on the numerous consultations.  These strategies include the 
<br/>National Development Plan (NDP), National Adaptation Plan, climate vulnerability, low emission 
<br/>development  strategy  and  NDC  Investment  Plan,  NDC  Implementation  Roadmap  and  from  line 
<br/>Ministries strategic plans.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1419 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Further  to  this  Sir,  it  means  three  crucial  adaptation  topic  that  are  often  overlooked  and 
<br/>chronically under supported: gender and social inclusion, relocation and human health.  This strategy 
<br/>also  includes  concept  notes  for  24  mitigation  and  adaptation  projects  that  come  under  various 
<br/>programmes that are priorities for immediate funding and implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation phase Mr. Speaker, Sir, has already started and key projects and programmes 
<br/>being  developed  from  the  identified  policies,  interventions,  targets  and  projects  with  a  strategy.  
<br/>These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>

<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Promoting  electric  bus  transport  in  Fiji  which  will  pilot  electric  buses  and  multiple 
<br/>passenger routes and build local technical capacity to operate and maintain electric buses. 
<br/>The first one will start off at Valelevu where we are actually building a suburban bus transit 
<br/>route and a station there with the electric charging stations will be there. 
<br/>Climate resilient homes which will have innovative constructing processes and materials 
<br/>that reduce home construction costs and provide solar for low cost housing and flats in Fiji. 
<br/>Smart agriculture will provide a guarantee for Fiji Development Bank to de-risk farmers 
<br/>while also improving the financial access to smart agriculture technologies that support low 
<br/>emissions and climate resilient and cultural practices as we are seeing in Bureta in Ovalau 
<br/>where we had that first Agro-photovoltaic’ Project, which is blended finance project funded 
<br/>through FDB, the Green Climate Fund and the Korean assistance. 
<br/>Bonds which would seek to raise up to US$50 million for investments to deliver sustainable 
<br/>blue economy and create jobs and protect Fiji’s ocean helping those people in the maritime 
<br/>areas, on coastal areas to get into sustainable fishing practices and various other practices 
<br/>in mariculture and agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Climate Finance Strategy, of course, can be downloaded from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Fiji Climate Change portal accessible to all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister; can he explain how much money Fiji will need to meet its climate goals considering the 
<br/>estimated cash inflows?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  could  the  honourable  Member,  please 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>repeat the question, I could not hear the whole of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Minister explain how much money Fiji will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to meet its climate goals with the estimated financial inflows? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member may recall that 
<br/>we had the World Bank carry out an assessment.  In respect of climate resilience to build resilience 
<br/>in our infrastructure.  At that time they had estimated about FJ$9 billion and that include things like 
<br/>the seawall in Namatakula that has been stopped by his intervention into it; and we hope to have that 
<br/>resolved and various other projects, Sir, to build infrastructure whether it is for example, fixing up 
<br/>roads that are right next to the sea, whether it is building retaining walls, whether there are bridges, 
<br/>Irish crossings, et cetera, to build that resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, this Climate Finance Strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a lot more broader and this is 
<br/>more to do in terms of mitigation also like electric buses they are not adaptation, they are actually 
<br/>mitigation. So this is more about the Climate Finance Strategy, how will we get the finance, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We already have a relocation trust fund, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where there are funds. We have 42 
<br/>to  43  villages  that  are  being  identified  to  be  moved  to  higher  ground,  65  percent  of  the  Fijian

<div><span>population lives within five kilometres of a shoreline.  So obviously these things will have a huge 
<br/>impact and we have said this continuously, Sir, and unfortunately, in fact I thought about this last 
<br/>night and I was thinking about what NFP was saying yesterday too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On several occasions since in particular after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, we have invited the honourable 
<br/>Members from the other side to come to the Situation Room at the Ministry of Economy to see the 
<br/>rebuild programme to do with schools, for example, and nursing stations.  Unfortunately, not a single 
<br/>one of them has turned up to see the enormous task behind it and how it is done, how tenders are 
<br/>called and how matters are prioritised.  Again, I am making them an offer, ‘Please turn up, you tell 
<br/>us, we will make the arrangement’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Too late. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  said  since  2016  honourable 
<br/>Member, you should know this.  Honourable Kuridrani, if he is genuine about this, we can explain 
<br/>to him very slowly how the process works. Thank you.
