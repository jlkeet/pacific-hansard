<div><span>FHCL….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I did ask, has the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>guarantee of $26 million been paid off?  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government had guaranteed loans to Fiji 
<br/>Development Bank (FDB) and Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), and they have all been paid off 
<br/>this year.  All of that has been paid off.  There is a loan currently with Merchant Finance and they 
<br/>are expected to be paid off by December 2022.  The debt stock of $26 million, now that debt stock 
<br/>is almost zero.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB has been paid (I have got the figures here) - the lease rental paid to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners.  He said that landowners are not getting a single cent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  A  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  did  not  mention  about 
<br/>iTLTB lease rental, I had mentioned about timber sales proceeds under the Decree and under the Act.  
<br/>No single cent has been paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he did then go on to say that landowners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have not been paid a single cent.  You cannot make those statements in a vacuum.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2017… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am not mentioning anything 
<br/>under vacuum, I am quoting from the Mahogany Decree which specifically says that timber sales 
<br/>proceeds be paid to the landowners, no single cent has been paid. I am not talking about rent, I am 
<br/></span><span>not talking about anything else, but I was talking about timber sales proceeds. Thank you.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1271 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no Decree, there is an Act.  I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come to the Act because you only read half of the sentence, and that is your problem - half pie.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lease rental paid to landowners from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 to 2021 was $3,397,021.48 and the stumpage paid was $1,344,863.71.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Bulanauca is talking about the proceeds.  If he reads the Act, it  
<br/>actually talks about when FHCL is able to pay off all of its debts, is able to get the company up on 
<br/>its  feet,  then  there  will  be  a  mechanism  that  will  be  developed  to  share  the  proceeds  with  the 
<br/>landowners.  This  has  never  happened  before.    There  was  never  a  clear  legal  directive  to  do  so, 
<br/>everyone knows that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, Sir, people have been talking about for decades in this country, right from 
<br/>Vatukoula days, that the royalties that Government collects must be shared with the landowners.  It 
<br/>was in the 1997 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji, it did not happen. It was in the 2013 Constitution 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji, under our honourable Prime Minister’s leadership, that the landowners get 80 
<br/>percent of the royalties that normally go to the State but we are paying it to the landowners, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulanauca, when we do things, we do it properly.  We do things properly, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and that is going to happen because the debts will be paid off,  FHCL has also been 
<br/>(which he failed to mention) has now re-engaged in the planting of more mahogany forests.  He did 
<br/>not also mention that the rates have also been reassessed where landowners are now getting paid a 
<br/>higher rental and stumpage has also increased, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, here we  have a debt-ridden company, we have the largest planted forest 
<br/>mahogany plantation in the world. Since 1950s up until 2007, FHCL did not make a single profit, it 
<br/>is a fact! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You can speak to George Speight, he was the CEO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not mention that.  He is going on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about production and I will tell you the production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, FHCL recorded a 121.9 percent increase in revenue and 108 percent 
<br/>increase in sales revenue in 2021.   As I have said, the company has paid off its debt, the revenue 
<br/></span><span>generated in 2021 enabled the company to make total payments amounting to $10.2 million.  Again, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been replanting of the forest taking place, a lot more land is being actually 
<br/>replanted with forests and obviously, we are building sustainability into it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will move along now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from FHCL to the other points that had been raised.  
<br/></span><span>One other point that I wanted to mention as a general comment is that, when honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>1272 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come to Parliament and talk about audited reports, if they were not disingenuous, they would know 
<br/>that a lot of the audit accounts were, in fact, pending prior to even 2007.  If you look at Municipal 
<br/>Councils audited accounts, it is going back to 2003, 2004 and 2005 - all of that had to be caught up 
<br/>with.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  one  of  the  recommendations  that  had  been  made  to  the  OAG  is,  if  some  of  these 
<br/>accounts are pending for such a long period of time, you can consolidate it.  It has been done and 
<br/>there is an audit practice to be able to consolidate it.  You do not have to do it year-in, then the next 
<br/>year, and then the next year.  You can consolidate it, in particular, if such a long period has lapsed.  
<br/>They refused to do it, so you have to wait on a single linear approach for the submissions of these 
<br/>reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was in respect of the Fiji Roads 
<br/>Authority (FRA) tender.  Honourable Usamate had touched upon some of those areas regarding FRA, 
<br/>Sir.  One of the problems we did face with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and it was mentioned 
<br/>yesterday also was that, when funding from ADB, if you meet certain MQRs, then whoever was the 
<br/>lowest actually got the tender.  But what we found, Sir, was that some of the companies, whilst they 
<br/>met the MQR, the ones that actually ended up getting it was because they were under-pricing and, 
<br/>shall I say, insubstantial companies, that the quality of their works was not good.  They would actually 
<br/>do a road pavement but within six months, it would break up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We talked to ADB and said that we wanted to put certain stringent requirements so that the 
<br/>quality of works of those companies must also meet a particular criteria.  The cheapest is not always 
<br/>the  best,  as  you  know,  so  we  need  to  ensure  that  we  have  to  have  companies  that  meet  a  higher 
<br/>standard  of  MQR.    There  is,  of  course,  internal  mechanisms  within  ADB  and  there  are  all  those 
<br/>regional socio-economic politics that goes on, but we do not want to be part of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Someone raised it yesterday that we ended up paying for it.  Yes, we ended up paying for it 
<br/>because we wanted the right contractor.  We know what the road conditions are like and we know 
<br/>what the weather conditions are like.  If you go to the road conditions in somewhere like Rewa, the 
<br/>soil texture is very clayish and different as compared to, for example, you going out to the West.  If 
<br/>you go around the Yadua way, the soil texture is a lot better, it is different and more solid, but in 
<br/>other places in Fiji there is lot more clay.  You cannot apply the same roading standards as you do, 
<br/>for example, in a clay soil area in Rewa as opposed to somewhere in the West.  So, you need to be 
<br/>able to ensure that the tenders and specifications you have actually cater for that.  That regime of 
<br/></span><span>tendering that they had did not cater for that.  If we actually complied with that standard, the public 
<br/></span><span>would come and complain, “Hey the road is breaking up within six months.  It has rained for five 
<br/>days, it is breaking up”.  So, all these things need to be taken into consideration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad, again, is not here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but he said that since 2007 
<br/>up to  2014, there was  no scrutiny of accounts.  What  a  load of nonsense!  Honourable Radrodro 
<br/>actually  sat  in  the  Committee  that  was  appointed  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  during  the 
<br/>Bainimarama  Government  days  where  they  actually  had  a  Committee,  similar  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts.  He is nodding his head in agreement.  There was a group of them 
<br/>and they used to scrutinise the OAG’s Reports.  Honourable Professor Prasad who has now done a 
<br/></span><span>disappearing act, again, makes that statement and just disappears off into the night.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that, honourable Usamate 
<br/>read out a comment made by the Auditor-General in the Energy Fiji  Limited (EFL) Report.  The 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General said that EFL should provide electrification around Fiji.  That statement itself, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding, either deliberately or just complete ignorance, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1273 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I would say, negligent ignorance, the difference between the Executive, the difference between 
<br/>policy and the difference between who are the people who are supposed to do or fund the job.  You 
<br/>cannot go to a limited liability company and say, “You should be doing this.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the OAG does not understand governance.  They do not understand the fact that 
<br/>EFL  has  its  own  Board,  they  have  their  own  budget  and  they  have  their  own  balance  sheet.    If 
<br/>Government wants to have people connected to the electricity grid, it is Government’s responsibility 
<br/>to connect those people and when Government connects those people, the Government goes to the 
<br/>supplier of that connectivity and say, “what is your price, we will pay you the price, we will make an 
<br/>allocation in the budget, please, do this for us.”  It is a fundamental lack of understanding by the 
<br/>OAG in respect of this, Sir.  Therefore, how can one take these observations of the OAG seriously in 
<br/>so many instances?  It is a fundamental lack of understanding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the interest of time, the last point I would like to make is that, one thing 
<br/>that  appears  to  be  lost  on  many  of  the  honourable  Members  on  the  other  side  is  climate  change.  
<br/>Honourable Usamate highlighted that, some other honourable Members highlighted that.  It has an 
<br/>enormous bearing on our ability to deliver what we set out to deliver.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had only </span><span>TC Cody</span><span> but we had two or three weeks of 
<br/>incessant rainfall.  I have said in Parliament before, Kabisi Highway went; Nawai, one lane went; 
<br/>Semo, one lane went; and in Ba and various other places - landslides, et cetera. We do not budget for 
<br/>that.  We then re-allocate funds that has been already approved by Parliament and divert those funds 
<br/>to those areas.  We work within that framework of money that has been allocated to us, so we have 
<br/>to re-allocate funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If today there is a cyclone or a catastrophe or a volcanic eruption today, we have to get the 
<br/>money from somewhere.  Somewhere, some expenditure is going to be stopped and we divert the 
<br/>funds to that place.  That is what happens, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In all their submissions, none of them 
<br/>talked about </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and none of them talked about the 13 cyclones that we have faced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why the honourable Prime Minister goes overseas, we talked to our 
<br/>development  partners,  and  then  they  actually  berate  us  for  doing  that.    I  remember  when  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister was going overseas during his Presidency of COP23, all of them had a 
<br/>go at him saying, “Oh, he is travelling overseas.”  Today, we are getting interest rates at zero percent 
<br/>because they recognise our climate vulnerability.  Even though we are deemed to be a middle-income 
<br/></span><span>country, the World Bank is giving us concessional financing because they recognise our vulnerability 
<br/></span><span>to climate change.  We are one of the most vulnerable countries in the world, it is listed, please go 
<br/>and read about it.  So, when we talk about finance, allocation of funding, allocation of resources, 
<br/>please, take into account climate change.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I would like to thank all honourable 
<br/>Members and especially the honourable Attorney-General for summarising the Report because a lot 
<br/>of things have been said by the Opposition which do not relate to the Report itself.  Nevertheless, it 
<br/>has always been the case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  Members  who  have  responded  positively  and  all  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers who have taken the recommendations positively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
