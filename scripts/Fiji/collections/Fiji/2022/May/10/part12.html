<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament:  Sir  and 
<br/>Honourable  Members,  I  as  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  who 
<br/>moved the motion, take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the Review of the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General 2020 Annual Report and Assessing the Office of the Auditor-General - Supreme 
<br/>Audit Institution (SAI) Performance Measurement Framework Consolidated Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>this Consolidated Report provides the Committee findings on the review 
<br/>made  on  the  following  reports  -  Office  of  the  Auditor-General’s  2020  Annual  Report  and  the 
<br/>Assessment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) is established under Section 151 of the Constitution 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji, and the Audit Act 1969 further specifies the powers of the Auditor-General 
<br/>to audit the whole of Government financial statements and reports of all entities of Government. It 
<br/>also empowers the Auditor-General to conduct performance audit of Government entities, to assure 
<br/>Parliament that the entities are achieving their objectives effectively and in doing so economically 
<br/>and in compliance with all relevant legislations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Auditor-General  is  responsible, on behalf of Parliament, to  audit the 
<br/>accounts  of  all  Government  agencies,  State-Owned  Entities  (SOEs),  Statutory  Authorities  (SAs), 
<br/>Municipal Councils and Provincial Councils, except for its own office and those entities that may be 
<br/>exempted  by  law.    The  Auditor-General  carries  out  the  audit  in  accordance  with  the  relevant 
<br/>provisions of the standard on auditing issued by the Fiji Institute of Accountants or other relevant 
<br/>standards considered appropriate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Section 152 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“(1)  At least once in every year, the Auditor-General shall inspect, audit and report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament on -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the public accounts of the State; 
<br/>the control of public money and public property of the State; and  
<br/>all transactions with or concerning the public money or public property 
<br/></span><span>of the State.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) plays a critical role in strengthening 
<br/>governance, accountability and transparency in the Government.  As such the OAG is expected to 
<br/>promote transparency and accountability through good governance of its own affairs in  an ethical 
<br/>manner in order to fulfil its mandate. To assist in this crucial role, it is important that OAG leads by 
<br/>example and be a role model organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  decision  to  undergo  a  SAI  Performance  Measurement  Framework, 
<br/>assessment  was  made  by  the  OAG  in  order  to  provide  an  independent  assessment  of  the  current 
<br/></span><span>operations and audit practices of the Fiji OAG against the international standards specifically, the 
<br/></span><span>International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIs) and other established international 
<br/>good practices for public auditing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the OAGs Independence and legal framework, the work to update and 
<br/></span><span>modernise  Fiji’s  audit  legislation,  the  Audit  Act  1969,  commenced  before  the  SAI  Performance 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measurement Framework assessment was initiated.  The review was carried out by a legal consultant 
<br/>and funded by Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) and the review had already 
<br/>considered three key issues for improvement identified from the assessment.  The OAG has submitted 
<br/>the result of the review of the Audit Act 1969 to the Ministry of Economy for submission to Cabinet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of financial independence, the Office now receives a one-line budget, a separate bank 
<br/>account and accounting/payroll system providing the Auditor-General financial independence. For 
<br/>information,  OAG  now  prepares  its  annual  financial  statements  using  the  International  Financial 
<br/>Reporting Standards for Small and Medium-Sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs) as the financial reporting 
<br/>framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that the OAG is funded through an annual appropriation by Parliament. 
<br/>This enables the OAG to fulfil its audit mandate on public sector entities and these include financial 
<br/>audits,  performance  audits  and  special  investigations.    In  the  2020  financial  year,  the  budget 
<br/>appropriation stood at $5.6 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee after carrying out a thorough review of the OAG Annual 
<br/>Report and the Supreme Audit Institution Performance Management Framework, the Committee in 
<br/>a bipartisan approach agreed on the following recommendations, that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG amend their Strategic Plan to ensure that its audit mandate is not disrupted due 
<br/>to unforeseen circumstances and events like the COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>A proper training plan be developed to be in line with the audit training needs of the staff 
<br/>so they are able to better improve their performance and productivity, as mentioned in the 
<br/>Performance Management Framework Report. 
<br/>The  OAG  liaises  with  Ministries  and  Departments  to  allow  for  proper  facilitation  of 
<br/>payments for outstanding audit areas, especially from Municipal Councils and Provincial 
<br/>Councils. 
<br/>The OAG needs to specifically identify strategies and work towards improving on its own 
<br/>current Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) rating of C+ before the 
<br/>next assessment period.  
<br/>The  Pacific  Association  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (PASAI)  should  conduct  more 
<br/>regular reviews on the OAG in the future which would allow the office to be on par with 
<br/>international auditing standards. 
<br/>The OAG should consider exploring the use of technological infrastructure to assist in the 
<br/></span><span>conduct of their online audit in future. 
<br/></span><span>The  OAG  should  take  note  of  the  areas  of  improvement  and  implement  improvement 
<br/>before the next PASAI review commences. 
<br/>The OAG should follow up with the line Minister on the review of the Audit Act 1969 and 
<br/>modernise to suit the current environment of doing business. 
<br/>The OAG to conduct a comprehensive exit meeting to allow Ministries and Departments 
<br/>to rectify pertinent audit issues before the tabling of audit report to Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that contribution, as the Member moving the motion, I thank you for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  as  a  Member  of  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/></span><span>Committee to contribute on the motion before this Parliament this morning which is the Consolidated 
<br/></span><span>Report  on  the  Review  of  the  Annual  Report  of  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  2020  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance  Audit  undertaken  by  the  Supreme  Audit  Institution  on  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-
<br/>General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we acknowledge that this assessment framework is a first ever independent review of the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Auditor-General  (OAG)  under  the  Supreme  Audit  Institution  (SAI)  Performance 
<br/>Management Framework which was solely carried out by the Pacific Association of Supreme Audit 
<br/>Institutions (PASAI) and also received during the year.  It had addressed areas where the OAG had 
<br/>excelled in and those where it needed great improvements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The objective of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was to provide an independent assessment of 
<br/>the current operations and audit practices of Fiji’s OAG against international standards, specifically 
<br/>the International Standards for Supreme Audit Institutions and other established international good 
<br/>practices for public auditing.   Also, Sir, this assessment was funded by the European Union (EU) 
<br/>and  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  in  partnership  with 
<br/>PASAI. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with the objectives of PASAI 12, the value and benefits of SAI making a difference to 
<br/>the lives of citizens, the SAI Performance Measurement Framework also provides the OAG with an 
<br/>objective basis for demonstrating its ongoing relevance to citizens and other stakeholders. It assesses 
<br/>the OAG’s contribution towards strengthening accountability, transparency and integrity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also gives the  OAG an opportunity to  become  a model  organisation - 
<br/>leading by example in promoting transparency and accountability through credible public reporting 
<br/>on its own performances.  The review of the OAG was done in six areas as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Independent and Legal Framework of the organisation;  
<br/>Internal Governance and Ethics of the OAG; 
<br/>Audit Quality and Reporting; 
<br/>Financial Management, Assets and Support Services;  
<br/>Human Resources and Training; and 
<br/>Communication and Stakeholder Management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  just  contribute  further  on  some  of  the  Committee’s  recommendations.    The 
<br/>Committee, after carrying out  a thorough  review of the OAG’s 2020 Annual Report and the SAI 
<br/>Performance  Measurement  Framework,  in  a  bipartisan  approach  agreed  on  the  following 
<br/></span><span>recommendations:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG to amend its strategic plan to ensure that its audit mandate is not disrupted due 
<br/>to unforeseen circumstances and events like the COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  comment  on  that  is  I  am  totally  in  agreement  with  this 
<br/>recommendation.    The  OAG  may  need  to  explore  the  use  and  adaptation  of  IT 
<br/>infrastructures in their audit conduct.  As we all know, the OAG in the conduct of the 
<br/>audit, they used to be doing physical verification and physical presence in the ministries 
<br/>and  departments  that  are  under  audit.    This  means  that  when  events  like  COVID-19 
<br/></span><span>pandemic reoccurs in the future or similar, the OAG is equipped to conduct its normal 
<br/></span><span>work with the  IT infrastructure and the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, gives the OAG a 
<br/>perfect opportunity to assess its capability and make recommendations to government for 
<br/>improvement.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper training plan be developed to be in line with the audit training needs of the staff so 
<br/>that they are able to better improve their performances and productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  comments  on  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  staff  training  is  a  necessity  in  any 
<br/>organisation  and  the  OAG  is  no  exception,  given  the  evolvement  of  the  government 
<br/>system and processes through international benchmarks, it is incumbent on the OAG to 
<br/>facilitate the highest level of training, not only for its staff but also in conjunction with 
<br/>other  line  Ministries,  the  training  of  relevant  officials  who  are  desk  officers  for  audit 
<br/>purposes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG should liaise with Ministries and Departments to allow for prompt facilitation 
<br/>of  payment  of  outstanding  audit  arrears,  especially  from  Municipal  Councils  and 
<br/>Provincial Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increasing arrears of fees from Municipal and Provincial 
<br/>Councils is an area of concern in the OAG.  It is advisable that given the chronic delays 
<br/>in  payments,  it  would  be  good  for  the  OAG  to  provide  legal  powers  to  pursue  these 
<br/>recoveries.  At the moment, they do not have any legal powers to pursue the collection of 
<br/>those arrears and we note that the OAG also contracts out auditing of most Municipal and 
<br/>Provincial  Councils  due  to  the  limited  number  of  auditing  firms  that  are  currently 
<br/>available.  This costs money to the OAG and must be recovered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been observed that due to the limitation of audit firms, reports from municipal and 
<br/>provincial  councils  are  also  often  delayed.  On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  recent 
<br/>amendments to the Fiji Chartered Accounting Act 2021 did not include the provision of 
<br/>auditing services and this limits the resources that the OAG can tap into to obtain the 
<br/>maximum value for money on the conduct of audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG needs to specifically  identify  strategies  and work to improve  on  its  current 
<br/>Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) rating of C+ before the next 
<br/>assessment period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to improve its rating, the OAG needs to be adequately resourced in terms 
<br/>of financial, staffing and infrastructure, and even the environment that they work in.  It is 
<br/>important that the government recognises the role of the OAG for scrutiny of the current 
<br/></span><span>Government system but it will also be for future governments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, to allow the Auditor-General to improve its rating, Government needs 
<br/>to be able to stop changing the Auditor-General on a regular basis.  Government needs to 
<br/>display consistency by working on keeping those appointed in the positions of Auditor-
<br/>General, for example, for two terms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG should follow up with line Ministers on the review of the Audit Act 1969 to 
<br/>modernise to suit the current environment of doing businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the recommendations from the PASAI review of the OAG.  It states that 
<br/></span><span>the Audit Act 1969 does not provide the Auditor-General with the power to communicate 
<br/>directly  with  the  Judiciary  or  report  audit  findings  to  prosecuting  and  investigating 
<br/>agencies.  As such, any communication processes to guide OAG’s interaction with the 
<br/></span><span>Judiciary or special prosecuting agencies is yet to be developed.  This may change when 
<br/></span><span>the current audit law is modernised and it is incumbent on Government to prioritise this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so that we  are internationally  compliant to  auditing standards.   If  Government  can be 
<br/>reviewing archaic laws in other sectoral areas, this must be included too as a priority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are no doubt nearing the end of the second term of Parliament of the 
<br/>current Government and the Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Act 2021 which was 
<br/>passed  in  this  august  House  in  2021  is  yet  to  be  implemented  by  the  Fiji  Institute  of 
<br/>Accountants.  I know this because I have made several attempts to register under this Act 
<br/>with the Fiji Institute of Accountants, but I have been advised that they are still waiting 
<br/>the Solicitor-General’s clarification on the rules and regulations under the said Act and 
<br/>we recommend to the Solicitor-General’s Office to give this a priority and to commence 
<br/>this new Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG to conduct a comprehensive exit meeting to allow Ministries and Departments 
<br/>to rectify pertinent audit issues before tabling of audit reports to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to remove the politicisation, unnecessary panic and finger-pointing that 
<br/>can  be  result  of  an  audit  by  the  OAG,  it  is  crucial  that  the  exit  interview  meeting 
<br/>recommended by the OAG with Ministries and  Departments be prioritised by various 
<br/>entities.  Government must play a bigger role in mandating its officials, especially the 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries.  Government must prioritise this with Permanent Secretaries to 
<br/>participate in this exit meetings for it is in the best interest of the entities involved to do 
<br/>so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once the  OAG  prints  out its  report, various  Ministries  and institutions would then be 
<br/>comforted that the OAG is presenting a fair, balanced and accurate account of their audit 
<br/>findings.  Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will hear less complaints against the OAG then.  
<br/>The ball is really in Government’s court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I leave the other recommendations to the other honourable Members of the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee and other honourable Members in this august House to contribute on 
<br/>and update this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before the 
<br/>House  and I thank the Committee for the report and the various recommendations they have made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Local  Government  acknowledges  the  recommendations  made  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Committee, in particular the recommendation on the prompt facilitation of payments that 
<br/>should be made by the Ministry of Local Governments on outstanding audit arrears. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  response to  this  recommendation, the  Municipal  Councils have made 
<br/>appropriate  arrangements  with  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  (OAG)  to  clear  the  outstanding 
<br/>audit  fees.    From  close  to  about  $500,000  that  was  owed  to  the  OAG,  Municipal  Councils  have 
<br/>cleared and only $50,000 is left to be cleared - the rest have been cleared.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  inform  the  House  that  the  Municipal  Councils  have  made 
<br/></span><span>arrangements  with  the  OAG  to  settle  the  arrears  in  instalments.  This  is  particularly  for  the  small 
<br/></span><span>Municipal Councils, like Rakiraki, Tavua, et cetera.  The reason is that, small Municipal Councils 
<br/>have very limited revenue base.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  wishes  to  further  respond  to  the 
<br/></span><span>following PAC questions marked as Appendices 1 and 2 in the Report of the Standing Committee on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1227 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public  Accounts.  In  response  to  the  Municipal  Councils  adopting  the  International  Financial 
<br/>Reporting Standards (IFRS), I am pleased to inform the House that all 13 Councils are transiting to 
<br/>IFRS to prepare their Financial Statements for auditing purposes.  This has also been made mandatory 
<br/>through the new finance policies that have been developed and implemented by all the Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as for the improving of the accounting systems and processes, most of the 
<br/>Municipal Councils have invested in MYOB accounting software to store and retrieve data. Through 
<br/>this software, the Councils are now able to create accounting systems for their organisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Municipal Councils have been late in submitting the financial statements 
<br/>for audits and we acknowledge that. The main reason for that delay was due to the lack of skilled 
<br/>personnel. There were staff laxity and the use of improper accounting software to name a few.  But 
<br/>I  must  give  credit  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  and  Special  Administrators  (SA)  of  the 
<br/>Municipal Councils.  In the last couple of years, they have submitted more than 130 Annual Reports 
<br/>to Parliament and the Municipal Councils are still working to clear the backlog. We will be presenting 
<br/>some more Annual Reports in the Parliament, soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Municipal Councils, in collaboration with the Ministry, will work towards improving the 
<br/>systems and processes at the Council and they have made a lot of progress in that area by recruiting 
<br/>the  right  people  for  the  right  job.  The  organisation  structures  have  been  completed  and  various 
<br/>policies have been introduced so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we expect a lot of improvement in their service 
<br/>delivery, as well as in the submission of the Reports, et cetera, to this House. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/>I would particularly want  to  touch on something that  is  relevant  today, in  terms  of  some of the 
<br/>requirements under the Financial Management Act that is creating a lot of anxiety within the political 
<br/>parties in this  country. That is the demand that the political parties present their Manifesto to who 
<br/>we do not know or else we do not know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. R. GAVOKA.- Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy, 
<br/>Minister for Elections and the General Secretary for the FijiFirst Party made some threats here to us 
<br/>that you watch what you have to say or you will have to account for everything that we say. This was 
<br/></span><span>a threat to us, Mr. Speaker, that would dampen the spirits of the democracy in this country as we 
<br/></span><span>head towards elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this should not be a case as this is an Election year, we should celebrate our 
<br/>democracy and no one should be telling us to watch what we say.  This is a free country, we have 
<br/>our manifesto, we have what we believe is good for this country. There are nine political parties in 
<br/>this country, Sir, competing for election this year, no one should be threatened in the way it was done 
<br/>yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, stick to the motion of today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Chairman of the Committee spoke, he 
<br/>said  that  it  should  improve  the  work  of  OAG  relevant  to  the  current  environment.  The  current 
<br/>environment  is  that  we  do  not  know  which  competent  body  is  going  to  give  a  pass  or  fail  to  a 
<br/></span><span>manifesto.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We went to the FEO and asked if he was going to give us an A, F or 
<br/>D on our manifesto and he said, ‘No, we do not know.”  Can you give us a template? No, we do not 
<br/>have one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you lay down rules like that, please go through the thought process 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>properly so that we are clear on what we should do.  The OAG, should play a lead role in this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Are we going to be audited by them, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Our fear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that all this extends to who we are as 
<br/>a free people.  There should be no disillusionment to our people that a manifesto cannot be discussed 
<br/>openly as you did in the past.  Now, we are going around registering people to vote, at the same time 
<br/>we are putting obstacles with the political parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  this come together,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  give  clarity, we  are  asking  for clarity and we 
<br/>believe the Office of the Auditor-General should play a role in this and lay out the rules very clearly, 
<br/>otherwise we are going to have another 2018.  In 2018 about 171,000 people did not vote and that 
<br/>was too high for a small country like Fiji.  It was a failure on the part of the Elections Office, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, stick to the motion that is before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are reviewing the work of the OAG and we 
<br/>want  them  to  give  clarity  to  the  way  we  do  business  in  this  country.    It  is  very  important,  that 
<br/>institutions should be given the independence to do their own work.  For this one here, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we know what happened - they fired the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Gavoka  and  his  political 
<br/>desperation is once again misleading Parliament.  The Auditor-General was not fired, his contract of 
<br/></span><span>five years came to an end and like any other position, and he can apply for it.  The job has already 
<br/></span><span>been  advertised  and  people  can  apply  for  it.    I  do  not  know  whether  he  applied  or  not  but  the 
<br/>Committee will look at that but he has not been fired - please do not mislead Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  was  a  nice  line  ‘political  desperation’.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Desperation is threatening other political parties to complicate matters for them.  We live in glass

<div><span>houses so do not throw stones, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Speak the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my concern.  The Financial Management 
<br/>Act covers this manifesto thing and we want clarity; no one should be threatened in this country in 
<br/>the way they exercise democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rest my case there, I hope that people across the aisle understand what I 
<br/>am trying to say and act accordingly for the benefit of our people in the election that will be held this 
<br/>year.  Let us have a good election and please let us not threaten the political parties - as the Minister 
<br/>for Election has done yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  One of their former colleagues did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say that they have all been instructed to make a lot of noise when I speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, they are continuing with that tradition – the silent 25. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Anyway, Mr. Speaker, I thank the Committee for this Report 
<br/>and note the recommendations made to further strengthen the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) 
<br/>both, in terms of its work and independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I know the recommendations come against the backdrop of an inquiry into the 
<br/>OAG appointed by His Excellency the President on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December last year.  We all know that the 
<br/>OAG  has  been  under  severe  and  intense  scrutiny  by  this  Government  for  a  while,  and  its  role, 
<br/></span><span>performance and independence has been questioned even on the floor of this Parliament by a select 
<br/></span><span>few and led by none other than the honourable Attorney-General, so much so that we even had claims 
<br/>in this Parliament that the Auditor-General was having grog with some Opposition Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the work and recommendations of this Committee ceases to have any meaning 
<br/>if the Auditor-General, who must only report to Parliament and no one else, is maligned inside the 
<br/>same house that protects the OAG, as well as preserves its neutrality and independence.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>I have said this before in this Parliament that the Executive reports to Parliament, the Executive does 
<br/>not run Parliament.  The Executive does not run the Independent Offices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- We know that! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You do not know that, that is the problem.  You do not know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>half the things that is happening inside FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, reports to this Parliament 
<br/>through the Speaker, and no one else.  That has been traditionally the norm at all times, and we all 
<br/>know that.  The reports are then referred to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and, of course, 
<br/>like anyone else, we are not saying that the Auditor-General is immune from scrutiny and criticism, 
<br/>but these have to be based on facts and facts alone – nothing else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  a  normal  and  genuine  democracy,  Mr.  Speaker,  Government  Ministries,  statutory 
<br/>organisations, Government Commercial Companies and entities answer to queries, agree to rebut the 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report concerning them at hearings of the Public Accounts Committee.  This is 
<br/>all part of the scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But when the Auditor-General is sitting together with the Chief Legal Officer of the State, 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General,  who in  this case also  happens to  be the Minister for Economy, 
<br/>announcing changes to a report as was seen five years ago, something is not right, Mr. Speaker.  I 
<br/>had said that in Parliament yesterday.  This was even before the PAC could scrutinise that.  Therefore, 
<br/>the  perception  of  the  people  about  the  neutrality  of  an  independent  office  being  compromised, 
<br/>naturally gained momentum rightly or wrongly - perception is also very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The result, Mr. Speaker, is that we do not have a substantive Auditor-General.  The last person 
<br/>to hold that Office is, in a way, associated with OAG.  He lasted only one term on the job and may 
<br/>have opted to exit instead of reapplying, as reported by the media four months ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  Government  was  shooting  the  messenger  at  all  times  instead  of 
<br/>shooting the message, so much so that there was a press statement from the OAG on 30</span><span>th </span><span>December, 
<br/>2021.  The statement that can be found on the OAG site said this, Mr. Speaker, and I want to quote 
<br/>from the official media release:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“OAG’s Response to Recent Public Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is rather unfortunate that public statements have been released to publicly denigrate the 
<br/>reputation of the Auditor-General and the Office of the Auditor-General and selectively 
<br/>publish information concerning annual audits.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the release from the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that kind of stupid interjections from someone who is always concerned about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pigeon shooting.  The second paragraph states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Auditor-General  will  not  respond  directly  and  publicly  to  the  various 
<br/>allegations  contained  in  these  statements.    The  Auditor-General  and  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General is bound by section 8 of the Audit Act 1969 concerning secrecy and the 
<br/>confidentiality aspects of the auditor - client relationship governing the audit profession.  In 
<br/>addition, the Office of the Auditor-General will not release any information, not yet publicly 
<br/></span><span>available, concerning any audit client, except in the Auditor-General’s reports to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  accepts  that  it  currently  has  the  enormous 
<br/>challenge and responsibility of auditing backlog draft financial statements, which were not 
<br/></span><span>submitted annually over several years, within the resources that it has been allocated.  And 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Office of the Auditor-General will continue to work with these State entities to ensure 
<br/>that audits of financial statements are updated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Auditor-General  and  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  will  continue  to 
<br/>diligently deliver its responsibilities as mandated by the 2013 Constitution and Audit Act 
<br/>1969.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General and the staff of the Office of the Auditor-General are hopeful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for a better year ahead and wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2022.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was what the Auditor-General said in the press release.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I read  this  statement because that statement is  a damming indictment  of 
<br/>Government’s thorough dislike of the Office of the Auditor-General or the Auditor-General himself.  
<br/>It is clear as daylight that the statement from the Office of the Auditor-General was made to defend 
<br/>the Office from being denigrated by the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government’s </span><span>modus operandi</span><span> is simple and we all know that.  It will 
<br/>malign  anyone  and  everyone  it  dislikes  or  feels  that  their  actions  will  expose  them.    No  other 
<br/>government has changed rules of the game, in this case, the Standing Orders, more than the current 
<br/>Government.    No  other  government,  and  that  is  true,  had  usurped  the  powers  of  parliamentary 
<br/>Standing or Select Committee other than the current Government, because, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some 
<br/>of them are used to dictatorship, and they want to run this Parliament like this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  brings  me  to  address  some  of  the  honourable  Attorney-General’s 
<br/>thoroughly misleading remarks that stooped to gutter levels yesterday afternoon.  He has lied about 
<br/>this many times.  I made the remarks on the report tabled from 2007 to 2013 by the OAG, before I 
<br/>was elected as the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, because the report was 
<br/>public.  In fact, when I became the Chairman, the Government nominees - honourable Koroilavesau, 
<br/>honourable Balmindar Singh and honourable Sanjeet Patel, supported my work in the Committee.  
<br/>In fact, they were very good members of the Committee and my Opposition colleague, honourable 
<br/>Aseri Radrodro.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know, honourable Koroilavesau used to give me full support in the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I am not on that Committee anymore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  The  running  commentaries  that  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General refers to are proceedings of the Committee, because the Committee hearings were public.  It 
<br/>was a public event with media attending so if I was making the comment as part of the Chairman of 
<br/>the Committee, in the Committee which is publicly covered by the media, of course they will report 
<br/>what  I  say.      What  is  wrong  with  that?    That  is  what  he  is  saying,  that  I  was  giving  a  running 
<br/>commentary, after all the meetings were public, transparent, informative and open to the press.  I 
<br/>know, one day, the honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Prime Minister walked into the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee meeting and I welcomed them.  The media was there but then they keep 
<br/></span><span>talking about public commentary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But  the point is,  Mr. Speaker, that they  were picking their 
<br/></span><span>statements from the meeting of the Standing Committee itself.  The reason (I have said this before) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why they changed the Standing Orders was because they did not want the Opposition to chair the 
<br/>Committee, they did not want the scrutiny of the audit reports in the way that it used to be done in 
<br/>the traditional manner where the Public Accounts Committee was always chaired by an Opposition 
<br/>Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  It  is  very  clear  that  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  was 
<br/>always under siege by this Government and the government before that they were part of because 
<br/>from 2007 until 2013, there was no Auditor-General’s Report until the Parliament convened, it was 
<br/>not  made public.  They  say, “Oh, there was no Parliament” but the report could  have been made 
<br/>public, the Auditor-General’s Report is a public report and if you do not have a Parliament, if you 
<br/>have a military government, they would do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Coming  back  to  the  recommendations,  in  fact  all  the 
<br/>recommendations in this report is really about what the Office of the Auditor-General needs to do.  I 
<br/>do  not  think  there  is  a  clear  recommendation  as  to  how  to  strengthen  the  independence  of  the 
<br/>organisation,  how  not  to  get  Government  Ministers  to  interfere  in  the  work  of  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will give you an example.  I know you’re sleeping on the

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … that the report was changed.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do that, Mr. Speaker, but the interjections are so stupid that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I get distracted so much.

<br/>General could be resourced well.  In fact in the report itself, the Auditor-General himself is saying 
<br/>that he has no control over the office he runs, he has no control over the vehicles that he gets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is what he is saying - it is in the report.

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is lying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So they are saying that the Auditor-General was lying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, he was.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The other point in this report and I want to quote them.  He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comes to a Parliamentary Committee and they are saying that he lied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I would believe the Auditor-General than some of you sitting

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- If you look at just one more point that the Auditor-General 
<br/>has been saying and this is in this Supreme Audit Report, it actually says that the executive does not 
<br/>have a role in the appointment of the Auditor-General but the Auditor-General does not have the 
<br/>independence (this is the supreme audit institution) in terms of the resources and the way the budget 
<br/>is determined.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  even  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  where  it  says  that  the  Executive  does  not  have  a  hand  in  the 
<br/>appointment or does not influence, in fact the Constitutional Offices Commission is chaired by the 
<br/>Prime Minister, the Attorney-General sits in that Committee, the Government appoints two Members 
<br/>so in a very direct way the executive has a hand in the appointment of the Auditor-General.  On top 
<br/>of that, they do not have the means of acquiring the resources in an independent manner</span><span>.  </span><span>So, it is 
<br/>very clear, I mean the honourable Attorney-General says that this man (the Auditor-General who is 
<br/>no longer there) I know why he did not apply, because you attack him publicly.  Why would he want 
<br/>to be an Auditor-General for another five years when he knows that he would not be able to do his 
<br/>job, he was a professional man and then … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What did he tell you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  He does not text me like your minions text you … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He does not text me like your minions in independent institutions text you.  The honourable

<div><span>Attorney-General, just be a good, honest man, just be a bit honest.

<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This man (the former Auditor-General) was a man of integrity.  
<br/>When you attack him publicly, when you malign him publicly, why would anyone Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>want to be in the job? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- A candidate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, I wish he will come to us but this is the level of 
<br/>deceit and lies that they come up within Parliament.  They actually said that the Attorney-General 
<br/></span><span>lied. This is really shameful to say that the man is not in the job, he came to the Public Accounts 
<br/></span><span>Committee said what he said in this Report and the honourable Attorney-General is saying that he is 
<br/>lying... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … without him having the opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say this, that this Government has run out of time, has run out of 
<br/>money,  has  run  out  of  ideas  and  in  fact  it  has  ran  out  of  good  people  who  want  to  serve  this 
<br/>government any more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- That is why you joined them! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And the silent 25, all they do, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is make stupid 
<br/>interjections.    That  is  all  they  do,  and  the  people  of  this  country  know  this.    No  amount  of  fear 
<br/>mongering or stalking fear from the past is going to sway them to voting these people again. They 
<br/>must understand that their time is up.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to contribute to the motion on the OAG’s  
<br/>Report and it is shocking to hear the other side saying that the Auditor-General is a liar.  Not only 
<br/>they said this once but they said it several times and when they say that they undermine that Office, 
<br/>but that is not new. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is no longer there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- The issues with the Auditor-General, I note the recommendations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in front of us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He is no longer there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- And they are very good at interjecting and interfering, very good 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I note that the issues with the Auditor-General even though the 
<br/>Report is in front of us started when he issued a qualified opinion on the 2015 Accounts of </span><span>Walesi</span><span>
<br/>and raised issues regarding that.  From there the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> started making excuses and blaming OAG 
<br/>regarding the delays in the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know OAG had raised the issue about how long it took them to get their accounts in order 
<br/>and  why  was  it  three  years  late.    So  that  was  one  of  the  main  issues  I  suppose  motivating  the 
<br/></span><span>Government to undermine that office up to now.  Again as raised by the previous speakers, we have 
<br/></span><span>in front of us a commission of inquiry into the OAG and I question why.  Why do they have to do 
<br/>that in terms of the importance of that role to the nation and in terms of accountability and this is 
<br/>going on.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-OAG 2020 Annual Report &amp; 
<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the terms of reference: examine the conduct operations and performance of the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Auditor-General,  make  recommendations  to  eliminate  any  unlawful,  improper, 
<br/>ineffective  or  inefficient  practices  rather  than  the  focusing  on  what  the  OAG  has  raised  in  terms 
<br/>inefficiencies, untimely reports, delayed reports, et cetera, the Government is now focussing on witch 
<br/>hunting at the Office of the Auditor-General rather than looking at the faults that the OAG has raised. 
<br/>The Minister should ensure that the Annual Reports are on time and audit issues are addressed rather 
<br/>than wasting public funds on this commission of inquiry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To reflect on my colleagues’ concerns regarding the contract of the incumbent, why was it 
<br/>not renewed?  The Honourable Attorney-General had explained that.  Of course, he did not apply 
<br/>because he was pressured not to apply and that is the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, that goes hand in hand with what we raised yesterday regarding the pressure on 
<br/>heads of statutory organisations and Permanent Secretaries to make political statements. A few of 
<br/>them have made political statements.  I noticed that these have been prepared for them and why do 
<br/>politicians have to sacrifice the civil servants.  Why do they not make the statements themselves?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  A  few  of  them  have  made  it  and  we  need  to  warn  the  civil 
<br/>servants that they are not politicians.  If they make political statements they need to resign and stand 
<br/>in the Elections, of course, some of them are quite close to the Honourable Attorney-General that 
<br/>they send texts to him.  I mean, how independent are they in closely liaising with the Honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also note regarding the Office of the Auditor-General that this is part of the witch-hunt in 
<br/>the victimisation of this particular office. On the budget, why has the budget reduced over the years?  
<br/>In the last four years the Office of the Auditor-General’s annual budget has fallen by a quarter from 
<br/>$6.6 million in 2018/2019 to $4.9 million in 2021/2022.  Again, I would like to emphasise, how can 
<br/>they do their proper duties with these kinds of reduction?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General again, it is very important to note that it was established 
<br/>under the Constitution as the other side knows, and request the office that at least once a year he must 
<br/></span><span>inspect, audit and report to Parliament on the Public Accounts of the State on the control of public 
<br/></span><span>money, public property, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very important in terms of good governance and transparency and that is why we on this 
<br/>side of Parliament are very concerned about the victimisation of the last Auditor-General and the 
<br/>undermining of the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Audit  Act  1969  clearly  specifies  the  powers  and  the  empowerment  of  the  Auditor-
<br/>General to conduct performance audit, the scope of the audits and of course the Standing Order is 
<br/>clearly specified there on 103 - the Minister responsible for Finance must lay the Auditor-General’s 
<br/></span><span>Report before Parliament in accordance with Section 152(14) of the Constitution. This all boils down 
<br/></span><span>to good governance and transparency.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, good governance and transparency go hand 
<br/>in hand with media freedom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  under  this  Government  Fiji  has  been  classified  as  the  worst  place  for 
<br/></span><span>journalists.  The reporters just recently released a statement, Fiji has been ranked as the worst place 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>in  the  Pacific  region  for  journalists  in  the  latest  assessment  by  global  press  freedom  watchdog 
<br/>reporters without borders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In RSF 2022 World Press Freedom Index released this week Fiji was placed 102 out of 180 
<br/>countries of receiving an overall score of 56.91 out of 100.  Fiji nearly failed, 59.  The country slipped 
<br/>by 47 places compared to its 2021 rankings when it was placed 55 out of the 180 nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A statement was also issued regarding this by the Fiji Media Association and let me read out 
<br/>what they stated. It says that the Fiji Media Association says the Reporters without Borders Report 
<br/>is another clear reminder to the government to review and remove sections in the Media Industry 
<br/>Development Authority Act that imposes harsh penalties on the media.  It says these breaches include 
<br/>content that is deemed against public interest or order, against national interest or creates communal 
<br/>discord  or  even  if  the  media  does  not  include  a  by-line  for  articles  exceeding  50  words.    The 
<br/>Association says who defines what is against the public interest or what is against the national interest 
<br/>and while the Fijian media has been doing their best to be bold and free and abiding by the code of 
<br/>ethics, these laws are making many media organisations hesitant about publishing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order.  Honourable Member, you are straying, going all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over the place.  Stick to the motion.  We have a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes, what is your Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, that is what I actually wanted to mention.  He is all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over the place and not actually speaking on the Report itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  What I was expressing was the role of 
<br/>the  OAG  in  terms  of  good  governance  and  transparency.    Good  governance  and  transparency 
<br/>involves the OAG, the whole Parliament, et cetera, Government and of course, the media.  That is 
<br/>why I am raising it here, in terms of that partnership and the stakeholders to make the work of the 
<br/>OAG effective and efficient.  Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to very quickly just remind 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members of the impact of  the recommendations that were made by the Committee.  The 
<br/>recommendations are quite telling and it gives a good background to what I was going to say and, 
<br/>indeed, provide a response to  what  the other honourable Members on the other side were talking 
<br/>about.   It says, that:

<div><span>The OAG amend their strategic plan to ensure that its audit mandate is not disrupted due to 
<br/>unforeseen circumstances in events like COVID-19 pandemic. 
<br/>Proper training be developed in line with the audit training needs of the staff so they are 
<br/>better able to perform their performances.   
<br/>The OAG should liaise with Ministries and Departments to allow for prompt facilitation of 
<br/>payments on outstanding audit arrears, especially from municipal councils.   
<br/>The OAG needs to specifically identify strategies and work to improve its current PEFA 
<br/>rating C+.  Its current rating was C+.  Not B+, not A+ but C+ before the next assessment 
<br/></span><span>period.

<div><span>PASAI should conduct more regular reviews of the OAG in the future which will allow the 
<br/>OAG to be on par with international auditing standards.  In other words, it was not on par.   
<br/>The OAG should consider exploring the use of technological infrastructure to assist in the 
<br/>conduct of online audits.   
<br/>The OAG should take note on the areas of improvement and implement improvements 
<br/>before the next PASAI review commences.   
<br/>The OAG should follow up with the line minister on the review of the Audit Act 1969 to 
<br/>modernise, to suit the current environment of doing business. 
<br/>The OAG to conduct a comprehensive exit meeting to allow Ministries and Departments 
<br/>to rectify pertinent audit issues before tabling of audit reports to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Auditor-General refused to do exit meetings.  Refused!  Hardly attended any entry 
<br/>interviews.    Refused  to  do  that.    No  good  auditor  refuses  to  attend  meetings,  exit  meetings  in 
<br/>particular.  He refused and you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know for a fact he said he does not want to 
<br/>attend the meetings as there may be a conflict of interest.  What an absolutely obtuse statement to 
<br/>make.  A complete lack of understanding as to what an auditor does.  If we check with the auditing 
<br/>standards with the Fiji Institute of Accountants, it tells you that you must do exit meetings.  This 
<br/>Auditor-General, the former Auditor-General refused to do that. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the acting Auditor-
<br/>General at the moment, does do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  would  like  to  make  also  is  the  lack  of  client  
<br/>engagement whereby on several occasions that I have highlighted, the Auditor-General failed to meet 
<br/>with the Permanent Secretaries or Government representatives to discuss the issues identified in the 
<br/>Auditor-General’s report.  Furthermore, the Auditor-General has failed to attend entry and exit audit 
<br/>meetings, communicating that these meetings impact the independence of OAG, what a preposterous 
<br/>statement to make.  This highlight the poor service delivery of the OAG for the past years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regards to the audit engagement when performing the financial statement audits, the OAG 
<br/>normally combines financial audits (I hope they understand what I am talking about) and compliance 
<br/>audits.  This is precisely the reason why the audit reports have been coming late to Parliament because 
<br/>what they should be doing is running them separately.  At least, Parliament very quickly gets the 
<br/>financial  audits.    The  compliance  audits  come  separately,  you  do  not  do  them  simultaneously  or 
<br/>indeed even one after the other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is currently a two year delay in tabling of audited financial statements, 
<br/>we do not want to do both of them together.  The effectiveness and the efficiency of OAG audits 
<br/>have been concerning with the way OAG focussed with the quantity of audit issues raised in the Draft 
<br/>Management Letter (DML) which they normally give to the ministries or the departments and say 
<br/>look, these are the things that we think we need to have response.  They are focussed on the quantity 
<br/>rather than the quality of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  DMLs  that  are  now  being  issued  are  on  a  100  pages  long,  issues  such  as  grant 
<br/>administration they should be included in the ministry’s finance manual, underutilisation of budgeted 
<br/>funds, reconciliation not verified by the Head of Treasury, disclosure on service simpler items as 
<br/></span><span>lodged in the financial statement and disclosure of the events that occurred after the balanced date in 
<br/></span><span>the ministry’s financial statements showed that the Office of the Auditor-General is not well versed 
<br/>with the ministry’s Finance Manual.  They do not even look at the Finance Manual and say look, 
<br/>these are the issues that need to be addressed in the Finance Manual and this is what  used to come 
<br/>in the Auditor-General’s Report, and the requirements of the Financial Management Act.  They have 
<br/>not even read that it would appear and the Finance Instructions of 2010.

<br/>Assessing OAG’s SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what leading to this preposterous list of items.  Lack of adherence to the audit process 
<br/>by OAG whereby we have noted that OAG continued to send three DMLs during the financial year 
<br/>2017-2018 even though the exit meeting had been concluded.  So what they do, they say this is the 
<br/>DML  so  the  ministry  responds  to  that,  they  have  done  their  response,  after  the  audit  has  been 
<br/>completed then after that they send them another DML and then it turns up here.  They know all these 
<br/>people here say, “Oh look this has not been responded to”.  That is what they have been doing, that 
<br/>is a deliberate attempt to try and undermine those respective ministries and departments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No independent, no professional organisations or person would actually do that.  You have 
<br/>to come with clean hands. If you are an independent body and have been tasked to do this, you go 
<br/>and do your job.  No one is stopping you, do not pull out these under hand tactics, you lose your 
<br/>credibility and that is precisely what happened.  They do not talk about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy, for example, was not given the opportunity to 
<br/>discuss on additional issues highlighted in the subsequent DMLs.  These issues were subsequently 
<br/>raised  in  the  final  management  letter  in  the  Auditor-General’s  Report  to  Parliament.    Lack  of 
<br/>consultation  with  the clients  on the changes made to  the reporting  guidelines to  Parliament.  The 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General released a new reporting guideline effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  there  was  no  consultation  carried  out  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to 
<br/>understand  the  client’s  difficulties  and  foreseeable  scenarios  that  may  limit  the  client’s  ability  to 
<br/>adhere to the required changes.  The Office of the Auditor-General lacks technical and specialised 
<br/>expertise,  for  example,  in  carrying  out  audits  in  fields  such  as  climate  change  and  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals  (SDG),  yet  within  nine  months  of  it  being  announced,  deploys  of  valuable 
<br/>resources for these specific purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SDG have been announced within nine months, they are doing an audit whether we have 
<br/>complied with that or not.  No other part of the world will you have an Auditor-General going out 
<br/>and carrying out an audit whether we have complied with SDGs or not within nine months.  They do 
<br/>not even have the expertise, given the significant audit backlogs with the Ministries, State Owned 
<br/>Entities and Statutory Authorities, you would have thought that the OAG with direct resources to the 
<br/>higher priority areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carrying  out  performance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  performance  audit  low  priority  areas  is 
<br/>monitoring of implementation Sugarcane Development and Farmers Assistance Performance audit 
<br/></span><span>on the access for persons with disabilities to public office and public transport. The OAG knew and 
<br/></span><span>they complained about the Municipal Councils, other officers and Ministries but they need to know 
<br/>the information, the Opposition needs to know the information and the Members of the public want 
<br/>to know - Agriculture and all those other departments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, high yielding Ministries, high staff members, they have not been given priority but all 
<br/>these other areas have been given priority. That is what we were questioning and just because they 
<br/>are an independent office does not mean that we cannot question them.  In the same way, as I said 
<br/>yesterday, that the Opposition can question and scrutinise the Government policy. They can do that, 
<br/>in the same way, we can question decisions.  In the same way, for example, if we are not happy with 
<br/></span><span>the decisions of the Courts, we can appeal it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  same  if  you  are  happy  with  the  decisions  of  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  Public 
<br/>Prosecutions (DPP) we can appeal it.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the OAG has never communicated.  In the 
<br/></span><span>five years as the former Auditor-General, never communicated a strategy or indicated his intention 
<br/></span><span>on how he intends to address  the significant backlog of audits that currently exists.  They do not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appreciate the fact that today, before the Auditor- General’s budget, we used to seat with the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance.  If you pick up your Budget Estimates, you would see that there are one line item. The 
<br/>Judiciary has one line item and all the independent offices have one line item. What does that mean?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not tell the Parliament on how to spend their money, they come and make submissions 
<br/>on  the  Budget  and  they  go  off  and  they  do  their  own  thing.  They  have  their  own  procurement 
<br/>procedures  and  they  have  now  also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  moved  away  from  Financial  Management 
<br/>Information System (FMIS).  The Auditor-General has moved away from FMIS.  He wants to go and 
<br/>buy 25 cars, he can buy 25 cars, you want to buy 25 bicycles, and you can do that.  It is his choice 
<br/>and that is why they have a one line item which they do not come and actually tell this Parliament. 
<br/>They are not coming into the Parliament with these clean hands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  had  to  initiate  discussions  on  this  and  it  has 
<br/>provided options as to alternatives ways to proceed because of the backlog. They can give it out to 
<br/>the different private companies.  Honourable Radrodro, on that note, if the matter is not being held 
<br/>up by the Solicitor-General’s Office, the Fiji Institute of Accountant and Solicitor-General’s Office 
<br/>I  know,  as  far  as  two  days  ago,  were  trying  to  finalise  the  regulations  if  we  put  in  place.  The 
<br/>regulations does not have to come to the Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once it is finalised, then it would be put in place, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Again, there are other 
<br/>options such as allowing state owned  entities to pay for outsource audits by the OAG have been 
<br/>rejected. We have said get these entities to pay for it. They are independent auditors and they adhered 
<br/>to international standards, get them to do it. The OAG have never come to us and say, “Can you give 
<br/>us $1,000,000 more because we want to outsource audit?” No!  If they did, we would have given it 
<br/>to them.  We cannot tell them, “Here is $1,000,000 you can go and outsource it.”  It is up to them to 
<br/>tell us. They had all these options to do that but they did not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to raise was just in responses of the issues that 
<br/>were raised previously. They have gone on about the position of OAG and that it should have been 
<br/>renewed.  I  did  not  hear  them  saying  anything  when  we  actually  advertised  the  position  of  the 
<br/>Commissioner  of  Police  after  five  years,  or  when  we  advertised  the  Commander  of  the  RFMF, 
<br/>Commissioner of Corrections, the Governor of RBF and the Supervisor of Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every single person appointed by the COC, their positions are advertised after the five-year 
<br/>term.  They want special rules for the Auditor-General but no special rules for anybody else. This is 
<br/></span><span>the contradiction - they shoot themselves in the foot. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  when  anyone  steps  out  of  their 
<br/>mandate,  we  have  the  right  to  question.    It  is  not  question  about  attacking,  it  is  a  question  of 
<br/>maintaining the integrity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the ability to question, in the same 
<br/>way they have the ability to question anyone else, it is not just Parliament, anyone can be questioned.  
<br/></span><span>We have decisions that are questioned by the Judiciary, by lawyers - it is not done by Parliament.  
<br/></span><span>We have questions of the DPP, it is not done by Parliament.

<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- That is another process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  FICAC  -  people  have  raised  questions  about  that.  NGOs 
<br/>have made comments about the Police. The have raised issues about the Commander of the RFMF, 
<br/>they have raised issues about the Commissioner of Corrections, where were you then?  Do not be 
<br/>hypocritical. This is double standards and he is saying “Parliament, Parliament, Parliament.”

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- These independent institutions can be, but this is the problem 
<br/>of someone who is subservient to a person who carried out the first </span><span>coup</span><span> in this country, and who 
<br/>undermined the institution of the State, that is his problem.

<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amount  of  rape  and  pillage  on  the 
<br/>institutions  after  1987,  you  should  know  what  happened.    How  the  institutions  were  completely 
<br/>undermined and he does not talk about that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, he left a legacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Why don’t you talk about your decision from 2006? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Please!  You lost your credibility my friend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka said that I threatened all the other political parties.  All 
<br/>I did was simply read out the provisions in the Financial Management (Amendment) Act passed by 
<br/>this Parliament.  All I did was read, and I am going to read it again: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “If: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a political party; 
<br/>a candidate for election to Parliament; or 
<br/>any other person representing or acting under the direction of, the political party or 
<br/>candidate, makes a financial commitment, whether orally or in writing, the political 
<br/>party, candidate or other person must immediately provide a written explanation 
<br/>setting out the following information - 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>how revenue for the financial commitment is to be raised; 
<br/></span><span>how expenditure for the financial commitment is to be made; 
<br/></span><span>how  expenditure  is  to  be  allocated  to  different  sectors  and  budget  sector 
<br/>agencies; and 
<br/>if expenditure exceeds revenue, how the deficit is to be financed.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very simple.  All we are saying is if you are going to go out to members 
<br/>of the public, to the young people and promise them all free university education and say we will 
<br/>give you nice new homes for free, you have to tell them where you are going to get the money from.  
<br/>You may turn around and say “look it is going to cost us $100 million a year, that means I am going 
<br/>to cut off  $50 million from FRA, $15 million from Water Authority of Fiji” - that is fine, that is how 
<br/>you are doing it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, we released the figures as to what the economic position in Fiji is; what is the 
<br/>financial position in Fiji, what is the debt level in Fiji, what is the growth prospects in Fiji and from 
<br/>that you can make your extrapolation.  They are saying to who, who governs political parties, you 
<br/>have lawyers, be bright, use your brains.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and say, who we are going to report this to?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The comments they made are so inane.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  continuously  come  to  Parliament  and  spread  misinformation.    The 
<br/>Commission of Inquiry, of course, is going to give its report and we will see whether the Independent 
<br/>Commission of Inquiry does say.  All in all, we all agree that the standard of auditing process in Fiji, 
<br/>the efficacy and the efficiency with which they must operate, must significantly improve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The independence of the Office of the Auditor-General is guaranteed in the Constitution of 
<br/>the Republic of Fiji.  You have the Audit Act of 1969 and all of these provisions clearly state the 
<br/>laws that pertained to the Office of the Auditor-General, how they should conduct their affairs and 
<br/>indeed how they should be left to independently do so.  But that does not mean, nor does it negate 
<br/>the ability to have international standards apply to these independent institutions; that is all we are 
<br/>saying. That is what this report is saying and it is saying how we can improve that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Accounts to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all honourable Members who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have contributed to the debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  me,  I  have  this  Supreme  Audit  Institution  Performance  Measurement  Framework 
<br/>Report and a lot has been said about independence.  However, this independent assessment actually 
<br/>said on page 24 that the independence of OAG is categorised as 3 out of 4  and the only reason they 
<br/>have been pegged it at ‘3’ and not ‘4’ is because of the Audit Act 1969 which is under review.  Once 
<br/>it is reviewed, amendments are passed by Parliament, it will be rated ‘4’.  So, independence is there 
<br/>and this was an independent  assessment carried  out  by the Pacific Association  of Supreme Audit 
<br/>Institutions (PASAI) that we were talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Sir,  with  regard  to  the  backlog,  whenever  we  ask  the  Auditor-General  about  the 
<br/>backlog, they only criticise Government Ministries and agencies for not providing information on 
<br/>time.  But the assessment, again, says under SAI-7 Overall Audit Planning, was scored at 1 out of 4.  
<br/></span><span>That means they had poor planning and that is why there was a backlog of audit that has not been 
<br/></span><span>presented to Parliament at this stage.

<br/>2018-2019 AUDIT REPORT ON GCCs, CSAs AND OTHER ENTITIES  
<br/>AND 2018-2019 AUDIT REPORT ON STATUTORY AUTHORITIES 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  Government  Commercial  Companies, 
<br/>Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  and  Other  Entities  2018-2019  Audit  Report  and  the 
<br/>Consolidated Report on Statutory Authorities 2018-2019 Audit Report, which was tabled on 
<br/>10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now invite the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to speak on his motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Leader of Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; as Chairman of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, I take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the 
<br/>review of Government Commercial Companies (GCCs), Commercial Statutory Authorities (CSAs) 
<br/>and Other Entities and the 2018-2019 Audit Report on Statutory Authorities (Consolidated Report) 
<br/>which was tabled on 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>    Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Consolidated Report provides the Committee’s review findings on 
<br/>the  two  audit  reports.    The  OAG  established  under  the  Constitution,  and  the  powers  of  Auditor-
<br/>General is specified in the Audit Act.  The Committee reviewed the audit findings of the seven entities 
<br/>in the Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities and Other Entities 
<br/>Report and 11 entities were covered under the Commercial Statutory Authority Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG  had  issued  eight  audit  opinions  for  Government  Commercial  Companies, 
<br/>Commercial Statutory Authorities and Other Entities in which five were related to 2019 Financial 
<br/>Statements, while three were backlog of various entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was one modified opinion issued for the 2019 Financial Statement and 
<br/></span><span>two  financial  statements  in  the  backlog  for  the  various  entities  were  issued  with  modified  audit 
<br/>opinion as well.  The Auditor-General had issued an unmodified audit opinion on four of the 2019 
<br/>Financial Statements that were audited for the various entities.  One of the financial statements in the 
<br/>backlog for the various entities, was issued with an unmodified audit opinion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial statement of most entities audited for 2019, were timely and 
<br/>of good quality.  However, further improvements can be made to enhance the quality and timeliness 
<br/>of submission of the financial statements for OAG’s audit.  The Auditor-General had issued 11 audit 
<br/>opinions for statutory authorities out of which, three were related to 2016 Financial Statement, one 
<br/></span><span>related to 2017 Financial Statement, four related to 2018 Financial Statements and three were related 
<br/></span><span>to 2019 Financial Statement for the various entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted a few significant matters from the Statutory Authority Report which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>required necessary action from the relevant entities.  These included: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1245 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressing significant delays in submission of draft financial statement for audit; 
<br/>improving risk assessment processes to achieve Authorities objective and forming a clear basis 
<br/>for determining how risks are managed; and  
<br/>improving  overall  monitoring  of  the  entities  including  the  establishment  of  independent 
<br/>internal audit functions which would assist in identifying any gaps in control.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that some of the entities have resolved the audit issues that were raised 
<br/>during  the  time  of  audit,  while  some  are  working  towards  resolving  these  control  issues.    The 
<br/>Committee strongly recommends that immediate action is required by the respective entities in order 
<br/>to improve financial accountability.  It is also important to note that most of the entities are working 
<br/>towards achieving their contributions towards Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 
<br/>in line with the relevant SDG targets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee had conducted a thorough review in the two audit reports 
<br/>and also sought clarification from the 17 entities on the audit issues that were raised.  Given the audit 
<br/>findings and the responses received, the Committee recommends that the relevant entities listed in 
<br/>the two audit reports take note of the Committee’s recommendations highlighted and ensure its timely 
<br/>implementation.  The Committee recommends that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Private Limited to explore other revenue options.  
<br/>Currently they are on a very prime real estate and they had plans to expand the building to 
<br/>gain rental revenue.   
<br/>Fiji  Public  Trustee  Corporation  Limited  should  continue  to  decentralise  its  operation 
<br/>throughout Fiji to allow for ease of accessibility from the general public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>A  special  audit  be  conducted  on  the  operations  of  Fiji  Hardwood  Corporation  Private 
<br/>Limited.  The line ministry to conduct internal audit and should report to the line Minister.   
<br/>Fiji Servicemen’s Aftercare Fund to follow OMRS principles and strictly comply with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>A special audit to be conducted on the operations and finances of Sugar Industry Tribunal 
<br/>given that the gravity and high number of anomalies noted by the Auditor-General.  Again 
<br/>the Committee recommends that the internal audit from the Ministry of Economy should 
<br/>conduct this audit.     
<br/>The  Committee  notes  with  concern  the  delay  in  the  presentation  of  audited  financial 
<br/>statements of Sugar Industry Tribunal and strongly recommends that the Tribunal should 
<br/>prioritise on bringing its audited financial accounts up to-date with immediate effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  acknowledges  the  commitment  made  by  the  entities  to 
<br/>resolve the anomalies and those significant matters that were identified during the audit and measures 
<br/>that were put in place to ensure that they are addressed in a timely manner and are not repeated in 
<br/>future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, as the Member moving the motion, I thank you for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will just touch very briefly  on Fiji Hardwood 
<br/></span><span>Corporation Limited.  It says here, Mr. Speaker, that the company recorded plantation forest crop 
<br/></span><span>amounting to $213,320,000 320 as at December 2017.  I just ask if this could be clarified and to be 
<br/>verified because other commentators are saying that the total plantation in this country is in the tune 
<br/>of $5 billion.  This is what is believed to be there and as we know that we are always known to have 
<br/>the biggest talk of mature mahogany in the world.  So I am a little dismayed when I see this figure 
<br/></span><span>that is only $213 million in total, the plantation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>1246 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wonder if the Government would take the opportunity to verify this and reconcile what is 
<br/>out there in the market place where people say that the value of the plantation is in the tune of $5 
<br/>billion.  Of course, as originally intended, times would come when this plantation should be returned 
<br/>to the landowners and I believe the time is here now.  We hear that the debts have been paid off and 
<br/>we believe the time is now ripe for these plantations to be restored to the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  continuing  to  work  with  the  professional  organisations  to  harvest  and  process 
<br/>mahogany products to benefit the country, the landowners and everyone, I have always said that we 
<br/>can always setup manufacturing plants in Fiji and make Fiji mahogany a world product to be exported 
<br/>worldwide as we have this supply of raw materials.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to touch briefly on the Accident Compensation Commission of 
<br/>Fiji in the seven months that it was established.  It has Assets of $397,000 almost $400,000 that was 
<br/>in seven months.  I believe it is now in the millions and I just bring this up Mr. Speaker, Sir, because 
<br/>in the Economic Affairs Committee which I was part of for some years, when we used to scrutinise 
<br/>the Report of the Fiji Insurance Industry through the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF), we were always 
<br/>concerned about the insurance on vehicles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that in some countries a vehicle cannot be running on the road without insurance 
<br/>and we had recommended at one point that it should be made compulsory in Fiji that when you buy 
<br/>a vehicle you must secure/acquire insurance for it because Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a driver (we all drive 
<br/>vehicles) we will all feel more safer and more confident when we know that the other car is also 
<br/>insured. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If anything happens, immediately you are covered. Today, not everyone carries insurance for 
<br/>their cars and I believe that we have done this now. There used to be a third-party, we have now taken 
<br/>it away from the private companies and it is now government driven and it appears to be working 
<br/>well.  So, I think we should look at ways Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure that every vehicle on the road 
<br/>in Fiji is insured. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You go and buy an expensive car, say you buy $100,000 car, you are driving on the road a 
<br/>car valued at $5,000 can damage your car and he has no way that he can meet the repayment to repair 
<br/>your car - that is the reality of life in Fiji, it happened to me.  I have got an expensive car at that time 
<br/>and it got hit by a very old taxi and he could not pay for the repair and I was not carrying insurance 
<br/>at that time so I have learnt that I should carry insurance. So it should be made compulsory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The roads that we have in Fiji, the types of drivers that we have, I suggest that we look at this 
<br/>in the way that we have setup the Accident Compensation Commission Fiji (ACCF) 2017.  Those 
<br/>are my contribution Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Part A of the Report in dealing with 
<br/>2018-2019 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities 
<br/>and other Entities contain financial audits of seven entities for which the OAG had issued eight audit 
<br/>opinions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Five out of these eight audit opinions were related to the 2019 Financial Statements, two were 
<br/></span><span>of  backlog  audits  of  various  entities.    There  was  one  modified  opinion  for  the  2019  Financial 
<br/>Statements and two financial statements had the backlog for the various entities were issued with a 
<br/>modified opinion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG had issued an unmodified audit opinion on four of the 2019 Financial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that were audited for the various entities with one of the Financial Statements and the backlogs being 
<br/>issued with an unmodified audit opinion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned all that because what should be of some concern to us is that 
<br/>six out of these Financial Statements that were given, six or 86 percent of those entities are not subject 
<br/>to audit by the OAG.  Therefore their Financial Statements may not be according to international best 
<br/>practices or to the standard that they need to achieve particularly since they are funded by taxpayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reported that the financial statements of 
<br/>most of these audited entities were timely and generally of good quality however there is room for 
<br/>improvement  to  enhance  the  quality  and  timeliness  of  submission  of  financial  statements  for  the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part B:  Mr. Speaker, this part deals with the 2018/2019 Audit Reports on statutory authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which covered 11 entities for which the Office of the Auditor-General issued 11 audit opinions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For 2016 financial statements there were three audit opinions. In 2017 one audit opinion.  In 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2018 four audit opinions and for 2019 three audit opinions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  audits on the 2016 financial  year the Office  of the Auditor-General however issued a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disclaimer of opinion on three of the financial statements audited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2017 financial year his office issued an unmodified opinion on one financial statement 
<br/>and  for  2018  one  was  issued  with  a  modified  opinion  while  three  were  issued  with  unmodified 
<br/>opinions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the 2019 financial year the Office of the Auditor-General issued an unmodified opinion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on all three financial statements of the various entities that were audited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On these 11 entities, the Auditor-General has highlighted that control and non-compliance 
<br/>issues were categorised from medium to high risk. These weaknesses that were from medium to high 
<br/>risk were of fundamental importance to the statutory authority and the office noted that it required 
<br/>immediate  attention  although  this  report  is  three  years  old,  Mr.  Speaker.  Those  charged  with 
<br/>governance in these statutory authorities together with oversight from their line Ministry must take 
<br/>note and apply urgent necessary action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  the  Audit  Report  also  highlighted  other  areas  that  required  immediate 
<br/>management  action  for  resolution  on  these  issues  which  were  addressing  significant  delays  in 
<br/>submission of draft financial statements for audit, improving risk assessment processes to achieve 
<br/>authorities’ objectives to form a clear basis for determining how risks are managed and improving 
<br/>overall monitoring of the entities including the establishment of independent, internal audit functions 
<br/>to assist in identifying any gaps and controls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  view  of  the  above,  Mr.  Speaker,  scrutiny  by  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  is  key  in 
<br/>reviewing  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  reports  to 
<br/></span><span>Parliament is  crucial to  ensure that governance and compliance to  international  best  practices are 
<br/></span><span>adhered to and therefore, there must be accountability to Parliament and Government for the funding 
<br/>provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, what should be of concern to all of us is that under the current legislative 
<br/></span><span>framework auditing of entities for which the Office of the Auditor-General is not the external auditor 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is not reported to Parliament which means Parliament by virtue of the fact that they approve of these 
<br/>entities’ budget but not holding them accountable is not being responsible in my view, especially in 
<br/>this  post  COVID  world.    These  entities  must  be  given  the  opportunity  to  be  accountable  to  the 
<br/>taxpayers’ hard-earned money which is not followed up on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the Committee’s Recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That  FBC  explores  other  revenue  options  such  as  investing  in  a  state  development  and 
<br/>concurring with the Office of the Auditor-General recommendation; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>That the management of FBC reviews the accrual and determine whether it was appropriate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to continue the accrual as a liability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  Recommendation  No.  2,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  agree  that  the  Fiji  Public  Trustee 
<br/>Corporation Limited should continue to decentralise its operations throughout Fiji to give people in 
<br/>the urban, rural and remote areas an opportunity to be accessible to their services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Recommendation No. 3, Mr. Speaker, I agree that a follow-up audit be conducted on the 
<br/>operations of Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited, they really need a lot of help, according to this 
<br/>OAG Report. Sir, very lose control, issues with inadequate cash flow, both the financing facilities 
<br/>which are the FNPF and FDB are under stress with repayment arrears and penalty interest charged 
<br/>on both accounts.  They are noted here, poor recording of stock movement, did not record the number 
<br/>of logs moving in and out of the yard leaving them open to theft and pilferage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this audit, Mr. Speaker, it was noted that the mahogany that was harvested in 2017 
<br/>and 2018 had not been replanted to maintain the sustainability of the mahogany plantation as required 
<br/>under the licencing arrangement under the Mahogany Act 2010.  On the date of audit opinion, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  which  was  22</span><span>nd</span><span>  July,  2020  -  approximately  5,000  one-year-old  mahogany  plants,  the 
<br/>estimated value was $500,000, were ready for planting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, due to constraints with cash flow, it is stated here that the company could not carry 
<br/>out  the  reforestation  process  of  mahogany  plants.    So,  that  was  wasted,  Mr.  Speaker.  So,  the 
<br/>recommendation with a follow-up audit to be conducted on the operations of FHCL, the potential to 
<br/>be  a  multimillion-dollar  industry  but  may  be  according  to  honourable  Gavoka,  a  billion-dollar 
<br/>industry is a timely one, the recommendation and they just need to drastically overhaul the whole 
<br/>operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the recommendation for the Fiji Servicemen’s Aftercare Fund 
<br/>which is a fund financially assisting so many people who have served our country and their families. 
<br/>However, internal  controls  and proper maintenance of beneficiary records and proper preparation 
<br/>and checking of salaries and cash at bank reconciliations were generally, Mr. Speaker, found to be 
<br/>very weak.  Double payments to beneficiaries, according to the Report.  Overpayments, unauthorised 
<br/>deposit of allowances into third party bank accounts just added to the problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are so many issues, Mr. Speaker.  Therefore, PAC’s recommendation to resolve the 
<br/>many  unresolved  matters  states  that  the  Fund  does  not  have  an  established  governance  and 
<br/>accountability function to drive the Risk Management Framework, besides also recommending that 
<br/>the Fiji Servicemen’s Aftercare Fund is to follow the OMRS principle and strictly comply with it.  I 
<br/>support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  make  a  contribution  to  this  debate.  
<br/>Firstly, I convey my appreciation to the Committee and the Chairman for thoroughly scrutinising the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  I just would like to emphasise on the two entities that fall under my ambit portfolio – the 
<br/>Sugar Industry Tribunal and the Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) in 
<br/>Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Sugar Industry Tribunal’s 2016 Financial Statements, some of the key findings from 
<br/>the audit of the Tribunal included the absence of a strategic plan, the disaster recovery plan, risk 
<br/>management policy, human resources policy, IT security policy, environmental controls and code of 
<br/>conduct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG,  Mr.  Speaker,  also  raised  that  the  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal  had  not  submitted 
<br/>Financial Statements from 2017 to 2019.  I am pleased to report, Mr. Speaker, that in this august 
<br/>House,  that  Financial  Statements  from  2017  to  2020  were  submitted  to  the  OAG  and  it  is  my 
<br/>understanding that the audit is currently underway.  Other issues such as the strategic and business 
<br/>plans and various policies have been progressively completed and will be submitted to the OAG.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issue  of  non-existence  of  a  service-level  agreement,  Mr.  Speaker,  regarding  the 
<br/>outsourcing of the IT function of the Fiji Sugar Corporation, the Sugar Industry Tribunal has recently 
<br/>finalised a draft service-level agreement to safeguard and protect the interests of the Tribunal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Centre for Appropriate Technology and Development (CATD) at 
<br/>Nadave, there were various audit concerns raised which have been addressed by CATD.  The Centre 
<br/>is ensured that policies for registration and timeline for payment of fees are developed to guide the 
<br/>recognition of revenue and receivables and that invoices are issued in sequence to all students upon 
<br/>completion of registration and of course, retained for records and audit verification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  anomalies  in  the  VAT  receivables  which  highlighted  the  variance  of  $158,421 
<br/>between  the  VAT  receivables  balance  as  per  the  general  ledger  and  the  assessments  as  per  the 
<br/>statement of VAT account, the Centre has liaised with Fiji Revenue Customs Services (FRCS) to 
<br/>rectify the variance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I rise as a Member of the Public Accounts Committee to make a 
<br/>brief  contribution on this motion which is the Review of the Consolidated Accounts for Government 
<br/>Commercial  Companies,  Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  and  other  Entities  on  the  2018-2019 
<br/>Audit Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just start by saying that the entities that are reported in this report are 
<br/></span><span>reported on different financial periods.  Some are reported in 2019, some are reported in 2018 and 
<br/>some are even reported  in  2017.  So when these reports are prepared  and have been late in  their 
<br/>submission,  a  lot  of  missed  opportunity  can  be  said  to  have  been  bypass  by  these  entities.    The 
<br/>shareholders also, in this case the Government and potential investors of the entity being reported 
<br/>here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we commend Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) and Fiji Development Bank (FDB) 
<br/>for being on time as usual with their reporting to Parliament.  Maybe the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Economy can inform this august House  when  Energy Fiji Limited have been compliant with its 
<br/></span><span>reporting requirements, why did he want to change its audit from the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>to now a private entity.  Maybe, this should be the perfect opportunity for the honourable Minister to 
<br/>inform  Parliament because as it is, they are already in  strict compliant to the requirements of the 
<br/>Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot overlook the continue delays in the submission of the audit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>1250 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reports by these entities which the Office of the Auditor-General has highlighted, to have been due 
<br/>to  delay  submissions  in  draft  financial  accounts  or  incomplete  draft  financial  accounts  being 
<br/>submitted to the Auditor-General.  Entities deciding to address issues raised in draft audit reports and 
<br/>re-submission of financial statements for audit and financial statements not submitted at all for audit 
<br/>purposes, despite several reminders from the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to say that on the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee in number 
<br/>one,  I  would  like  to  state  that  probably  the  secretariat  of  the  Committee  could  perhaps,  confirm 
<br/>whether this recommendation was made in terms of real estate development because I would like to 
<br/>enquire what this recommendation has in terms of core business or in relation to the Fiji Broadcasting 
<br/>Commission (FBC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to implore the line Ministers to 
<br/>take  corrective  measures  and  take  on  board  the  Auditor-General  and  the  Committee’s 
<br/>recommendations so that they improve in their reporting timeline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other recommendation has already been alluded by honourable Members on this side of 
<br/>the  House,  Sir.    Perhaps,  a  follow-up  audit  needs  to  be  undertaken  on  a  timely  basis  so  that 
<br/>information can be discussed in a timely manner in this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the importance of addressing issues of audit as and when they arise 
<br/>and reiterate, my call for the OAG is for them to continue to be the ears and eyes, not only of the 
<br/>Government  but  our  people  with  respect  to  good  governance  and  compliance  to  service  delivery 
<br/>requirements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To end my brief contribution, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our civil servants 
<br/>and  members  of  the  Government  Commercial  Companies,  Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  and 
<br/>other entities who have participated in the facilitation of the information in the OAG Report. The 
<br/>work of these Officials carried out on behalf of the Government and our people is notably a mammoth 
<br/>task.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst there would be continuous guidance from this august House for the improvement in 
<br/>their service delivery and their compliance to good governance principle, they must be acknowledged 
<br/>for the big role that they play in advancing the common interest of our people, of our nation and our 
<br/>related stakeholder. Thank you very much.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to highlight only a few matters in this 
<br/>Report  of  the  Auditor-General  because  many  of  the  key  issues  about  the  accountability  of  these 
<br/>Government companies and the other bodies actually require closer analysis that we can talk about 
<br/>in  this  august  House.  The  question  is,  what  is  the  big  picture  on  the  accountability  of  these 
<br/>Government entities?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually right there in the Executive Summary of the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report and as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2020, seven of these government entities had their audits up-to-
<br/>date but 15 of those entities did not.  In order words, Sir, only one-third of Government entities are 
<br/></span><span>properly and financially accountable and two-thirds of them are not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what does the Auditor-General summary say?  It is right there in black and 
<br/>white and I want to quote.  It says the following, “Audit of 13 Government commercial companies, 
<br/></span><span>one Commercial statutory authority and one recognised entity were delayed. The delay in the audit 
<br/></span><span>is primarily due to the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1251 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Delay  in  submission  of  draft  accounts  for  audits  or  draft  accounts  submitted  were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>incomplete; 
<br/>Entities deciding to address issues raised in the draft audit reports and the resubmission of 
<br/>financial statements of audit; and  
<br/>Financial statements not submitted for Audit at all, despite the reminders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  this  tells  us  is  that,  the  state  of  the  Government  accountability  is 
<br/>lurking.  The non-compliant entities do not appear to understand how to be accountable or why they 
<br/>are accountable or uncountable.  First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the point that preparing timely annual 
<br/>accounts is important to the entity itself and understanding your financial position as you go is critical 
<br/>for decision making for the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The work of the Auditor-General is important because they impose an independent reality 
<br/>check on the accounts. That is the idea. No private sector business would wait for months, two or 
<br/>three  years  for  the  audited  account  to  be  presented.  They  know  that  if  it  is  delayed  by  then,  the 
<br/>information they contain is actually useless.  Everything has moved on but these Government entities 
<br/>do not seem to understand this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is not just about accountability to the taxpayers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is about ensuring 
<br/>that they actually understand their own strategic position or direction;  the same way as the private 
<br/>sector  business  would  do  in  the  world.    The  whole  point  about  these  Government  entities  being 
<br/>separate from Government, having their own boards and their own management is that, they operate 
<br/>in  the way private sector companies do, so they  can be efficient and make the best  use of public 
<br/>funds.    But  they  cannot  do  that  when  they  do  not  even  know  their  own  financial  state  and 
<br/>understanding your accounts three years after the balance date means you do not know where you 
<br/>are going - it is pretty clear.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, look at the shocking state of these audits - Viti Corporation is still auditing 
<br/>accounts for 2008 to 2011; the Yaqara Pastoral Corporation is still finalising accounts for 2016 and 
<br/>2017;  Food Processors Fiji is still auditing accounts for 2009 to 2013; Fiji Hardwood Corporation is 
<br/>still doing its 2017 accounts.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this one is particularly shocking because the Auditor-
<br/>General later in his report says “that FHCL cannot continue as a going concern” (that is serious) in 
<br/>other words he is saying that FHCL is heading for bankruptcy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what the Auditor-General is saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is in the report. Why is this 
<br/></span><span>particularly concerning?  Because we are talking about  a plantation or forest  of mahogany  worth 
<br/></span><span>about $200 million.  That is why it is important.  This should be providing Fiji with a whole new 
<br/>industry of timber exports and value added products. Instead it drifts in the doldrums without strategic 
<br/>direction.  This Government has had 15 years to fix it and they are saying that the Auditor-General 
<br/>is  wrong  and  as  usual  nothing  has  been  done.    The  report  is  quite  glaring,  I  would  say  from  the 
<br/>Auditor-General to actually point that out, but we go on, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Authority is still trying to finalise its 2018 accounts.  Here we have a body that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>critically important for putting Fiji citizens into their own homes - thousands of families … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Fijian citizens; how about you say Fijian. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a useless interjection from …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not useless.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Sometimes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the noise coming from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the other side is like chickens about to lay eggs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And it cannot even get its accounts right from four years ago.  They go around the country 
<br/>and they have been saying this in the last two elections.  One Minister went around the country before 
<br/>the 2018 Election and said “put numbers on the houses” and people are still waiting for leases and 
<br/>relocations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is your problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is not my problem, it should be your problem because that

<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  what  this  Government  has  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promising.

<br/></span><span>Walesi</span><span> before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the big talk, all the social media post about bringing Fiji into the 
<br/>digital age.  But what has it cost?  And how has this money been spent?  Remember, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  this  is  the  company  that  all  television  stations  are  forced  by  the  Government  to  use  their 
<br/>transmissions (they were actually forced). This company has had more than $50 million in taxpayers’ 
<br/>money.  But since it started in 2015 we have seen no accounts, where is the accountability?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Who wrote that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We have been told that the  accounts up to 2017 would be 
<br/></span><span>released soon but, Mr. Speaker, nothing.  What is  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> doing?  Why can it not be transparent?  
<br/></span><span>These are legitimate questions, Mr. Speaker.  Why can it not tell us how it has spent the money?  I 
<br/>mean, simple.  That is what they do not understand, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all remember the public fight, Mr. Speaker, between </span><span>Walesi</span><span> and the Auditor-General, it 
<br/></span><span>is out there.  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> tried to blame the Auditor-General on why its accounts were not finalised.  I

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mean,  you  are  the  entity,  you  are  the  company,  and  you  blame  the  Auditor-General  why  your 
<br/>accounts were not finalised?  The next thing we know, Mr. Speaker, after all that public debate that 
<br/>we are going to have a commission of inquiry into the Auditor-General, and the rest is history.  The 
<br/>Auditor-General has left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just raise one more point coming from this Report, Mr. Speaker, and this concerns the 
<br/>disorganised  approach  of  Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL)  to  rural  electrification  which  has  been 
<br/>highlighted  by  the  Auditor-General.    Specifically,  the  Auditor-General’s  Report  said  that  the 
<br/>Government gave nearly $29 million in grants to EFL for rural electrification in 2019.  It is not clear 
<br/>from the Report what year these grants are meant to cover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report notes, Mr. Speaker, that EFL was able to commission less than $100,000 worth 
<br/>of rural electrification over the years 2000 and 2019.  This is what the Auditor-General says, and that 
<br/>is a shocking figure, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What is happening to rural electrification?  Why is it not a 
<br/>priority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, the people of Fiji, are supposed to have our own electricity company.  This company, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, should operate at  a profit  –  supply  power reliably but  also,  develop  power supplies 
<br/>where it is needed, such as in the rural areas.  Instead, Mr. Speaker, what has happened, Government 
<br/>has sold off 44 percent of EFL to a Japanese investor because it needed money.  I mean, $400 million, 
<br/>$200  million  of  that  went  back  to  FNPF  and  $200  million  went  to  Government.    Now,  EFL  is 
<br/>focussed on profits, so it can pay dividends.  What that means, Mr. Speaker, is that EFL will begin 
<br/>to lose focus on its social responsibilities - the services that the people need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, this is a report by the IFC and it says this about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the profitability of SOEs and I want to quote this: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“According to a 2019 sector assessment conducted by the Asian Development Bank 
<br/>(ADB), the contribution  of SOEs to Fiji’s GDP in 2019 was only 4 percent, while they 
<br/>control an estimated 12-17 percent of the country’s economic assets. Not surprisingly, the 
<br/>financial  performance  of  Fiji’s  SOEs  has  historically  been  below  the  government’s 
<br/>expectations,  and  they  generally  continue  to  be.    The  profitability  of  Fiji’s  SOEs  has 
<br/>improved noticeably from a return on equity (ROE) of -0.2 percent and a return on assets 
<br/>(ROA) of 0.0 percent in 2002-2010 to a ROE of 9.9 percent and a ROA of 4.3 percent in 
<br/>2015-2018.    However,  this  performance  improvement  is  largely  due  to  increased 
<br/></span><span>profitability  of  a  few  SOEs  (e.g.,  Energy  Fiji  Limited,  Fiji  Airways,  Fiji  Development 
<br/></span><span>Bank,  Fiji  Airports  Limited).    The  performance  of  most  other  SOEs  (e.g.,  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation) remains remarkably low.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was observed by the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, what I want to say is, the lack of availability of financial reports 
<br/>of two-thirds of the entities that were covered by the Auditor-General, and the link to the profitability 
<br/>and  the  contribution  of  these  entities  to  the  overall  GDP,  Mr.  Speaker,  remains  low.    So,  this 
<br/>Government’s claim is actually quite hollow that over the last so many years, they have reformed the 
<br/></span><span>SOEs and that we are on a trajectory to creating a much better contribution to GDP and increasing 
<br/></span><span>the profitability or the returns from equity and assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  very  important  that  the  OAG  is  supported,  aided  and  it  is  the 
<br/></span><span>responsibility  of  the  Government  and  the  Ministers  responsible  for  those  entities,  to  ensure  that 
<br/></span><span>financial statements are provided on a timely basis so that the Auditor-General can have a look and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we, in Parliament, are able to scrutinise those - then only can we look forward to a better contribution

<br/>but on creating employment and providing the services that people need in this country.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.36 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will continue with the agenda item.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to make a brief contribution on the Fiji National 
<br/>Sports Commission and the Fiji Sports Council’s Report 2018/2019.  At the outset, it looks like that 
<br/>the  former  Auditor-General  loved  his  headlines  in  the  newspaper  and  I  am  aware  of  many  cases 
<br/>where despite providing all information, he went on to highlight things that were not true.  One such 
<br/>case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the new Rakiraki Municipal Market and I will leave it at that and only 
<br/>time will tell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I move to deliberate on the report proper, allow me to briefly sum up the Commission 
<br/>and this annual report within great sporting achievements that have brought fame and glory to Fiji in 
<br/>the recent times.  As the honourable Prime Minister highlighted in a recent address during the Annual 
<br/>Fiji Sports Commission’s Conference on Community Sports, Mr. Speaker, Sir, sports in Fiji have 
<br/>taken on a turn for greater heights under the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me state some facts: We have won two Olympic gold medals - Rio 2016 
<br/>and Tokyo 2020, along with the great effort by the Fijiana Women for a Tokyo Olympic bronze.  The 
<br/>Fijiana Women Sevens Team is now a world force to be reckoned with and the day is not too far 
<br/>from when they will match the men with World Cup Olympics, Commonwealth glory in their sights.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list goes on in sporting achievements under the FijiFirst Government.  We have 
<br/>won gold in the Paralympics.  This goes along with competition in football in the Rio Olympics and 
<br/>at the Under 23 World Cup.  Along with this, we have seen a rise in world class performance in sports 
<br/>like weightlifting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  achievements  highlight  what  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  was 
<br/>referring to  in  his  speech at  the Conference.  To add on, the Fijiana Drua Women’s Side created 
<br/>sporting history with their win in the Super Rugby Women’s Competition by beating the four-time 
<br/>champions.  On this note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must clarify some recent false commentary on their 
<br/>return to our shores last Sunday.  Some elements have jumped the gun in stating that the Fijiana Drua 
<br/>were not accorded the welcome they deserve upon their return.  This is not true, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Unfortunately this kind of misinformation is based on a lack of fact-checking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the CEO of Fiji Rugby Union has confirmed to me that 
<br/>not only they were received by him and the senior executives at the airport, but the team and the 
<br/>management  were  given  a  traditional  welcome  in  Veiseisei,  followed  by  a  church  service  and 
<br/>thanksgiving dinner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  further  programmes  have  been  planned  which  will  coincide  with  the 
<br/>upcoming match for the Fijian Drua men’s side in  Lautoka.  So let me assure this House and the 
<br/>people of Fiji that there are no double standards in play, as some have assumed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir we will continue to ensure that the women’s teams are given all the glory 
<br/></span><span>that they deserve as we have done in the past when we honoured returning athletes and teams, both 
<br/>women and men.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir let me now turn to the Fiji National Sports Commission’s 2018-2019 Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  The Fiji National Sports Commission focuses to reconstruct the delivery of sport and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>1256 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recreation in support of building an active nation that improves and enriches the lives of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Sports, as we have outlined in numerous forums and in previous speeches 
<br/>in this august House, unifies all Fijians, and has become an important component of Fiji’s economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the women and men’s teams have a new age approach now to a commercial 
<br/>setup to set up the basis of a market-based development model for sports and it is a model that the 
<br/>Ministry and the Fiji National Sports Commission (FNSC) will push for adoption in other sports, at 
<br/>the elite level especially Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The trickle-down benefits from this kind of investment 
<br/>and market-based setup will be huge from the development of sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Sports Commission was setup to establish higher standards 
<br/>of excellence in all sports delivery systems within Fiji and may I add to that Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>they have played an integral role in the Fiji sporting success story. Along with the national sporting 
<br/>bodies and umbrella organizations like Fiji Association of Sports and National Olympic Committee 
<br/>(FASANOC) as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sports Commissions has continued to have a very proactive role in sports development 
<br/>throughout  the  country.  Through  their  new  development  Programmes,  the  Train  and  the  Trainer 
<br/>Programme  has  seen  the  establishment  of  rural  and  urban  sports  associations  representing  their 
<br/>communities. This has been made possible by conducting the community level training for members 
<br/>in coaching, refereeing and administration across a number of sports, thus seeing the growth in clubs 
<br/>many now registered with the National Sports Organizations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend their efforts in upskilling of training for sports.  Leaders in both urban and rural 
<br/>communities mean that sports people can continue to train wherever they are and everyone’s talent 
<br/>in sports is accepted wherever they move to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission recently celebrated 10 years since its establishment by the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government.    This  was  a  project  that  misfired  and  was  never  realized  by  the  previous 
<br/>governments although talk of a national sports commission predates our independence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the Annual Report 2018-2019, I note satisfactory responses provided by the Fiji 
<br/>National Sports Council (FNSC) and the Fiji Sports Council to the Standing Committee on Public 
<br/>Accounts on areas of concern. These include improvements and changes to policies and HR issues 
<br/></span><span>that were highlighted in the Annual Report. I am satisfied that moving on, the FNSC and the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Sports Council will not have issues in these areas any more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an accountable government funded body, the FNSC and the Fiji Sports Council ensure 
<br/>that it has in place the mechanism and capacity to use these funds in an accountable, transparent, and 
<br/>sustainable manner.  From the Report Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the success stories around us in sports, I 
<br/>am pleased to report that they can do this with a vision for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key areas that the FNSC and the Ministry will 
<br/>work on is to provide the pathways in after sports for our athletes.  This is an important area that we 
<br/></span><span>must manage well, as more and more Fijians take the elites sporting pathways.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir we have seen and known from some of the stories from our sporting legends, 
<br/>life after sports can be tougher than life on the playing field.  Therefore, we must all work together 
<br/></span><span>in improving the safety net we provide for our sportspeople.  We will work closely with the FNSC, 
<br/></span><span>the national sporting bodies and international partners to develop this plan.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1257 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all matters raised in the report for the Fiji Sports Council have been resolved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Now,  I  will  speak  on  two  areas  –  first  is  Fiji  Hardwood 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Corporation Limited and second, Energy Fiji Limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited, there is a lack of internal control of a non-preparation 
<br/>of reconciliation into inventory of logs, aids receivables by the end of 2017.  We are talking about 
<br/>the Annual Report 2017.  If it is rectified by now fine but why it happened?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So it is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to let people do what they are supposed to do and also 
<br/>the fixed assets register was not properly maintained during 2017 to support the written down values 
<br/>and the annual board of survey to verify the movements in property, plant and equipment during the 
<br/>year.  It is also important to hold the Board of Survey each year.  We notice that in most cases the 
<br/>Ministry does not hold a Board of Survey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the independent verify and the net present value of the plantation increased by 8.37 million 
<br/>by 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2002. It was not practicable for the Office of the Auditor-General to determine the 
<br/>correct valuation of forests as at recorded in the Books of Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited as at 
<br/>the end of 2017. So it is important to have an up-to-date valuation of the plantation of mahogany here 
<br/>in Fiji particularly when we have the best plantation here in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very interesting to have good real assessment of the value of the stock of mahogany that 
<br/>we do have here in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While we do that, because we are still asking the questions: 
<br/>why have the productions gone down since 2009 - from 93,000 cubic metres down to 70,000 cubic 
<br/>metres, 50,000 cubic metres, 30,000 cubic metres right down to 2,600 cubic metres in 2017 and then 
<br/>up again to 11,000 cubic metres, then 16,000 cubic metres in 2018 but all still below 20,000 cubic 
<br/>metres?  It is far below the sustainable harvest production volume of around 80,000 cubic metres a 
<br/>year  (less  than  20,000  cubic  metres  is  very  low).    Why  have  we  stuck  below  $20,000  harvest 
<br/>production for all these years?  You can blame the COVID-19 but before 2019 no land was taken 
<br/>back. Be careful of your facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The area under mahogany is still the same from the beginning until now.  No land has been 
<br/>taken  back.  You  go  and  check.    It  is  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  increase  that  production 
<br/>particularly when the sustainable production predicted is  80,000 cubic metres.  That  has  dropped 
<br/></span><span>from 150,000 cubic metres down to 112,000 cubic metres then to 80,000 cubic metres. I do not know 
<br/></span><span>who was doing the assessment, who wants to be the expert doing the assessment but they keep on 
<br/>dropping until 80,000 cubic metres but 80,000 cubic metres, Mr. Speaker, Sir, still cannot be achieved 
<br/>by the board or by the Mahogany Industry Council or by the Fiji Hardwood Corporation who is the 
<br/>commercial company for Government to harvest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, under the Decree, that should only be the grower, not the harvester.  So, it is important, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to have a real value of the mahogany plantations as we have here in Fiji.  However, 
<br/>it is important that we need to revert this to the landowners themselves, just as for pine.  It is good 
<br/>that now we have a profitable Fiji Pine Limited but that was planned from previous Governments, 
<br/></span><span>only for FijiFirst Party to reap the benefits now, having profits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to do that similar thing with mahogany.  Let the landowners 
<br/>own that industry  or  business but  it is  important.   We are going to  do it after this  Election.   It  is 
<br/></span><span>important  to  ensure  that  the  industry  or  the  business  is  owned  by  Fiji  pine  landowners  or  the 
<br/></span><span>mahogany  landowners.    Let  the  experts  run  it,  just  as  we  have  the  similar  principle  with  Fijian 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>1258 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Holdings.  Let the experts run it.  That is what we have to do, but we have not done it.  After Election 
<br/>this year, we are going to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another capital structure for Fiji Pine Commission by 2025.  We will make sure that by 2025, 
<br/>the  industry  or  business  is  under  the  pine  landowners.    Also,  for  our  mahogany  landowners,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it is important that we do the same, but we must make sure that it becomes profitable.  
<br/>At the moment, we do not know whether it is profitable or not.  Although we know that they have 
<br/>paid off the Government guaranteed debt of $26 million, but we do not have any report here to see 
<br/>their profitability over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also important to ask the question, where has the Sustainable Mahogany Industry (SMI) 
<br/>gone to?  This was one of the biggest buyers of Grades 1 and 2 mahogany in Fiji.  The guitar – the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister was holding a guitar at that time, now where is it?  It is gone.  Why have 
<br/>they left Fiji?  These are the questions that we need answers to.  Why has the Mahogany Industry 
<br/>Council or Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL) replaced a big buyer like that, to continue 
<br/>the production and harvesting of mahogany in Fiji? Those are the questions that they need to answer 
<br/>and we are going to answer that after the Election, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not to keep going down or below 20,000 
<br/>cubic metres, we need to increase it.  It is amazing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Also on pricing, how is the 
<br/>pricing being pegged?  Not many people are buying mahogany logs because they are too expensive.  
<br/>They are very expensive.  It is important to review that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   We had  brought in a 
<br/>Parliamentary petition to inquire into all these but it was not allowed.  It is important to dig deeply 
<br/>into the operations of FHCL and the Mahogany Industry Council in order to improve the harvest and 
<br/>the performance in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our main concern is to improve because the more we improve, the better it is 
<br/>for everyone else and the nation and in particular, the landowners themselves.  We must ensure that 
<br/>the maximum benefits go right to the landowners themselves.  Where is the timber sales proceeds, 
<br/>under the Act, that was supposed to be paid to the landowners?  Up to now, no single cent has been 
<br/>paid for the timber sales proceeds.  No single cent has been paid!  The Government guarantee of $26 
<br/>million has been paid, which is alright, but what about the timber sales proceeds?  Nothing to date, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The stumpage, as we can read here, we do not know where they paid the stumpage amounting 
<br/></span><span>to  $15,200  to  because their trade payables documents  were not  there.   It is  important  to  increase 
<br/></span><span>production so that we can also increase the stumpage that goes to the landowners and it is only proper 
<br/>to keep good records to actually identify what stumpage goes to which </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or landowning unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  have  a  good  look  at  the  FHCL’s  operations  and  the 
<br/>Mahogany  Industry  Council  because  we  have  the  Chairman  here,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>himself,  and  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  who  is  a  member,  so  make  it  profitable  and 
<br/>everyone will be happy, particularly the landowners themselves.  They have not been paid any timber 
<br/>sales proceeds to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will go on to Energy Fiji Limited (EFL), Sir, particularly on the recommendation where it 
<br/></span><span>ensures  that  the  entire  production  have  access  to  electricity  by  2021.    It  is  a  20  year  National 
<br/>Development Plan (NDP) from 2017 to 2036.  It is important to get the electricity to the rural areas, 
<br/>particularly in the Wainunu area. There are various sources for hydro or solar, some of the villages 
<br/></span><span>have solar.  A lot of villages still have diesel but there is a hydro there that has been proven feasible 
<br/></span><span>in Nuku, Wainunu and supported by honourable Sigarara from the FijiFirst Party.  It is important to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1259 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have that hydro scheme working which has been proven feasible and the Water Authority of Fiji have 
<br/>studied it for three to five years and have approved it, but today nothing has been done.  That can 
<br/>supply electricity to Wainunu, Kubulau, Wailevu, Dreketi, Lekutu, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to generate our own fuel for the future as we have increasing 
<br/>prices of fuel as imported from offshore, particularly in Vanualevu, they  still have diesel there.  They 
<br/>have biomass  here in  Nadroga,  contributing more energy to  the EFL but  we need biomass  too  in 
<br/>Vanualevu.  The hydro, biomass and solar, we need to increase the production of energy into  our 
<br/>rural areas, but I think it is too late for FijiFirst now, the new government is going to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I give the floor to the next speaker, I have 
<br/>rearranged the speaking order as I had additions to that.  So, the next speaker will be the honourable 
<br/>Simione Rasova; followed by the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Trasport; 
<br/>then  honourable  Jese  Saukuru,  honourable  Mikaele  Leawere,  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources; and the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General.  Please, take note of that order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee on the Review of the 2018-2019 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies, 
<br/>Commercial Statutory Authorities and other Entities and the 2018-2019 Audit Report of Statutory 
<br/>Authorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that most of these companies are in Viti Levu, I would like to stand because of my 
<br/>representative in Parliament through the Eastern Division from Kadavu, Lomaiviti, Lau, Rotuma and 
<br/>most of these companies here do not  really  relate to  all of these, except  some of the  commercial 
<br/>companies.  I think most of the people out there maybe, the people who are here.  You may not be 
<br/>really aware, it took me almost four years to understand all these Government commercial companies 
<br/>and the commercial statutory authorities and the statutory authorities until to date.  Regarding the Fiji 
<br/>Broadcasting Commission, that is Government Commercial Company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Fiji Broadcasting Corporation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Yes,  Fiji  Broadcasting  Corporation.  Also,  Fiji  Public  Trustee 
<br/>Corporation and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited.  If you are saying that we do know, what about 
<br/>the public that are listening, they would not even know. And I know that half of the people are out 
<br/></span><span>there that do not  even know anything that is  noted here.  I would like to  thank all the Committee 
<br/></span><span>Members, the Chairman, the Deputy Chairperson, Hon. Joseph Nand and Hon. Vijendra Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  the  Committee  Members  over  here,  Hon.  Aseri  Masivou  Radrodro  and  Hon.  Ro 
<br/>Teimumu Kepa have spoken on this review of the Budget.  I hope that both of the Members; Hon. 
<br/>Joseph Nand and Hon. Vijendra Lal should also speak on this because you people are the ones that 
<br/>scrutinised Standing Order 110 and you should be the one telling the people of Fiji on what you did 
<br/>on this report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the House when they try to debate on the review 
<br/></span><span>of this Committee and also the Report on the Auditor-General, we seem to be bringing in what we 
<br/></span><span>know and what we read. Yet, the other side of the House is always against any positive criticism

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I am telling you the truth and that is why I am telling you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You do not speak the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Now, they are controlling what the truth is and just today, they said 
<br/>he is a liar. Now they are controlling who is going to say the lie and who is going to tell the truth. 
<br/>That is what they do, honourable Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, we do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You have  to accept what we say. This is the loyal Opposition. You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should accept this because this is a positive criticism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Loyal to who?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- We are loyal to, Mr. Speaker.  He was the Chief Guest at the Auditor-
<br/>General’s function and you were the one that was against the Auditor-General. That is what you are 
<br/>saying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, you have to control  who is telling the truth and who is 
<br/>telling the lie.  But anyway, this is from my side.  As a citizen of this country, as a loyal Member of 
<br/>this Opposition, we always try and tell the truth. A positive criticism, honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/>Accept it, so that we could move this country forward. We are talking about the debts and here we 
<br/>are having statutory bodies and I never knew about this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not go to workshops anymore and there is a limited people that go to the workshops. 
<br/>That is what this Government is doing.  I mean we have 51 Members and we are supposed to be one 
<br/>to  get  this  country in  order,  get  the debts  down,  and  get  the machinery from  overseas  in  a better 
<br/>motion to go forward.  The honourable Attorney-General always wants us to be like Singapore. Okay, 
<br/>let us work together in a bipartisan and move this country forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  they  are  saying  here  that  the  Government  Commercial  Companies  and  Commercial 
<br/>Statutory  Bodies.  There  are  seven;    Fiji  Broadcasting  Corporation    Limited,  Fiji  Public  Trustees 
<br/>Corporation, Fiji Hardwood Corporation, Fiji Rice, Energy Fiji Limited and Fiji Development Bank. 
<br/>These are the Statutory Companies. Eleven Statutory Authorities, people do not know about these 
<br/></span><span>companies. Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC), Fiji Services Aftercare Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are not interested because they do not know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are only three of you that are Members of this Committee. That is the Chairman, who 
<br/>is always touring around with the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and also 
<br/>Hon. Vijendra Lal and Hon. Joseph Nand. You people are supposed to come here and speak on this. 
<br/>This is your Report and when I am talking about the report, you are saying you are against it. You 
<br/></span><span>have all the excuses. Now the Consumer Council of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Oh my god!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Alright.  The  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal,  Accident  Compensation 
<br/></span><span>Commission and Fiji Sports Commission and mind you, honourable Minister for Sports, you have to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>distinguish Fiji Rugby Limited and the Fijian Drua as two different entities, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Firstly, 
<br/>the Fijian Dura is owned by Counter Ruck PTE Limited (CRL) and Fiji Rugby Union owns the Flying 
<br/>Fijians; the honourable Minister should know his ministerial portfolio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  Investment  Fiji,  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  Fiji  Sports  Council  and  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Authority of Fiji – we approved Bill No. 17 and the next day they approved a loan of about $160 
<br/>million  from  ANZ  and  the  Centre  for  Appropriate  Technology  which  is  overseas.    These  are 
<br/>companies that we always hear about publicly but this is probably the third time of all time it has 
<br/>been presented in Parliament for debate.  I hope that all honourable Members of Parliament take heed 
<br/>of these things as it is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once we have positive criticism on the debate, it will do good for the honourable Minister 
<br/>responsible, also the honourable Prime Minister and all the Ministers.  And yet, this report has come 
<br/>three  years  late  to  Parliament  and  the  insubordination  of  its  Permanent  Secretaries  and  Ministers 
<br/>according to the Decree amended by the honourable Prime Minister on 1</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2010. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- That is non-compliance and insubordination of some workers on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS). Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes I really want to say what a load of “bleep” 
<br/>but unfortunately, I cannot.  Even this morning, honourable Professor Prasad and his three musketeers 
<br/>who are not here again - obviously they have gone out campaigning.  It seems like after his little 
<br/>hissy fit in New Zealand, he decided to take on FBC and </span><span>Walesi </span><span>and start with all the nonsense that 
<br/>he does in his usual manner, completely irrelevant to what we are actually talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public 
<br/>Accounts  assessment  of  the  2018-2019  Audit  Report  on  Government  Commercial  Companies, 
<br/>Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  and  Other  Entities.    I  would  like  to  start,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by 
<br/>acknowledging  the  findings  and  the  recommendations  made  by  the  Committee,  as  well  as  the 
<br/>contributions made by all Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities 
<br/>and Statutory bodies in playing a pivotal role in Fiji’s economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee report provided some findings for three statutory bodies that are under the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport,  specifically  the  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/></span><span>Consumer Commission, Consumer Council of Fiji and also Investment Fiji. I am pleased to note that 
<br/>the Committee did not find any adverse findings in the three independent statutory bodies and their 
<br/>audited reports remain unmodified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, contrary to what honourable Professor Prasad thinks, I would like to 
<br/>re-emphasise  something,  and  that  is  the  fact  that  these  organisations  are  actually  independently 
<br/>governed by their respective Acts - they have their own Boards and Management. I commend the 
<br/>Board and the Executive Management of the three organisations for firstly submitting their annual 
<br/>reports and secondly for having an unqualified report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, this is what happens when you actually appoint the right people, with the 
<br/>right skills in the right position - merit based appointments which we have always spoken about and 
<br/>this  is  actually  a  proven  formula  for  success.  These  sorts  of  achievements  and  good  governance 
<br/></span><span>practices give a lot of confidence in the Fijian economy from the international community.  It gives

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confidence to  our taxpayers also  who know that every dollar we  give to  these statutory bodies is 
<br/>properly accounted for so there is transparency and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  regards  to  the  PAC’s  recommendation  on  the  Consumer  Council’s 
<br/>need for a risk and disaster plan.  I would like to highlight that the Consumer Council of Fiji has 
<br/>developed a risk management policy and disaster recovery plan that ascertain the necessary strategies 
<br/>to  implement  at  the  time  of  need.    I  would  like  to  conclude  by  thanking  the  Committee  for  this 
<br/>particular report and thanking the statutory bodies in the role that they have played in our economic 
<br/>recovery efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Chairman  and  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee for their effort in scrutinising the report and reporting back to Parliament.  Allow me to 
<br/>make contributions on the motion before Parliament on the review of the Consolidated Report for 
<br/>Whole of Government 2018-2019 Audit Report.  My contributions will be confined to Sugar Industry 
<br/>Tribunal under Part B of the report on Statutory Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response, but allow me to speak on the report.  
<br/>On the roles of the Sugar Tribunal, the Sugar Tribunal is obliged to advise the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Sugar about the extent to which the objectives of the Act have been achieved in the period under 
<br/>review,  for  it  promotes  efficiency  and  development  of  the  industry;  coordinates  activities  of  all 
<br/>sections  of  the  industry;  promotes  goodwill  and  harmony  between  them;  prescribes  standards 
<br/>governing the mutual rights and obligations of the corporation and growers; provides for the keeping 
<br/>of  an  official  register  of  growers;  also  responsible  for  encouraging  and  providing  means  for 
<br/>reconciliation  with  a  view  to  prevent  and  settle  any  disputes  within  the  industry  by  amicable 
<br/>agreement.    Where  an  agreement  is  not  reached,  the  Tribunal  must  explore  methods  of  settling 
<br/>disputes with maximum expedition and minimum legal form and technicality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit of the Sugar Industry Tribunal for the financial year 2017, resulted in the issuance 
<br/>of a modified disclaimer opinion.  Altogether, there were 13 qualifications and I wish to highlight 
<br/>some of them: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tribunal did not prepare and present a statement of changes in equity as a component 
<br/>of the financial statements for the year ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2016, which is a departure 
<br/>from the requirement of section 3 of financial statement presentation.  As a result, the OAG 
<br/>is not convinced whether the retained earnings balance of $223,835 has been fairly stated 
<br/></span><span>in the financial statements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Tribunal  was  unable  to  provide  appropriate  documentations  to  support  loss  on 
<br/>revaluation of $165,289 on transfers of $139,631.  As a result, the OAG is not convinced 
<br/>whether the property plant equipment balance of $462,193 has been fairly reported in the 
<br/>financial statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tribunal recorded trade and other receivable balances of $263,676 in the statement of 
<br/>financial position as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2016 - included in the amount is a VAT receivables 
<br/>balance of $16,142.  Another receivable balance of $18,831 and owed by Near Infrared 
<br/></span><span>Project  (NIR)  of  $223,650.    The  Tribunal  was  unable  to  provide  the  auditor  with  the 
<br/></span><span>appropriate  documentations  to  support  the  above  balances  and  as  a  result,  the  OAG  is 
<br/>unable to ascertain whether the trade and other receivables balance of $263,676 has been 
<br/>fairly stated in the financial statements.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tribunal recorded operating expenses of $140,897 in the statement of comprehensive 
<br/>income for the year ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2016.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Tribunal was unable to provide the auditor with supporting documentation to support 
<br/>transactions totalling $34,410 recorded as meal and gang expenses.  As a result, the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General was unable to verify the completeness and accuracy of the balances 
<br/>and also unable to determine whether any adjustments might have been necessary in respect 
<br/>of meal allowance and gang expenses at the end of the financial year and any corresponding 
<br/>adjustments  to  the  elements  making  up  the  statement  of  comprehensive  income  and 
<br/>statement of financial position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Altogether  there  were  13  issues  raised  which  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  had 
<br/>recommended that a special audit be conducted on the operations and finances of the Sugar Industry 
<br/>Tribunal given the gravity and the high number of anomalies noted by the Auditor-General.  Further 
<br/>to this, Sir, the Committee noted other significant matters that were governance issues in that the 
<br/>Tribunal did not have a business plan, strategic plan, disaster recovery plan, risk management policy, 
<br/>human resources policy, IT security policy, policies to govern environmental controls and code of 
<br/>conduct in place, in addition minutes of management meetings were not provided for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  audit  review  -  there  was  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  the  management  held  meetings 
<br/>during  the  financial  year  2016.    There  was  also  no  evidence  to  indicate  that  management  held 
<br/>meetings  during  the  financial  year  2016.    There  was  no  service  level  agreement  regarding  the 
<br/>outsourcing of the IT function to Fiji Sugar Corporation.  The Committee noted that the root cause, 
<br/>the Tribunal lacks the capacity to develop policies.  The absence of these policies can be attributed 
<br/>to  absence  of  proper  governance  structure.    These,  if  not  rectified  can  lead  to  a  poor  culture  of 
<br/>governance in the authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Accounts Committee recommended with concern the delay in the presentation of 
<br/>the audited financial statements of the Sugar Industry Tribunal and strongly recommended that the 
<br/>Tribunal should prioritise on bringing its audited  financial accounts up to-date with immediate effect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the consolidated report of the review of the Sugar Industry Tribunal Annual Report for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2011 – 2015, the Economic Affairs committee noted, and I quote these issues of concern: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“1.  The Annual Report is not comprehensive enough to detail its performance against its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectives. 
<br/></span><span>The  components  of  the  Master  Award  is  to  be  reviewed  as  it  is  an  important  and 
<br/>essential instrument to ensure industrial stability and design, to be fair to all genders.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.   No available data on the number of female farmers who register their disputes with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Tribunal.   
<br/>Late submission of annual reports.  Current issues can be addressed better.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate, Sir, my earlier call when responding to the motion by the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs regarding the Sugar Industry Tribunal.  We have seen new faces on the helm of 
<br/>many leadership to bring about new vision and renewed hope.  Changes in life, Sir, help us move 
<br/></span><span>forward and become better professionals and better personalities. We suggest that the Government 
<br/></span><span>should consider making necessary changes in the leadership of the Sugar Industry Tribunal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to contribute to the 
<br/></span><span>motion  before Parliament.  Like my fellow colleagues who have spoken before me, the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>1264 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - 2018-2019 Audit Report on  
<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has made an excellent work in highlighting some of the issues that has been noted from the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report and I commend the honourable Chairman and the Committee for this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be on Fiji Roads Authority (FRA).  As a corporate 
<br/>entity, established in 2012, FRA is responsible for Fiji roads.  Of course, budgetary allocation has 
<br/>been given but according to the audit report, there are anomalies identified in the Fiji Roads accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking about Fiji Roads Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just inform the House about the conditions 
<br/>of some of our roads  especially  from  the cemetery  at  Lovonilase around  that roundabout  right  to 
<br/>Walu  Bay,  the  roads  are  patched  and  the  conditions  are  very  deteriorating.  It  is  not  very  good 
<br/>especially for the motorists as they try to swerve on the roads to divert from such conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- It is in the Report and the roads are in very bad conditions.  The 
<br/>motorists try to swerve especially on the patched portion of the roads and it is not very good and 
<br/>dangerous for oncoming vehicles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, from Navua to Nakavu the roads need to be done especially the two 
<br/>bridges that have been highlighted but they have not been built yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as well as the 
<br/>East Bank through Laselase Village in Sigatoka as it is pathetic and rough. The bus services there are 
<br/>not operating due to the deteriorating road conditions.  Even the West Bank of the Sigatoka River 
<br/>from Waicoba up the road is inaccessible.   So I am highlighting this Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that the 
<br/>authority concerned should at least get these roads and bridges done so that the motorists will not 
<br/>face any dangers on the road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  important  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  note  the  findings  of  the  audit  particularly  on  other 
<br/>significant matters and this include if I may highlight; the absence of documented business continuity 
<br/>and disaster recovery plan, assets with zero written-down values and in terms of contribution and re-
<br/>imbursement to and from municipal councils.  The Fiji Roads Authority has not brought to account 
<br/>the contribution received from municipal councils an amount payable to the council amounting to 
<br/>$44 million and also $28 million respectively in the statement of the financial position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amount has been disclosed as contingent assets and liabilities according to the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Report.  It  was noted Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the  Authority’s receivable  and payable  and 
<br/></span><span>related  expenses  and  income  accounts  for  current  and  prior  years  are  understated.    This  is  gross 
<br/></span><span>negligence and it is highly recommended that the Authority takes note of the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General’s findings and recognise themselves going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On redundancy liability accounts, the Office of the Auditor-General noted that the Authority 
<br/>did not maintain a complete list of staff which make up the total balance of redundancy, liability, 
<br/>account  amounting  to  $1.8  million.    The  Authority  was  unable  to  obtain  details  of  this  liability 
<br/>account from the Department of National Roads in 2012 when the Authority was established. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the impairment of debtors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Authority recorded receivables of $3.5 
<br/></span><span>million as at 31 July 2018 and included in this balance is debtors amounting to $2.8 million which 
<br/></span><span>are over 90 years old.  This is a deviation from stated regulation and the OAG noted that the Authority 
<br/>has not provided any impairment loss relating to the debtor balance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise is on the proper process not followed 
<br/></span><span>during the tender process.  The OAG’s review of the tender process noted instances where members 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1265 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  the  Tender  Evaluation  Committee  were  not  approved  by  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the 
<br/>Authority as required by Section 6.4(b) of the FRA Operations Manual. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For accountability purposes Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of help needed for officers to have 
<br/>the  suitable  qualifications  to  carry  out  their  core  functions.    On  that  note  I  thank  you  for  this 
<br/>opportunity Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  talk  to  this 
<br/>particular report and I would like to thank the Committee for the Report that they had just undertaken 
<br/>on the 2018-2019 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies and Commercial Statutory 
<br/>Authorities and Other Entities.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just like to talk very briefly about two of the entities here in particular on Energy Fiji Limited 
<br/>and Fiji Roads Authority.  Honourable Aseri Radrodro was asking earlier on why it is that EFL is not 
<br/>being audited by the Office of the Auditor-General.  I think we all know now that EFL is now a 
<br/>private  company,  has  a  shareholding  by  an  investor  from  overseas  and  one  of  the  things  that  the 
<br/>investors always  want  is,  they want  their  audits on time and this is something that we have been 
<br/>talking about in this Parliament.  In a lot of cases audits are a bit late even for the Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/>for instance, there are 2019, 2020 and 2021 audits are in progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For WAF, 2019 and 2020 is in progress.  For the Ministry of Infrastructure 2019, 2020 and 
<br/>2021 are already in progress.  For the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources 2021 has just been 
<br/>completed.  All of these audits take some time and sometimes entities like EFL get left behind and 
<br/>that is one of the reasons why these things are happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the audit here for EFL I am glad to see it has an unmodified audit. There is no 
<br/>qualification of audit so I think that is an achievement.  A lot of times all Ministers want to see that 
<br/>Commercial Statutory Authorities (CSAs) get unqualified audit.  It is not the same for FRA, the audit 
<br/>there was qualified and that is a concern for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just looking at some of the issues that we have here for EFL where they are talking about the 
<br/>reimbursements  from  the  Department  of  Energy  this  is  one  of  the  significant  matters  that  was 
<br/>recommended.  The Office of the Auditor-General recommended that the grants receivable should 
<br/>be recorded in the correct accounting period and when there is a commitment of payment during the 
<br/>period of overstatement of assets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue at hand there was that there is an invoice of slightly more than $7 million was issued 
<br/>to the Department of Energy in 2019 for various Rural Electrifications Scheme but this was then 
<br/>reversed in 2020 due to non-payment because the invoice was only raised to facilitate payment from 
<br/>Department of Energy (DOE) but eventually this did not happen and that it did not have any impact 
<br/>on the profit and loss of EFL.  So that statement there that it might have impact on the statement of 
<br/>the financial position did not actually happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  point  that  have  made  here  in  relation  to  EFL  was  the  utilisation  of  rural 
<br/>electrification funding where the report makes some recommendations for EFL to coordinate with 
<br/></span><span>the Rural Electrification Steering Committee.  There is a Rural Electrification Steering Committee 
<br/></span><span>present,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  looks  after  rural  electrification  that  is  done  by  EFL  which  is  grid 
<br/>extension.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Rural  Electrification  Steering  Committee  has  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Economy, Department of Energy and Energy Fiji Limited. They work hand in hand in a coordinated 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>manner. They meet every two months to monitor the progress of rural electrification projects and to 
<br/>make sure of its timely implementation and they also look at the funding of all the projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also a statement made here by the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report that the 
<br/>company  EFL  should  work  out  the  strategy  to  ensure  that  the  entire  population  had  access  to 
<br/>electricity by 2021.  It is important to make a distinction that that is the target of Government to make 
<br/>sure that we have 100 percent access. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, EFL  is an  agent  that  Government  will then pay to help  to  contribute to  that 
<br/>target.  So, it is not the EFL to meet the target it is the Government working through EFL, working 
<br/>through the Department of Energy that that works to try to address to achieve that target. EFL is a 
<br/>public company limited by shares and is accountable to its stakeholders of which the Government of 
<br/>Fiji is one of the stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  objectives  of  the  Rural  Electrification  Steering  Committee  is  to  monitor  the 
<br/>progress of each Rural Electrification Project.  This Rural Electrification Steering Committee, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir,  carefully  monitors the progress  of each rural  electrification project.  It  looks  at  their 
<br/>funding requirements and generally any other issues relating to the timely implementation of rural 
<br/>electrification projects when it meets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  has  its  KPIs  and  further  in  the  rural  electrification  contract  between  EFL  and  the 
<br/>Department of Energy there is no approval required from the Ministry of Economy for projects that 
<br/>roll over from year to year since the Department of Energy and Ministry of Economy are already 
<br/>members of the Rural Electrification Committee overseeing the progress of each of the projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee reviews the project status of each project that is work in progress and a plan 
<br/>is  devised  to  execute  these  projects  accordingly.    There  are  of  course  some  challenges  to  rural 
<br/>electrification especially over the past few years.  One of these has been the damaging cyclones that 
<br/>we have had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2016 to 2020, Fiji has experienced a lot of damaging cyclones and these have gone to 
<br/>unprecedented level.  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> which was a category five cyclone is a good example.  It took EFL 
<br/>some seven to eight months to complete the cyclone restoration, not talking about the new projects 
<br/>just to make sure we could have electricity again in places that had been affected by the cyclone, it 
<br/>cost us $35 million.  That $35 million had to be taken out of projects that were already in process.  
<br/></span><span>As a result of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, EFL could not progress the timely construction and commissioning of 
<br/></span><span>some of the rural electrification projects because the repair and maintenance of the damaged power 
<br/>lines infrastructure became a national priority. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2020 in particular will go down in the history of EFL as one of the most 
<br/>challenging years it has ever had.  Apart from the COVID-19 pandemic which adversely affected 
<br/>EFL’s business, EFL faced other challenges in the form of four tropical cyclones which struck Fiji 
<br/>in  2020  - </span><span>TC Sarai, TC Tino</span><span> in February,  </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>  in  April and the  year ended with  </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>.  
<br/>These cyclones brought with them severe flooding, strong winds that caused widespread damage to 
<br/>the power lines infrastructure across the country.  Their resources, their employees were put through 
<br/></span><span>one of their biggest tests ever and the cyclone restoration works then became EFL’s highest priority 
<br/></span><span>since it was in the national interest and when these things happen they have an impact on the projects 
<br/>that were planned for that time and the impacts of COVID-19 continued in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second wave of COVID-19 impacted EFL’s business and the ability to roll out these rural 
<br/></span><span>electrification  projects.    The  impacts  of  the  closure  of  the  international  borders  followed  by 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1267 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>restrictions  such  as  lockdowns,  social  distancing  and  the  imposition  of  curfew  on  the  health  and 
<br/>wellbeing  of  all  Fijians  have  been  challenging.    The  COVID-19  pandemic  affected  the  timely 
<br/>implementation of rural electrification projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third major thing that has been affecting these things is that we have limited electrical 
<br/>contractors and technical employees within the company and in Fiji and because of that limit it also 
<br/>has an impact on your ability to be able to progress all of the developments that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the other issues that have been brought up with the EFL and with energy, has been 
<br/>some  issues  about  (I  think  it  says  here)  ‘rights  over  assets  resulting  from  Rural  Electrification 
<br/>Scheme’.    I  can  now  report  that  this  issue  has  now  been  addressed  by  EFL  and  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy and EFL has had discussions with this and now they have an agreement in place to make 
<br/>sure that to build the clause in the grid extension projects, assigned for any rural electrification project 
<br/>between the Ministry of Economy and EFL, and the assets generated from the Rural Electrification 
<br/>Scheme become part of EFL.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority: FRA as I mentioned it has a qualified audit opinion.  There are two 
<br/>issues there in the qualification of the audit opinion, one is in terms of the agreement with municipal 
<br/>councils which I understand now is being addressed and secondly is the issue to do with what I had 
<br/>addressed yesterday about the Transport Information Sector Project. But FRA management at that 
<br/>time as I mentioned yesterday, had changed some of the general conditions of the contract which 
<br/>affected the funding that we had from the World Bank in which government then had to finish off 
<br/>the  Suva  Arterial  Road  Upgrading  Project  (SARUP)  programme,  SARUP  1.    But  as  mentioned 
<br/>yesterday, that has now been addressed by FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the other issues that had been mentioned there: the absence of documented business 
<br/>continuity and disaster recovery plan.  FRA has proven that it has means of addressing these issues 
<br/>when disasters do happen but nevertheless policies have been drafted and are yet to be implemented.  
<br/>The work is taking place on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As with some issues with the assets with zero written down values, some of these assets are 
<br/>not used by the Authority as most of that do not comply with the minimum OHS requirements.  Those 
<br/>assets are used to comprise of IT equipment, furniture and fittings.  The assets are still in workable 
<br/>condition  but  FRA  management  does  review  the  assets  with  zero  values  and  determines  the  best 
<br/>course of action based on the budgetary allocation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other points that are talked about there in terms of the Redundancy Liability Account, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue is resolved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Impairment of debtors; as has been mentioned by honourable Leawere, the figure there has 
<br/>now been reduced to around $300,000.  I cannot see the figure, I think it was over $2 million, and 
<br/>that has now been reduced to around $300,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper process not followed during tender process - the process has been improved and has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been updated in their amended Operations Manual.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No clear guidelines to capitalise emergency response works – this has been updated in the 
<br/>amended  Operation  Manuals.    All  the  immediate  response  activities  will  be  treated  as  similar  to 
<br/>maintenance, while permanent risk reinstatement works will be capitalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other issues that have been listed there - Asset Disposal Policy, depreciation rates for road

<br/>things that have been recommended here.  We look forward to an audit that comes in the future where 
<br/>they will have no qualifications on their audits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of contributions have been made.  
<br/>The  contribution  worthwhile  listening  to  from  this  side  by  the  honourable  Ministers  provided 
<br/>clarification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  just  very  quickly,  some  of  the  issues  that  have  been  highlighted  -  the  three 
<br/>musketeers are missing again in action, Sir, I do not know where they disappear to after lunch, but 
<br/>again  on the  </span><span>Walesi</span><span> issue that was  raised continuously, they used that to  cast  aspersions on what 
<br/>Government have done and, indeed, to somehow or the other justify the actions of the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General (OAG).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, honourable Professor Prasad read from the press release of the OAG and I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>read a press release from </span><span>Walesi</span><span> too and it goes like this, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Walesi Fiji Limited has submitted all financials up till 2020 to the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General who, unfortunately, have continued to delay auditing and finalising our 
<br/>financials for every year since 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  2015-2017  financials  have  been  audited  by  the  Auditor-General  and  have 
<br/>already been tabled as part of the Auditor-General’s report in Parliament, which is also 
<br/>easily accessible online.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  also  submitted  our  2018,  2019  and  2020  financials  for  auditing  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>AuditorGeneral’s office, and we are waiting for them to finish the audit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  submitted  the  2015  financials  on  10  May  2019,  however,  the  audit  began  6 
<br/>months  later  on  5  November  2019,  and  the  audited  accounts  were  sent  back  to  us  10 
<br/>months after that, on 18 September 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also submitted the 2016 financials on 10 May 2019, however, the audit began 
<br/>1 and a half years later on 13 October 2020, and the audited accounts were sent back to 
<br/></span><span>us 9 months after that, on 12July 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We submitted the 2017 financials on 10 July 2019, however, the audit began 10  
<br/>months later on 13 October 2020, and the audited accounts were sent back to us 10 months 
<br/>after that, on 16 August 2021.We submitted the 2018 financials on 10 July 2019, as well, 
<br/>however, the audit began on 18 November 2021 - a 16 month delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We submitted the 2019 financials on 20 October 2020, however the audit began on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18 November 2021 - a 13 month delay.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the facts regarding </span><span>Walesi</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad raised this issue without any facts whatsoever and I wanted to 
<br/>highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that </span><span>Walesi</span><span> also queried the Auditor-General multiple times in writing 
<br/></span><span>on the reasons for the massive delays, but no response. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>GCCs, CSAs, Other Entities and Statutory Authorities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1269 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wanted  to  just  very  quickly  highlight  what  honourable  Professor 
<br/>Prasad mentioned yesterday whilst I got him on the floor that because I received a text message from 
<br/>the CEO, FCCC, therefore, they were not independent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when honourable Members from the other side raised issues with all the 
<br/>honourable Ministers, if there is a clarification sought and if someone mentions about, “oh, there is 
<br/>no medicine at Wainibuka”, the honourable Minister will immediately text or </span><span>viber</span><span> his Permanent 
<br/>Secretary to find out what is happening.  If there is any issue raised, for example, all of us do that, 
<br/>that is their responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also our responsibility to obtain, as Executive, that information.  If tomorrow, the next 
<br/>Member stands up and says that the foreign reserves has just dropped by $100 million, I cannot give 
<br/>you the answer.  I will go to the person who looks after the foreign reserves and I will send a </span><span>Viber</span><span>
<br/>message to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji saying, “Dear Governor, is this the case?  Please, 
<br/>tell me what is your foreign reserves now?”.  He is an independent officer, by him communicating 
<br/>with me does not mean, therefore, that he is compromising his independence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  National  Federation  Party  (NFP)  has  just  put  up  a  post  at  lunch  time  saying,  “Great 
<br/>sources - a revelation that the FCCC has sent a text message to the Attorney-General and therefore, 
<br/>they are no longer independent.” This is the quality of Parliamentary contribution, Sir.  It is up there, 
<br/>someone just sent it to  me. That is the level of  political acrimony, ‘desperation’ is the word, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Opposition Member interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Not  just  my  friend,  it  is  your  friend!  You  guys  are  all 
<br/>clapping.  You give out the loudest clap every time he speaks. This is the level of debate that we get 
<br/>from the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  again,  loves  the  word,  ‘bankrupt’  -  FSC  is 
<br/>bankrupt, </span><span>Walesi </span><span>is bankrupt, Fiji Hardwood Corporation is bankrupt, Fiji Airways is bankrupt.  He 
<br/>has never worked a day in the private sector, but he talks about bankruptcy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Nor in Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, nor has he been in the Government, nor 
<br/></span><span>has he worked in any commercial entity or statutory entity. I do not know whether he knows how to 
<br/>read a balance sheet or not, or knows what gearing is.  But immediately, Sir, he says ‘bankrupt’.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the contradiction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he, on one hand, lamented the fact that now we 
<br/>have a Japanese company that has bought a minority shareholding in EFL and he is saying, “While 
<br/>it has come in - it is terrible.”  Then on the other hand, he lamented the fact, “Oh, will EFL be able 
<br/>to make a profit now or not?” What does he want?  He is saying that EFL now will no longer be able 
<br/>to carry out its social obligations.  A business does not carry out social obligations. On one hand, 
<br/>they lament the fact that we need all these things done by all these companies and on the other hand, 
<br/></span><span>they complain about the fact that they were not making profits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has  taken a  very business-like approach and a proper 
<br/>accountable approach.  Before, the reason why the rate of electrification in Fiji was low because the 
<br/></span><span>Government used to get FEA to do it and  FEA was limited. Under this Government, we give the 
<br/></span><span>money to EFL to do it.  Under this Government, when we want low income people to pay half the

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electricity rate, we do not tell the EFL to charge them half, but we paid on behalf of the members of 
<br/>the public to EFL, so that it does not affect their balance sheet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  today,  Government no longer  guarantees any of EFL’s  borrowings. Our 
<br/>contingent  liability  is  gone.    Honourable  Radrodro  raised  the  issue,  “why  is  the  audit  now  being 
<br/>carried out by a private company.”  They used to outsource it in any case.  But guess what?  The 
<br/>Japanese like to get things done on time and so do we.  They said, “If you are going to leave it to the 
<br/>OAG, we will probably get our fiancials two years later.” That is the problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, EFL gets it done as soon as the financial year ends, within three months, we have the 
<br/>audited accounts. You get the audited accounts, and that is how it should work. That is why we had 
<br/>them excluded from being audited by OAG. You know that now, but why did you not stand up and 
<br/>say it and recognise that?  When the honourable Leader of NFP goes on, you all cheer him on. You 
<br/>have to know what you are talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to say is that, they went on about the Fiji 
<br/>Hardwood  Corporation  Limited  (FHCL).    In  2007,  the  debt  stock,  in  other  words,  the  amount  of 
<br/>money  that  FHCL  owed  people  was  $26  million.    Today,  Sir,  the  debt  of  FHCL  which  was 
<br/>Government guarantee…
