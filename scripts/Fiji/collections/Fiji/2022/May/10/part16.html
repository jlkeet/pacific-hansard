<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme to Improve Navacikadrokadro Crossing  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Question No. 107/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources update Parliament on the programme to improve the Navacikadrokadro 
<br/>Crossing along Nalomate River in Wainunu, Bua? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular Navacikadrokadro Crossing, actually in the books of the Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority (FRA) it is referred to as the Daria Crossing because it is upstream from the Daria 
<br/>Village on the Nalomate River.  It is a low level Crossing in Wainunu, Bua, along the Nabouwalu 
<br/></span><span>unsealed road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Crossing comes under the FRA routine maintenance programme, which 
<br/>means that it undergoes maintenance work every now and then.  In this regard, FRA has just recently 
<br/>completed the deck repair, the top of the Crossing has been overlaid and has been improved on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Crossing is programmed under the  FRA  Forward Work 
<br/>Programme as one of the crossings that is earmarked to be upgraded to a bridge.  So, it is earmarked 
<br/>for that but in the next financial year, we will get the money to do the design for that to become a 
<br/>bridge  and  hopefully,  sometimes  in  the  future,  we  will  have  the  money  to  actually  construct  this 
<br/>particular bridge.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the next question.  This question was supposed to be 
<br/>asked  by  the  honourable  Kirpal  but  he  is  not  in  Parliament  at  the  moment  and  I  have  asked  the 
<br/>honourable Maharaj to ask the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance of Fijian Exports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>            (Question No. 108/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism  and Transport inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  performance  of  Fijian  exports  and  what  were  some  of  the  commodity 
<br/>exports that increased in the past year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s international trade actually plunged in 2020 due to the pandemic, as 
<br/>we all know, similar to what other countries have actually experienced but we somewhat recovered 
<br/>around  2021  and  despite  the  recovery  being  below  pre-pandemic  levels,  we  had  seen  some 
<br/>commodities actually excel.  Trade in several products such as fuel, aircraft, cars, machines actually 
<br/>took  a  nosedive  globally  in  2020  and  in  2021,  while  trade  in  goods  such  as  medical  protective 
<br/>equipment,  pharmaceutical  products,  home  appliances  and  electronics  actually  increased.    It  is 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1281 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>important  to  understand  the  impact  of  trade  on  specific  goods  and  sectors  and  even  amongst 
<br/>respective countries, it is actually highly diverse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji exported a total of $1.85 billion worth of goods in 2021, which was an 
<br/>increase of 3.2 percent from $1.79 billion when compared to the year 2020.  While trade of several 
<br/>types of goods actually decreased, trade and other goods increased remarkably.  Our domestic exports 
<br/>have shown an increase of 10 percent compared to 2020, and 7 percent compared to 2019 which is a 
<br/>pre-pandemic period.  We acknowledge that this is a below pre-pandemic level, but this is actually 
<br/>understandable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It should be noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2020, some of the exports have shown an increase 
<br/>compared to 2019 and 2020.  Turmeric increased by 254 percent compared to 2019, and 62 percent 
<br/>compared to 2020.  Spices also increased by 175 percent compared to 2019, and 45 percent compared 
<br/>to  2020.    Insulated  wire,  cable  and  other  insulated  electric  conductors  increased  by  68.4  percent 
<br/>compared  to  2020.    Potato  chips  and  other  assorted  snacks  had  actually  increased  by  42  percent 
<br/>compared  to  2020.    Mineral  water  increased  by  40.2  percent  compared  to  2020,  and  7  percent 
<br/>compared to 2019.  Wood and chips or particles increased by 35 percent compared to 2020, and 99 
<br/>percent compared to 2019.  Molasses actually increased by 29.8 percent compared to 2020, and 86 
<br/></span><span>percent compared to 2019.  Kava also increased by 29 percent compared to 2019, whilst there was a 
<br/></span><span>4 percent decline compared to 2020.  Uncooked pasta and noodles also increased by 27.4 percent 
<br/>compared to 2020.  Taro increased by 12.3 percent compared to 2020, and 21 percent compared to 
<br/>2019.  Sweet biscuits also increased by 1.9 percent compared to 2020, and 28 percent compared to 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are actually capitalising on these particular growth areas by deepening our presence in 
<br/>the existing markets, Mr. Speaker, and continuously exploring opportunities for newer markets.  The 
<br/>Ministry  is  also  working  with  key  trade  partners,  development  agencies  and  international 
<br/>organisations  to  develop  capacities  and  address  non-tariff  barriers,  diversification  and  supporting 
<br/>MSMEs in simplifying business processes to stimulate export growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s exports currently are tracking well and are contributing 
<br/>to our economic diversification which was at the forefront of our plans as can be seen with the agro 
<br/>commodities and our economic recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you for the opportunity to respond, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; while growing trade is critical 
<br/>for Fijian economy, can the honourable Minister inform Parliament on how we are ensuring Fiji’s 
<br/>climate goals are being met?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s  actual  global  leadership  in  climate  change  action  is  no  secret  to  us  and  given  our 
<br/>commitment  to  the  full,  effective  and  transparent  implementation  of  the  </span><span>Paris  Agreement,</span><span>  this  is 
<br/>evident  with  our  Climate  Change  Act  2021,  which  was  gazetted  on  24</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2021.    It  is 
<br/>actually a milestone achievement for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act creates a legal foundation to support our long term climate ambition and essentially, 
<br/>our  sustainable  development  objectives  and  commitment  to  protecting  our  environment.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, ensuring Fiji’s climate goals are being met should not just be a sole responsibility of a 
<br/>particular organisation or person, it should be a shared responsibility and collaborative effort on all 
<br/>fronts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By recognising the need to support the implementation of Fiji’s climate goals, the Ministry 
<br/>of  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  is  undertaking  a  range  of  climate  change-related 
<br/>projects  in  collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy’s  Climate  Change  and  International 
<br/>Cooperation Division.  In the interest of time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just be brief and highlight some 
<br/>of the key climate change projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to trade, Sir, it has a multifaceted impact on carbon emissions, which go beyond 
<br/>emissions from production and from transportation.  However, trade can also play a pivotal role in 
<br/>climate action with the emergence of environmentally-friendly goods and technology to consumers, 
<br/>amongst other means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst acknowledging the nexus between trade, environmental and climate policy levers, Fiji 
<br/>is currently negotiating the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (ACCTS), Sir, 
<br/>with five other countries, that is, New Zealand, Costa Rica, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, and 
<br/>we envision more parties to actually join this initiative in the near future.  This ACCTS is seen as an 
<br/>instrument  through  which  the  parties  will  encourage  trade  of  environmental  goods  and  services, 
<br/>whilst  disciplining harmful  fossil fuel  subsidies and setting  guidelines for voluntary  eco-labelling 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, fish stocks and ocean ecosystems are on a decline in many parts 
<br/>of the world due to overfishing and the use of actually destructive techniques to fish, and it is not just 
<br/>the number of fish humans are taking out of the sea that is problematic, it is actually how we do it.  
<br/>For instance, the use of bottom trawl fishing ensures that a maximum number of fish is captured in 
<br/>the shortest amount of time but the method is actually hugely destructive as it destroys absolutely 
<br/>anything else in its path.  So the harmful fisheries subsidies are a key contributor to not only over-
<br/>fishing but also over-capacity and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji and WTO members are currently negotiating a fisheries subsidies agreement in which we 
<br/>aim  to  curb  harmful  fisheries  subsidies  that  lead  to  access  capacity,  which  may  contribute  to 
<br/>overfishing as well as those that support IUU fishing.  The vast majority of fisheries subsidies, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, are granted to large fleets, thereby, disproportionately benefitting big businesses and 
<br/>the knock-on impacts of this on small scale and artisanal fisheries which provide food source and 
<br/>employment in the fisheries sector, is actually massive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has a very strong position in the WTO and we aim to ensure that trade is used as a vehicle 
<br/>to address fish sustainability issues and build our ocean resilience to address climate change.  We 
<br/>can actually increase ocean resilience by ending overfishing and disruptive fishing techniques and in 
<br/>doing  so,  we  also  mitigate  climate  change.    Overfishing  of  marine  fisheries  production  are  more 
<br/>vulnerable  to  ocean  warming  by  compromising  the  resilience  of  many  marine  species  to  climate 
<br/>change and continued warming will hinder our efforts to rebuild the over-fished populations.                      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From a tourism perspective, Sir, we are taking climate ambitions across to all the particular 
<br/>sectors.  We are currently working with Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the International 
<br/>Finance Corporation (IFC) on a national sustainable tourism development framework, building on 
<br/>the Fijian Tourism 2021 Successive Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are working with IFC on a number of initiatives for a long term sustainable growth and, 
<br/>of course, for investments in the Fijian tourism industry.   This includes the Vanua Levu Tourism 
<br/>Development  Project  and  the  COVID-19  Tourism  Recovery  Project.    Those  Projects  intend  to 
<br/>support destination development in Vanua Levu, Sir, by enabling the business environment as well 
<br/>as facilitating green private and public sector investments that create sustainable tourism.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1283 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also exploring the possibility of having a United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
<br/>Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Geopark in Fiji and the Pacific EcoTourism Recovery Initiative 
<br/>aims  at  a  green  and  inclusive  recovery  through  a  tripartite  partnership  between  the  South  Pacific 
<br/>Tourism Organisation (SPTO), the Pacific Community (SPC) and UNESCO.  Fiji, as one of the four 
<br/>Pacific Island Countries selected under the initiative, will select the potential region to be included 
<br/>in the study, with the potential to further develop into a UNESCO Geopark.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  the  transport  perspective,  Sir,  we  are  actually  committed  to  a  carbon  free  domestic 
<br/>maritime  sector  around  2050,  and  we  must  continue  our  efforts  towards  a  green  and  sustainable 
<br/>shipping sector.       
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- If you don’t like the information, don’t listen to it.  This is about Fiji, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Gavoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Well, it is very important information.  Maybe, paying attention might 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do you some good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Co-Chair, Mr. Speaker, of the Pacific Blue Shipping Partnership, we look to catalyse a 
<br/>multi-country  transition  to  sustainable  resilient  and  low  carbon  shipping.  The  Ministry,  in 
<br/>consultation with MSAF, is currently working on the ratification of the International Convention for 
<br/>the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) Annex XI and MARPOL is a Treaty aimed at 
<br/>preventing marine pollution caused by ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  quite  recently,  the  Ministry  led  the  initiation  and  hand-over  of  electric 
<br/>outboard engine boats at Nakalawaca Village in Tailevu.  This initiative also is the first of its kind in 
<br/>Fiji and the Pacific, and is part of our commitment, as climate leaders, to transition to green shipping 
<br/>in  order  to  ensure  the  marine  industry’s  long  term  sustainability.    These  climate  change-related 
<br/>projects are just a snapshot of many projects we have at the Ministry, and I hope it is informative to 
<br/>everyone in this Parliament, although it seems like it may not be to some, which is quite sad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Progress of Fiji’s Designated Marine Protected Areas  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 109/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil 
<br/>Service, Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  progress  to  designate  30  percent  of  Fiji’s  marine  areas  as  Marine  Protected 
<br/>Areas according to the 5-Year National Development Plan?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji,  of  course,  is  very  fortunate  to  be 
<br/>blessed with large ocean spaces that exist within its territorial sovereignty.  This includes the vast 
<br/>archipelagic waters and, of course, territorial seas.  It is within these waters or areas of ocean, Fiji 
<br/>has the most important fisheries.  This is because the ocean resources in inshore areas benefit all of 
<br/>Fiji citizens, provide for food security and play a large part in Fiji’s vital tourism industry. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Covering  about1.3 million  square kilometres of  space, the health and sustainability of our 
<br/>ocean  resources  is  inseparable  from  the  health  of  our  people.    Prior  to  the  strict  enforcement  on 
<br/>conservation  practices  that  our  Government  introduced,  Fiji’s  oceans  have  been  continuously 
<br/>exploited for its non-renewable resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2020, Sir, while the world took COVID-19 as an excuse to shelve climate change priorities, 
<br/>Fiji, in fact, welcomed and aligned itself to the Global  30by30 Initiative launched by the Government 
<br/>of United Kingdom.  The 30by30 Initiative is a collision of likeminded countries, who have placed 
<br/>the health of the ocean central to their climate change priorities, in order to allow the oceans to buffer 
<br/>anthropogenic impacts and conserve marine biodiversity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, achieving our Marine Protected Area (MPA) target is no longer just a policy 
<br/>or global commitment by our Government but a legal requirement.  Part 13, section 81(2) of Fiji’s 
<br/>Climate Change Act puts into law the designation of 30 percent of our EEZ as MPAs by 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government had the foresight to create a conducive environment to ensure 
<br/>the enforcement of climate ambitions and determine feasible and achievable long term targets and 
<br/>short  term  goals.    Government,  of  course,  has  not  limited  itself  to  simple  commitments,  but  has 
<br/></span><span>allocated significant resources and time to ensure the realisation of the 30 percent MPAs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021m the Ministry of Economy, along with the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries signed an MOU with the Blue Prosperity Coalition to operationalise the elements of our 
<br/>National Ocean Policy, particularly 100 percent sustainable management of our EEZ, of which 30 
<br/>percent will be designated as MPAs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate  Change  and  International  Co-operation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  the 
<br/>secretariat  of  the  National  Ocean  Policy  Steering  Committee,  is  spearheading  this  work  with  the 
<br/>Waitt Foundation to develop a 5-Year Work Programme to help achieve this plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, our Blue Bond Issuance earmarked for launch later this year 
<br/>also complements the delivery of this target. Through its Blue Investment Fund, the Fund acts as a 
<br/>lending vehicle to provide affordable blue debt to Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) interested 
<br/>in establishing and scaling sustainable blue projects ranging from tourism activities, focussing on 
<br/>MPAs to ocean-based renewable energy generation.  Above all, the intention of Fiji’s Blue Bond 
<br/>Issuance is underpinned by the need to support our Blue Post COVID-19 Recovery - one that reignites 
<br/>Fiji’s  fisheries  sector,  fortify  Fiji’s  sustainable  tourism  brand  and  supports  Fiji’s  ambition  for  a 
<br/>sustainable and healthy ocean. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect of the status of the MPAs in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have rapidly expanded in 
<br/>inshore areas.  Approximately 78 percent of inshore areas are under some form of Locally Managed 
<br/>Marine Areas (LMMAs).  Currently, there are only four gazetted MPAs within the inshore areas, 
<br/>while the rest are managed under the iTaukei traditional protocols of taboo areas.  Overall the inshore 
<br/>MPAs are equivalent to 1.8 percent of Fijian waters, which means that Fiji will not be able to meet 
<br/>its 30 percent of MPA commitment from inshore areas alone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  existing  management  practices  inshore,  there  is  a  need  for  a  significant  expansion 
<br/>towards Fiji’s offshore waters outside of their </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> areas to cover the remaining 28.2 percent of 
<br/>the MPAs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2020,  through  a  robust  and  systemic  10-step  process  approved  by 
<br/>Cabinet, a draft map was presented and discussed in the first round of public consultations and made 
<br/>available for stakeholder review.  The objectives of the consultations were as follows, to:

<div><span>fulfil a Cabinet decision that was passed on 13</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2019, supporting consultations on 
<br/>the establishment of an MPA over 30 percent of Fijian waters; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduce the MPA commitment and seek input on where the Fijian public would like to 
<br/>see MPAs and their preferred types of MPAs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generate dialogue with stakeholders to secure endorsement and/or agree changes to draft 
<br/>map in the national candidate sites for the proposed offshore no-take MPA; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>invite submissions to a draft network of offshore candidate MPA sites (when I say candidate 
<br/>I do not mean candidates running for Parliament, I mean candidates as in candidate sites); 
<br/>and

<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>educate and inform the public on the proposed offshore MPAs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  process  was  undertaken  through  technical  representations  and  presentations,  breakout 
<br/>group sessions, a tour of resources, looking at the details of the MPAs, along with the participants 
<br/>providing comments on the questionnaire forms provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  more  consultations  are  being  organised  with  a  strategy  to  increase  the 
<br/>sample size, as well as the diversity of the participants to better reflect the view of all Fijians.  This 
<br/>includes focussed consultations with the fishing industry to look at means to establish complete no-
<br/>take zones through an appropriate marine spatial planning, considering existing commercial rights.  
<br/>No-take zones basically means you do not take anything from within the zone itself, only outside of 
<br/>those zones.  There are certain MPAs, Sir, as we have seen in other countries where you can take out 
<br/>only certain things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this proposes a second round of consultations to take place within May and 
<br/>June this year for possible announcement and update on commitments, in time for the next UN Ocean 
<br/>Conference to be held in Lisbon in late June 2022.  In these next steps, Fiji will also need to develop 
<br/>an implementation plan to achieve this target by 2030, and raise interest with private sector investors 
<br/>and philanthropies towards sustainable financing to meet the enforcement and management of these 
<br/>MPAs, given our vast ocean space.

<div><span>Maritime Security Initiatives – Fijian Navy  
<br/>(Question No. 110/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on some of the Maritime 
<br/>Security Initiatives conducted by the Naval Unit of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I rise to respond to Parliamentary Question No. 110 of 
<br/>2022 raised by the Honourable George Vegnathan and I thank him for raising this very important 
<br/>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the RFMF Naval Division is responsible for the surveillance of Fiji’s 1.3 million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>square kilometres of Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).  This is achieved through: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>monitoring  and  coordinating  of  maritime  search  and  rescue  operations  for  Fiji  and  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regional search and rescue area of responsibility;

<br/>the  conduct  of  hydrographic  surveys  and  hydrographic  services  for  the  thousands  of 
<br/>mariners who traverse Fiji’s waters, amongst other maritime security initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these maritime security  roles and initiatives are critical services to Fiji’s blue 
<br/>economy, our overall maritime safety and wellbeing and equally important our responsibility as a 
<br/>coastal State in order to fulfil our international obligations under various international and regional 
<br/>conventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in responding to the question by the honourable Member, I wish to express 
<br/>that the maritime security initiatives currently being implemented by the Republic of Fiji Navy are 
<br/>designed to combat transnational crime including trafficking of drugs, human trafficking and illegal, 
<br/>unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing as well as emerging threats to the region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Navy enhances its support to border security agencies in the space of combatting 
<br/>transnational  crime  through  information  sharing  and  resource  support.    For  cases  of  interest,  its 
<br/>increased  and  meaningful  collaboration  with  partner  agencies,  has  resulted  in  the  successful 
<br/>apprehension of two foreign vessels since January, 2022.  In addition, for the year 2021, the Republic 
<br/></span><span>of Fiji Navy fleet successfully conducted 89 boarding of vessels of which 19 were joint operations 
<br/></span><span>with regional partners who provided support in terms of aerial surveillance or at sea boarding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover our enhanced support to local partner agencies have been enabled 
<br/>through strengthening collaboration with our regional and defence cooperation partners for greater 
<br/>maritime domain awareness through information sharing, improved platforms and capacity-building 
<br/>at the Fiji Maritime Surveillance Rescue Coordination Centre and I am sure that some Committee 
<br/>Members have already visited this facility.  Mr. Speaker, the RFMF’s naval division continues to 
<br/>develop  information  sharing  mechanisms  whilst  maturing  with  technological  advancements  to 
<br/>support the synthesising and assessing of maritime security threats based on a holistic view of the 
<br/>maritime domain.  This is done to prioritise where to focus our limited maritime assets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will continue to develop as the Republic of Fiji Navy prepares for the 
<br/>launch and opening of the Maritime Essential Services Centre in 2024 and beyond - a project that we 
<br/>are  pleased  to  undertake  with  our  </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>  partner  as  I  did  highlight  yesterday  here  in  this  august 
<br/>House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Naval Division continues to also build on existing Navy partner Shiprider 
<br/>Agreements as evident in the recent signing of the Shiprider Agreement between the UK and Fiji.  
<br/>Essentially, this allows our Navy personnel to embark and board royal navy ships to conduct joint 
<br/>maritime security patrols within Fiji’s EEZ, supplementing the patrols conducted by the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji Navy Ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  the  honourable  Members,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  signed  the 
<br/>Shiprider Agreements with the US, the UK, with Australia and, of course, with New Zealand.  So 
<br/>what happens when vessels, naval ships or even the American Coast Guard Cutters, when they come 
<br/>to Fiji, we have our people on board and they do patrol our waters as well with the other partners of 
<br/>ours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, our Naval Division continues to formalise technical agreements and operational 
<br/>frameworks  that  encompass  cross-border  support,  capacity-building,  information-sharing  and 
<br/>development around search and rescue particularly with the New Zealand and Fiji Agreement signed 
<br/>in 2021.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also continuing efforts for the signing of agreements with regional 
<br/>rescue coordination centres that manage areas bordering the Fiji search and rescue region which is 
<br/>an area of about 6.5 million square kilometres which is almost six times higher than Fiji’s EEZ of 
<br/>1.3 million square kilometres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion Sir, I wish to highlight some search and rescue statistics.  For the year 2021, 
<br/>the Rescue Coordination Centre coordinated a total of 53 search and rescue cases, resulting in 147 
<br/>lives rescued and sadly 15 lives were lost.  For the year 2022, the Rescue Coordination Centre has so 
<br/>far already coordinated 25 search and rescue cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  it  may  be  non-traditional  maritime  security  aspect,  search  and  rescue  allows  for 
<br/>purchasing distress out at sea to have the right to receive humanitarian assistance in protection of life 
<br/>and the right to personal protection and security.

<div><span>Update on the Golden Age Home Facility 
<br/>(Question No. 111/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the condition of the Golden Age Home facility at Lautoka?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is talking about the condition of the Golden Age Home and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assume that the honourable Member is talking about the structure of the Golden Age Home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As way of background, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation six years 
<br/>ago took charge of the three residential homes in Fiji, the Golden Age Home in Lautoka, Golden Age 
<br/>Home in Labasa and Golden Age Home in Samabula. Before that, the Homes were under the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the Golden Age Home in Lautoka, this Home was built in the 1940s and served as a 
<br/>primary school.  In 1960, it was handed over to Government to serve as a residential home for our 
<br/>senior citizens.  We would not be talking about this situation if our families were more responsible 
<br/>and if our families took care of their own elderly family members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, Government has taken care of the senior citizens who have sought refuge in our 
<br/>three  homes  and  in  case  of  Lautoka,  I  agree  with  you  that  the  condition  of  the  home  is  sort  of 
<br/>deteriorating because it is a very old structure, but we have not compromised the quality of care that 
<br/>we give out to our senior citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation has been lucky that we have had 
<br/>three successful capital  projects in the form of Golden Age Home in  Labasa.  Approximately, $4 
<br/>million project is on the verge of completion and we are awaiting the completion certificate.  We also 
<br/>had the Western Disability Centre that came at a cost of $1 million which is completed and we are 
<br/>now in the progressive stage of completing the Barefoot College which also comes at the cost of 
<br/>around $4.3 million.  Next on our priority list is a new Golden Age Home facility for our residents 
<br/>in the Western Division and this, we will apply through the normal budgetary process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some years ago, the Construction and Implementation Unit of the Ministry of Economy did 
<br/>a scoping for renovation works.  The building is not in a condition whereby we can inject more money

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to carry out renovations, it is very old, but like I said, I can assure the Parliament the quality of service 
<br/>is up to par.  We have engaged more carers and currently we have 43 out of the total of 119 residents 
<br/>that we have.

<div><span>Investment and Support to Counter Ruck Pte Limited  
<br/>(Question No. 112/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>investment and support provided to Counter Ruck Pte Limited which owns and operates the 
<br/>Fijian Drua?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in Parliament, Government has supported the Drua Rugby 
<br/></span><span>Team which is owned by the Counter Ruck Pte Limited (CRL).  I think a lot of people may actually 
<br/></span><span>want to ask the question - why is it owned by a private company?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the New Zealand Rugby Union which is actually the one that is heading or 
<br/>set up the Super Rugby Pacific Competition had a number of conditions. They did not want the Super 
<br/>Rugby Team (which is part of this competition), to be handled by the Rugby Union of that particular 
<br/>country itself. They wanted it as a separate entity, so they want a creation of an independent entity 
<br/>and, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of that, Counter Ruck Pte Limited was created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the conditions is, it requires a minimum of NZ$3 million equity or 
<br/>debt but to have that type of money.  Also, maintenance of a million dollars at all times cash at hand, 
<br/>Sir, which is the requirement; a robust business model of delivering efficient financial returns so as 
<br/>to attract the necessary private equity participation and to sustain the team.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in addition to the financial matters, a range of high performance and team performance KPIs 
<br/>were also in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rationale, of course, as I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was to set up a separate private 
<br/>company,  to  keep  the  financial  affairs  of  the  Rugby  Union  away  from  the  team  that  is  going  to 
<br/>participate in the Super Rugby Competition, Sir, because of any financial failures that may occur 
<br/>because these competitions are extremely expensive, and if it is going to put additional burden to the 
<br/>Rugby Union, we could have the entire structure within that individual country collapse.  That is why 
<br/>they have to keep that as separate entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we were approached, we were asked by Counter Ruck to give a grant. 
<br/>We could not give a grant because Government cannot give a grant to a private company that is 100 
<br/>percent privately-owned because obviously, taxpayers’ funds are involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we said we could not, then we as Government came up with a solution.  We 
<br/>said, “We recognise that Drua is very important to the Fijian public, of course, it is very important 
<br/>for us.  We also saw the economic advantage in terms of the competition and how Fiji, of course, is 
<br/>going to be the home base for Drua, at least, not now but later on it will be, we saw the economic 
<br/>benefits and we also know that rugby is a very, very important part of our national psyche.  So, we 
<br/>then said that we could become an equity holder. In that way we could actually give the $6 million 
<br/>but in return, get shares for it, as we do in other companies, Sir, which is what we have done and as 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a result of which we will get 51 percent of Counter Ruck.  We have already disbursed $3 million, the 
<br/>second lot of $3 million will be disbursed by December of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the idea is that, Drua becomes a formidable team, develops a good brand 
<br/>and as a result of the brand, we have got the Fijian diaspora in Australia and New Zealand and various 
<br/>other parts of the world.  We have also seen that with just one game being played in Suva, the number 
<br/>of people that turned up.  And if you read all the social media comments, not just from Fiji but from 
<br/>New Zealand and Australia, how they were commenting that the droves in which the Fijian public 
<br/>turned up, they wish they could  get those kind  of numbers when they play in  Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The merchandise sales of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, went through the roof so these are ways 
<br/>that they make money.  Government has also granted a 13-year income tax holiday, we provide a 
<br/>waiver of duties, et cetera, on the goods specifically imported for Fijian Drua purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have said, Sir, that in time to come, Government could, of course, divest its shares, get 
<br/>back its money, but what we would have done would have had the Drua Team up and running and a 
<br/>good company will be running it too. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir:  We have heard 
<br/>positive things about the Drua and also the Fijiana Drua.  My question is, how can they be factored 
<br/>into this setup or may be going into the future given their profile right now and the successes of the 
<br/>Fijiana Drua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  They  carried  the  name  ‘Drua’  so  they  are  part  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>franchise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Of its benefits? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, they are part of the franchise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that  brings to an  end question time and question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time is now over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, it also brings us to the end of the sitting for today. I thank you all for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your cooperation and your forbearance.  Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
