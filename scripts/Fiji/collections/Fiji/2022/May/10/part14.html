<div><span>Revitalisation Plans for the Sugar Industry  
<br/>(Question No. 105/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  iTaukei  Affairs,  Sugar  Industry, 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and Forestry update Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to revitalise the Sugar 
<br/>Industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Inosi Kuridrani.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  an  Election  year  for  us  so  I  suppose  there  is  no  surprise  that  the 
<br/>Opposition has, once again, started kicking the cane industry like a political football.  It is a pity that 
<br/></span><span>honourable Professor Prasad is not here because I heard him make a comment this morning to say 
<br/></span><span>that there are dictators on this side of Parliament.  I want him to know that there are no dictators on 
<br/>this side of Parliament; what we have on this side of Parliament is strong, decisive leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Just because he is married to PAPI, it does not mean that he 
<br/>can stand on the table and beat his chest.  But as always Mr. Speaker, Sir, I shoot straight with the 
<br/>cane growers about the state of the industry - no lies, no false promises just the facts as they are.  And 
<br/>the fact is that we have continued to provide higher levels of support to cane growers, than at any 
<br/>point in Fijian history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fertilizer  and  weedicide  subsidies,  cane  top-up  payments,  cane-cartage  transportation 
<br/>payments, cost for Penang Mill area growers, assistance with the renewal of leases through top-up 
<br/>payments to landowners, upgrading of cane access roads covering one-third of the cost of purchases 
<br/>for the mechanisation of cane harvesting, the purchase of cane lorries and incentives for new growers 
<br/>to enter the industry and for growers to boost cane production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have challenges as you all know - when the going has been tough for 
<br/>the cane growers, their government has extended a firm hand of support due to climate change.  As 
<br/>we have heard, Sir, floods are more intense, droughts are longer and storms have been stronger and 
<br/>more frequent than ever – </span><span>TC Sarai</span><span>, </span><span>TC Evans</span><span>, </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> were 
<br/>all brutal blows.  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> alone caused massive damages to the cane production 
<br/>cutting production to 1.4 million tonnes in 2016 and 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only cane was affected but the cane access roads and milling infrastructure were severely 
<br/>damaged.  Intense rainfall caused water logging, reduced soil fertility and ultimately reduced cane 
<br/>productivity.  Those challenges, as everyone knows, are beyond our immediate control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Post-pandemic, the price of fertilizer almost doubled.  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has since 
<br/>exacerbated  the  situation  with  international  sanctions  on  Belarus  which  is  the  supplier  of  gMOP 
<br/>fertilizer and Muriate of potash and the fertilizer export restriction  imposed by China, the largest 
<br/>exporter of DAP Fertilizer have both substantially increased prices.  The South Pacific Fertilizers

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited is procuring fertilizer materials from alternative markets at a cost that has increased two to 
<br/>threefold and there is COVID-19.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the challenges that we have comes in combination with the economic 
<br/>shock  caused  by  COVID-19;  there  were  lockdowns,  port  closures  and  inconsistence  shipping 
<br/>schedules that affected the sugar and molasses sales all of which affected the Fiji Sugar Corporation’s 
<br/>cash flow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Global lockdowns, Mr Speaker, delayed the arrival of parts of equipment which compromised 
<br/>timely mill maintenance.  I should mention that despite the COVID-19 challenges and failed boycott 
<br/>instigated by the National Farmers Union last year, the mill operated well with fewer breakdowns 
<br/>and  stoppages.  We  shielded  growers  from  global  price  hikes  by  absorbing  the  entire  increase  in 
<br/>fertilizer cost with an additional grant allocation of $9.72 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the revised 2021-2022 Budget on top of the initial allocation of $15.6 million, 
<br/>the total allocation is $25.3 million.  From 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2022, the price of fertiliser has gone up in access 
<br/>of $80 per bag, yet my Government has continued to subsidise the entire difference of that increase 
<br/>so that growers still pay the same price of $20 per bag and we made an additional allocation in the 
<br/></span><span>most recent revised budget to cater for that increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my Government is the only one in history to introduce the guaranteed sugar 
<br/>price of $85 per tonne irrespective of the world market price. This has given security and certainty 
<br/>to farmers by supporting their bottom line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my Government is also working with our counterparts to ensure that the export 
<br/>of sugar to foreign destinations attracts low or zero-rated duties to give Fiji a competitive advantage 
<br/>over other sugar exporting countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the recent price review of sugar in the domestic market conducted by the Fijian 
<br/>Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) will further consolidate the pricing for farmers and 
<br/>ensure  FSC  acquires  the  right  price  for  its  product  and  generates  revenue  to  perform  targeted 
<br/>investments to increase crop yield, improve milling efficiencies and product diversification. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the industry  institutions are closely collaborating to  boost cane productivity.  
<br/>The FSC and the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) has acquired a highly qualified personnel 
<br/>from India to do research and address the soil health issues in our sugarcane farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SRIF  through  its  new  CEO  has  consolidated  efforts  in  reviewing  the  sugarcane  varieties 
<br/>prevalent locally with  an intent  to  plant only those varieties that  are best suited to  Fiji’s climatic 
<br/>conditions and those that promised the most optimum sugar contents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  FSC  has  also  recruited  new  experts  to  drug  strategic  objectives  on  cane 
<br/>development. Strong emphasis is being placed on the improvement of soil health through initiatives 
<br/>such as fertiliser uptake, application of aglime and intercropping to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  focus  is  always  shifted  towards  more  structured  and  methodological  harvesting  and 
<br/>transportation systems for the 2022 season something that will ensure strong supply of good cane to 
<br/>the mill thereby improving milling efficiencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in many ways the sugar industry is like any other business.  To sustain a business 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we need to:

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Achieve a balance volume of crop; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Manufacture the required volume of sugar; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Set the right price levels to be viable in the business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sugar industry is expected to achieve its targets of 2 million tonnes of cane this year and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the current sugar price in the domestic and export markets sugar revenue will increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The climate impacts I have discussed taken in combination with global treat disruptions have 
<br/>presented FSC with huge challenges.  Notwithstanding risk, Mr. Speaker, FSC has been  provided 
<br/>with the Government guarantee as it navigates through this interim period.  This financial support 
<br/>will continue as FSC remains on its path towards financial stability on the back of strong marketing 
<br/>initiatives, enhance milling efficiencies and improve cane production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I want to stress that Fiji is not alone in the way we support and subsidise the 
<br/>sugar  industry.  India  being  one  of  the  largest  sugar  producing  countries  subsidises  its  industry 
<br/>significantly.  My Government does the same for the same reason to continue to support our sugar 
<br/>industry so that our growers can trust in a viable and sustainable future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  highlighted  in  some  of  my  previous  responses  in  Parliament,  FSC  will 
<br/></span><span>continue to carry out product, development and diversification and grow the market for its sugar of 
<br/>Fiji product.  It will also work on improving the packaging machines and distribution channels and 
<br/>acquire international certifications that would open doors to new markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is  the potential for FSC to  generate  good revenue through bulk  sugar and molasses 
<br/>exports.  These will help lift some of the financial burden of government as a percentage contribution 
<br/>towards the guaranteed price of $85 per tonne.  Mr. Speaker, it is not only the world that is changing 
<br/>when  it  comes  to  cane  growing  as  new  dynamics  are  in  the  Fijian  economy  and  workforce  are 
<br/>affecting the industry as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, Mr. Speaker, as we all know, is not the same country that it was in the 1960s and ‘70s.  
<br/>We are a more modern and diversified economy and the interest of the young generation reflect that.  
<br/>Traditionally  cane  growing  has  been  heredity  with  farms  being  passed  down  from  generation  to 
<br/>generation, however  young Fijians increasingly want to diversify by growing other crops or even 
<br/>taking up other professions and entirely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The average age of cane farmers is 59 in a population where a large majority of our people 
<br/>are under the age of 40.  This is an issue we must confront squarely.  I have mentioned the assistance 
<br/>we are providing to mechanise the industry but not all terrain can be harvested by machines.  Some 
<br/>require manual labour and to fill the labour shortage, Mr. Speaker, we are also working with the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service to supply labour to the industry.  In addition, as we have highlighted, 43 percent 
<br/>of all cane growers are small growers, cutting less than 100 tonnes of cane per year.  These growers 
<br/>are far from fully relying on cane growing and often grow other crops to subsidise their incomes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  that  is  why  we  created  the  option  for  smaller  scale  growers  to  grow  non-
<br/>sugarcane crops for domestic purpose to support Fiji’s food security and for export purposes.  We 
<br/>need more locally grown crops available for our people.  They are healthier and more resilient to the 
<br/>global price shocks we have been experiencing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced in the revised budget of 2021-2022, Mr. Speaker, the government has allocated 
<br/>$500,000 to support cane growers who seek to convert their sugarcane leases to agricultural leases 
<br/>to  plant  other  crops  or  for  residential  purposes.    We  will,  of  course,  work  with  landowners,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, iTLTB and interested farmers to help them obtain new leases.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1277 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We expect, Mr. Speaker, that primarily, small scale growers will wish to diversify into non-
<br/>sugar crops as they might find it more feasible and profitable to do so.  At the very least they deserve 
<br/>that option.  Meanwhile the government will continue to boost cane production and ensure that our 
<br/>target of two million is achieved by this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the mills to begin crushing early next month, I wish a fruitful year to the growers, the 
<br/>millers,  the  lorry  drivers,  cane  cutters,  harvester  operators  and  all  stakeholders  involved  with  the 
<br/>industry.  Thank you Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that 
<br/>the sugar industry is struggling to survive due to low production and high cost of production.  The 
<br/>cane cartage alone consists about 40 percent of cost of production … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your supplementary question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- … With the recent fuel increase, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is there any plan 
<br/>by this Government for distant farmers to establish this trans loading zone so that it helps them to 
<br/></span><span>survive?  Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You sit down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Is there any plans to establish trans loading? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have asked the question, so you sit down so that I can give the floor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the honourable Prime Minister.  You have the floor, Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is comment in the papers that I was 
<br/>betrayed,  but  I  will  stay  with  SODELPA  now  because  of  the  </span><span>massari</span><span>  I  can  get  as  Member  of 
<br/>Parliament - a very confused individual.  Someone once said this predicament is like that of his party 
<br/>and his leadership, they are neither at home or at the jetty.  All of them wear massive smile and carry 
<br/>a pocket knife ready to stab. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already covered everything, but with regards to the price of fuel, there is an independent 
<br/>body namely the FCCC that conducts price reviews.  There is a process for FCCC to follow when 
<br/>considering  price  review  for  any  regulated  price  and  all  stakeholders  are  required  to  follow  the 
<br/>procedure.

<div><span>Capital Works on the Protection and Preservation of Fiji’s History  
<br/> (Question No. 106/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SIGARARA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/>update Parliament on the capital works being undertaken by the Fiji Museum to protect and 
<br/>preserve Fiji’s history?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Museum plays a crucial role in preserving Fiji’s history as well as Fiji’s 
<br/>culture.  As a statutory body, Fiji Museum has extended its function beyond the role of collector and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a  repository  of  national  heir  loom  to  a  research  facility  and  educational  resource  space  and  an 
<br/>inclusive exhibition and display arena attracting local and international visitors alike.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  Government’s  strong  commitment  and  investment,  the  Fiji  Museum  is  being 
<br/>transformed into a premier cultural and historical destination.  This transformation of Fiji Museum 
<br/>will  provide  educational  and  cultural  benefits  to  our  people,  revitalised  the  local  economy,  grow 
<br/>tourism in the capital city and create a sense of pride. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Museum is well placed within the heritage precinct along the Queen 
<br/>Elizabeth  Drive  for  around  four  decades  now,  however  the  façade  of  the  Fiji  Museum  looks  run 
<br/>down.  Their interior needs to be improved and displays have to be made more attractive.  The Fiji 
<br/>Museum,  therefore,  required  a  major  renovation  and  they  also  needed  funds  to  carry  out  those 
<br/>renovation works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has invested around a million dollar to complete some of the planned capital 
<br/>works.  These are new visitor restaurant blocks by the Museum veranda, coffee shop facility, new 
<br/>front  entrance  to  the  museum,  replacement  of  old  roof  of  the  main  Museum  building,  new  Fiji 
<br/>Museum shop and this shop is created just like what we find in other museums around the globe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Museum also as part of the capital work, had to remove asbestos from the main museum 
<br/>building, creating stall spaces for events equipment (that has been completed), installation of new 
<br/>kitchen and facility for staff and for events at the museum veranda and installation of new electrical 
<br/>transformer and associated works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the electrical work at Fiji Museum had to be done urgently because ever 
<br/>since  Fiji  Museum  was  created,  the  electrical  wiring  was  not  changed  and  all  our  objects  in  the 
<br/>museum was at risk.  Pending capital works at the museum include exterior painting of the museum 
<br/>building and the installation of solar panel system for the main Museum and the Maritime Gallery 
<br/>works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, 5 percent of full rewiring of the entire Museum and conservation building is left to be 
<br/>completed.  The Government has provided $496,944 for these pending works. While the Government 
<br/>focussed its investment on infrastructural and exterior component, a lot of the interior gallery display 
<br/>works is supported by donors and sponsors, who have shown great interest in assisting Fiji Museum 
<br/>achieve its vision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to preserve Fiji Museum objects, a sum of $400,000 was provided by the 
<br/>US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). This fund will be used for both, hard and 
<br/>soft infrastructure initiatives, such as the refurbishment of storage space for objects, renovation of 
<br/>space  to  be  used  as  a  lab  for  object  conditioning  work,  research  and  development  of  an  online 
<br/>database for all Museum objects, audit of Museum objects and archival materials and to implement 
<br/>educational session so that the public could appreciate the value and significance of our heirlooms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the revamping of Fiji Museum Maritime Gallery is another initiative that 
<br/>will provide unique maritime history. The Gallery which will host this new major exhibition titled, 
<br/>“Voyages:  Stories of an Ocean People, is now close to completion. Once it is completed, it will set 
<br/>an exciting new direction for Fiji Museum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Visitors to this exhibition will discover the stories of great voyages that have created modern 
<br/>Fiji – from the early Lapita people who arrived over 300 years ago, the skilled </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> craftspeople 
<br/>who  had  travelled  by  Drua  and  navigated  and  traded  in  the  vast  Pacific  highway,  stories  of  the</span><span>
<br/>Girmitiya</span><span> voyages and other more recent migrants who came as whalers, missionaries, labourers and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>traders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ultimately this exhibition will encourage visitors to connect with our ocean 
<br/>while being challenged to consider what ocean legacy they are leaving behind for their children, as 
<br/>they navigate a warming world due to climate change and the related implications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recently,  the  Fiji  Museum  received  $40,000  from  the  Australian  High 
<br/>Commission  to  implement  a  Museum  Education  Action  Plan  for  Fiji,  first  ever  to  be  pursued  at 
<br/>national level which includes interactive initiatives for people with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  visitors  have  a  high  expectation  of  the  National  Museum.  They  prefer  physical 
<br/>experience of the Museum and enjoy entering a world that belongs to them, a world of wonder and 
<br/>inquiry.  And to provide that facility, the Government is committed to improve the Fiji Museum and 
<br/>we  are  doing  whatever  we  can  to  put  Fiji  Museum  as  an  important  facility  for  our  cultural  and 
<br/>historical Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders 
<br/>with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a 
<br/></span><span>suspension motion.
