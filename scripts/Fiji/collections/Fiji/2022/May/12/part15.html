<div><span>COMMITTEE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF DIRECT INITIATIVES  
<br/>TO FARMERS IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament authorises the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs to assess 
<br/>the  impact  of  direct  initiatives  to  farmers  in  the  agricultural  sector,  in  particular  the 
<br/>distribution of seeds and seedlings for cash crops, help in the form of materials provided to 
<br/>dairy farmers, provision of irrigation pumps/piping, rice planting, ploughing and harrowing 
<br/>of land by the Ministry of Agriculture, handling of breeder goats/sheep, and report back at 
<br/>the next sitting of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of  Agriculture in  Fiji  is 
<br/>well-known  to  all  of  us.  For  at  least  a  century,  the  agriculture  was  synonymous  with  the  Sugar 
<br/>industry rightly regarded as the backbone of Fiji’s economy for almost 30 years of our independent 
<br/>history.  However, while the focus was on sugar, the other sectors were also being boosted. We had 
<br/>the Lakena and Dreketi Rice Scheme.  Every cane  belt town had a rice mill including the driest 
<br/>districts  like  Tavua  and  Ba.  There  were  diversification  and  self-sufficiency  for  most  rural 
<br/>households  in  terms  of  cash  crops,  for  sale  and  self-consumption,  as  well  as  rotating  crops  - 
<br/>intercropping to maintain nutrient balance in the soil.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  like  the  time,  farming  practices  have  also  dramatically  changed.  
<br/>Unfortunately, the advisory and the expertise from the Ministry of Agriculture also withdrawn to 
<br/>an alarmingly low-levels and here, I mean for both Sugar and Non-sugar sectors.  New approaches 
<br/>under the pretext of innovation, mechanisation and you name it were rolled out.  At least, three 
<br/>decades ago, the farmers only required guidance and advice on the new ways of doing things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  obviously  they  need  help  in  the  form  of  mechanisation  seeds,  seedlings  and  breed 
<br/>animals.  More  than  three  decades  ago  we  had,  veterinary  posted  in  every  district  who  could  be 
<br/>called at odd hours to visit farms and attend to the animals in distress but this has now become a 
<br/>thing  of  the  past.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  changes  for  the  better,  with  time  but  it  seems  that  our 
<br/></span><span>Agricultural sector has changed for the worst because there are no visible signs of it becoming an 
<br/></span><span>important factor in Fiji’s economic growth and move towards some degree of self-sufficiency and 
<br/>a major contributor to GDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  brings  me  to  the  various  initiatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture 
<br/>aimed at helping the farmers. I acknowledge as I did in this Parliament before, that during COVID-
<br/>19, the Ministry of Agriculture assistance,  especially in the distribution of seeds, helped a lot of 
<br/>farmers raise the production and make their ends meet.  At least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we do a close 
<br/>scrutiny of the Ministries own survey report of 2020 which reveals that Fiji is lagging far behind in 
<br/>terms of acquiring some semblance of self-sufficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One may not need to look further than the dairy industry.  In the absence of parliamentary 
<br/>democracy, it was basically privatised with a 10-year exclusive licence given to major business to 
<br/>import powered milk and bulk butter at zero duty and reconstitute it into dairy products. This is 
<br/></span><span>apart from processing fresh milk from our dairy farmers.    
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1363 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one only has to look at the 2020 Agriculture Survey Summary, to note the 
<br/>decline of the industry, despite the exclusivity.  Milk chilling plants have been constructed in the 
<br/>Western Division but the milk production has not increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  today,  almost  88  percent  of  milk  is  important  and  reconstituted.  We  believe,  the 
<br/>famous Rewa butter is 100 percent important only to be made salty and packaged. The number of 
<br/>dairy farmers have swindled and the Government blames Tuberculosis (TB) and Brucellosis for the 
<br/>decline. That may be a factor but nothing about how it programmes to incentivise farmers and how 
<br/>it is not working.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of us in this Parliament heard about the juncao grass being hailed as the perfect catalyst 
<br/>to boost milk output in cows.  Farmers were  told if they did not plant the grass, they would not 
<br/>qualify for any assistance.  Naturally, the question comes to mind is, what has happened to the so 
<br/>called assistance to revive the dairy industry?  Why the policy of providing replacement calves at a 
<br/>subsidised price to dairy farmers has not resulted in increased milk production?  The answer is that, 
<br/>the calves will be ready as cows in three years, not immediately. What about the interim?  Why then 
<br/>say  that  it  will  instantly  produce  the  desired  results?    Is  this  due  to  lack  of  planning  or  poor 
<br/>knowledge of the industry?  The list goes on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fencing materials have been provided to certain farmers, in many cases, we are told that the 
<br/>farmers do not need them, but other forms of assistance.  Recently, a well-known dairy farmer in 
<br/>Tailevu, was given fencing materials for goats, and he showed us those materials, it is rusting in his 
<br/>yard because he does not need it, and he is a dairy farmer, not a goat or sheep farmer.  This only 
<br/>serves the purpose of a painful example of wastage of tax payer funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  also  issues  with  ploughing  and  harrowing  of  farms  by  the 
<br/>Ministry.  Last weekend, we were in Navua and they provided examples of how this scheme is not 
<br/>working there.  There are claims that this matter has been raised with the Ministry but is being swept 
<br/>under the carpet.  We were shown farm access roads as well.  These have not been maintained for 
<br/>many years.  They are overgrown with grasses and weeds.  The questions is why; whether there is 
<br/>no budget or any other reason?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also told of lack of subsidies for weedicide and fertilisers for cash crop farmers.  We 
<br/>know cane growers have also lost subsidies on weedicides, despite needing them the most.  Cash 
<br/>crop farmers tell us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that previously the price of a litre of glyphosate was $9.50, 
<br/></span><span>but this has risen by $10 to $19.50, an increase of over 100 percent.  Ginger farmers have told us 
<br/></span><span>that more than a decade ago, the price of kilogramme of baby ginger was $1.  Just this year, it was 
<br/>increased to $1.60 per kilogramme.  It would be interesting to hear what the Honourable Minister 
<br/>says.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many other examples, however, the point is, in the last two decades, agricultural 
<br/>practices  around  the  world  has  gone  through  huge  changes.    Influenced  by  large  corporations, 
<br/>agriculture has become an applied science business.  The most successful agriculture economies, 
<br/>including those close to Fiji, such as Australia and New Zealand, have applied scientific research 
<br/>and data driven methods to increase yields, and they are able to cut their cost and improve their 
<br/></span><span>competitiveness,  which  we have not  been able to do, and, Fiji,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, seems  to  have 
<br/></span><span>missed the boat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Simultaneously, the Ministry  of Agriculture has  been in decline.  In my view, it has lost 
<br/></span><span>direction and expertise.  The service it provides to farmers have fallen in both quality and quantity.  
<br/></span><span>Like everything under this Government, it seems now to be focused on photo opportunities for the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister and others.  The honourable Minister is constantly pictured as some so called 
<br/>new  initiative,  making  some  grandiose  announcements  about  new  developments  and  new 
<br/>directions, just like he did in Parliament yesterday.  That is fine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but what are the 
<br/>results?  On the ground, there is very little to show, and that is why we are asking for this inquiry.  
<br/>The people of Fiji need to understand the truth versus talk.  Unless we know what kind of impact is 
<br/>coming from these initiatives, we cannot do anything to improve it or change it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no use, Mr. Speaker, Sir, jumping from a digger or getting behind the wheels of a 
<br/>tractor for a photo opportunity.  The cold hard reality is that, Government is unable to bring new 
<br/>practices and technology to our agriculture to make Fiji more competitive.  I read a report yesterday 
<br/>which exactly talks  about  that, so it is  not  desperation, it is  hard track.  This  has had a twofold 
<br/>impact.  First, our local farmers cannot earn a decent living from supplying food locally because 
<br/>they cannot produce enough to cover the cost of getting their crops to the market. In many cases it 
<br/>is cheaper for supermarkets to import food than to buy it locally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can walk into a supermarket in Fiji and find some truly odd products on 
<br/>sale for example coconut water imported from Sri Lanka.  A single cob of corn wrapped in plastic 
<br/>imported from New Zealand being sold for $6.  These are products that are grown right here in Fiji.  
<br/>Clearly, if a supermarket is supplying them, there must be demand.  And yet, we cannot get our own 
<br/>farmers’ products reliably into the consumer market. Why? And as I said yesterday a cassava farmer 
<br/>with six tonnes of cassava was told in Vanua Levu that there were no storage spaces, by AMA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the distraction we are struggling to create a robust, sustained 
<br/>agriculture exporting industry.  I recall that it was recently announced that Fiji had for the first time 
<br/>exported more than $100 million worth of non-sugar agriculture products.  That is correct but Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we also know that we are spending the same amount of money, about $100 million on 
<br/>importing beef and sheep meat every year.  Why is that in a country that can easily host and farm 
<br/>cattle and sheep, we are importing so much?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Hon. Dr. M. Reddy interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will have your opportunity … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Dr. M. Reddy interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You will have your opportunity my friend 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When looked at in this light, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our non-sugar 
<br/>agriculture, just like sugar in the last 15 years, can only be seen as a colossal failure. We need to 
<br/>understand what is going on and why.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tragedy of our agriculture industry is that nothing seems to happen 
<br/></span><span>unless the Minister turns up himself.  He distributes some seeds here and addresses a meeting there, 
<br/>he supplies a tractor to some farmers here or new fencing material to farmers there and of course 
<br/>the army of government photographers and camera crew that go with him.  And who can forget Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, the stray horse that the Ministry captured and handed to the people of Nadroga to pull 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1365 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a plough.  I would certainly like to know what has happened to that horse. I assume it has run away 
<br/>by now or being used as a ride to tame the others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But this is not agriculture Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not agriculture, this is just politics with a 
<br/>bit of mud attached to it.  What we do not see is emerging farmers who are able to earn a living 
<br/>from the business of farming.  We do not see major commercial investments but we have heard 
<br/>about it here - in agriculture we should create agricultural clusters and allow our smaller farmers to 
<br/>grow  with  them.  And  Mr  Speaker,  Sir,  we  should  not  forget  our  most  successful  agricultural 
<br/>industry over generations.  Sugar was developed like this.  First came the large agricultural investor, 
<br/>the  CSR  company,  which  became  South  Pacific  Sugar  Mills  (SPSM)  and  then  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation and in the heyday of the industry after Independence at and at least for 30 more years, 
<br/>farmers were successful and earned good incomes because they worked with and around the FSC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have one or two large private sector investors in the tobacco and poultry 
<br/>industries.  Their success has been to create a group of tobacco farmers and chicken farmers who 
<br/>do not need Government support.  Another global development has been demand for organic foods. 
<br/>This is now worth about US$100 billion dollars in the global market with huge opportunities for 
<br/>value-added product development.  If Fiji could just supply 1 percent of that market, our economy 
<br/>would be transformed. There are now a few enterprising exporters no doubt who are able to export 
<br/>products such as raw </span><span>kava</span><span> and turmeric to meet demand in these markets.  But these are just a drop 
<br/>in the bucket compared to what we should be doing and those exporters will tell you that it is easier 
<br/>to work without the Agriculture Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are just a few of the directions in which our non-agriculture sector 
<br/>needs to go.  We need to import substitute in areas like cattle and sheep, meat and vegetables. We 
<br/>need  to  attract  large  commercial  investors  to  agriculture  to  create  viable  livelihoods  for  small 
<br/>farmers.  We  have  to  look  at  the  organic  food  market.    That  is  the  big  picture  that  they  need  to 
<br/>consider and that is why, Mr. Speaker, we need to understand whether the Ministry of Agriculture’s 
<br/>initiatives are succeeding or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, millions of dollars of taxpayers money are being thrown into Government 
<br/>initiatives on seeds, seedlings, farming and fencing materials, farms, tractors, ploughing of land, et 
<br/>cetera.  What is the effectiveness of this help?  That is what we are asking through this motion.  No 
<br/>one knows.  I do not even think the Ministry of Agriculture knows.  No one is able to tell us, no one 
<br/>has heard from the farmers who have received this help about how it has helped them in the long 
<br/></span><span>run because the problem we have under this Government is that it never wants to hear bad news.  
<br/></span><span>That is why they oppose all independent inquiries and motions that we bring.  It only wants to tell 
<br/>everyone how much money it is spending.  We hear over and over again how much is spent here, 
<br/>how much is spent there but whether that spending is effective or not - that is the big question.  It is 
<br/>clear this Government is actually fearful of finding out whether it is doing anything that is producing 
<br/>results.  This is because we suspect in the Opposition and this side of the House, it is not producing 
<br/>any results.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let there be an inquiry through the people’s representatives chaired by 
<br/>Government Members, majority of them would be Government Members in this House.  Let the 
<br/></span><span>people speak and let the people hear how effective the Government’s policy in this critical area has 
<br/></span><span>been.  I urge the Government, before they vote down this motion, which they are likely to do with 
<br/>the kind of noise that is coming from the Minister himself (as they always do), I want to tell them, 
<br/>“Do not be afraid of the truth, this is part of the process of Government reviewing its own policies.”  
<br/></span><span>He should understand what evaluation means.  So do not be afraid about the truth, do not be afraid 
<br/></span><span>of hearing that maybe things are not as good as you are saying they are.  Is it not what you always

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brag about and say, ‘Government is about the truth, Government is telling the truth, Government is 
<br/>doing this”, but let us, Mr. Speaker, use this motion which has majority of Government Members 
<br/>in the Standing Committee to have an inquiry to talk to the people and evaluate, based on some of 
<br/>the statistics and bring that report to Parliament.  It may well point out where the gaps are, where 
<br/>the  Government  needs  to  shift,  which  way  it  needs  to  put  emphasis  so  that  we  can  grow  the 
<br/>agriculture sector as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  commend  the  motion  to  Parliament  and  I  hope  that  the  Government  will 
<br/>support this and have the Standing Committee inquire into the initiatives and effectiveness of those 
<br/>initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  this  motion  for 
<br/>debate. As usual, the honourable Opposition Member comes up with baseless motions for money-
<br/>wasting ideas so that he can shilly-shally and idle away the nation’s time.  Why should we task a 
<br/>Standing Committee with doing what any Fijian already can, which is to read the extreme facts and 
<br/>data that the Government publishes regularly?  If honourable Professor Prasad wants to assess the 
<br/>impacts of the initiatives and the current overall performance of the sector, he can read that data.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Throughout the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture was a reliable and resilient sector 
<br/>that grew to record strength, supporting livelihoods and enhancing Fiji’s nutritional security.  We 
<br/>crossed the $100 million mark in agricultural export for the first time in 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday the honourable Minister for Agriculture, in his Ministerial Statement, provided 
<br/>an update on how Government initiatives have impacted the performance of the agriculture sector 
<br/>over the years. Yet, honourable Professor Prasad, had the gall to call that support a juvenile attempt 
<br/>by the Honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Professor Prasad’s motion is worse than juvenile.  He is arguing 
<br/>with facts  and figures, even a child would know better.  Here are the facts, Mr. Speaker.  After 
<br/>breaking records in 2020, agricultural exports rose to a further $123 million in 2021.  Fiji had also 
<br/>witnessed significant growth in the export of kava, ginger and turmeric, amongst other spices in the 
<br/>past two years, exported mostly to the United States of America.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Spaker, the top agricultural export categories in 2021 were ginger, assorted vegetables, 
<br/>cassava, chicken meat and eggs.  These are all positive results of what this side of Parliament has 
<br/></span><span>shown to the agriculture sector. Unlike honourable Members on the other side, we are all about 
<br/></span><span>results, not just rhetoric.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, honourable Kuridrani made a statement saying that the contribution 
<br/>of  agriculture  to  GDP  has  declined  since  2013.    What  he  did  not  tell  you  is  that  the  volume  of 
<br/>agriculture is  at  record high,  which means production is  increasing.   I think  that  the honourable 
<br/>Member fails to understand the basics of the developmental pathway of any economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  economic  transformation  and  progress  of  most  countries  start  with 
<br/>traditional primary sectors.  The major contributors to most economy nowadays are fuelled by either 
<br/></span><span>industry or service sectors.  Honourable Kuridrani is right that this is not the Fijian economy of the 
<br/></span><span>1970s, 1980s and the 1990s - we are more a diverse economy. Sectors like tourism, manufacturing 
<br/>and financial services are growing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this shows that our economy is progressing and expanding. We will continue 
<br/></span><span>to fulfil our vision of a diversified economy - an economy that does not rely heavily on any one 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector.  Therefore, we remain strong in our support to the agriculture sector, and we will continue 
<br/>to provide the necessary support needed to progress it further.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I  end,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  go  back  to  the  comment  that  honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua had talked about, that we are boring.  That is the term that they get from their supporters 
<br/>in the social pages - boring.  Just because they are now married to </span><span>paapi</span><span>, it does not mean that we 
<br/>should know about the excitement that they receive from that end.  Mr. Speaker, they talked about 
<br/>boring, but there are only three of them and there are 27 of us here.  We have won two Elections, 
<br/>so we are not really boring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on those remarks, Sir, I do not support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the motion.  We really 
<br/>need to get to understand the full potential of agriculture.  We all know that it is a segment of our 
<br/>economy  that  can  do  better  and  should  be  doing  better,  but  for  some  reason,  it  continues  to 
<br/>underperform.  I know that the honourable Minister and the Government are hyping the fact that in 
<br/>quantum in dollar terms, it is increasing, but relative to the GDP it is not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what we see from this side of Parliament is that, we need to develop models to 
<br/>help grow agriculture. I must say I was quite impressed with the very comprehensive presentation 
<br/>from the honourable Minister for Agriculture in his Ministerial Statement yesterday, covering the 
<br/>whole range of products that are being produced in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was  sitting here with  the honourable  Leader of the Opposition  and we were asking the 
<br/>question - why  can they not really perform to their potential or maximum?  And he highlighted 
<br/>something that is really illuminating, Mr. Speaker, in that, the model that we use, we should follow 
<br/>the FSC model - the support system for every crop, whether it is coconuts, ginger, turmeric, </span><span>dalo</span><span> or 
<br/>whatever produce we have, we need that kind of model, that kind of support system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In sugar, Mr. Speaker, the support system is such that for every 600 farmers, there is one 
<br/>overseer.  I do not know what it is like today, but that used to be the case years back when I was a 
<br/>cane farmer.  Honourable Adimaitoga can testify to that, I believe, but this is what we need.  If you 
<br/>really want to grow agriculture, Mr. Speaker, we need to set up this kind of structure.  There must 
<br/>be support system on the ground, in every district, to help support the farmers, as they do in the Fiji 
<br/>Sugar Corporation (FSC).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, as a cane farmer, the handholding by the overseer from your 
<br/>seedlings,  the harrowing,  ploughing, the fertilizer  and all that is  all part of the relationship  with 
<br/>FSC, to the harvesting and transportation to the mill.  That is the kind of model that we need to 
<br/>develop if you really want agriculture to flourish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can digress a bit, I know the honourable Prime Minister has got a lot of initiatives to 
<br/>help with the cane crop, but let me just take us back, Mr. Speaker, to the beginning of sugar.  When 
<br/>you look at the infrastructure they created, the railway system from Kavanagasau in Nadroga all the 
<br/>way to Rakiraki, the main route and then the trunks to the valleys where they lay the rail network….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Time has changed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, it has changed, honourable Member, but the philosophy then 
<br/></span><span>was for the company to  pick up your cane from your doorstep.  That  was it.  And the extent of 
<br/></span><span>investment at that time for Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) to do that.  I  mean, in my district in

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cuvu, there is one that goes through Navovo, one goes through Yadua, one goes through Yalahuna, 
<br/>so  really  that  was  the  undertaking  by  the  company  to  pick  up  your  cane  from  your  doorstep.  
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister, if I can just suggest that we put that in place for our farmers to create 
<br/>new interest in cane farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was a cane farmer, Mr. Speaker, I could have harvested a thousand tonnes, but my problem 
<br/>was that, at the end of the season, I have stand-over cane.  I could not harvest them all and it cost 
<br/>me a lot of money.  I bought a truck, I was committed to cane farming, but that element, that part 
<br/>of the cane equation kind of, failed and I believe with us - SODELPA, this is what we are going to 
<br/>do with the farmers.  We will work with them to pick up their cane from their doorstep.  That will 
<br/>generate more interest in Nadroga, in Navosa and as far as Rakiraki in Ra, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going back to agriculture, Mr. Speaker, that is also what we need to do - the provision of 
<br/>equipment.  There was a headline over the last couple of days, one of the political leaders was saying 
<br/>that the days of knives and forks are gone.  So, equipment is very important, it is key to all this.  I 
<br/>get comments from Nadroga that after paying for a digger from Government, it takes them three 
<br/>months for the machine to arrive at the farm.  These are all that need to be done to fully support 
<br/>agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I asked the honourable Minister about turmeric in Keiyasi, Navosa.  It grows in 
<br/>abundance there, Mr. Speaker.  Keiyasi can develop to be a township and it can be a centre for the 
<br/>processing of turmeric.  The Nadroga Navosa Corporation has a collection centre there already been 
<br/>built,  and  I  was  suggesting  to  the  honourable  Minister  to  turn  that  into  a  processing  centre  for 
<br/>turmeric up in the highlands of Navosa, to create employment and bring the processor closer to the 
<br/>farmers.  He said that it is commercially driven but commerce, honourable Minister, can give them 
<br/>incentives to motivate those companies to come and set up in Keiyasi and process turmeric from 
<br/>there.  It is in plentiful supply, as we all know, and it is one of the best.  Those are the types of steps 
<br/>we need to take, Mr. Speaker, to grow agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was in a meeting with some villagers in Tailevu and they said,  “Can you help with the 
<br/>fruits or foods in season”,  because mangoes, mandarins and </span><span>duruka</span><span> only come once or twice a year 
<br/>and when they bring them into town, they normally set up in the verandah of some supermarkets 
<br/>and they get chased away.  They said, “can Government do something to give us an outlet for the 
<br/>fruits and food in season to be sold to the consumers?’  This is one area where you could look into, 
<br/>Sir, because there is a lot of fruits in season that only come once or twice a year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will certainly look into that when we set up agriculture on the basis of supporting those 
<br/>types of producers.  Also in Tailevu, there was a comment made that they would harvest ginger but 
<br/>they would carry them from the farm to the pick-up points which could be quite a distance.  So I 
<br/>said, “Okay, have you spoken with the Ministry?’  They said, “Yes, they have.”  So help with some 
<br/>sort of transportation system to help them from the farm into the collection point for the producers, 
<br/>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-  Do they want the horse! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Actually, they were asking for a horse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Now, you’re laughing about the horse.

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Whether they have been supplied, is the question here, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, to carry their produce from the farms to the collection point whether by tractor or 
<br/>by horse power, I ask, did he provide that. But make it happen, let us not sit here and say everything 
<br/>is hunky-dory, that everything is alright.  There are people out there who are asking for assistance, 
<br/>and that is why we believe with this motion, that much more can be done.  It is under-performing 
<br/>and  that  is  why  I  am  all  for  this  Committee  to  help  determine  how  we  can  go  forward  with 
<br/>agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I leave it there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I hope that we are not set in our ways, that we know it 
<br/>all and that we would not accept something this meaningful and important to help the agriculture 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address this august Parliament in response to 
<br/>the call by the honourable Leader of the National Federation Party on an update on farming and 
<br/>agriculture initiatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I am at a loss to understand why the honourable Member has 
<br/>asked  for  such  an  update.    The  initiative  in  these  areas  have  been  well  documented  and  well 
<br/>presented by the honourable Minister for Agriculture, in this august House time and again as well 
<br/>as through media coverage, et cetera.  It looks like that honourable Professor Prasad cannot digest 
<br/>the success that the Ministry for Agriculture has done for the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motive of the honourable Leader of the National Federation Party has 
<br/>simply selfish political concerns and I must urge rather than out of any concerns for the welfare or 
<br/>well-being of those in the farming and in the agriculture sector.  It is just another desperate and 
<br/>pathetic attempt to appear relevant and concerned about the farming and agriculture with Elections 
<br/>around the corner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may be it is just following the Labour Party Leader who went on in doubt 
<br/>about what to do next, dance to beating the drum on behalf of farmers, empty words and empty 
<br/>drums in a desperate Elections gimmick.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- This is my time now, honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka spoke about the sugar industry.  The cane farmers saw 
<br/>no hope for their families in the sugar industry until 2006.  Hear me out, honourable Gavoka. I am 
<br/>talking about up to 2006 that because of the non-renewal of land leases (and this is what honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad has not mentioned during his speech). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was our Prime Minister who gave hope to our farmers by providing the 
<br/></span><span>assistance and the farmers of this country are very well aware of it.  They know it, that it was this 
<br/></span><span>man who gave life to the farmers of this country because I go to the farmers, I know and I am telling 
<br/>from my experience and we are on ground, we know what farmers want, we know what their needs 
<br/>are.

<div><span> Committee to Assess the Impact of Direct Initiatives to  
<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  happy  on  the  other  hand  to  use  this  opportunity  provided  by 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad to highlight one of the many success stories to come out under this 
<br/>Government.    In  highlighting  these  success  stories,  let  us  all  acknowledge  and  recognise  this 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  in  recognising  the  potential  in  our  youth  and  providing  the  much  needed 
<br/>resources for their development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  reaffirmed  in  each  of  the  handover  ceremonies,  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government stands firmly behind for the youths of Fiji.  The honourable Opposition Members may 
<br/>talk big here and on social media on their plans and wish list for our youths but we deliver and we 
<br/>continue to deliver for the youths of this country in real terms and in real time and to continue to 
<br/>make real difference in the lives of our youths.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will continue, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to grow the Fiji Youth brand and always be at their back 
<br/>as we move on into the new normal of the current pandemic.  We gave hope to our youths in these 
<br/>uncertain times.  Let me also say that FijiFirst Members are on the ground more, compared to any 
<br/>other Government that we had.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our all Government response to economic effects of COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, the Ministry of Youth and Sports in August 2020 launched a new initiative called the 
<br/>Youth Farm Initiative. The initiative supports improvement of the Food Security and Livelihood. 
<br/>Through  this  new  initiative,  the  youths  are  encouraged  to  utilise  vacant  land  within  their 
<br/>communities for farming. This initiative, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has strong community foundation and 
<br/>focusses on local level capacity building using local resources, capital, labour and the land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It utilises the strength of existing local landowning group based networks and builds on it 
<br/>through providing farming implements and other materials such as seeds, fertilisers, water palms, 
<br/>water tanks, et cetera, to kick start this initiative. Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been proven to be a winning 
<br/>formula with growing growth in the number of projects under this programme in a very short period 
<br/>of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since August 2020 to date, the Ministry has assisted 202 Youth Clubs with around 6,000 
<br/>youths to benefit who are members of this youth club.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, huge response has been 
<br/>received from these interested youths supported with formal land consent from the landowners for 
<br/>youths to utilise land farming services. The total landmass consented for farming by the landowning 
<br/>units to be utilised by the 202 Youth Clubs is around 1,250 acres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Youth and Sports Divisional Office works in close collaboration with the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture  to  obtain  soil  samples  for  testing  and  advising  the  Youth  Club  on  land 
<br/>preparation and planting of suitable crops, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Ministry also provides training on 
<br/>agriculture practices in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Organization for Industrial, 
<br/>Spiritual, Cultural and Advancement (OISCA) and the Ministry of Youth and Sports trainers from 
<br/>these Youth Training Centres.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry provides direct funding assistance in the form of 
<br/>equipment  higher  for  land  preparation  farming  tools  and  equipment  such  as  spade,  fork,  knives 
<br/></span><span>materials  for  greenhouse,  along  with  the  vegetable  seedlings  and  fertilisers.    With  the  primary 
<br/></span><span>purpose of strengthening food security and providing employment opportunities, the programme 
<br/>has enabled these youth clubs to share their harvest within their communities during the COVID-
<br/>19 pandemic and the lockdown period to generate income with the surplus produced on a regular 
<br/></span><span>basis.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1371 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we support the Government’s goal of development through integrated 
<br/>approach, the Ministry of Youth and Sport wishes to acknowledge the partners and stakeholders 
<br/>who have made it possible to empower and reach the untapped capabilities of these rural youth of 
<br/>Fiji. I acknowledge the Ministry of Agriculture for their technical assistance and support that they 
<br/>have continued to provide for our youths through this programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, at this juncture, acknowledge the Chinese, Japanese and Indian Governments for their 
<br/>continuous support towards this programme and empowering our Youths.  Most of all, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I acknowledge the engine room - work done by our youths under this initiative and the important 
<br/>role of the land unit who have contributed to this programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no need for this inquiry because we have the monitoring system 
<br/>in place apart from the internal audits. Full stop, no enquiries.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this 
<br/>opportunity to provide this update and I strongly oppose the motion before us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Members who 
<br/>have  contributed  before  me  but  I  stand  to  oppose  the  motion.  .  I  have  clearly  stated  during  the 
<br/>Business  Committee  proceedings  that  we  need  to  give  the  Ministry  time  to  implement  the 
<br/>programmes but definitely, there is always time for us to move by the honourable Members of NFP 
<br/>to later access the impact of direct initiatives to farmers in the agricultural sector.  The effectiveness 
<br/>of it, whether it is succeeding or not, we will always have time because as the honourable Minister 
<br/>had stated in the last two days, if I remember correctly, what Government is giving to the Ministry 
<br/>is not expenses, it is an investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investments are not short term, although there are some short term gains 
<br/>from  most  of  these  initiatives  and  programmes.    We  need  to  be  fair  to  the  Ministry  and  to  the 
<br/>officials, give them time because it also took time to bring the agriculture sector to where it is today.  
<br/>Of course, we are aware of the potentials and Government has set in place the strategic plan, the 
<br/>modernisation plan and allocated the results accordingly as well so that the sector performs better 
<br/>based on the potentials that are there and obvious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We fully understand and agree that the agriculture sector is of importance and well known 
<br/>to all of us.  When we look at the agriculture sector, it is important for the country, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it is just basically, food and nutrition security, and let us look at the economic gains later on.  
<br/>Food and nutrition security is important.  We have ratified the SDGs, eradication of poverty and 
<br/></span><span>food security, and we have stated it so many times in this august Parliament, it is not only about 
<br/></span><span>providing food to our people, but we must be providing them with the right food and make sure that 
<br/>we are conscious of the nutrition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in Fiji, it will surprise most of us, one of our key challenges is the triple burden of 
<br/>malnutrition and of course, we have, according to one of the surveys, problems on anaemia and 
<br/>some  food  security  relating  issues.    So,  this  is  why  if  we  look  at  the  programme  in  detail,  for 
<br/>example, what the honourable Member is suggesting, seeds and seedlings for cash crop.  It is about 
<br/>food  security,  backyard  gardening,  and  the  other  programmes  that  they  have,  that  includes  post 
<br/>disaster recoveries where the Ministry provides cuttings, seedlings, for those areas that are badly 
<br/></span><span>affected as a result of disasters that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, there are those who need seedlings for the new ventures that they are embarking 
<br/>into.  I will use the ginger farmers for example.  Again, let us also be honest with ourselves, farmers 
<br/></span><span>or  recipients  of  this  must  also  be  honest.    There  has  been  a  lot  of  instances  in  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture where they are provided with seeds, when they harvest, they sell everything, and come 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back to  the Ministry  for some more seeds for the next  season.   That  is  being  irresponsible, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  It is a basic economic rule, ‘the goose and the golden egg’.  If you want the golden 
<br/>egg, let us keep the goose.  We have to look after the goose in order to keep receiving the golden 
<br/>eggs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, with the agriculture in Fiji, particularly when we deal with the smallholder 
<br/>farmers, most of them are not in a position to even re-invest, and that is why the programmes are so 
<br/>important because, firstly, they need to be self-sufficient and have extras.  When they have extras 
<br/>then they can re-invest in the business so that they can grow and go into other financing initiatives 
<br/>as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Materials provided to dairy farmers – we are all aware of the situation in the dairy sector in 
<br/>Fiji, particularly by 2006, they started to pick up the new trend in Brucellosis and Tuberculosis (TB) 
<br/>and then when further testings were conducted, it surprised everyone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that it has 
<br/>affected almost the entire geographic regions and of course, the livestock that we have as well.  So, 
<br/>2006, 2009 tells us that because we have been neglecting the livestock sector, it has built up slowly 
<br/>and then we felt the brunt when it came to 2009.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we are honest in this august 
<br/>Parliament the recovery of the dairy sector.  The reform was good but that is more of the processing, 
<br/>the involvement of CJ Patel but when it comes to production, it is going to take a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  going  to  take  a  while,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  for  dairy  husbandry  practices,  the 
<br/>weather is the major factor now, the nutrition and the feed. There are so many things that contributes 
<br/>towards or further worsen the predicament that the dairy sector is in but in terms of the materials 
<br/>provided to dairy farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say this.  Most of what is given to the dairy 
<br/>sector in terms of the materials is part of the recovery from Brucellosis and Tuberculosis.  Why; 
<br/>because most of the affected areas if we are to sustain them in the longer term, they need what they 
<br/>call “double fencing”.  So, that the stock from one farm cannot move to the neighbouring farm.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the problems in Waito, in most of the dairies farms like Serea, animals are coming 
<br/>from one farm to the next one to the next one. To stop that and that is why a lot of assistance is 
<br/>going.  We need to contain the animal first within the farm then we can deal with the problem and 
<br/>then look at other issues that we can contribute to increase production.  I will not go into the detail 
<br/>because there are other speakers after this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Irrigation pumps and piping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, or maybe the use of technology of course, 
<br/></span><span>we need mechanisation but what do we do off season.  This is why climate change is also affecting 
<br/></span><span>agriculture in a big way and that is why they need it now.  The honourable Prime Minister has just 
<br/>commissioned the new facility in Koronivia a few weeks back.  These are the facilities that is not 
<br/>only needed in the research station but the farmers need it themselves Mr. Speaker, Sir so that we 
<br/>can be reliable and consistent in our supply so that we can meet the volumes, meet the qualities so 
<br/>that we can address the issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ploughing and harrowing of land as I have stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are thankful that 
<br/>Government is assisting not only in the provision of machines but of course, in land preparation, 
<br/>drainage work, et cetera because if we want the small or the subsistence farmers to be upgraded to 
<br/></span><span>semi-commercial, commercial level farming they need some injection.  They need some assistance 
<br/></span><span>by government and that is why we welcome such assistance but again, as I have stated, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, they need to be given time so that they can do more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Breeders, goats and sheep, it is interesting that we want to assess this now but I hope the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Member knows that the Fiji Fantastic which is the breed of the local sheep that we have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1373 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been Nacocolevu since 1980 and it took about 10 good years to just perfect the breed so that it 
<br/>adjust to Fiji’s climatic conditions and we are proud that we have that local breed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But then the honourable Minister has talked about breeding few years back that is why we 
<br/>have brought in other breeds not only for sheep but for goat.  The three cattle and the Swiss Brown 
<br/>for dairy so that we can have new stock in anticipation that when these get better, we are in a better 
<br/>position to roll out these programmes and address the issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Let us just look at the export levels over the years.  We have often debated on this in this 
<br/>august Parliament that although contribution to GDP is less than what it used to be, the economy 
<br/>has taken a complete turn from where it was years ago.  But when you look at the value of agriculture 
<br/>products, again contribution to GDP is less, but when you look at the value it keeps increasing which 
<br/>is good for the country and that, of course, is a clear indication that most of the programmes are 
<br/>already successful.  I do agree with the honourable Bala - they have a monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>system within the Ministry of Agriculture; let the honourable Minister deal with it and bring back 
<br/>the reports.  The Office of the Auditor-General will also assess the effectiveness of the programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have stated, I know the state of the Ministry when I came in 2012.  
<br/>That is why we came up with the modernisation plan.  That was the first initiative and that lead to 
<br/>the Strategic Development Plan, et cetera.  When you look at funding, the honourable Kuridrani 
<br/>said that we are decreasing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2012, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allocation to the Ministry of Agriculture was around $37 million, 
<br/>if I remember correctly.    Over the next few years, it went above the $100 million and because of 
<br/>the economic situation that we are in - he is talking about the reduction - but it is within that context.  
<br/>Previously, it was around $30 million plus so under this Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has almost 
<br/>tripled because it has gone over the $100 million mark.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the Government, to be fair to the other sectors is also providing the funds.  Therefore, I 
<br/>do not support the motion based on the arguments that I have made.  Let us allow the Ministry and 
<br/>Minister to carry on with the programmes that we are doing and we need to acknowledge all of 
<br/>them including the Minister for doing such a great work, and of course we will reap the benefits in 
<br/>the years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion by the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Professor Prasad and in doing so, I would like to begin by taking Parliament back to 2019 when in 
<br/></span><span>reply to a Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for Agriculture, I said the following:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At least the honourable Minister is seen to be doing something.  We have seen 
<br/>reports  and  heard  of  him  distributing  chicks,  handing  out  seeds  of  vegetables,  even 
<br/>though many are complaining about quantity and quality.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also said in 2019, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have heard of him starting a new initiative of 
<br/>collecting young coconut trees that have germinated after lying on the ground for a while from trees 
<br/>in  domestic  compounds.    All  well  and  good,  Mr.  Speaker,  but  the  honourable  Minister  and  his 
<br/></span><span>Ministry must realise that in this depressed economic environment where people struggle to buy 
<br/></span><span>even the cheapest of foods like salt for cooking, they are simply unable to buy food for chicks or 
<br/>manure.

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many in rural areas have access to animal manure, for sure, but those in peri-urban and other 
<br/>places do not, so it is imperative that the honourable Minister looks into this so that this initiative 
<br/>does not go to waste.  Also, in 2019, I continued by saying and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We have also received complaints from people about the manner in which the 
<br/>distribution of assistance has been happening.  These people have called our leader 
<br/>and our party office.  We have received calls from Sigatoka in particular Nabitu that 
<br/>only a few farmers had been assisted and in fact there is a claim that these farmers are 
<br/>well  acquainted  with  the  honourable  Minister  and  certain  Agriculture  Ministry 
<br/>officials at district level.  This is the second time in a year that our office has received 
<br/>calls from Nabitu and the complainants are thoroughly displeased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope the Honourable Minister looks into this matter. Then there have been 
<br/>complaints  about  a  few  advisory  councillors  and  even  one  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister has been selective about which person has been assisted based on political 
<br/>support in the last elections.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Who were they?  Give us their names. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- This is what I said, Mr. Speaker, on May 25</span><span>th</span><span>, 2019.  This 
<br/>is  precisely  the  point  of  the  motion  -  poorly  thought-out  initiatives  dreamt  up  in  isolation  by 
<br/>Ministers who are far removed from the realities on the ground, continue to be the order of the day.   
<br/>If  the  initiatives  succeeds  there  is  a  big  photo  opportunity,  if  it  fails  however  some  poor  Civil 
<br/>Servant gets the blame.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a responsible Parliament, Mr. Speaker, we should  take our role of making Minister’s 
<br/>accountable to us, seriously. We cannot allow willy-nilly policy implementation to continue without 
<br/>having brought Ministers and Civil Servants to Parliament to answer for their actions in front of a 
<br/>Committee.  I know that some will try to pull out the separation of powers argument to say that we 
<br/>cannot do this, and I would like to say that this is complete nonsense.  Powers need to be separate 
<br/>precisely because they need to keep each other accountable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministers are Ministers because they are Members of this Parliament first and not the other 
<br/>way around therefore, they are accountable to this Parliament as a first priority and this is called the 
<br/>Doctrine of Ministerial Responsibility for those Ministers who do not know this.  Why then assess 
<br/></span><span>the impact of agriculture initiatives? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, over the years of this Government’s leadership, the contribution of agriculture 
<br/>to our overall GDP is now at 8.1 percent. There is so much untapped potential here that needs to be 
<br/>utilised.  This is why we need to assess agriculture initiatives to figure out what they are doing, how 
<br/>they are doing it and whether we are doing it effectively and efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  recent  pandemic  has  shown  us  just  how  vulnerable  we  are  as  a  country  to  external 
<br/>shocks. So, just imagine if we were able to export high quality agriculture products at a good enough 
<br/>quantity to keep the economy going, and this is why I am supporting this motion and I commend 
<br/></span><span>this motion to Parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But just before I take my seat, I know that the honourable Minister for Agriculture is very 
<br/>disruptive when we speak and he was asking me who, who, who and I would just like to remind 
<br/></span><span>him of an email that was sent by the owner of a bullock in April of this year and was also sent to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Farmers in the Agricultural Sector 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me and I sent it to him with no reply at all, Mr. Speaker.  During the last sitting I was gesturing to 
<br/>him to say what happened to the email?  And this is what he does (hand gesture).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  why  I  support  this  motion  because  we  need  to  have  a  look  at  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiatives brought in by the Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  we  witness  an  exercise  in  futility  by  the 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad.  We all know that this is an actual ploy by him to get some airtime.  
<br/>He forgot about the airtime he was getting in New Zealand so he is trying to express himself here. 
<br/>He is looking for some airtime so he can, as usual, pontificate and try to play hero.  The truth is that 
<br/>he manipulates, he twists and he conveniently omits facts and, plain and simple, opines untruth in 
<br/>this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Lies!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is the only reply that he can have and at the same time, what he is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>doing and what is most important, Sir, he is misleading the people in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prasad refers to visiting locations such as Navua, visiting farm 
<br/>roads and seeing growing grass – why is he only visiting farm roads now?  Is it because elections 
<br/>are near, honourable Prasad.  Where was he when our government agencies were actually clearing 
<br/>the farm roads and assisting and supporting the farmers over the months and years, Mr. Speaker?  
<br/>This is all that he can observe from a singular visit.  It is actually surprising that honourable Prasad 
<br/>is oblivious to the information, not only shared by the Fijian Government but agencies such as the 
<br/>United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (UNFAO).  Please, go and do your research, 
<br/>honourable Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Agriculture  Census  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Mr.  Speaker,  in 
<br/>partnership with the UNFAO indicates (and this is important information - I wish you would read 
<br/>it, honourable Prasad), indicates that 190,460 agriculture household members participates in at least 
<br/>one agriculture activity – that is crops, livestock, fishery or forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the 2020 Agriculture Census, Mr. Speaker, a total value of crop production in Fiji 
<br/>was recorded at $2.5 billion, Mr. Speaker.  Temporary crops were valued at $2.3 billion whilst a 
<br/>$163.6 million were permanent crops.  The permanent crops are mainly those that are exported, 
<br/></span><span>whilst  $2.3  million  worth  of  crops  are  actually  circulating  within  the  Fijian  economy  as  market 
<br/></span><span>produce or as subsistence crops, where families actually grow food for themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  programmes  -  this  government  -  are  actually  targeted  towards 
<br/>unlocking our potential by bringing in innovative and new ideas.  We have actually strengthened 
<br/>our programmes which have proven that our agriculture sector crossed $100 million in exports.  In 
<br/>fact,  with  kava  being  one  of  our  largest  exports,  we  have  seen  how  Fijians  have  now  actually 
<br/>diversified into niche products.  For instance, a few weeks ago we saw samples of kava cookies in 
<br/>the market and why not, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  hope  all  the  farmers  are  listening  to  these  outrageous  claims  by  honourable  Professor 
<br/></span><span>Prasad for this is nothing new.  We care for our farmers and we actually support their expansions.  
<br/>Our very own Fijian organic and Fijian produce emblems are getting attraction both locally and 
<br/>internationally  and  I will come back to  the  Fijian organic branding, Sir, because he needs to  be 
<br/></span><span>taught a lesson about organic stuff.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our co-operatives have increased their farm mechanisation programmes either sugarcane, 
<br/>rice or ordinary farmers.  They are actually adapting to new technologies and moving up the value 
<br/>chain.  We have seen how our grassroots businesses step out of their comfort zones when they are 
<br/>given the right support and empowerment.   Our farmers particularly the young ones are moving 
<br/>and progressing towards value adding and exports now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Gavoka  talks  about  models.    We  have  actually  piloted 
<br/>successful models through our co-operatives whereby the government, the private sector, banks and 
<br/>donor agencies actually partner to fund particular profit making operations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a co-
<br/>operative is producing cassava, </span><span>vudi</span><span> and </span><span>kumala</span><span> chips in Nabulini.  Never before had we actually 
<br/>seen  this  but  this  is  happening  right  now.    Successful  Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPP)  models 
<br/>established and implemented, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week, I actually talked about how well exports of turmeric, kava and spices are actually 
<br/>doing in designations like the U.S including our traditional crops like </span><span>dalo</span><span> and cassava to Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand.  This has not eventuated by just magic, Mr. Speaker, Sir but through well-crafted 
<br/>targeted  policies  and  assistance  by  the  Fijian  Government  and  the  data  for  all  of  this  is  freely 
<br/>available, honourable Professor Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this week when I was sharing vital information with this august Parliament about 
<br/>how the Government is mainstreaming climate change into crucial trade and economic policies, one 
<br/>of the honourable Members on the other side saying that it was all unnecessary information.  This 
<br/>is why he has no idea about the impact of climate change on Fiji’s agricultural sector.  He means to 
<br/>discredit the actual research done by scientists and international organisations.  However, he needs 
<br/>to  learn  that  agriculture  production  is  affected  globally  by  increasing  temperatures,  change  in 
<br/>rainfall patterns and more frequent and intense rain and weather effects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it were not for these government initiatives that we have put in place, Fiji’s agriculture 
<br/>sector would have suffered to the brink of collapse.  What are other reasons why we have suffered?  
<br/>You look at 1987, it is a small fact but it is a big trap.  In 1987 we had a massive brain drain, we did 
<br/>not have enough veterinarians (VETs), we had none, today we have quite a few.  We had to bring 
<br/>them back and just the last couple of points that I wanted to raise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me give the honourable Professor Prasad a lesson about organics.  You can come here 
<br/>and pontificate about organics and say, “Oh, we should be exporting more organic material out to 
<br/></span><span>the world.”  It does not happen overnight you need to get the soil tested, ensure that you certify; the 
<br/></span><span>certifying  organisation  Pacific  Organic  &amp;  Ethical  Trade  Community  (POETCom)  is  the  only 
<br/>certifying organisation that will allow us entry into the US into Australia.  Now we are fortunate 
<br/>enough that the certifying authority has actually  come here, learn because  you pontificate about 
<br/>these things without learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, we have a massive organic industry that we can turn our little organic industry into.  
<br/>As a matter of fact, the honourable Seruiratu will tell you our ginger coming out from some places 
<br/>in Fiji is 500 tonnes more powerful than other gingers in the world, but we must manage it and do 
<br/>it carefully so we get access into the markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  has  no  idea  about  organics  and  you  should  not  pontificate  about  it 
<br/>because  we  are  supporting  as  many  organic  farmers  as  we  can  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce, 
<br/>Trade, Tourism and Transport has the organic labelling ready for all our organic farmers.  This is 
<br/></span><span>why we are now able to send organic turmeric out to the US.  You do not listen nor do you read 
<br/></span><span>about it, honourable Professor Prasad.

<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should stop talking about telling the truth because he never tells 
<br/>the truth.  This really hurts me when he says the ‘silent 25’.  I am not silent, she is not silent, he is 
<br/>not silent, we are not silent, we are unified honourable Prasad. We are unified behind one leader, 
<br/>we are not leaderless and we are not rudderless like you are.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you  Sir  for  this  opportunity  to  make  my  contribution  in 
<br/>support of the motion before Parliament.  Before that, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister 
<br/>for these programmes and initiatives and he is hardworking, unfortunately Sir, the result has not 
<br/>been impressive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the honourable Bala’s statement regarding the internal 
<br/>control.  Sir, his Ministry of Youth and Sports is one of the 22 government agencies that failed to 
<br/>reach the timelines of the submissions of draft financial statements 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be brief, we understand that all these programmes and initiatives are 
<br/>still  in  progress  and  this  motion  is  timely  to  ensure  that  standard  process  and  procedures  are 
<br/>complied with by the Ministry.  We need to know whether internal control measures were in place 
<br/>to ensure the efficient and effective implementation of these programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  important  that  we  should  ensure  that  proper  management  of 
<br/>expenditure is fundamental to ensuring value for money in delivering services to the community.  
<br/>We need to have cost-effective internal controls within the purchasing and payment systems as it 
<br/>plays an important part in ensuring that funds are not being misused, no favouritism, avoid over 
<br/>expenditure and corruption. Unfortunately, Sir, if you look at the Auditor-General’s Audit Report 
<br/>on Economic Service Sector of 2018, it highlighted some of the anomalies in procurement of goods 
<br/>and  services  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  which  cast  doubt  on  the  Ministry’s  capability, 
<br/>transparency, accountability and integrity in the implementation of these programme and initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Auditor-General reported that instances were noted where quotations 
<br/>were  not  obtained  in  a  timely  manner.    Instances  were  noted  where  procurement  were  made  in 
<br/>invalid  and  expired  quotations.    Local  purchase  orders  were  raised  and  issued  before  the 
<br/>procurement request forms were approved. In most instances, local purchase orders were not raised 
<br/>for the purchase of ginger seeds, hire of trucks for cutting and land facility programmes, therefore, 
<br/>Sir, we have doubt that these programmes will be properly managed by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go further, may I ask the honourable Minister, was there any study 
<br/></span><span>done  before  these  programmes  were  approved  and  implemented?    I  share  this,  Sir,  because 
<br/>considering the economic and social impacts of these programmes.  If I was in his place as Minister, 
<br/>Sir,  first,  I  would  ensure  that  internal  controls  and  standard  processes  and  procedures  are  being 
<br/>complied with, construct more farm roads especially in villages and rural communities, establish 
<br/>collection centres for rural and maritime communities.  We have noted  that $1 million has been 
<br/>allocated to one of these programmes, Sir.  That $1 million is enough to build 10 collection centres 
<br/>around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Yes,  it  would  have  been  better  used  in  constructing  collection 
<br/>centres.    Construct  cold  storage  facilities  for  productive  farming  communities,  organise  market 
<br/>outlets, provide machines such as diggers for land clearing and drainage purposes, provide subsidy 
<br/></span><span>to  successful  semi  and  commercial  farmers  like  in  the  sugar  industry.    We  always  ask  why  the 
<br/></span><span>assistance given to sugarcane farmers cannot be given to non-sugarcane farmers.

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is why I said from the above, was there any study done in regards to 
<br/>the approval of these projects?  But since it is already on the ground, the only way we need to ensure 
<br/>that the taxpayers’ money are properly utilised is to conduct  an investigation or review of these 
<br/>programmes as proposed in the motion.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- My contribution to the motion will be very brief.  To start off with, like 
<br/>all of us on this side, we do not support the motion that has been put forward and when people on 
<br/>the other side compare us with our neighbours, do they understand the economies of scale.  The 
<br/>average size of a farm in Fiji is around four hectares, the average size of a farm in Australia is about 
<br/>100 hectares - the economies of scale plays a very important part. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  have  said  that  we  are  not  contributing.    I  would  like  to  further 
<br/>elaborate  on  honourable  Seruiratu’s  comment  about  the  dairy  industry.    The  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government has continuously been putting money into the dairy industry.  Do they understand what 
<br/>the dairy industry has gone through?  It is not about talking to a farmer for a few minutes that you 
<br/>will understand what the dairy industry has been through, you need to be in the dairy industry to 
<br/>know what it has gone through.  Every farmer has tried its level best to get the milk production up, 
<br/>together with direct assistance from the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year in and year out, the Fijian Government has put money into the dairy industry. It is not 
<br/>because our farmers are lazy, it is not because there is not enough support given to the dairy industry. 
<br/>It is because of the diseases that have been prevalent in the industry, that is why the production has 
<br/>come down and it is not because of the Fiji First Government. It occurs because of the Party leaders, 
<br/>Government and the other Government’s before them.  They have continuously failed to look at the 
<br/>dairy  industry.  They  have  failed  to  look  at  the  testing  methods,  they  have  failed  to  look  at  the 
<br/>husbandry practices, they have failed to look at the support services. That is why the dairy industry 
<br/>is what it is today.  Had they done their job that time, the dairy industry would have been flourishing 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without the Fiji First Government’s restructure of the dairy industry, there would not have 
<br/>been a dairy industry. Do you people know that? The dairy industry was run to the ground, they 
<br/>interjected, restructured the industry and the farmers are now getting the support that they needed. 
<br/>We are already in the downturn where we have lost more than 50 percent of our cattle because of 
<br/>the diseases. But the Government, through its initiatives and livestock rehabilitation programme, 
<br/>they have managed to get this dairy industry up and hopefully with the continuous support we will 
<br/></span><span>get where we and the farmers are working very hard regarding that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  talked  about  exports.  Yes,  we  may  not  be  exporting  vegetables,  food  and 
<br/>everything but through our markets, we have plenty of fruits and vegetables in the markets. Our 
<br/>citizens are getting the nutrition they deserve. We are working out the small seeding programme, 
<br/>seed distribution and everything else is working well. The people are getting the food, people are 
<br/>able to sustain themselves. Sustainable agriculture is what the Government wants. We do not want 
<br/>to have programmes that we are not able to sustain for a prolonged period.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we may not be exporting the fruits but look at fruits like dragon fruit and 
<br/></span><span>guava.  There is plenty fruits supply in Fiji now. People are able to enjoy good quality fruits at a 
<br/></span><span>reasonable  price  rather  than  paying  for  the  imported  ones.  We  cannot  write-off  our  Agriculture 
<br/>sector  and  say  that  the  Government’s  initiative  in  the  Agriculture  sector  is  not  working  -  it  is 
<br/>working. The Government has continued to develop infrastructure so that farmers have access to 
<br/></span><span>the markets.  They are able to bring their produce to the market, get a good value for them because 
<br/></span><span>of the good quality they are able to deliver.

<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I sit down, I would like to add on that meeting 25, 26 people 
<br/>in  a  group  meeting  in  Bua  does  not  mean  that  they  have  met  all  the  people  and  all  agricultural 
<br/>farmers. They do not represent the total agricultural sector. If they have to do it then they should 
<br/>have started from the beginning of the term, met all the farmers, found out what their difficulties 
<br/>are, air that continuously here and not come at the last time to get some political airtime and start 
<br/>talking about the farmers. Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that note, I do not support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  contribution  to  the  debate. 
<br/>Honourable Members for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting 
<br/>times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
