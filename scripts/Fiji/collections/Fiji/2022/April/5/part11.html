<div><span>Review Report - 2016-2017 Audit Report Financial Statements of Government and  
<br/>2016-2017 Agency Financial Statements of the Ministry of Economy  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Report provides the Committee review findings 
<br/>for the Report of the Auditor-General on the 2016-2017 Audit Report on the Financial Statements of 
<br/>Government and the 2016-2017 Agency Financial Statements of the Ministry of Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) is established under Section 151 of the Constitution 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji, and the Audit Act 1969 further specifies the powers of the Auditor-General 
<br/>to audit the whole of Government Financial Statements and the Reports of all entities of Government.  
<br/>At least once every year, the Auditor-General must report to Parliament on the audits conducted and 
<br/>on other significant matters the Auditor-General wishes to bring to the attention of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  reviewed  the  three  parts  of  the  2016-2017  Audit  Report  on  the  Financial 
<br/>Statements  of  Government  and  the  2016-2017  Agency  Financial  Statements  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy Audit Report and these include:

<div><span>Part C: 2016-2017 Agency Financial Statement of Ministry of Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  that  the  OAG  had  issued  33  audit  opinions  on  the  2017  financial 
<br/>statements of State agencies.  Out of the 33 Ministries and Departments out of which 21 or 64 percent 
<br/>were unmodified opinions and 12 or 36 percent were modified opinion.  Therefore, in most cases, 
<br/>material misstatements, individually or in aggregate were not noted in the audits which would affect 
<br/>the financial statements of agency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted in the review that there were matters highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General in its Audit Report which was a matter of concern that the Ministry of Economy with other 
<br/>relevant Ministries and Departments needs to strengthen and addressed in moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended the efforts of the Ministry of Economy in trying to address the 
<br/>gaps  highlighted  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General,  however  other  relevant  Ministries  and 
<br/>Department  Heads  should  work  closely  with  the  Audit  Office  to  address  the  gaps  identified  and 
<br/>implement the Committee recommendations accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank my fellow Committee members, namely, honourable Alvick 
<br/></span><span>Maharaj  (Chairperson),  honourable  Ro  Teimumu  Kepa,  honourable  Virendra  Lal  and  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Aseri Radrodro for their efforts and contributions in the scrutiny process and in the final compilation 
<br/>of this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, I wish to inform the House that the Committee continues to discuss and deliberate 
<br/>with  interviewees  from  Ministries/Departments  on  their  commitments,  implementation  and 
<br/>monitoring  of  the  SDGs.  It  is  also  important  to  note  that  most  Government  Ministries  and 
<br/>Departments  are  working  towards  achieving  their  contribution  towards  Fijiâ€™s  5-Year  &amp;  20-Year 
<br/>National Development Plan in line with the relevant SDG targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I now commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
