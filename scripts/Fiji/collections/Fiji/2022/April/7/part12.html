<h3>INVESTMENT FIJI BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>INVESTMENT FIJI BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 
<br/>Thursday, 10th February, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Investment Fiji Bill 2022 (Bill No. 5 of 2022) be debated, voted upon and be passed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Investment Fiji Bill 2022 was tabled 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Parliament on 10th February, 2022 as Bill No. 5 of 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had been referred to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights for review.  Following public consultations, the Standing Committee tabled its report 
<br/>on the review of the Bill in Parliament on Monday, 4th April, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2017  the  Fijian  Government  engaged  the  International  Finance 
<br/>Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank Group to undertake a review of Fiji’s Investment Framework.  
<br/></span><span>Since the engagement the following have been achieved: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>An Investment Reform map was developed to provide a pathway for the Fijian Government 
<br/>to align the investment policy reforms with short and medium term National Development 
<br/>Goals; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>An Investment Policy Statement was developed based on the findings of the Investment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reform Map (IRM) to serve as the guiding policy for investments in Fiji; and   
<br/>The  Foreign  Investment  Act  1999  was  reviewed  and  as  a  result  of  the  review,  the 
<br/>Investment Act 2021, which is the new Investment Act was enacted by Parliament on 3rd 
<br/>June, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Investment Act amongst other things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Repeals the 1999 Act; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishes  legal,  social  and  economic  principles  with  the  development  of  investment 
<br/>activities in Fiji;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Defines the rights, duties and responsibilities of domestic and foreign investors; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provides equity for investors with transparent, reliable, efficient and fair rules of procedure 
<br/></span><span>within the framework of the International Treaties and Agreements to which Fiji is a party; 
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Removes the issuance of Foreign Investment Registration Certificate by Investment Fiji; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Removes the power for Investment Fiji to conduct investigations and inspections necessary 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the purpose of regulating foreign investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the removal and Investment Fiji’s function to issue Foreign Investment Registration 
<br/>Certificate, Sir, and its power to conduct investigations and inspections, a review of the Investment 
<br/>Act  1980  was  conducted  to  realign  the  functions  of  Investment  Fiji  in  order  to  complement  the 
<br/>changes brought about by the new Investment Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Investment Fiji Bill 2022 which is the outcome of the review of the 1980 Act, therefore 
<br/>seeks to replace the 1980 Act to realign the mandate and functions of Investment Fiji to that of a 
<br/>promotional  agency.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  purpose  of  realigning  the  mandate  and  functions  of 
<br/>Investment Fiji is to enable Investment Fiji to move away from being a regulator of foreign investors 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Fiji and to focus primarily on the role of being a promotional agency for attracting both foreign 
<br/>and domestic investors to invest in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, proposed the following as the new mandate of Investment Fiji: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment promotion: to increase the contribution made by investors in Fiji’s economy 
<br/>by promoting Fiji’s competitive and comparative advantages; 
<br/>Investment  facilitation:  to  facilitate  all  necessary  information  and  services  to  assist 
<br/>prospective and existing investors to meet their specific investment project needs; 
<br/>Export promotion: to facilitate and promote the development and expansion of export; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>After-care: to provide investors with assistance to overcome any challenges to the growth 
<br/>and  expansion  of  their  activities  and  support  investors  with  their  expansion  and 
<br/>diversification objectives; 
<br/>Policy advocacy: to collect information and raise awareness on the challenges faced by 
<br/>investors and recommend reform measures to improve Fiji’s investment and business-
<br/>enabling environment; and 
<br/>Image building: to promote Fiji as a desirable investment destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, apart from the Committee, a number of consultations were held 
<br/></span><span>in respect to the formulation and drafting of the Bill with various agencies which I do not want to 
<br/>go into because the Committee is fully aware of that.  In short, that is the introduction to the Bill.  I 
<br/>could go onto the different clauses, but I am sure the honourable Members do want to speak on that.  
<br/>Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a realignment of Investment Fiji, the agency, to fit in to the new 
<br/>Investment Act and use it as a promotional agency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have seen like last night, the honourable Prime Minister was at one of the outsourcing 
<br/>companies that recently was formed during the pandemic itself, and as we have seen, 3,000 were 
<br/>jobs created in that sector during the pandemic in the past two years.  As a result of that, we have 
<br/>now  seen  a  huge  interest,  Government  has  provided  $200,000  to  Outsource  Fiji,  the  Australian 
<br/>Government is now partnering with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember when we had mentioned this in the last session, people from the other side were 
<br/>saying, “oh, it is all pie in the sky stuff” but actually it is not.  It is about a hundred thousand jobs 
<br/>being created.  This is precisely what Investment Fiji is going to do, because they are going out now 
<br/>and  targeting  Australian  companies  that  used  to,  for  example,  have  their  outsourcing  centres  in 
<br/>Philippines and India.  Because of the pandemic, now they want to bring it closer to home.  So, 
<br/></span><span>Investment Fiji’s job now is to get those investors to come to Fiji, we have got the Fijian Government 
<br/></span><span>and Australian Government working together to promote Fiji as a destination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have now got Telstra that is going to buy Digicel, they also do a lot outsourcing and it 
<br/>creates a lot of jobs.  In fact, what they are saying is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there will be a hundred 
<br/>thousand jobs created alone in the BPO sector in the next 10 years.  So, that is Investment Fiji’s job, 
<br/>to now go and promote, hand hold investors, not simply bring them in and leave them alone in a 
<br/>lurch, but to hand hold them, make sure that they do the right investments and ensure that they feel 
<br/>confident enough to continue to invest in Fiji, which of course will not only be good in terms of 
<br/>foreign reserves, in particular, a lot of them do a lot of exports, but also in the creation of jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank  you for allowing me to speak on this today.  
<br/>Reforms  and  modernisation  of  business  processes  for  us  are  no  longer  an  option,  but  they  have 
<br/>actually become a norm.  It is a must for any nation that it is focused on growth and only quality 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>1016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sustainable growth.  Effective analysis and implementation of changes in business processes will 
<br/>not only help the Government in responding to the changing dynamics and societal needs, but also 
<br/>enable competitiveness in the international environment.  Also the effectiveness of implementation 
<br/>of reforms will improve the use of public resources to enhance delivery of services, transparency, 
<br/>accountability and citizens’ trust in our Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with the above and aligned to the international best practices, Sir, Investment Fiji Bill 
<br/>provides  Investment  Fiji  the  much  desired  scope  to  transform  into  fully-pledged  investment 
<br/>promotion agency, an agency that is focussed on and is well equipped to serve investors, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>both foreign and domestically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill will effectively allow Investment Fiji to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>channel  its  resources  and  manpower  towards  undertaking  promotional  and  marketing 
<br/>activities; 
<br/>develop investment attraction strategies; and  
<br/>focus on investment facilitation and after care (as mentioned by the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  a  significant  shift,  Mr.  Speaker,  from  their  current  monitoring,  enforcement  and 
<br/>administrative task. Investment Fiji was used as a scapegoat by agencies.  Even until today there are 
<br/>agencies that would prefer Investment Fiji to undertake screening of investors, but Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>this is not the role of the investment promotion agency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At present, Investment Fiji is required to ensure that investors are adhering to requirements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and legislations in place and they undertake policing roles and enforce disciplinary action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  providing  support  guidance  and  assistance  to  investors  had  become  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>secondary Key Performance Indicator for Investment Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Investment Fiji Bill, therefore, will equip Investment Fiji to prepare itself and have the 
<br/>right attitude with the clear focus on what Fiji needs.  Investment Fiji needs to be out there attracting 
<br/>and bringing more efficiency in terms of efficiency-seeking investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  extend  the  Ministry’s  appreciation  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee  also  for  their  Report  and  the  necessary  consultations.  There  were  couple  of 
<br/></span><span>recommendations  that  they  had  also  said  in  the  Standing  Committee  that  was,  firstly  that  the 
<br/></span><span>respective institutions which actually deal with investment continue to collaborate in order to provide 
<br/>an investment environment that is appealing to investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wish to inform the House that the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport 
<br/>has been at the helm of implementing business reform and investment reforms and this is one of the 
<br/>many.    Reforms  have  been  undertaken  thus  far  including  the  Investment  Act,  Digitalisation  of 
<br/>Business Registration, Digitalisation of Tax Registration, Removal of Business Licence and Online 
<br/>Business Portal are all focussed on creating a conducive environment for investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these has only been made possible with the collaboration and support of each approval 
<br/>agency, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Also there exists the Cabinet Mandated Investment Facilitation Committee 
<br/>and the Doing Business Taskforce.  These Committee comprise of Permanent Secretaries, Heads of 
<br/>Organisations, Directors and Chief Executive Officers forming the overarching umbrella to ensure 
<br/></span><span>efficient and effective implementation of business and investment related reforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  small  point  that  was  mentioned  by  the  Committee,  Sir,  that  adequate  resources  are 
<br/>provided to  Investment  Fiji to enable it to effectively carry out its work whether it be investment 
<br/>promotion functions or assisting relevant institutions in building capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  begun  paving  its  way  for  this  particular  transformation 
<br/>already.  The Investment Fiji Board has worked on an extensive five-year strategic plan and looking 
<br/>forward  in  the  2022-2023  National  Budget,  we  will  prioritise  provision  of  adequate  resources  to 
<br/>Investment Fiji.  This will not be ad hoc but structured and based on the five-year strategic plan which 
<br/>will set down the key deliverables. The Ministry will continue to provide the necessary support, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also another recommendation that came up from the Committee was that 
<br/>there be a monitoring and evaluation system that is set up which effectively monitors the work carried 
<br/>out by Investment Fiji.  The Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport as a line Ministry 
<br/>has  maintained  a  clear  line  of  reporting  of  performance  of  Investment  Fiji  through  mandatory 
<br/>quarterly, reporting of agreed key performance indicators. In order to ensure that there is transparency 
<br/>and accountability in its reporting, Investment Fiji has a monitoring and an evaluation system and 
<br/>they are able to effectively monitor the work that they carry out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  stated  earlier,  Investment  Fiji  in  conjunction  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Market  Development  Facility  has  developed  a  five-year  strategic  plan.    This  is  really  to  ensure 
<br/>redesigning and redefining their new role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the Bill, Sir, this Bill not only alludes to remodelling of Investment Fiji but 
<br/>provides avenues for all other relevant agencies such as the Registrar of Companies, Department of 
<br/>Environment to assume their due responsibilities as per their respective legislations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have managed to get the agencies to understand the difference between investment and 
<br/>investor. When it comes to promoting Fiji as an investment destination, it is Investment Fiji.  When 
<br/>it comes to  providing support and guidance to  investors, it is  Investment  Fiji.   When it comes to 
<br/>implementation of investment projects, the relevant approval and licencing agencies, they need to 
<br/>ensure that set legal provisions are met.  When it comes to the investor entering Fiji, it is simply the 
<br/>Fijian Immigration Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian  Immigration Department  will also  bring into effect  regulations that will ensure 
<br/>proper screening of investors before they are issued with an investor permit.  Therefore, if a foreign 
<br/>investor  violates  permit  requirements,  then  the  Immigration  Department,  in  accordance  with  its 
<br/></span><span>legislation will take necessary action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment-related reforms have set a clear pathway, Mr. Speaker.  Everyone is on the same 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>page and has a clear understanding of their roles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as Fiji positions itself for post-pandemic economic growth, the Fijian Government will 
<br/>continue to strip away unnecessary regulations, processes and procedures to create a pro-business 
<br/>culture.  Our  ambition  is  to  make  Fiji  the  desired investment  destination  for  all  investors.  We  are 
<br/>taking a brisk walk towards uncluttering the archaic burdens left since the Colonial era.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to realise that those countries that are able to provide the best incentives and best 
<br/>business  environment  will  be  able  to  capitalise  on  the  opportunities.    We  need  to  be  one  of  the 
<br/>countries that is able to be at the top of the game, Sir.  We cannot afford to be a “business as usual”, 
<br/>we need to do things differently.  It is high time we collectively moved away from the unnecessary 
<br/>administrative  and  cumbersome  processes,  and  create  an  investor-friendly  and  cost-effective 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business environment.  To boost this reform agenda, Investment Fiji Bill 2022 is a critical piece in 
<br/>the puzzle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  World  Bank  Group  and  International  Finance 
<br/>Corporation (IFC) for their continued support to the Ministry, and I wish to especially thank, Mr. 
<br/>Deva De Silva who  ensured that we are  able to  get  the right  technical  advisors on board  for this 
<br/>particular project.  The Ministry also led by the Permanent Secretary and Investment Fiji Board have 
<br/>worked  tirelessly  for  the  reforms  to  be  realized  and  I  congratulate  them  all  on  this  particular 
<br/>achievement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Sir, I have just come back from a small visit to the UAE and I was told there, 
<br/>and this is a great example for us, that in Estonia, Sir, the entire country is completely digitalised.  
<br/>There are only two things that you have to appear in person; one is when you die and the second is 
<br/>when you get divorced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, in my view, there is not much to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>said about this Bill because it does not in the end, say very much.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji was formerly the Economic Development Board, then it became the Fiji Trade 
<br/></span><span>and  Investment  Board, then the Fiji  Islands Trade and  Investment  Board, then the Fiji  Trade and 
<br/>Investment Bureau, and then this Government renamed it to Investment Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  this  might  be  a  shorter  and  a  snappier  name,  but  if  you  ask  the  average 
<br/>foreign investor and also domestic investors about the effectiveness of Investment Fiji, you are not 
<br/>going  to  get  a  very  positive  response.  It  is  regarded  as  bureaucratic,  uncommercial  and  focussed 
<br/>completely on the wrong things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All this Bill does, Mr. Speaker, is set out in very elaborate and fancy words the mandate of 
<br/>Investment Fiji as read by the honourable Attorney-General at clause 5, the functions of Investment 
<br/>Fiji at clause 6 and the functions of the Board in clause 9.  It does not really say anything useful even 
<br/>there, in my view.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We see a whole lot of very fancy words about investment facilitation, export promotion and 
<br/>increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of Government services, capacity building, et cetera.  But 
<br/>these fancy words, Sir, mean nothing if you do not deliver, that is the important point.  And as usual, 
<br/>the Government has always talked big.  They come here, use fancy words, talk big, but they cannot 
<br/></span><span>deliver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole purpose of this Bill, Mr. Speaker, is to work hand in hand with the Investment Act 
<br/>that was passed last year.  Last year, the Government voted the Investment Act into law, but that law 
<br/>is not yet in force.    Why?  It is because the Investment Act … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Use your brain!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … needs regulations to make it work and the Government has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not yet issued the regulations.  It is almost more than six months, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> June last year, the Investment Act, as I have said, was passed and we heard a lot of 
<br/>fancy words from the honourable Minister for Trade.  He talked about modernisation of the legal 
<br/>framework for investment, he talked about implementing the vision of the Government to transform 
<br/>Fiji, he talked about international best practices, and on and on they went.  What happened then, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker? Nothing! Nothing in the last six-seven months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1019 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One year on, the Investment Act 2021 is still not in force because the Investment Act needs 
<br/>sector specific regulations to make it work, and no one has prepared those regulations.  Normally, as 
<br/>I have said before in this Parliament, Mr. Speaker, a good minister would bring draft regulations as 
<br/>well for the committee to consider, but this Government never does that.  They never do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, what does Investment Fiji do - the agency that is being changed by the Bill 
<br/>before  us?    It  just  carries  on  under  the  old  Foreign  Investment  Act  1999,  the  very  Act  that  this 
<br/>Government says is inefficient and out of date.  It is still there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this Government has been in power, one way or the other, for almost 15 years 
<br/>and in  that time, it has done nothing, in  my view, to  change the legal  framework for investment, 
<br/>except to make it more complicated.  Ask any foreign investor about the frustrations, and they go on, 
<br/>on a daily basis.  We do not have the ease of doing business now but for a long time, we know what 
<br/>the result was and this is a perfect illustration of how this Government works.  All talk, no action, 
<br/>fancy speeches, fancy words but zero delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Why, Mr. Speaker?  It is because this Government is hopelessly disorganised.  Disorganised!  
<br/>They write fancy speeches and make promises which they cannot deliver. As I have said before in 
<br/></span><span>this Parliament, Mr. Speaker, laws are being rushed, laws are being made without consideration of 
<br/></span><span>the environment in which the law is going to be implemented, whether it is effective or whether it is 
<br/>efficient,  those  are  the  things  that  they  do  not  consider.      I  mean,  as  the  honourable  Minister  is 
<br/>famously known to be saying, “What is the reality of the matter”.  The reality of the matter is that, 
<br/>big talk, no action.  That is the reality of the matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I really do not have a very strong view on this Bill because it really says nothing.  
<br/>It does not help.   As I have said, apart from all the fancy words, it is nothing.  But the most important 
<br/>thing,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  one  needs  to  understand  and,  again,  this  is  a  very  good  example  of  a 
<br/>Government which tries to bring laws, which says that this law is going to do all this, promises that 
<br/>it is going to deliver that, but the effectiveness of those laws and the way it is implemented has been 
<br/>a total failure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if you look at the ADB Classification Report, it clearly pointed out that foreign 
<br/>direct investment has been modest, averaging about 6.9 percent of GDP during 2014 to 2019 and has 
<br/>been  very,  very  volatile.    This  too,  again,  after  the  Election  which  was  supposed  to  mean  true 
<br/>democracy and good governance but we all know, Mr. Speaker, that far from having true democracy 
<br/>and an efficient government, we are continuing with the dictatorial style of governance that we saw 
<br/></span><span>before 2014.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, economists know that critical components of the GDP includes; consumption, 
<br/>investment,  Government  expenditure  and  trade.    Sir,  we  have  seen  in  the  last  15  years  that  this 
<br/>Government has borrowed, it has spent and whatever modest growth that the ADB talks about from 
<br/>2010 to 2019 – 3.3 percent average growth, a very modest growth.  In fact, the economy, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>contracted in 2019 by 0.4 percent, so they had all these years to look at these laws and the investment 
<br/>environment, but they did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, and there is a motion after this on poverty, the poverty level actually increased 
<br/>as per the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) Report 2019-2020.  I know in the last 
<br/>Budget  Speech,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  or  his  speech  writers  quoted  John  Keynes  and 
<br/>obviously, he did not understand, he is like a C-grade student who probably just reads half the theory.  
<br/>But he should read Adam Smith and look at what he said about the investment environment.  I will 
<br/>just quote one section of what he said, and I quote:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state in which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is very important, Mr. Speaker, - the trust and confidence in Government.  Investors can 
<br/>look  at  things,  like  rate  of  return,  inflation,  liquidity,  tax  benefits,  frequency  of  return,  risk  of 
<br/>investment, safety of investment which are normal things that investors look at but beyond that, they 
<br/>look at the administration of justice, the independence of institutions and the trust that they have in 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, trust and confidence in Government and its overall administration of the justice 
<br/>and policies is the most critical factor.  In fact, it is a binding constrain, and one of the reasons why 
<br/>we  have  not  had  good  private  investment  in  this  country,  including  foreign  direct  investment  is 
<br/>because of the lack of trust and confidence.  You talk to foreign investors, you go and talk about Fiji 
<br/>Revenue &amp; Customs Service (FRCS), you go and talk about Titles Office, you look at the registration 
<br/>of companies, the digitisation that they plan to do, how is it working?  He knows that, the honourable 
<br/>Minister knows that these things are not working.  Investors and potential investors are frustrated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, of course Mr. Speaker, the overall macro-economic environment.  When you run large 
<br/></span><span>deficits, when you borrow and spend and when your growth strategy is borrowing and spending, the 
<br/></span><span>private investors are worried because they know, and this is why investors and businesses everywhere 
<br/>and in every country are worried about what Government does, how it spends because ultimately, 
<br/>the  burden  of  that  debt  not  only  falls  on  the  people  but  it  also  falls  on  the  businesses.    This 
<br/>Government has not given that kind of confidence for investors in its own economic policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, that investors look at is consistency in policies.  I know the 
<br/>honourable Minister was threatening some people during his consultations, “The only way you can 
<br/>guarantee consistency is if this Government is voted back into power.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know they are getting desperate.  They are spewing all these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>racist filth as well, they are getting desperate! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  You  can  see  all  these  racist  filth  being  spewed  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister himself about 1987 and what Indo-Fijians went through, but that is for 
<br/>another day, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, let me come back to this idea of trust and confidence in government because as 
<br/>economists, we understand and they must also understand that confidence and trust in government 
<br/>policy, government approach, the overall governance is very, very important about creating the right 
<br/>investment climate.  You can have all these laws, you can change Investment Fiji laws, you can make 
<br/>it a promotion agency, but if the overall environment is not conducive for investors and if they do 
<br/>not have the confidence, investors are not some concrete walls behind all these physical investment 
<br/>infrastructure individuals who also understand and need confidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  confidence  and  trust  can  improve  or  reduce  compliance  cost,  lower 
<br/>transaction cost and lower cost of doing business. These are very important things and the style that 
<br/>this Government has used over the years, they have been ramming it through Bills under Standing

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  State  institutions  are  not  run  well, 
<br/></span><span>when they are not efficient, when they do not demonstrate credibility and fairness, it does not create 
<br/></span><span>trust  in  the Government  and confidence in  the country. The other example are these immigration 
<br/>laws.  If you look at countries around the world, they have very clear rules about getting a Permanent 
<br/>Resident,  getting  an  investment  visa  and  then  over  a  period  of  time  getting  citizenship.  When 
<br/>investors look at Fiji, Fiji is not the only country where there are people out there in the world you 
<br/>are going to rush to Fiji to invest just because someone says we are a great country, we have such 
<br/>good governance and we have such good leaders.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not run away from Fiji.  I actually 
<br/>went away for my studies. I was here in the 1987 </span><span>coup</span><span>, I was arrested at Sukuna Park and went to 
<br/>CPS.  Do not tell me anything like that. Do not lie. I went for studies and I came back to Fiji. I never, 
<br/>unlike some other academics in quest to get a job in Australia ever gave up my Fijian citizenship. 
<br/>Even though at that time I would have got a better job if I gave up my Fijian citizenship and got 
<br/>Australian citizenship. I did not.  Others you supported, did.  So get your facts right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is, for whatever reason 
<br/>he left after 1987 and some of us were here during 1987 and even during 2000. They do not talk 
<br/>about 2000. They do not talk about all the atrocities committed against</span><span> </span><span>the people in Muaniweni and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The truth hurts them, Mr. Speaker.  They are selective and his

<br/>vacuum, they come with families, they come with an aspiration and what we have done is to change

<div><span>Immigration laws, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the investors always look for a country, they 
<br/>do not come in a vacuum, they come with families, they come with  friends, they want to  go and 
<br/>invest, live and probably become citizens.  There are many good people over the years who have 
<br/>come, who have invested and who have become citizens.  Here we have a Government which brings 
<br/>this law, makes it a requirement for 15  years to  be eligible for citizenship, I mean, we are losing 
<br/>people, we will have an exodus of people leaving this country.  We already have that and yet we have 
<br/>this draconian immigration laws and the efficiency with which the Immigration Office does things is 
<br/>a matter that also needs to be considered, if you want to look at an investment climate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill will not help anyone if we do not address this other macroeconomic, 
<br/>political, governance and the state of administration of justice and the role of independent institutions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.03 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate on the Investment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in support of the motion on the floor.  During 
<br/>my contribution, I will be referring to the agriculture sector.  Before that, the session prior to morning 
<br/>tea, I thought we had a stray animal in Parliament and on topping it up, I received an email from 
<br/>Honourable Qereqeretabua about stray animal.  I thought, “Hey, she is also thinking there is a stray 
<br/>animal here.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of setting aside money by different decision making units and 
<br/>the  entire  spectrum  of  the  economy,  whether  it  is  households,  businesses,  schools,  famers, 
<br/>government, for the purpose of promoting growth and development is an investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also, when someone sets aside money to improve the productive capacity 
<br/>of the existing assets, for example, a farmer buying an additional implement for the tractor, that is 
<br/>investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may have read some of the recent addresses that I have made to various 
<br/>communities around Fiji, one of the aspects I have been touching on is that savings and investment 
<br/>is critical for growth and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I have noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that in the rural and maritime areas, farmers tend not to 
<br/>save. It is a very worrying issue because, firstly, it contributes to have vulnerability of that particular 
<br/>farming household.  If any shock happens and I am mostly referring to external shocks - cyclones, 
<br/>natural disasters, COVID-19 pandemic for that matter, the first call is their own savings.  When they 
<br/>do not have savings, then the household becomes very vulnerable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  been  talking  about  that  is  because  the  first  call  for 
<br/>investment is the farmers or households’ own savings and everyone in this Parliament understands 
<br/>that  for  growth  and  development  of  an  household,  a  farmer,  a  businessperson  and  a  country,  it 
<br/>requires investment in critical productive assets and investment to improve your productive capacity 
<br/>of those assets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a country, international benchmark is that, you need to have about 20 
<br/></span><span>percent to 25 percent of GDP as investment. I thought honourable Professor Prasad would make that 
<br/></span><span>particular contribution, instead of going all over the place.  Sir, where are we now in relation to the 
<br/>actual benchmark of 20 percent to 25 percent of GDP investment ratio?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  around  16  percent  (2020  figure)  and  of  that  16  percent,  the  good  thing  is  that  13 
<br/>percent of that is private sector driven and about 3.0 percent is Government.  We want growth to be 
<br/>led by the private sector.  But in difficult times, as the honourable Minister for Economy alluded to 
<br/>this earlier on this week or during the Revised Budget session, it is the role of Government to lead 
<br/>investment and to ensure that there is enough money floating in the economy for people to pick up 
<br/>and invest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that there are various pools of money all 
<br/>over, locally and outside of Fiji – pools of money by individual households, the former Fiji residents, 
<br/>Australians, New Zealanders, et cetera.  What they do is, they look around for the best return, easier 
<br/>to do business, easier to get their money back so that they can get that pool of money and invest in 
<br/>the country.

<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1027 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the normal rule in economic is that, investable funds will find its way to the 
<br/>place where there is highest return and it is easier to do business and easier to get and own that money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  that  note,  if  you  look  at  the  Investment  Fiji  Bill  2022,  it  talks  about 
<br/>investment promotion.  It is very critical.  How do we attract local investors who have got that pool 
<br/>of money sitting in the bank, or external investors who have got that pool of money and looking 
<br/>around whether he/she should invest in Australia, New Zealand, America, Fiji, Samoa or Tonga? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  facilitation  is  how  I  get  to  make  that  investment  in  Fiji.  Export  promotion  to 
<br/>facilitate  promotion  and  development  of  exports.    Aftercare  to  provide  investor  assistance  to 
<br/>overcome any challenges post-business, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Policy advocacy, to collect information 
<br/>and raise awareness on challenges faced by potential investors.  Image building, to promote Fiji as a 
<br/>desirable investment destination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if honourable Professor Prasad stands up and starts running 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down our country, then who would want to come and invest in this country? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That’s what you did.  Unpatriotic! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- The honourable Minister for Economy exactly said it is unpatriotic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for honourable Professor Prasad to say those kinds of comments publicly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR M.REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you have a dispute at your home, you settle it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there, you do not go around in public washing your own dirty linen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  difficult  time  when  we  need  to  attract  investment  and  promote 
<br/>economic growth.  We had 16.3 percent of our investment to GDP ratio.  We need to get to, at least, 
<br/>25 percent, Sir, that is the international benchmark for developing countries.  Honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad was all over the place but he did not talk about the critical nuances of getting our investment 
<br/>rate from 16.3 percent to 25 percent investment to GDP ratio.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion on the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  on  the 
<br/>Investment  Bill.    We,  on  this  side  of  the  House,  totally  support  investment.    We  understand  the 
<br/>importance of investment and it is crucial as it leads to the creation of jobs.  A rise in employment 
<br/>potentially means an increase in the number of taxpayers in any country, which in turn generates high 
<br/>revenue for the Government through increased and indirect tax collections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More tax revenue allows the Government to provide a level of service to its citizenship by 
<br/>expanding current programmes and by undertaking new investment projects in public infrastructure 
<br/>such as roads, schools and hospitals.  Of course, this will trickle down to the people to afford basic 
<br/>necessities of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  understand  investment  growth  can  have  a  direct  positive  impact  on  people’s  living 
<br/>standard and consequently, reduce poverty level.  So, that is something I would like to emphasise.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1028 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do support investment, we do support all sorts of investments including the private sector, public 
<br/>sector  and  various  other  investments.    The  only  concern  we  have  is  that,  it  is  done  within  good 
<br/>governance and transparency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  we  also  note  some  of  the  key  factors  as  mentioned  by  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General,  such  as  economic  growth,  which  needs  to  sustain  investment.    Confidence  has  been 
<br/>mentioned by him and also honourable Professor Prasad.  Again, inflation is an issue which is also 
<br/>affected by various factors including external factors, productivity of capital, availability of finance 
<br/>and we have discussed that issue, and liquidity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue which has been mentioned, Sir,  is  compliance.   Again, that  has also  been 
<br/>discussed and if you look at the Committee’s Report, this was an issue that was raised by the public. 
<br/>Volatility, of course, which is a concern by the investor that returns on their investment is viable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had also mentioned when we discussed the Bill itself (I will touch on that later), such 
<br/>things as limitation of foreign control, right to private ownership and the lease reserved and restricted 
<br/>lease which was there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  business  facilitation,  this  has  also  been  discussed  various  times  -  the  ease  of  doing 
<br/></span><span>business.  My colleagues have also touched on that.  Of course, the bilateral trade agreements and 
<br/>international multilateral agreements, how do we effectively benefit from that?  The transparency of 
<br/>regulatory systems, we have seen the Bill before us which is empowering Investment Fiji, moving 
<br/>away from a regulatory function.  So, we are concerned about the lack of consultations in terms of 
<br/>how  that  will  operate.    As  mentioned  by  honourable  Professor  Prasad,  there  needs  to  be  an 
<br/>implementation strategy in that, given the regulations which need to be formulated.  Of course, the 
<br/>cost of bureaucratic delays through the system for investment and the shifting of goal posts, a key 
<br/>concern too is the biosecurity requirements and the inconsistency in the application of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Agriculture had mentioned investment trends.  From what we 
<br/>have  seen,  the  investment  level  in  the  country  continued  on  a  declining  trend.    In  2019,  prior  to 
<br/>COVID-19, the total investment in the economy was only hovering around 15.8 percent of GDP, far 
<br/>below the 25 percent level required to ensure that there is always going to be sustainable growth, if 
<br/>we hit 25 percent.  This is despite the substantial increase of our loan portfolio and Government claim 
<br/>that it continues with capital expenditure allocations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2000, the highest level of investment on record by this Government was in 2013 – 27.6 
<br/></span><span>percent of GDP during the upgrading of the Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road which contributed to that at a 
<br/></span><span>cost of $228 million funded through a Chinese Government loan which was completed in 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last 40 years since the 1980s, the highest level of investment recorded against GDP by 
<br/>previous  Governments  was  in  1981  –  34.3  percent  of  GDP.    In  the  1990s,  the  highest  level  of 
<br/>investment recorded was in 1998 – 28.2 percent of GDP.  Previous Governments have always had a 
<br/>well-planned  investment  programme  under  its  Public  Sector  Investment  Programme  (PSIP), 
<br/>targeting  infrastructure  projects  with  both,  high  economic  and  financial  returns,  not  less  than  25 
<br/>percent  and  25  percent  respectively,  which  are  prioritised  and  properly  sequenced  to  ensure 
<br/>continuity, and generate investment in other sectors so as to generate employment opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues, as I have mentioned, is in section 5 of the substantial legislation (Investment 
<br/>Act 2021) – the reserved and restricted activities, and that is a concern that we are raising today.  We 
<br/>had raised this in the substantial Investment Bill debate and the provisions there.  Our view is that, it 
<br/>gives  the  honourable  Minister  too  much  power  and  discretion  in  deciding  reserved  and  restricted 
<br/>activities, and this appears to require businesses in various localities to apply for their activity, then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1029 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>go to Cabinet to be declared as reserved rather than having a national lease which makes it clear to 
<br/>the whole nation, which can lead to different rules for different locations, cities or towns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other concern is the insufficient protection for local businesses as two years does not give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them security in terms of protection of their business activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue, Sir, that I would like to raise today is Investment Fiji’s performance in terms 
<br/>of the number of registered projects and projects implemented, and this has been an ongoing concern 
<br/>which, we in the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, have also raised.  Just sharing some of 
<br/>the data from there, the FRCS registered a number of projects in 2016-2017 – 415; 2017-2018 – 374 
<br/>and 2018-2019 – 175.  Proposed investment in 2016-20017 - $999 million; 2017-2018 - $1.2 million; 
<br/>and 2018-2019 - $685.71 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, when you look at the projects implemented, you compare the FIRCS-registered projects 
<br/>and those which are actually implemented, it is 415 to 159  and 374 against 185 which were actually 
<br/>implemented  and  175  and  120  actually  implemented,  which  is  why  if  you  look  at  one  of  the 
<br/>recommendations of the Committee, which we are looking forward to be followed through, we noted 
<br/>with  concern  during  the  period  under  review  the  number  of  FRCS  registered  project  proposals 
<br/></span><span>reduced with actual projects implemented, consistently much lower than project registered. The value 
<br/></span><span>of proposed investments and number of projects implemented reduced, actual employment increased 
<br/>but it was again consistently much less than that indicated in the investment proposal.  This is why 
<br/>we recommended that a comprehensive assessment be made to determine the reasons for the gap 
<br/>between the actual versus projected output and to strategise accordingly to address these gaps. That 
<br/>Sir, is my contribution to assist with moving forward regarding this legislation and the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset let me state that if you think that the 
<br/>Government is taking us in the wrong direction, it does not mean that we are unpatriotic.  We keep 
<br/>hearing this, Mr. Speaker, when we debated the Fiji Airways Guarantees, we were told that we were 
<br/>not proud of our national airline, et cetera.  All we are saying, Mr. Speaker, is that we question some 
<br/>of the decisions by Government and that should not be termed as unpatriotic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Industry,  Commerce,  Tourism,  Trade  and 
<br/>Transport had said that what we are doing is remodelling, reform and modernise Investment  Fiji, 
<br/>which is fine, but it must be done in a transparent manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just read the commentaries by the United States Department of States 
<br/></span><span>on a report titled  </span><span>2021 Investment  Climate Statements  - Fiji</span><span> and this was in  2021;  Legal  Regime 
<br/></span><span>Transparency of the Regulatory System, it says: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The lack of consultation with the private sector and other stakeholders on proposed 
<br/>laws and regulations remains an area of concern.  The business community has complained 
<br/>that the government enacts new regulations with little prior notice or publicity.  Foreign 
<br/>investors  perceive  a  lack  of  transparency  in  government  procurement  and  approval 
<br/>processes, and some considering investment in Fiji have encountered lengthy and costly 
<br/>bureaucratic delays, shuffling of permits among government ministries, inconsistent and 
<br/>changing procedures, lack of technical capacity, costly penalties due to the interpretation 
<br/>of tax regulations by the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS), and slow decision-
<br/>making”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was in 2021 Mr. Speaker, Sir, and for a government that has been in place for the last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15 years, this is truly a sad indictment on how they handle investment in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- US States Department, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and that is a sad indictment 
<br/>on the government of the day and they have been doing this for last 15 years.  That is why, while we 
<br/>support investment, we are concerned with the way they go about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, the role of FRCS in this Bill, FRCS is to collect revenue and implements the 
<br/>policies of the Ministry of Economy, but in this Bill, they are also developing policies.  Likewise, for 
<br/>the Department of Immigration, they should implement the policies of the Ministry of Home Affairs, 
<br/>but in here they are also developing policies.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are some of the confusion that 
<br/>we see in this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  ask  the  questions  about  implementing  agencies.  Who  sits  on  those  boards  and 
<br/>committees? It appears to be a small clique of people who appear everywhere in this country. In any 
<br/>board, there are always some people who are always there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- No, that is SVT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  a  small  clique  of  people  who  are  known  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government of the day and the number of women is diminishing by the day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Nonsense!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of women is diminishing by the day 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on boards and committees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know about the ease of doing business which 
<br/>is truly lacking in this country and the performance indicators are well-known to us such as building 
<br/>the construction permits. In Fiji today, people are saying that it is easier to buy a home rather build 
<br/>it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is what people are saying in Fiji today and I can testify that, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am Chairman of the Nadroga/Navosa Co-operation, we wanted to build some 
<br/></span><span>apartments here in Suva and I was given the round around. No one could give me a definitive decision 
<br/>on the permits whether to proceed with the building or not.  And everyone I met, Mr. Speaker, was 
<br/>acting; Acting Engineer for the Suva City Council, Acting Director of Town and Country Planning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Government of actors; nothing happens. 
<br/>It is so frustrating.  You try and build a house in Suva or anywhere in Fiji and then you see, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  Electricity availability, I know the Government is gloating over the lines they have run 
<br/>across the country but I have highlighted a number of places who have been waiting there for years 
<br/>for electricity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Property of registration is one of the indicators.  Credit of availability, I know there is a lot of 
<br/>money in the system but confidence is not there. Protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading 
<br/>across borders, contract enforcement and resolving insolvency. I know that we are no longer rating 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1031 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countries by the ease of doing business but this is still very much a challenge in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. The environment is still very unclear. The simple way around this is to change the people in 
<br/>charge of this country.  That is a simple solution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know what to do.  We will not be leaving things in the hands of a few 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people. We will include people across the country to play their role in developing this country.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course  there  is  also  the  political  stability.  We  need  to  make  sure  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>election this year is carried out properly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Of course.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Right now we are highlighting some concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Talk about the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Political stability is very much part of this Bill. Our people who are 
<br/></span><span>working overseas had been given 23 days to register to vote by postal and that is too short. There are 
<br/>asking for a longer period to register. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about political stability and the 
<br/>democratic process in elections and they are asking - is that in the Bill?  They are so limited in their 
<br/>understanding of things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I believe, there were some thoughts on providing some assistance to 
<br/>political parties to help with education and their people in campaign, et cetera, I wonder if they can 
<br/>do that again because we want people to be fully involved in the democratic process (the elections) 
<br/>and resources are stretched, we just come out of COVID-19, they thought about it but they pulled it 
<br/>back, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We need people …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Speak on the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  That  is  another  beauty,  speak  on  the  Bill.    We  are  talking  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>political stability, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the comprehension level over there is quite a serious concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when people participate in the election process, 
<br/>political stability is an outcome of that  I just hope they understand that.  So, help political parties, 
<br/>do the needful to get more people to register and to be educated so that we can have a truly democratic 
<br/>election.    There  are  still  a  lot  of  question  marks  about  the  way  we  do  things  over  here.  We  are 
<br/>highlighting this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to help with the investment climate in this country.  Stability is 
<br/>an issue. When people see that the people of this country are joining in election, et cetera, stability 
<br/>will come into the country and by extension the investment in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all these promotions by Investment Fiji, I just wonder who is going to 
<br/>keep track of those fly-by-nights who come in here, quickly set up something, leave the country and 
<br/>leave a lot of people holding empty bags in this country?  That used to be the role of Investment Fiji, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who will do that from onwards, because we used to rely on Investment Fiji to do that for us, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Again without consultation, they have moved that to FRCS and that 
<br/>will confuse people.  Again I say, we support investments but not the way the FijiFirst do it, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and that is why we are not supporting this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a short contribution.  In order 
<br/>for  Investment  Fiji  to  align  their  operations  with  the  changing  legislation,  the  organisation  is 
<br/>undertaking a strategic reset through the development of a new strategic plan. The ultimate goal of 
<br/>this  new  strategic  plan  is  to  drive  Fiji’s  economic  recovery,  post-COVID-19  through  broadening 
<br/>Fiji’s economic base.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In developing this plan, Investment Fiji has undertaken a detailed sector and market analysis 
<br/>which  includes  identifying  top  priority  sectors  and  markets  for  both  investment  and  trade.  
<br/>Competitor benchmarking was also done to identify IPA best practices.  Furthermore, over 50 public 
<br/></span><span>and private sector consultations and three validation workshops were held in the development of the 
<br/></span><span>draft report.  This new strategic plan that is currently being developed will completely revamp the 
<br/>organisation,  the way it  works, the way their work is  monitored and how they interact  with  their 
<br/>stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  the  organisation  will  have  a  new  vision  and  mission  which  will  fully  reflect  its 
<br/>ambition as a new investment and trade promotion agency and it will also support the mandate of the 
<br/>agency as defined by the 2021 Investment Fiji Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new strategy will also outline key stakeholder relationships, since the key stakeholders 
<br/>will play a vital role in the success of investment, Fiji’s promotion and attraction activities.  To ensure 
<br/>a  successful  investment  and  export  promotion  for  Fiji,  it  is  important  to  establish  strategic 
<br/>relationships between Investment Fiji and its key partners.  These partners will all need to play a role 
<br/>in the investment and export promotion process. So it is important that these roles are well defined 
<br/>and the partners buy-in to their role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji will also have a new marketing strategy.  These strategies are based on their 
<br/>return on investment.  These strategies are based on their return on investment for Fiji and Investment 
<br/></span><span>Fiji’s marketing budget.  Some activities identified with the highest return on investment are direct 
<br/></span><span>outreach, outbound missions, consultant-led generation and in-market presence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji will also have a new aftercare plan.  Aftercare is a crucial service provided to 
<br/>existing domestic and foreign investors.  It includes a range of activities from post-establishment of 
<br/>facilitation  services  through  a  development  support  to  retain  investment,  encourage  follow  up  on 
<br/>investment and achieve greater local economic impact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimated that 70 
<br/>percent of FDI originates from the existing investor base.  These investments usually occur through 
<br/>expansion  of  existing  facilities,  all  mergers  and  acquisitions.    Efficient  aftercare  services  will  be 
<br/>delivered differently based on an investor’s or exporter’s category on prioritisation.  Those with the 
<br/>greatest economic benefit to the country, will be provided more time and resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  the  strategic  plan  will  include  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities,  which  is 
<br/>important to allow Investment Fiji to assess its progress on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1033 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are vital to the success of an investment and trade promotion agency.  As the organisation matures, 
<br/>it will measure its progress in line with the nation’s goals, such as return on investment, gross value 
<br/>adding and the quality of jobs created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  current  economic  environment,  the  role  that  Investment  Fiji  will  play  as  Fiji’s 
<br/>investment  and  trade  promotion  agency  is  crucial  to  attracting  quality  investments  and  exports.  
<br/>Providing them with necessary budget to execute their role effectively, will be a key factor to their 
<br/>success.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just be short, since some of my colleagues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have mentioned the topics which I wanted to speak on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  responding  to  the  Bill,  I  just  want  to  respond  to  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture in his response.  He mentioned that people need to do their personal savings to help them 
<br/>in time of need and in times of disaster.  But, the honourable Minister himself understands that the 
<br/>rural people, especially farmers, rely on Agriculture Marketing Authority (AMA) for their market 
<br/>outlet.  He knows very well that AMA which is supposed to buy foodstuff from rural farmers are not 
<br/>doing their job.  They are returning goods that they are supposed to buy and saying that they have 
<br/></span><span>fulfilled their quota.  That contradicts to what they are trying to do to promote agriculture.  So, how 
<br/></span><span>can you save when they do have anything to save?  They have nothing.  So, we should blame him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the Bill, I do not understand the logic in shifting this responsibility 
<br/>to Investment Fiji as a promotional agency.  Why?  It is because you cannot attract investors if the 
<br/>environment to invest is not there, and that is what is happening here.  We do not have the right policy 
<br/>for investors to invest.  That is why we had high liquidity in the last four years or five years.  People 
<br/>are not investing, people are not borrowing.  The banks are not lending because there is no confidence 
<br/>in the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How can the bank lend when it is not safe to lend the money because there is no confidence?  
<br/>They  are  not  confident  to  lend  money,  and  the  borrowers  or  the  investors  have  no  confidence  to 
<br/>borrow.  Why?  It is because of the legislation that we have.  It is wrong.  We need to have the right 
<br/>policy mix to attract the investors, so I do not see the logic in trying to shift this responsibility of 
<br/>investment to Investment Fiji because the climate to invest is not here. It is wrong. That is why our 
<br/>investment has been declining over the last three to five years. It is on a declining trend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the ease of doing business, as mentioned by honourable Gavoka, it declined from 2012 to 
<br/></span><span>2020 from 58 to 102. Why?  It is because people do not want to come to Fiji to invest.  We do not 
<br/></span><span>have  that  right  policy  mix.    They  do  not  have  the  confidence.    Look  at  the  independence  of  the 
<br/>institution that is supposed to promote and support investment, there is no independence in them.  
<br/>We know it!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why you do it that you know very well it will be a failure, it is just a waste of taxpayers’ 
<br/>money.  Why shift the responsibility to other institutions that do not have the skills and technical 
<br/>expertise  to  do  investment  development  in  Fiji.  This  is  the  same  idea  that  they  did  to  the  small 
<br/>microfinance business. There is an organisation that receives the application, a different organisation 
<br/>appraises the application and another organisation disburses the loan. That does not work. You will 
<br/>be surprised to see an update report from small businesses. It does not work that way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji  Development  Bank (FDB) that was  supposed to  give loans and monitor have the 
<br/>skills and the infrastructure.  It is the same as this, Investment Fiji has the skills, right qualification 
<br/>and technical expertise to do this job but why take it away from them?

<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not support this Bill, thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in favour of the Fiji Investment Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this Bill, the Investment Fiji will truly reflect the mandate for what an 
<br/>investment promotion agency should be, and why it is important for Fiji to stimulate investment and 
<br/>exports and contribute towards economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Investment Fiji promotes investment and exports, and in doing so, it treats 
<br/>both, domestic and foreign investors alike, and this Bill further ensures that impediments faced by 
<br/>investors and exporters are removed or minimised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji as an  Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) has a huge challenge. It has to 
<br/>compete with hundreds of other IPAs and similar agencies globally that are doing the same for their 
<br/>respective countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, therefore, vital to have a robust and dynamic IPA for Fiji with clear 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mandate and well-resourced, to carry its mandate.  The Fiji Investment Bill provides just that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  past  two  years,  we  have  suffered  in  terms  of  attracting  investment  because  of  the 
<br/>pandemic, but now is the time that we have to go out and promote investment and exports, to enhance 
<br/>our  economic  growth  and  that  is  precisely  what  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport did just after the last Parliament.  He was in Dubai, attracting investment and 
<br/>talking to the investors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our private sector has endured and showed resilience in the most difficult 
<br/>times.  Most businesses have carried on, despite logistics and supply chain constraints, as well as 
<br/>travel constraints because of closure of borders.  Just as the promotion of tourism, we will need to 
<br/>promote investment and exports in several sectors in which we have comparative advantage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji has a huge role to play.  By giving Investment Fiji clear mandate with checks 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and balances, this can be achieved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  period  faced  with  unseen  economic  headwinds,  we  need  to  rely  on 
<br/>Investment Fiji and all other relevant agencies to work together to reset our path to economic growth.  
<br/></span><span>With this mandate, Investment Fiji can stand along with some of the best IPAs that we have globally, 
<br/></span><span>such as EDB Singapore, Dubai, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when honourable Professor Prasad was speaking, he started off with his 
<br/>favourite line, that is, “there is nothing much to be said”, and he often does that because he really did 
<br/>not understand and he loves the idea of giving grades.  He gave Grade C to someone, Grade 0 to 
<br/>someone else, and he was all over the place when he was speaking on that subject matter, and I am 
<br/>wondering what grade he will give to himself.  Did he really speak on the motion?  He was all over 
<br/>the place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He would give himself ‘A++’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, but I think we will grade him ‘F’, because he failed on talking on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the subject matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1035 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he also spoke on the legislation that was passed initially (a couple of months 
<br/>back), but this Bill is to give mandate to Investment Fiji as an institution.  When Investment Fiji will 
<br/>get the legal mandate, it can start doing its work and that is what this Bill is all about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  during  his  deliberation,  did  he  propose  anything  that  we  could  consider  from  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presentation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- There was nothing concrete in his presentation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  also  spoke  about  the  immigration  laws.    Did  he  give  credit  where  credit  is  due,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir? Again, he did not.  He should know that the business permit which was previously 
<br/>given  for  two  weeks  has  now  been  extended  up  to  three  months  and  this  was  done  by  this 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And, again, a lot of changes were made over a period of time for the ease of doing business 
<br/>and we have discussed this at length in this House, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So much of reform has taken 
<br/></span><span>place but then, again, he is on another mode at the moment, we understand that, he cannot focus on 
<br/></span><span>the subject matter because he is only thinking of how he can sit on this side of the House.  But you 
<br/>have to wait for quite some time, honourable Professor Prasad, it is not going to happen soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, honourable Tuisawau, that is his favourite subject area.  He always love to talk about 
<br/>reserved and restricted list.  Reserved and restricted list is an impediment to investment. I will give 
<br/>you a good example which is the shipping services. Under the old legislation, for any investor to 
<br/>come and invest in the shipping services, they should have 51 percent local shares.  There has to be 
<br/>a 51 percent shareholders to do the business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where  is  the  money  for  local  shareholders?    It  is  because  no  one  had  the  money  in  their 
<br/>pocket, that is why the shipping services were poor, it was not providing the services as required by 
<br/>the people.  We live in a maritime area, with so many islands around us, and people need to move 
<br/>from one island to another.  But this was the biggest impediment that not only acted as an impediment 
<br/>to attract right investors, but people suffered in return.  However, by opening this up, now we can 
<br/>see competition  and  you can also  see that shipping fares have reduced.   So, that is the benefit of 
<br/>removing this reserved and restricted list, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  also  heard  about  fly-by-nights,  that  when  investors  come  in,  then  who  is  going  to 
<br/></span><span>monitor?   We  have  clearly  stated  and  even  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Tourism  and 
<br/>Transport  has  clearly  stated  that  Investment  Fiji  should  do  its  job  and  their  job  as  a  promotional 
<br/>agency, that they should be promoting investment and bringing investors into the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  we  have  other  agencies,  like  Fiji  Revenue  &amp;  Customs  Service  (FRCS).    They  can  be 
<br/>monitoring  whatever  they  have  to  do  and  similarly,  the  Immigration  Department  will  be  also 
<br/>monitoring the type of investors that are coming in and particularly, character, in case there is any 
<br/>fraud related to that investor, et cetera.  The reason being because they are connected with the rest of 
<br/>other immigration agencies around the globe and it is easier for them to access that information rather 
<br/>than Investment Fiji trying to get that information.  It is hard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, fly-by-nights, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have worked at Investment Fiji previously and I can 
<br/>share my personal experience and that was the reason why I left that organisation within one year 
<br/>and that was during the time when we were attracting investors from, I will not mention the countries.  
<br/>The officers at Investment Fiji and this was reported in Auditor-General’s Report as well that these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>1036 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investors came in, within five years their interest was to get citizenship and to facilitate the citizenship 
<br/>rather  than  to  facilitate  investment,  to  facilitate  citizenship  there  was  a  lot  of  corruption  in  the 
<br/>organisation and that was reported in the Auditor-General’s Report.  I am talking about the criteria 
<br/>and the law that was set then but this legislation is going to change that as well as the changes that 
<br/>were made to the immigration law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, this is my response to the Investment Bill.  I commend 
<br/>the Government in bringing the Investment Bill but whether it works is another issue because my 
<br/>law firm deals with Investment Fiji, we deal with company laws and I do agree, the computerisation 
<br/>has come in handy.  It does have some flaws but it has come in handy.  We have all mentioned it, 
<br/>investment is key to our nation.  We all need to support it.  It is good for job creation.  It is good for 
<br/>our nation.  The ripple effect of it is positive and obviously unimaginable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I read, Mr. Speaker, Sir, clause 5 of the Investment Bill, the mandate of Investment Fiji and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just two issues that I will highlight on and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “(a) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (f) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  promotion:  to  increase  the  contribution  made  by  investors  to  Fiji’s 
<br/>economy by promoting Fiji’s competitive and comparative advantages.   
<br/></span><span>Image building: to promote Fiji as a desirable investment destination.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know, like any business investor, you check out the economy, you check out everything, 
<br/>you see there are sound policies, you see the laws in place, they want to ensure that the nation is 
<br/>secured, it is stable.  I am one of the generation that grew up in the </span><span>coup</span><span> from 1987, I was a Form 
<br/>Two student at Suva Grammar School and I will never forget that day because I had to walk home 
<br/>Princess Road and I saw the fears in my Indian friends. I pray there will be no more  </span><span>coups</span><span> in our 
<br/>nation, in my lifetime and the lifetime of my generation and my children’s.  There will be no more 
<br/>immunity clauses in any Constitution.  We need to bring back the rule of law and true democracy in 
<br/>our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.- Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Not in the 2013 Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU S. MATANITOBUA.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  I  know  what  happened  at  Fiji  Television  Limited  because  I  saw 
<br/></span><span>people being sent out.  I saw that, we saw that, we saw what happened to the Solicitor-General, we 
<br/></span><span>saw what happened to the head of the Bureau of Statistics.  When I talk to my clients, I say just do 
<br/>the work, do it right,  follow the laws, invest, do not  do anything that will make  you breach  your 
<br/>investment permit, do it right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  two  weeks  ago  we  all  debated,  even  I  spoke  on  the  Development  of  Informal 
<br/>Settlements Bill which was rushed through Standing Order 51. It came to us on Thursday, on Friday 
<br/>I spoke on it.  What concerns me and I am not sure whether the Members of the House are aware of 
<br/>this.  The Development of Informal Settlements Bill criminalises informal tenants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Please!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- It criminalises it.  If a developer wishes to develop the land because 
<br/>they have got a development lease, they will have to issue notice but the penalty is $20,000 or 10 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1037 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years imprisonment or both.  Now, I pray, when these investors come and they are given development 
<br/>leases and I stand to be corrected, the Khalsa Road is a case in point because 200 of them have been 
<br/>issued the notice because some of them came to see me and I said, “see the landowner wants the land, 
<br/>they have gone to iTLTB, they have come back to take back what is legally theirs and that is their 
<br/>legal right; they are the landowners.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  got  another  community  in  our  nation;  our  Solomon  brothers  and  sisters.    Our 
<br/>forefathers, the </span><span>vanua,</span><span> our chiefs accepted our Indian friends; our brothers who came, the Chinese 
<br/>and we have forgotten about the Solomons.  They are staying on land that is not theirs and if any 
<br/>investor comes and waives that Development of Informal Settlements Bill, they will end up at the 
<br/>foreshore because they have no land.  They are Solomon Islanders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are being silly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I will not respond to that comment, I am addressing you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Read the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I have read the law and I am more senior than him.  I will address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Read the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have no land compared to us.  We have people 
<br/>from Lau, Kadavu, we can always go back to our land, we have our relatives.  The Solomon Islanders, 
<br/>where do they go?  We know what happened in Papua New Guinea, because I have been there.  At 
<br/>Port Moresby, they are out there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- So we have to be very careful and I pray that when these investors 
<br/>get  this,  what  has  happened,  basically  the  Government  has  washed  their  hands  off  the  informal 
<br/>settlements.  Where is affordable housing?  My children cannot afford housing right now with the 
<br/>houses that are built by Housing Authority of Fiji.  We need to make affordable housing - $40,000 
<br/>to $50,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing we want is investors coming here,  I have never seen and I speak from my 
<br/></span><span>experience, as the former lawyer head of Suva City Council for six years, unprecedented growth of 
<br/>informal  settlements  from  Lami  to  Nausori  because  cost  of  living  has  gone  up.    We  have 
<br/>professionals, kids that are not moving out of their homes because they cannot afford the rent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will address you until you tell me to stop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to ensure that when our investors come; our people first.  Start first in Jerusalem, 
<br/>secure our people first because when we are secured, we are sound, we are safe and we will also work 
<br/>together to draw in investors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An aunty of mine used to joke to me when I was at Suva City Council, she said, “Tanya, you 
<br/>coming to Lami, first thing you see on the left are the dead people, on the right you see all the rubbish 
<br/>(before we relocated) then you see the prison, then you see the market, then you see the “Welcome

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Suva”.  But now we see, sadly the informal settlements, we need to empower them.  We need to 
<br/>move them into affordable homes where they own it, otherwise we will be like PNG where we cannot 
<br/>control things.  We need to get our people into homes that they have legal titles over, so when an 
<br/>investor comes, they know that this is a good country to invest in, they look after their people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- We do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I do not know about whether they do, because I mentioned it two 
<br/>weeks ago,  four days with no water.  That is me living in the city, but it is okay because I have water 
<br/>facilities.  Utility services, roads, power, water and all these things need to fall in place, otherwise 
<br/>the mandate of the Investment Fiji and the whole Investment Bill they brought is just a facade, it is 
<br/>all paperwork like all the other Bills they bring in.  I know because we are at the receiving end, we 
<br/>work the system; the lawyers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  glad,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  my  </span><span>vasu  </span><span>from  Rewa  have  embraced  and  welcomed  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>luvedra na Ratu.  </span><span>I am glad they did that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Talk about the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- I will talk about it, he wants me to talk about the Bill, I will talk 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recently read and I am glad that Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) is now transitioning local road 
<br/>markings to Australian standard.  I am glad because with our road standard, a lot of improvement 
<br/>need to be done.  In terms of our utilities, we have all been waiting for the Singaporean standard, I 
<br/>will not hold my breath, maybe it will snow in Fiji then we will reach Singaporean standard.  The 
<br/>Bill like every other law is good until we lawyers work through it and all the people that work through 
<br/>it, then we say it is all a facade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Investment Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for her contribution to the debate. I now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give the floor to the honourable Attorney General for his Right of Reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those Members 
<br/>of Parliament who actually stood up and supported this particular Bill. This Bill as highlighted in the 
<br/></span><span>introduction is in fact an adjunct to the Investment Bill that was passed by Parliament last year. Of 
<br/></span><span>course, they both go in tandem - one cannot operate without the other.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have demonstrated through the parliamentary process, there is a gap between the first 
<br/>Bill  that  was  passed  last  year  and  now  we  are  got  the  second  one;  that  is  how  long  it  takes.  
<br/>Honourable  Prof.  Prasad  obviously  in  his  zest  to  try  and  recover  and  recuperate  some  form  of 
<br/>assemblance of his moral decay, said that no regulations have been put in place. I should call him 
<br/>now the de facto Deputy Leader of PAP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, he said were not in place. How can we have the regulations in place when 
<br/>the second Act needs to be approved by Parliament? Obviously, the regulations are being worked 
<br/>upon.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1039 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He is so far gone in terms of trying to recover from political 
<br/>ground, he is actually missing the actual issue.  The issue is that the Investment Fiji Act go hand in 
<br/>hand and they cannot function one without the other. It would obviously makes sense to have the 
<br/>both of the regulations in place while the second one gets passed. It is very basic and logical. He 
<br/>comes and makes a big nonsense statement about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Gavoka talked about  that  American report, obviously this is 
<br/>similar to, they went on for about three or four years about the World Bank Ease of Doing Business 
<br/>and then it was revealed that there was corrupt practices in it, people actually got underhand dealings 
<br/>as to how countries were rated so that is now being taken away. The big bang theory has gone out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka now has used this particular report, he obviously failed to report many 
<br/>sections of this report which actually gives a very positive report in respect to Fiji. He is being very 
<br/>selective about the bits he read out. Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also scattergun approach on how 
<br/>these  assessments  are  done.  They  do  not  reveal  who  they  talk  to  and  this  is  the  problem  that  we 
<br/>highlighted in the Ease of Doing of Business with World Bank. They only went to a selective group 
<br/>of people to get their assessments. Honourable Gavoka as a true patriot, we should all be concerned 
<br/>about any assessment ….

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED- KHAIYUM.- As true patriots, all of us in this House should be concerned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about any outsider making an assessment about our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  We  need  to  look  at  whether  they  are  based  on  the 
<br/>fundamental premise of transparency and accountability which they are on about. They need to be 
<br/>able to know who are people who made their contributions and they need to know where was the 
<br/>spread of the information obtained from. Was it only one or two organisations or was it across the 
<br/>board?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have highlighted continuously, the statement that Bill Clinton made 
<br/>– It’s the economy, stupid?  Continuously we highlight that.  Honourable Prasad has never failed to 
<br/></span><span>take pot shots at the Fijian economy, make comments about the Fijian economy and the long-term 
<br/></span><span>stability of our country just for his own political needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is what we see today, demonstrated by NFP paapi is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the naked grab for power at any cost. It is a sign of desperate people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED.  KHAIYUM.-  We  have  not  fallen  into  the  abyss  where  we  cannot  get 
<br/>ourselves out because they are so far gone into their own political survival. Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me 
<br/>highlight  some  of  the  issues.  The  regulations,  when  they  talk  about  regulations,  it  is  all  done  in 
<br/>consultations.  That  is  why  the  regulation  is  done.  He  says  regulations  should  be  brought  to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1040 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.    Regulations  are  never  brought  to  Parliament.  They  are  what  we  call  subsidiary 
<br/>legislation and the Act empowers the Minister responsible to make those regulations and that is what 
<br/>is precisely being done since we gained Independence. Yet, he stands here and says, “All regulations 
<br/>should be brought to Parliament - only then it is a sign of good governance.” Oh wow!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would also like to make, they have continuously said, 
<br/>“oh, the ease of doing business, things are not being done properly, it is so difficult.”  Even in the 
<br/>recent past when we have brought laws or amendments to laws - the Liquor Licensing Act, the Hotel 
<br/>Licensing Act, the </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers to get their license for five years, they have all objected to it.  They 
<br/>said, “Oh, it is brought under Standing Order 51, we cannot do it”, they still objected to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even the Budget that took VAT of 21 items, increased minimum wage to 
<br/>$4, all of those Bills that were presented to make, for example, zoning a lot more easier, et cetera, 
<br/>they have all objected to it.  And they have the hypocritical position now to come and stand up and 
<br/>say, “We are not doing anything about it.” They are the ones who are opposing it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the level of hypocrisy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Here I am, supposed to be standing here 
<br/>talking  about  this  particular  Bill,  but  I  have  to  stand  up  here,  waste  my  time  to  correct  all  the 
<br/></span><span>misinformation they are spreading to members of the public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Kuridrani talked about liquidity.  He said, “Oh, there is so much 
<br/>liquidity, there is no confidence by borrowers, by the banks.”  </span><span>Areh</span><span>, we had COVID-19.  The entire 
<br/>world, all the countries in the world faced a huge issue regarding confidence of people investing.  
<br/>The entire world, all the countries stepped in, the larger countries did quantitative easing to pump 
<br/>money into the economy.  And here he has the audacity to stand up here in a very emotive manner 
<br/>and asking, “Why were not people borrowing? Why were the banks not lending last year and a year 
<br/>before last?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why would you do that when there are lockdowns? Why would you do that 
<br/>when 115,000 or 120,000 people have lost their  jobs? Why  would  you do that when the tourism 
<br/>sector has closed down? Why would you do?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M. Bulanauca interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This is your problem, honourable Bulanauca, you just pluck 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>things out of thin air.  I remember what you did in 2000, I will never forget that. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!

<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- He was Minister for Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He was Minister for Lands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they talked about foreign investor frustrations.  Let me remind honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members as to what happened recently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  company  called  Chugoku,  which  is  one  of  the  largest  electricity  companies  in  Japan, 
<br/>together with JBIC which is the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, bought 44 percent of EFL 
<br/>and  we  all  know  what  the  Japanese  are  like.    They  cross  every  t’s,  dot  every  i’s,  honourable 
<br/>Tikoduadua and you may be interested in this, they look at stability, they look at the environmental 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1041 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>standards, they look at the stability of the country, the policies, the consistency in the policies and 
<br/>only  then  they  will  invest.  That  was  some  fly-by-night  people.    In  fact,  the  consortium  is  named 
<br/>‘Sevens’.    Why?  It  is  because  of  the  Sevens  victory  of  the  Sevens  Rugby  Team.    That  is  how 
<br/>committed they are to Fiji.  Look at the company called Sevens Pacific Pte Limited, the Chugoku has 
<br/>bought in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad has an amazing ability to just obfuscate things.  
<br/>In the ANZ Report recently, Dr. Kishti Sen said that our debt portfolio has stability and we have the 
<br/>ability to pay our loans. Mr. Speaker, they come here and talk about those things, but they do not 
<br/>have a nuance approach to debt, for example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you are borrowing money where the yields are a lot higher as has been previously, or you 
<br/>are borrowing money with the maturity terms a lot smaller, or borrowing money at a much higher 
<br/>interest rate, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how can you compare your debt portfolio if the money that you are 
<br/>borrowing in the last couple of years, we borrowed $900 million at concessional rates, at 0.01 percent 
<br/>from JICA with a 40-year term and 10-year grace period?  Honourable Professor Prasad, listen!  Let 
<br/>me give you a lesson. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The grant component of that is 60 percent.   In other words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amount of 
<br/></span><span>money you borrowed, you only pay back 40 percent because 60 percent of it works out to be a grant 
<br/>component - 0.01 percent from the World Bank.  They said to us that we are going around the world 
<br/>with a begging bowl.  They called me a beggar.  They called the honourable Prime Minister, going 
<br/>around  talking  about  it,  a  beggar.    We  are  not  beggars,  we  are  actually  patriotic  people  who  are 
<br/>concerned about our country, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We  have highlighted and the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>has  highlighted  at  the  international  stage  our  vulnerability  to  climate  change.    If  you  do  not 
<br/>understand climate change, you got your heads buried in the sand further more now with Peter in the 
<br/>ground too, together with your head.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone knows in the past couple of months the amount of damage, not just the cyclone but 
<br/>just what inundation of water has caused us, highways washed away, and these things cost money.  
<br/>As  a  result  of  that,  despite  being  classified  as  a  middle  income  country,  we  were  able  to  get 
<br/>concessional funding from World Bank and IDA Funds at zero percent interest rate, 0.75 percent 
<br/></span><span>service charge.  Again, a grant component of about 53 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we only pay back 47 percent of the funds we borrowed.  
<br/>They do not  come to  this Parliament and talk about  those matters.  They simply look  at  the debt 
<br/>nominal figure.  This is the level of intellectual input and honesty that has been put in.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Tuisawau  highlighted some 
<br/>one-off investments, they are one offs, of course.  He highlighted Monasavu, that is a one off, of 
<br/>course,  it  is  a  huge  investment,  and  one  other  major  one,  one-  off,  but  he  did  not  look  at  the 
<br/>consistency in  the investment.  That  is  the point  he needs to  look  at.   Consistency is not  in  your 
<br/>narrative, you only look at it up to your noses.   How we are going to win the election, that is all.  
<br/>That is all you are concerned about.  It is just your naked grab for power, you are not looking at 
<br/>consistency and long term stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  talked  about  all  the  infrastructure  work.    He  said  that  there  is  no 
<br/>strategic  investment  by  the  Government.    Was  building  Moto  not  a  strategic  investment?    Was 
<br/>tarsealing  the  West  Bank  of  Sigatoka  Valley  not  a  strategic  investment?    Was  the  tarsealing  of 
<br/>Nabouwalu to Dreketi to have it tarsealed all the way to Labasa, not a strategic investment?  Was 
<br/>tarsealing Sawani/Serea Road not  a strategic investment?  Was giving electricity to  the people in 
<br/>Naitasiri  and  various  other  places  worth  over  $186  million  worth  of  electricity  connection  not  a 
<br/>strategic investment?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the problem with the Opposition.  They come here and just throw 
<br/>things,  they  are  not  actually  thinking  about  it.    Every  time  they  open  their  mouth,  they  actually 
<br/></span><span>undermine themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable </span><span>de facto</span><span> deputy of paapi said that the judicial system is not working.  He said 
<br/>that  there  is  an  undermining  of  the  judicial  system.    What  did  he  say  about  the  judicial  system?  
<br/>Please, correct me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,    I  did  not  say  that  the  judicial  system  is  not 
<br/>working.  He is actually misrepresenting what I have said.  I talked about independent institutions 
<br/>and I referred to that, so do not mislead.  I did not say judiciary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, he cast aspersions on the judicial system, let me put it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  does  he  know  that  the  Western  Division  that  contributed  bulk  of  the 
<br/></span><span>economic contribution to this country, only had one High Court which is Lautoka till today, but they 
<br/></span><span>had only one Judge for civil and criminal cases, for years and for decades?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism comes from the Western Division, honourable Saukuru, remember that.  Sugarcane 
<br/>is in the Western Division and Northern Division; there is no permanent Court in Vanua Levu; pine, 
<br/>gold, all of that, yet the amount of resources that was given to the Western Division was minimal.   
<br/>Honourable Kuridrani knows these things.  That is what is going to happen when you support paapi, 
<br/>they will go back to their old ways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today, we have a judicial system where there are far more Magistrates, far 
<br/>more  High  Court  Judges,  we  have  far  more  Small  Claims  Tribunals,  we  have  increased  the 
<br/>jurisdiction of the Magistracy, we now have Legal Aid Commission in every single centre of Fiji, 
<br/>over $5million is allocated to legal aid services - mothers for maintenance, child maintenance, all of 
<br/>those allowances, feeding rooms were being built for them, is that not that about empowerment, about 
<br/>the rule of law?

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1043 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Laws of Fiji that we hold none of them actually hold that up.  It has been revised, it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not revised since 1985.  There was no consolidation Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  actually  did  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    The  Laws  of  Fiji  is  available  online.    If  you  an 
<br/>investor, you know what the Laws of Fiji are.  Before, you would have to come from overseas, go to 
<br/>Mundro Leys and hire expensive lawyers, and get them to decipher the loan for you.  That is what 
<br/>used to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  of  that  has  been  made  transparent.    None  of  them  has  been  referred  to.    Honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor Prasad, your level of intellectual dishonesty is just quite amazing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, there are some other issues that was highlighted that I wanted to talk 
<br/>about.  Honourable Waqanika, I am really quite concerned for two reasons. The first issue is, she 
<br/>cannot seem to let go off Fiji TV, she needs to get over that and the second issue is that, she has 
<br/>completely read the law incorrectly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The law regarding development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not about any developer.  If she reads 
<br/>the  law,  it  says,  “Should  a  development  lease  be  taken  by  Ministry  of  Lands  or  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Housing…” So, the developer in this case is not any Tom, Dick or Mary, it is Government agency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This was explained in the introduction of the Bill that when Government wants to formalise 
<br/>an informal settlement and Government, for example, either through Lands Department or Ministry 
<br/>of Housing goes and approaches the iTaukei Land Trust Board, or if it is State land that is a lot easier, 
<br/>we get a development lease, we are supposed to subdivide the land and then develop the land, give 
<br/>proper roads, bridges - if necessary, footpaths, streetlighting, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that particular process, we have the power now under the law to be able to get people to 
<br/>move their houses in alignment so we can actually build a proper road.  They will have their piece of 
<br/>property. You cannot build the road if a house is there and one house is there how can you build the 
<br/>road  this  narrow,  that  is  how  close  the  houses  are  in  those  informal  subdivisions.    How  can  we 
<br/>subdivide it?  How can we have a bus running through their subdivision, if the road is going to be 
<br/>that narrow? A car cannot even pass through, let alone two bicycles.  That is what the law is about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She  is  standing  here  and  completely  misleading  Parliament,  saying,  “Oh,  an  investor  can 
<br/>come along. This is discrimination.”  She brought the Solomon Islanders into the picture.  Solomon 
<br/>Islanders were blackbirded into Fiji, even before Girmit, and they have been in Fiji.  They live on 
<br/></span><span>land, no one is going to take away that land.  If they are living on </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land, they may have got a 
<br/></span><span>lease.  If they are living on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land with </span><span>vakavanua</span><span> arrangement, that is an arrangement between 
<br/>them and the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowner. That is nothing to do with us. We are not going to take over that 
<br/>land.  What nonsensical statement is that! Again, probably trying to look for some kind of vote bank, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue that I also wanted to raise was about citizenship, the Immigration Act they 
<br/>brought into that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in Parliament sometime back, before under the 
<br/>Immigration  Act,  a  Minister  at  his  or  her  discretion,  could  grant  someone  citizenship  at  their 
<br/>discretion, and it happened under the SVT days when the leader of Peoples Alliance Party (PAP) was 
<br/>a  Prime  Minister.    People  who  had  run  away  from  the  law  or  from  other  countries  were  granted 
<br/>citizenship  within  six  months.  What  does  that  tell  you  or  what  does  that  do  to  the  value  of  our 
<br/>citizenship?  It undermines our value. It undermines the value of citizenship.  So, any country looking 
<br/>at the Fijian Passport will say, “Alright, anyone can get their citizenship.”  What we are trying to do 
<br/>is trying to actually elevate the level of our citizenship.

<div><span>Investment Fiji Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we took away the discretionary powers of the Ministers, five and 10 was 
<br/>introduced. We have now said, “You must stay in Fiji for 15 years to get citizenship.” You can stay 
<br/>in a country, like Singapore, for 30 years and you do not get a citizenship. People have stayed there 
<br/>for 25 to 30 years, but they are permanent residency.  In the Budget statement if honourable Prof. 
<br/>Prasad was listening, I do not know if he was there or not, Mr. Speaker, because every now and then 
<br/>he  makes  cameo  appearances  in  this  Parliament,  we  had  said  that  permanent  residency  based  on 
<br/>investor levels will be granted. We had said that work permits will become a lot easier, to make it lot 
<br/>more attractive, to get in the right investors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Permanent residency, Mr. Speaker, Sir, means you can have all the rights as a normal Fijian 
<br/>citizen but you cannot do two things.  You do not get a Fijian passport, you have your passport of 
<br/>your country, you get a permanent residency as we get a permanent residency in other countries and 
<br/>you cannot vote, you are not a citizen of Fiji.  That is what we have said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact some people from the diplomatic circles have in fact congratulated us and have said 
<br/>to us, “that is actually a very good move” because now we know that your passports actually can 
<br/>become a lot more acceptable for visa free entry in some of the other countries because they know 
<br/>now  that  no  Tom,  Dick  or  Mary  can  just  get  a  Fijian  citizenship.    As  highlighted  by  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Premila Kumar, a lot of people used to come as fake investors into Fiji simply to get a Fijian passport 
<br/></span><span>so that they can get entry into other countries namely Australia, New Zealand or USA.  That is what 
<br/>they used to do, we were just simply a stepping stone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if a person wants to invest in Fiji, wants to stay in Fiji, wants to adhere to the laws of Fiji, 
<br/>they need to prove their mettle and that is, you need to stay in Fiji for 15 years.  That gives us enough 
<br/>time to know whether actually you are going to be a good citizen or not.  What is wrong with that?  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  We should be proud that no one can 
<br/>become willy-nilly citizens in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. CONNOR.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Prof. Prasad goes on about citizenship, et cetera, 
<br/>it was his leader, Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka who removed dual citizenship after the 1987 </span><span>coup.  </span><span>Before in 
<br/>Fiji, you could be in fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir ….

<br/>citizenship.
