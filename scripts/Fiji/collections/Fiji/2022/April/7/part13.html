<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM. I know more history than you my friend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Bainimarama Government multiple citizenship was introduced as 
<br/>a result of which, so many former Fijians who had lost their citizenship as a result of Mr. Rabuka’s 
<br/>decree of getting rid of dual citizenship have now returned to Fiji.  Many of them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>have taken up Fijian citizenship, some of them do not necessarily live in Fiji full-time, nonetheless 
<br/>they had come and invested.  If you look at some of the homes that are being built in the Western 
<br/>Division, some of the houses and shops being built in Vanua Levu, they are former Fijians who have 
<br/>come back and invested. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you come to this Chamber, you have to be honest.  You do not have to be hypocritical 
<br/>about it, please because the hypocrisy is quite pungent, it really is quite pungent.  Honourable Prof. 
<br/>Prasad, that is not actually a fancy word. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I again would like to highlight to the Members and I have also got sorry Sir, 
<br/>I have just received some information from the comment that honourable Gavoka made.  He went on 
<br/>about not getting a permit.  This is from a Director of Town and Country Planning, it says and I 
<br/>quote:

<div><span>“Sir, honourable Gavoka through his Nadroga/Navosa company was intending to 
<br/>develop a property along Carew Street, Flagstaff.  The issue is drainage, the drain was 
<br/>running across the property and we had advised him that it can be located.  He met us and 
<br/>we had resolved the issue.  He had 360 per cent overdevelopment and had to connect to 
<br/>sewer line, we advised him that he discuss with the Central Board of Health on alternative 
<br/>means of sewage disposal.  Suva City Council has confirmed that he has not got back to 
<br/>them…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It took too long 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- “… We were being facilitative and guiding him along ….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject)
