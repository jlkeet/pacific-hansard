<div><span>“ … on how he could have gotten his development approved legally, of course, as we would 
<br/>have advised other local investors.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the beauty about Investment Fiji is that Investment Fiji will also be assisting 
<br/>local investors and by assisting local investors, we will be assisting foreign investors and hopefully 
<br/>the ability to meet up with some locals and be able to carry out that marriage in respect of investment 
<br/>in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank all Members who have supported this particular Bill and we look forward 
<br/>to this Bill being approved by Parliament and also the regulation being put in place so we can once 
<br/>again, as this Bill has been reviewed, assessed and contributed to, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the World 
<br/>Bank, IFC and various other international partners including all the stakeholders, so we can come on 
<br/>a better footing to be able to attract more investment in Fiji and also to be able to play a facilitating 
<br/>role and create jobs and opportunities for our Fijian people.
