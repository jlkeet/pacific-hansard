<h3>INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF POVERTY –STANDING COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS</h3>
<div><span>INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF POVERTY –  
<br/>STANDING COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL AFFAIRS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  approves  that  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>undertakes an inquiry into the causes of poverty and report back to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  an  inquiry  so    that  adequate 
<br/>resources and interventions can be planned following identification,  root causes and factors leading 
<br/>to poverty.  Why so, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  The answer is very simple.  Even during the period of so-
<br/>called  unprecedented  economic  growth  of  nine  consecutive  years,  although  at  an  average  of  3.1 
<br/>percent, poverty in Fiji increased from 28 percent in 2013-2014, Household and Income Expenditure 
<br/>Survey  (HIES)  poverty  increased  to  29.9  percent  by  February  2020  even  before  the  arrival  of 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19 pandemic to our shores.  That is some 258,000 Fijians who were in poverty according to 
<br/></span><span>that report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  increase  came  despite  two  general  elections,  they  should  have  showed  confidence, 
<br/>claims of lowest unemployment and increase in the amount of Social Welfare or Poverty Alleviation 
<br/>Assistance  and  other  benefits  that  this  Government  wrongly  and  erroneously  described  as  social 
<br/>wages.  After the outbreak of COVID-19, it was described as “an act of God”, poverty in our estimate 
<br/>has risen to over 50 percent.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer lies a lot in governance as well as 
<br/>timely and successful implementation of policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No  government  can  eradicate  poverty  completely,  that  is  understandable  and  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government is no exception.  However, the problem in this Government during its two terms as well 
<br/>as before that, in my view, was not governing but managing.  Worse, it has been micro-managing 
<br/>and to add salt to the injury of the poor, Government has implemented policies of so called relief 
<br/>measures at a wrong time when the positive effects have already been negated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, in our assessment is the prime cause of rising incidence of poverty.  Remember COVID-
<br/>19 came much later, after the poverty rate increased in six years when the economy was supposedly 
<br/></span><span>growing and indeed booming.  Therefore, we have to find out what is the reason?  Is governance the 
<br/></span><span>root cause of these evil?  Is haphazard implementation of policies and increasing benefits prior to 
<br/>2018 and then chopping them after the elections?  We saw that quite clearly.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Making  drastic  changes  in  education  in  terms  of  qualification  of  scholarships  and  loan  of 
<br/>students that are highly discriminatory, for example, offering scholarship to MBBS students were 
<br/>revealed in the Revised Budget but not only to those who graduated from Year 13 or Form 7 and not 
<br/>to Foundation students.  Many of those students and parents have called us and they are struggling. 
<br/>These are not necessarily rich people, and there are many examples of that in the news.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rising food, medication and fuel prices, despite zero rating of VAT because of far and higher 
<br/>inflammatory trends outweigh the reduction.  We understand the ramification of the Russia- Ukraine 
<br/>but this is a recent phenomenon, but there are prices of items, like sugar and medication which does 
<br/>not necessarily have anything to do with the War.  I was, kind of, surprised that all of them from the 
<br/>other side tell us that we are only looking to Elections.

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Instead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if your look at what they say and 
<br/>what they do, they are looking to the Elections. They have always been looking to the Elections, 
<br/>instead of the next generation and the future of nation and all its citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt, therefore, that Fiji was already in the fry pan after the 2018 
<br/>Elections. The economy, as we all know and I have said this in Parliament before in 2018 and also 
<br/>2019,  the  economy  was  declining  and  poverty  levels  were  rising.    This  morning,  I  talked  about 
<br/>confidence, Mr. Speaker, and sadly that was missing because come the pandemic, more than 150,000 
<br/>people lost their employment.  We are told some $25,000 have resumed employment, but there are 
<br/>still more than $100,000 who are unemployed out there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  fact  that  poverty  may  have  increased  to  over  50  percent  and  not  to 
<br/>mention those who were already at the margins of poverty, would have fallen below the poverty line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Government and the next Government after the Elections, Mr. Speaker, need a 
<br/>comprehensive  plan  to  correctly  assess  its  current  position.    I  have  not  seen  any  studies  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Government or the Ministries since the COVID-19 pandemic hit us, reports that have been made 
<br/></span><span>public or presented to this Parliament, which actually talks about what the real situation is on the 
<br/>ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the laws that we pass and the initiatives of Government has failed 
<br/>miserably and we have pointed this out on many occasions.  Even the dumbest copy and paste of the 
<br/>NFP manifesto for 2018 Elections, needed four years back, was implemented four years later when 
<br/>prices are skyrocketing daily.  It is not enough in addressing the escalating cost of living. Thus, we 
<br/>have the vulnerable unable to have any affordability of basics due to unemployment and reduced 
<br/>wages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many families, Mr. Speaker, in our visits to Sigatoka, Nadi, Rakiraki and Labasa, have told 
<br/>us  during  our  visits  that  when  they  go  to  hospitals  and  this  is  the  reality.  They  are  talking  about 
<br/>campaign, Sir, I am sure people also tell them and they know that. They are handed prescriptions for 
<br/>NCD medication that they cannot afford due to lack of income. For example, a hotel worker is now 
<br/>a stroke patient and completely bedridden. His family is at the mercy of donors, as they are unable 
<br/>to withdraw his funds from FNPF on medical grounds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list can be endless and these are people who come to us. I am sure they 
<br/></span><span>go to them as well. Sometimes they go to them first and then they come to us.  Single mothers and 
<br/>widows, who have lost their jobs from the hotel industry have not been able to access social welfare 
<br/>funds and are struggling to feed their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  the  honourable  Minister  for  Social  Welfare  is  always  very  helpful,  but  there  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thousands of people like that who are struggling to put food on the table.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Save the Children Fund has provided cash vouchers to thousands of families and Fiji Council 
<br/>of Social Services (FCOSS) has been providing relief for people in informal settlements.  The Fiji 
<br/>Cancer Society continues to provide food, chemotherapy when the Ministry of Health runs out of 
<br/>chemotherapy drugs, and other support to cancer patients as we do not have a dedicated facility. We 
<br/>were told that the Fiji Women Crisis Centre (FWCC) provides food and humanitarian assistance to 
<br/>cancer survivors.  Sir, NGOs like FRIEND, continue to feed thousands of unemployed, as well as 
<br/>orphanages around the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1049 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have more than two dozen people losing their limps to amputation each 
<br/>week. They are effectively disabled, but there is no support for food, livelihood or mobility aid for 
<br/>them.  Why?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  many  thousands  who  cannot  afford  housing  and  live  in  overcrowded  homes  in 
<br/>squatters or in informal settlements.  There is an increase in the number of street dwellers, begging 
<br/>and prostitution.  This is a cruel indicator, Mr. Speaker, of stresses our citizens are going through and 
<br/>unless  we  know  and  understand  the  demographics,  the  structure,  the  causes  and  can  develop 
<br/>interventions  to  assist  those  in  need  to  rise,  we  will  continue  to  have  half  the  country’s  citizens 
<br/>struggling to meet daily essential needs, like food, water, quality and affordable educational needs of 
<br/>the children, medical services and medicine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that the 2019-2020 Household  Income Expenditure Survey 
<br/>Report  was  vigorously  condemned  by  Government  upon  its  release  last  year  because  it  showed 
<br/>disaggregated data in relation to poverty. It led to the forced removal of the Government Statistician 
<br/>at the Fiji Bureau of Statistics – Mr. Kemueli Naiqama.  Of course, no prizes for guessing why that 
<br/>unfair and unjust treatment was given to him because the news, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was not good for 
<br/>the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fact  that  poverty  increased  by  almost  2.0  percent  to  29.9  percent  in  five  years  upto 
<br/>February, 2020 rubbishes and indicates the fears that we had about the Government dragging about 
<br/>the nine years of boom, and the results were in that poverty report .   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, established that majority of the poor - 62 percent were living in 
<br/>the rural areas, while 38 percent were in urban areas.  The Western Division had the highest rate of 
<br/>poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  always  said  that  while  disaggregated  data  is  important  to  the  fair  and  targetted 
<br/>dispensation  of  assistance  to  those  who  need  it  the  most,  this  does  not  mean  that  a  politician  of 
<br/>Government is practising racism, as this Government likes to claim. The importance of disaggregated 
<br/>data was also emphasised, Mr. Speaker, by the United Nations Rapporteur, following his fact-finding 
<br/>mission.  But Government, again, of course, shot it down and Government believes this would be 
<br/>against common and equal citizenry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nothing can be further from the truth, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The increase in poverty pre-COVID 
<br/>makes a laughing stock of common and equal citizenry drum bit by this Government.  In the last two 
<br/></span><span>years, poverty has increased due to  COVID-19 to  an estimated 50 percent  and with  many on the 
<br/></span><span>margins of poverty could actually fall quite quickly into abject poverty.  And Government’s  latest 
<br/>measure of providing VAT relief, of course, plucked out of the NFP’s 2018 Manifesto which back 
<br/>then was ridiculed by Government and its business cabal, is good but is not enough to cushion the 
<br/>impact of rising prices of food.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like  I  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  may  have  come  too  little  too  late.    It  has  come  as  an 
<br/>afterthought, in my view, in an election year, and it has come at a time when prices have spiralled 
<br/>out of control.  So making basic food and essential items VAT free will not alone control food prices, 
<br/>and we all know that, and this is the major factor in driving many into poverty. So we have to look 
<br/>at other ways of assisting those who, despite all these measures, may still be in poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HIES Report highlighted that rural poverty 
<br/>was high and cane growers fall into this category.  During the delivery of the 2021-2022 Budget in 
<br/>July 2021, the honourable Minister for Economy, for once, was correct in highlighting the plight of 
<br/>growers.  He said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>1050 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Even with the guaranteed price of $85 per tonne, for example, the net income of 
<br/>a farmer who harvests 100 tonnes of cane averages less than $3,000 a year, and more 
<br/>than  40  percent  of  our  growers  harvest  less  than  100  tones.    Even  for  a  farmer  who 
<br/>harvests 300 tonnes, the net payout on average is $7,500.  Almost three-fourths of our 
<br/>farmers harvest less than 300 tonnes.  That is their annual income and it is paid four 
<br/>times over four periods”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it took the honourable (should I say again), the </span><span>de facto</span><span> leader of the FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Party seven years to finally digest the painful reality… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No original thought. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The </span><span>de facto</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … that we consistently highlighted in Parliament since 2014.  
<br/></span><span>We were then accused of playing politics, but all I see from the other side, is a shameful act of playing 
<br/>politics and worrying about the Election.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  I  am  telling  you,  it  has  actually  come  back  to  haunt  them,  because  they  had  the 
<br/>opportunity from 2014, Mr. Speaker.  They had an opportunity in that term between 2014 and 2018 
<br/>to right the policies - macro-economic fiscal policies and tax policies, but they were on a campaign 
<br/>mode throughout and we saw what happened after 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  absolutely  vital  that  we  try  and  understand  the  situation  better, 
<br/>especially  after  COVID-19,  because  there  are  many  people  out  there  who  are  suffering,  who  are 
<br/>struggling, who are desperate for help and who need help in all circumstances.  As I have said, the 
<br/>Government knows about it.  That is why I am saying that this motion is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  why  we  brought  this  motion  to  ask  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Social  Affairs  to  do  this,  is  because  of  your  Ruling  that  we  cannot  ask  for  Select 
<br/>Committees to do these things.  So, this motion, Mr. Speaker, is brought into this Parliament with the 
<br/>expectation that the Government will see this as an attempt to work together, at least, in that Standing 
<br/></span><span>Committee to look at the causes and the factors that lead to poverty, or have led to poverty, at least, 
<br/></span><span>in the last two years and before, and what are some of the ways in which we can build partnership, 
<br/>we  can  devise  policies,  we  can  re-look  at  social  protection  policies  and  we  can  review  some  the 
<br/>polices  that  this  Government  has  been  putting  forward.    Do  we  know  the  effectiveness  of  those 
<br/>policies?  These are important questions, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ADB Report actually highlighted even before COVID-19 that at the current rate at which 
<br/>the poverty rate stands in Fiji, it will be very difficult, or Fiji is almost unlikely to meet its 2030 
<br/>SDGs.  This is before COVID-19.  Now with COVID-19, it could be impossible, at least, by 2030 to 
<br/>achieve the goals there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  observations,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  alone  necessitates  the  need  for  an  inquiry  into  the 
<br/>causes and the factors that may have led to this kind of situation in the country where people are 
<br/>desperately calling for help.  It cannot be swept under the carpet.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1051 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the sake of our people, Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of us to support this motion so 
<br/>that going forward, there is a well thought-out plan and understanding of what the issues are.  I have 
<br/>not seen the Government come out with a report, of course, they rubbish the report, but if it was a 
<br/>good Government, they would have come out and talk about the areas of concern in that report and 
<br/>how Government can deal with that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this motion and I urge all the honourable Members on the 
<br/>Government side to support this motion so that the Standing Committee can go around the country, 
<br/>produce a report that can come back to Parliament, we could have a debate and it will be useful for 
<br/>Government and future governments as to look at what happened in the last two years. So, I commend 
<br/>the motion to Parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, I do not support the motion before the House.  
<br/>Before  I  continue,  I  just  want  to  correct  the  honourable  Professor  Prasad.    The  Director 
<br/>Pharmaceutical Services has just texted me to say that the majority of the chemotherapeutic drugs 
<br/>are available …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We do not believe anything that you say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Listen! We do not believe what you say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- … except the very hard to find and source medicines such 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as plactitaxel cell, etoposide and these are not used everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I WAQAINABETE.- Do not say that. This has comes from the Director himself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there has been no other government than that of our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>Voreqe Bainimarama that has assessed, reviewed, examined and put forward policies to protect the 
<br/>marginalised and the improvised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government has been taking the important proactive, empowering policies and my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>colleagues coming after me will elaborate on the many other areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In health, to step out of poverty, there are a few important things that needs to be remembered:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>We are pursuing Sustainable Development Goal 3.0 which is universal health coverage; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>We must be able to manage the social determinants for health; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Reduce the out of pocket expenses for health; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Reduce the time needed to access a health facility when someone has an emergency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  it  has  been  defined  that  there  are  poverty  related  diseases.    Many  of  these 
<br/>diseases  contribute  to  the  disease  burden  in  low  income  countries,  a  tight  link  to  the  debilitating 
<br/>conditions  of  poverty  such  as  lack  of  access  to  proper  sanitation,  health  education,  safe  drinking 
<br/>water,  poor  nutrition  and  indoor  air  pollution.    Diseases  of  poverty  are  often  easily  avoidable, 
<br/>preventable or treatable with existing medical intervention, Sir.  According to the most recent global 
<br/>burden of disease reported by WHO, 52 percent of the total disease burden in low income countries 
<br/>is caused by poverty related disease.  This include the neglected tropical diseases but also extend to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a much wider spectrum of diseases and conditions causing high though preventable morbidity and 
<br/>mortality in low and middle income countries.  These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tuberculosis; 
<br/>Parasitic Diseases;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>HIV/AIDS; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Malaria; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Other tropical diseases including dengue fever; 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Brewlyaser; 
<br/>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Respiratory infections, for example, pneumonia, diarrhoeal disease, nutritional deficiencies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leptospirosis; 
<br/>Treatable childhood diseases, for example, polio, measles, ptosis; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and other peri-natal and maternal conditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these are some of the diseases that we are beginning to see that we are winning 
<br/>the battle against.  We are winning the battle because not only is health doing its part but also the 
<br/>social determinants of health have been working in that regard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to share some of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services policy 
<br/></span><span>in  ways  in  which  we  have  supported  and  mitigated  the  work  against  poverty.    One  is  the  Free 
<br/>Medicine Scheme.  There are now many Fijians who meet the threshold and are registered under the 
<br/>Free Medicine Scheme.  They have a card. Once they receive a prescription, they can then turn up to 
<br/>a participating pharmacy and take their medicines from the participating pharmacy rather than having 
<br/>to wait up in the chemist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have the subsidised haemodialysis, not only that, but we also run our dialysis 
<br/>units within the hospitals in Suva, Lautoka and Labasa and also the dialysis unit that is running for 
<br/>chronic dialysis in Nadera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  had  a  policy  and  we  had  the  catheterization  laboratory  which  we  had 
<br/>discussed here about two days ago and the fact that the catheterization laboratory still works and it is 
<br/>actually  heavily  subsidised  for  those  Fijians  who  meet  the  threshold,  given  the  fact  that  the 
<br/>consumables are very expensive and one would have to pay even more to have it privately done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had free health care except, of course, for some dental procedures 
<br/>but if you have a major operation that needs to be done, the surgeons will go ahead and do it.  I know 
<br/></span><span>for sure that some of us had worked in countries overseas where they will first check your passport 
<br/></span><span>to find out whether you actually meet the requirement to have an operation.  I know that there have 
<br/>been family members who we had fundraised to be able to support them with their medical treatment 
<br/>overseas  because  they  have  been  there,  they  are  stuck  there,  they  are  not  citizen  of  that  place  or 
<br/>permanent resident and they actually have to pay.  But for every citizen here in Fiji, no one has to 
<br/>pay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other policy is the General Practitioner Subsidy Scheme which is now 
<br/>in place.  We have those who meet the criteria or any Fijian can turn up to their nearest General 
<br/>Practitioner.  I was in Muanikoso, Makoi area a few weeks ago and they said that they have obviously 
<br/>two participating General Practitioners in Makoi.  Certainly when they turn up to Makoi, they can go 
<br/>straight and see them, pick up a script and go to a participating free medicine scheme pharmacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have subsidised dental services that are going to begin for participating 
<br/>dental practitioners as alluded to in the Budget by the Minister for Economy. We have subsidised

<div><span>you call St John, the Government gives St John money so that they can be able to subsidise the cost 
<br/>of your relative or our relative that gets picked up.  In some instances, they do not have to pay.  For 
<br/>distances that are quite lengthy from CWM Hospital, for example, the most they might pay is $50 
<br/>because the subsidy is paid for by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  also  and  I  will  talk  about  this  little  bit  later  on  the  social 
<br/>determinants of health, we have also have been increasing the access to health care for those in our 
<br/>rural  areas.    Sir,  I  want  to  touch  a  little  bit  on  social  determinants  of  health  because  this  is  so 
<br/>important. The access through new roads into places, there are now villages in Navosa that have a 
<br/>road.  Because they now have a road they have the ability to be able to access our health services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Regional Development talked about a village up in Nakida, I 
<br/>have been there, I walked there and I ask the honourable Prof. Biman Prasad to walk there. I can tell 
<br/>you that they do not walk anymore because they have a road and because there is a road, they are 
<br/>able to use that road, come by four-wheel drive and even if it is dry weather, they can walk on the 
<br/>road rather than having to climb cliffs or hills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the improved value added stations that we have now.  Sir, before Dawasamu 
<br/></span><span>was a nursing station so when one turns up to Dawasamu and had a disease that actually needed a 
<br/></span><span>doctor to look at, they would then have to travel all the way down to Lodoni.  Now they do not, it is 
<br/>now a Nurse Practitioner Health Centre C Station.  This is also now in Namara in Tailevu, Navunikabi 
<br/>in Namosi and Bouma in Taveuni to name are few.  The access to medical care is now being brought 
<br/>closer to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week I was in Tau because we just put a doctor in Tau Health Centre.  
<br/>That doctor is married to a dentist and that dentist who works in Sigatoka will now provide one to 
<br/>one-an-half days of dental procedures and dental consultation in the Tau area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We now have a doctor in Nawaicoba, so in between Nadi going down to Sigatoka, we have 
<br/>doctors in Nadi, we have a doctor in Nawaicoba, we have a doctor in Tau, we have two doctors in 
<br/>Cuvu, we have  got  doctors in  Sigatoka, we have a doctor in  Vatukarasa, a doctor in  Korolevu,  a 
<br/>doctor  in  Korovisilou  and  now  a  Nurse  Practitioner  in  Galoa  even  before  Namelimeli.    This  is 
<br/>increasing access to our people and reducing the out of pocket expenses.  Because Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>one thing that has been found is that when the out of pocket expenses and also the inability to be able 
<br/>to reach a health care provider within two hours for an emergency case is one of the reasons why our 
<br/>people are not able to have quality health care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2014-2015  we  did  an  assessment  of  the  ability  to  access  emergency 
<br/>surgery and the cut-off in which people will say around the world that you are doing very well was 
<br/>80 percent.  Most of the countries in the Pacific did not make 80 percent.  At that time, we were 67 
<br/>percent.  We think now that we are close to or above 80 percent.  With the fact that Savusavu Hospital 
<br/>has 24/7 clinicians from Labasa looking after it for emergency obstetrics, emergency appendectomy, 
<br/>emergency fractures and the fact that Ba Hospital will now be working under Aspen beginning this 
<br/>Saturday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the motion on the floor that the 
<br/>Standing Committee be given the responsibility to undertake an inquiry into the causes of poverty 
<br/>and report back to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  if  words,  just  like  we  have  heard  from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health, 
<br/>promises could reduce poverty, Fiji then would be like Norway with the lowest poverty rate.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  this  Government  has  no  shame  in  misleading  the  people.    They  have  no  shame  in

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hoodwinking the people. They have no shame in making false promises. The question is, does this 
<br/>FijiFirst Government really care about our people especially those living on or below the poverty 
<br/>line?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, let us then look at the poverty situation in Fiji because this is their performance 
<br/>indicator and as we have heard from honourable Professor Prasad that poverty continues to increase 
<br/>even before COVID-19.  Even though the Government comes up with the excuse that COVID-19 
<br/>has sort of brought about this increasing poverty rate, but Sir,   right now we are sitting at about 50 
<br/>percent of our population, those that are living on or below the poverty line … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Where is your figure from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- … and that we are looking at about 450,000 people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Oh please! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, that is the reality of the matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- No it is not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- The reality of the matter is rich people are getting richer and the 
<br/>poor people are getting poorer.  Mr. Speaker, the reality of the matter is the poverty gap continues to 
<br/>widen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Right!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- So, Mr. Speaker, we ask the questions. What are the causes?  Why 
<br/>is almost half of our population living on or below the poverty line?  I will re-echo what honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad has said, is  it bad  governance  by the Government  in  handling the affairs of our 
<br/>country? Mr. Speaker, I will refer to the Sustainable Development Goals because time and again we 
<br/>hear the Government side talk about the 17 SDGs.  What has Fiji as a country achieved in regards to 
<br/>the 17 SDGs? Have they once presented a report in regards to Fiji’s achievement of the 17 SDGs?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, on the UN website. Read it!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Bring it to Parliament!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR.- Technology!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  let  me  touch  on  the  pivotal  role  that  good 
<br/>governance plays in uplifting our lives, our people’s lives out of poverty and I would like to remind 
<br/>the  other  side  of  the  House  on  the  pillars  of  good  governance,  that  is,  participation,  consensus 
<br/>agreement,  accountability,  transparency,  responsiveness,  equitable  and  inclusiveness  and  one  that 
<br/>follows the rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we ask how, has been the FijiFirst Government use these pillars of good 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>governance in regards to public service delivery to our people?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Koroilavesau,  one  day  you  will  come 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back and those words will haunt you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me try and give us a clearer picture and let us look at public service 
<br/>delivery, alongside the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   SDG1 – No poverty.  Poverty 
<br/>in all its forms everywhere.  The UN and this Government’s target is that, we reduce poverty by 50 
<br/>percent in the year 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been hearing that poverty continues to increase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Where is your evidence? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- They are asking for evidence. If the Government had not sacked 
<br/>the Chief Executive Officer of the Fiji Bureau of Statistics and you read the findings in that Report 
<br/>…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- He was giving you wrong information, that is the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- …then you would not be interjecting with that kind of comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The report is here, honourable Radrodro, look up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if our poverty rate continues to increase, then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what is the problem with this Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Attorney-General, do not say </span><span>oilei, </span><span>you listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  have  the  legal  framework,  you  continuously  bring  into  Parliament  legislations  under 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  There are policies in place, and honourable Waqainabete had just mentioned 
<br/>that, that they have policies and programmes in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, why are 50 percent of our population living on or below the poverty line? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Not 50 percent, where did you get the figures from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Why  is  it,  honourable  Prime  Minister?    Why  is  it  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy?  Only what we can say is that, they have failed to effectively and efficiently 
<br/>enforced  their  legislations  and  their  policies  have  failed.    Why  have  these  policies  failed?    It  is 
<br/>because policy formulation has been on a top-down approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have failed to consult the people, listened to them and formulate policies to reflect the 
<br/>priorities of the people.  For example, Mr. Speaker, I had mentioned this in this Parliament during 
<br/>the  COVID-19  Supplementary  Budget  whereby  the  mainstream  media  had  highlighted  that  food 
<br/>preparations  at  Colonial  War  Memorial  (CWM) Hospital  had  been  taken  to  the  Military  and  one 
<br/>could not notice the good condition of the Military kitchen, as compared to the CWM Kitchen.  So, 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health, how can we expect our sick patients to be able to recuperate quickly 
<br/>if that is the condition of the kitchen in which their food is prepared?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are various programmes in place to realise their policy intention.  There 
<br/>are budgetary allocations in place to realise various programmes and policies, so to bring our people

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022

<div><span>out of poverty.  But with that kind of increasing poverty rate, we still ask, what is wrong with this 
<br/>Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- What is wrong with you? Something is wrong with you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  wrong  with  this  Government  in  not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognising the problems that people have? Are you blind? Are you deaf to their cries?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have made too many false promises, as reflected in their failed public 
<br/>service delivery. So people are questioning about what I am saying, how does bad governance look 
<br/>like?  What is the visible form of this bad governance to the people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on SDG2 - Zero Hunger: End hunger, achieve 
<br/>food security and improve nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. We must acknowledge and 
<br/></span><span>I thank the NGOs and CSOs in their assistance during the COVID-19 period whereby a lot of our 
<br/></span><span>people lost their jobs and there was a lot struggles in our society. We must acknowledge and thank 
<br/>them for their timely assistance, particularly in the provision of food rations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I heard honourable Koroilavesau said that the Government assisted too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes, of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.S.V. RADRODRO.- Yes, I acknowledge that, but then one of their policies is that, for 
<br/>those who have lost their job is to go and help themselves by using their own FNPF and have not 
<br/>made any commitment to refund those FNPF contributions that they have used, Mr. Speaker. People 
<br/>are still unemployed now, so what assistance are being given to these people?  They are still looking 
<br/>for jobs. They said they  are going to another $360, honourable Minister for Economy?  If that is 
<br/>coming from your side of the House, that is very good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on SDG3 - Good Health and Wellbeing: Ensure healthy lives and promote 
<br/>wellbeing for all and at all ages. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had highlighted this before that diabetes is the 
<br/>number one killer in Fiji and how our country holds number one place in the world in regards to 
<br/></span><span>death rate from diabetes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard the honourable Minister for Health talking about all the policies, programmes 
<br/>and the medical facilities that have been renovated, but he failed to mention what policy review or 
<br/>what new policy they have in place which they intend to raise in the next Budgetary session so it 
<br/>addresses this big problem that we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Honourable  speaker,  I  do  not  have  the  time  to  go  into  that  in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON.S.V. RADRODRO.- The next issue is on access to medicine, the free medicine that is 
<br/>just been flaunted by the honourable Minister for Health.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, he listed down the list of 
<br/>free medicine, where to access them from but the problem is that, when people go to those outlets to 
<br/>access those medicine, they are not available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, no!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Where are you getting all these? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- That is the problem, Mr. Speaker. You just have to go to CWM 
<br/>hospital.  Go to the Maternity Unit, honourable Minister for Economy, and you can go and see for 
<br/>yourself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. A. Sayed-Khaiyum interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.S.V. RADRODRO.- You will recall in the previous Budget session, when there was a 
<br/></span><span>provision for International Golf, we on this side of the House, during the Committee stage of the 
<br/></span><span>Budget,  we  had  requested  that  International  Golf  be  put  on  hold  and  divert  that  money  for  the 
<br/>renovation of the CWM Hospital, particularly the Maternity Ward.  But what happened? Nothing 
<br/>happened, the Government does not listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you should take that on board it is because of the financial burden that this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will have on our economy and also, may be our economic policies are not working.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at SDG4 - Quality Education:  Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education 
<br/>and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.  Mr. Speaker, because of time constraints, I will 
<br/>just give examples.  We will recall there was a promise made by the Minister for Education then, the 
<br/>one IPad that is going to be provided to students.  This would have come in very handy during the 
<br/>COVID-19 lockdown period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the sad thing is that because of the performance evaluation that teachers do have 
<br/>to undertake with the Ministry, I had this parent calling in, this is the dad of the family, who does not 
<br/>work and stays home and his wife is a teacher and she had to buy six phones to be able to help their 
<br/>students in regards to their online learning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though we had a debate on the FNU Labasa Campus, I think in the previous term of 
<br/>Parliament, I just had to smile when I saw the Fiji Sun reporting in the mainstream media that it was 
<br/>titled “ FNU Campus Lying in Ruins”, honourable Minister for Education. Also, in regards to FNU, 
<br/>what is Government’s plan now in having to pay up the arrears of Government grant?  In regards to 
<br/>USP also, what is Government’s plan in regard to paying up the arrears of Government grant?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Economy was making a side laugh with the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Education but this is not laughing matter.  They know and we know that 
<br/>education holds the key to making that breakthrough in any family and in any society.  If they  do 
<br/>hold that truth in them, then why is Government to FNU and USP being withheld? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Free education.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you talk about education.  Someone mentioned 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to me whilst in Bua recently that the Yadua District School… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- …has not been fully renovated after the cyclone.  Yes, I also went 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Lekutu, it is still under construction.  How long is this construction going to take, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, can I have another five minutes because there is a lot of interjections? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have five minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on SDG5 -  Gender Equality:  Achieve gender 
<br/>equality and empower all women and girls.  Mr. Speaker, if there is anything that this Government 
<br/>could really do, they would have brought into the House the temporary special measure, to ensure 
<br/>that more women are in Parliament.  But rather, Mr. Speaker, they brought in a piece of legislation 
<br/></span><span>under Standing Order 51, targeting women to go and change their name in the birth certificate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- It is relevant because this targets women make it difficult for them 
<br/>to exercise their civil right and to vote. A lot of women have told me, why should I bother?  Why 
<br/>should  I  pay  my  bus  fare  and  go  there  to  try  and  change  my  name,  when  nothing  was  wrong 
<br/>previously?  So they only talk about empowering women, they really do not do anything about us 
<br/>women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on SDG6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, ensure availability and sustainable 
<br/>management of water and sanitation for all.  The water problem in the greater Suva area, Nasinu 
<br/>corridor and in Lami still happens.  This is a continuous problem even though honourable Minister 
<br/>Usamate comes into Parliament and tells us that there is water, it is not a problem.  It is a problem, 
<br/>honourable Minister Usamate.  If you know that, even the new CEO coming in would not be able to 
<br/>fix the problem.  You watch honourable Minister because that has been the trend.  The CEOs have 
<br/>been taken away, Permanent Secretaries have been taken away…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not address the Minister, address the Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly in the West.  I had raised this before.  If the Government was truthful enough in regards 
<br/>to the review of the Local Government Act, maybe they would have come up with new policies and 
<br/>strategies to be able to address the big revenue arrears in rate collection, and that money could be 
<br/>diverted in consultation, in conjunction with the line Ministry to be able to address the poor drainage 
<br/>in all our municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On SDG16, this one is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me, please.  It is on Peace, 
<br/>Justice  and  Strong  Institutions.    This  is  to  promote  peaceful,  inclusive  societies  for  sustainable 
<br/>development,  provide  access  to  justice  for  all,  build  effective  and  accountable  and  inclusive 
<br/>institutions at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to end, I would just like to highlight on how Members of the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been taken up by the police, the CID to the police station for interviews.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- The motion is on poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Poverty is a cross cutting issue.  It also links in to this one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that demonstrates that this Government is only full of talk and no action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, keep to your speaking times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the motion moved by honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad.  At the outset, I must say I do not support it.  However, I must applaud the strategic 
<br/>move  by  honourable  Professor  Prasad  to  move  this  motion  at  this  time,  months  away  from  the 
<br/>election.  He had four years to bring a motion to Parliament that talks about poverty, and suddenly 
<br/>months away from the election, he remembers the poor people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  point  in  time,  please  allow  me  to  acknowledge  all  civil  society 
<br/>organisations and individuals who continue to provide for relief efforts to our vulnerable and poor, 
<br/>whether it is in times of crisis or everyday life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty is  a  global phenomenon and Fiji  is  no exception.  The findings  of the Household 
<br/>Income and Expenditure Survey for numerous years, statistics are collated every four years and is 
<br/>well recorded, and we know that poverty is a reality in Fiji.  The Bainimarama Government and the 
<br/>Fijian Government has never turned a blind eye to it.  In fact, I am sure that most of us here in this 
<br/></span><span>Parliament have grown from humble beginnings, some lucky than the others and naturally we always 
<br/></span><span>feel passionate about the poor of the country.  All of us, most of us or whoever has grown up in 
<br/>poverty  would  know  life  is  a  struggle  and  there  is  always  an  effort  to  break  that  struggle.    This 
<br/>Government  has  implemented  a  lot  of  initiatives,  that  is,  providing  support  to  the  vulnerable  of 
<br/>society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, we must be truthful to our people. Honourable Salote Radrodro, you talked 
<br/>about 50 percent of people living in poverty.  I do not know where you got that figure from.  I know 
<br/>the latest report says 29.9 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- That was years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- No, if you read the recent report, honourable Seruiratu will be  talking 
<br/>more about that and so we will wait for his turn. Please do not manipulate numbers and facts, to gain,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you know what I am talking about, cheap political mileage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- No, if you read the recent report, honourable Seruiratu will be  talking 
<br/>more about that and so we will wait for his turn. Please do not manipulate numbers and facts, to gain, 
<br/>you know what I am talking about, cheap political mileage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, poverty is a multi-facet development issue. Fiji amongst other developing 
<br/>countries around the globe continue to fight and the fight has to be through a harmonised, whole of 
<br/>Government across approach and the Fijian Government is doing just that, which means in Fiji we 
<br/>already know what the causes of poverty are.  There are reports by the World Bank and ADB that 
<br/>clearly  states  the  root  courses  of  poverty.  We  are  not  saying  that  there  is  no  poverty.    As  a 
<br/>Government, we have never said that there is no poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also note the impact of climate change and the recent COVID pandemic 
<br/>has plunged the poor and vulnerable into further poverty. We recognise that if this is not addressed 
<br/>and mitigated pragmatically through a targeted and rights-based approach, recovery efforts will only 
<br/>worsen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty in Fiji is far from the poverty situation it is made to look by Members of the other 
<br/></span><span>side of the House.  It is so because this Government has always tried its level best to  cushion the 
<br/>impacts of poverty in Fiji through many initiatives that cuts across all Government agencies. Because 
<br/>of such programmes in place, the Government has an existing poverty monitoring arm which is the 
<br/>Poverty  Monitoring  Unit  that  sits  within  my  Ministry.  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  honourable 
<br/>Professor  Prasad  is  trying  to  say,  is  trying  to  move  simply  a  duplication  of  what  the  Poverty 
<br/>Monitoring Unit is already mandated to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- I do not see why we need more resources for what he is calling for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because we already have the resources, personnel and staff and they are just doing that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Poverty Monitoring Unit is fully funded by the Fijian Government and can report on the 
<br/>very same to Parliament.  Various development agencies like the World Bank and ADB as I have 
<br/>mentioned  have  already  reported  on  the  causes  and  situations  of  poverty  in  Fiji  year  after  year.  
<br/>Honourable Professor Prasad,  I  suggest  you  read these reports which are independent  reports not 
<br/>influenced by this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- There you go! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government is pro-actively addressing the 
<br/>root causes of poverty hence the Government through its National Development Plan 5-Year and 20-
<br/>Year  articulates an inclusive socio-economic development  approach to  further improve the living 
<br/>standards of Fijians under the umbrella team of alleviating poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I speak of recovery and Government cushioning the impacts of poverty, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  a  number  of  initiatives  that  I  must  mention,  to  put  things  into  perspective  that  only  this 
<br/>Government has done, such as, recently the increase in the minimum wage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in one 
<br/>of  the  most  difficult  economic  times,  this  Government  has  recognised  the  need  to  increase  the 
<br/>minimum wage.  The National Minimum Wage rate will increase to $4 per hour which all of you 
<br/>know.  Together with this, we have removed VAT on 21 basic items at a time when this revenue was 
<br/>necessary for the Government.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Social Protection Programme, social protection is a human right and an integral part of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  It is targeted at assisting: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Women; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Children; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>People living with disabilities; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Senior citizens; and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Poor in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the downturn in our economy, this Government has not only continued to fund the 
<br/>Social  Protection  for  Needy  but  also  increased  the  budgetary  allocation  to  my  Ministry  which  is 
<br/>responsible for administration of the Social Protection Programme.  This fiscal year, we received an 
<br/>allocation  of  $113  million  for  our  Social  Protection  Programme  which  supports  over  86,000 
<br/>households and individuals. Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last seven years a total of $223 million has 
<br/>been allocated to the Poverty Benefit Scheme, $50 million to the Care and Protection Allowance, 
<br/>$258 million to the Social Pension Scheme (the first ever pension scheme), $7.3 million to the Rural 
<br/>Pregnant Mothers Scheme and of course we have got $1 million for Fire Assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Disability Allowance over the last five years, honourable Professor Prasad was allocated 
<br/></span><span>to a total budget of $40.4 million whereas the Bus Fare Scheme has been allocated a total budget of 
<br/>$35.2  million.    These  are  schemes  and  programmes  which  allows  the  disabled  Fijians  to  access 
<br/>monthly  allowances.  We  also  help  them  with  assistive  devices,  like  if  they  need  wheelchairs, 
<br/>walking-sticks, hearing aid, we do all that. These allowances are monthly (if you go back in record) 
<br/>never before did the disabled have anything like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Those senior citizens are over 65 years, they receive an allowance of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$100; never before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Absolutely.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I must point out  that  it was  this Government  that 
<br/>recognised the needs of senior citizens and persons living with disabilities and provided individual 
<br/>assistance programmes for them.  It was this Government that introduced the Food Voucher Initiative 
<br/>in  2010  and  took  it  up  to  notch  by  catering  for  the  needs  of  rural  pregnant  mothers.    It  was  this 
<br/></span><span>Government that recognised the need to make accessibility easier for our citizens and introduced the 
<br/></span><span>Bus Fare Subsidy Programme for elderly and persons with disabilities.  It was this Government, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that has come up with Fiji’s first ever targeted Social Assistance Policy aimed to cater 
<br/>through the social protection needs, the missing needle in times of emergencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must emphasise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Social Protection Assistance, there is a monthly 
<br/>allowance and has been consistent under this Government’s leadership, not only that, but allowances 
<br/>have increased in the past decade and new programmes have been introduced too, to cater for those 
<br/>who lost their jobs during COVID-19 and did not meet the criteria of our Social Protection Scheme, 
<br/>the Government quickly innovated an unemployment payout.  Millions of dollars was also used to 
<br/>provide relief food items to those who were affected by COVID related lockdowns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Micro-insurance for welfare recipients, the Fijian Government in partnership with Fiji Care 
<br/>Insurance has invested in a pioneer insurance package that covers social welfare recipients first ever.  
<br/>Our vulnerable do not have to run around looking for money for funeral expenses and it is the first 
<br/>such initiative that ensures that the most vulnerable segment of our population are insured, something

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no  other  government  had  thought  of.    It  covers  all  beneficiaries  under  our  Social  Protection 
<br/>Programme and since the inception of this partnership between Government and Fiji Care, like I said, 
<br/>now there are 16,700 claims have been paid out which amounts to about $20.9 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the Disaster Relief Programme, following </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> the Fijian 
<br/>Government  implemented  a  number  of  disaster  response  social  protection  programmes  for  the 
<br/>vulnerable.  The Help for Home Initiative was the first of its kind in the history of Fiji, designed to 
<br/>give affected households the resources they need to rebuild their damaged homes, including roofs to 
<br/>withstand  severe  weather  events,  $127.8  million  was  injected  into  this  Initiative  assisting  almost 
<br/>40,000 families.  Imagine how these families would have managed to rebuild their homes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can recall, when I was a little girl, </span><span>Hurricane</span><span> </span><span>Bebe, </span><span>I remember my mother telling me that 
<br/>the roof flew off.  No one gave us a single nail to fix the roof, we lived in those times.  Now, we have 
<br/>a Government that cares for these vulnerable and here we have honourable Members talking about 
<br/>that it is just talk and no action.  What you are saying is all talk and what we are doing is all action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we did not stop at that, we also invested $24.8 million to support over 40,000 
<br/>social welfare recipients as top-up.  We understood that they were the hardest hit in socio-economic 
<br/></span><span>terms.  The Government  also  invested about  $220 million  to  build back schools, the Care  for  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Initiative was also an unprecedented wide-reaching programme. I am talking about the poor and the 
<br/>vulnerable and the assistance given to them.  So, 80,283 households benefited from this $91.5 million 
<br/>investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  </span><span>TC  Harold</span><span>,  the  Government  spent  over  $6 
<br/>million to support all our social welfare recipients through cash top-ups and $1.1 million to support 
<br/>those affected by cyclones especially.  We never forgot our poor and the vulnerable.  We continued 
<br/>to assist them, to cushion the impact, so to say that this Government is not doing anything to support 
<br/>the poor and vulnerable is ridiculous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of women’s economic empowerment, the national women’s machinery had a 300 
<br/>percent  budget  increment  under  the  leadership  of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister  because  we 
<br/>identified gender inequality as a barrier to women’s economic participation.  Through the national 
<br/>women’s machinery, the Fijian Government has supported over 50 women’s groups in a span of four 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The women’s Micro Enterprise Development seed funding, this has been a total investment 
<br/></span><span>of almost $300,000.  We have invested over $2 million in the National Women’s Expo to bring the 
<br/></span><span>women  together  over  a  span  of  four  years,  allowing  thousands  of  rural  women  artisans  to  find  a 
<br/>platform to connect to markets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very personal.  I will move on to education assistance.  I am sure the honourable Minister 
<br/>is going to talk about free education.  I grew up in an era where we had to fund our own education, 
<br/>where we were humiliated for not paying school fees and I experienced that, being sent home, chased 
<br/>out of the classroom to go home and get the fees.  My poor mother could not afford that.  I left home 
<br/>to go to school but I hid in the cane farms because the teachers would humiliate you and it was very 
<br/>difficult.  Under this Government, under the honourable Prime Minister, education is our priority.  
<br/>Our children do not go through that.  Our poor parents do not have to worry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, you are saying that this Government is not pro-poor?  This Government is pro-poor.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do everything to help and support.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just yesterday, the Asian Development Bank’s Gender and Development Report came and 
<br/>99.1 percent of women and girls in Fiji are able to read and write.  That is an achievement for Fiji, 
<br/>and I wish you would applaud that initiative.  No, you will not agree to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember when I wanted to go to university, even though I scored very high marks, I could 
<br/>not get a scholarship.  Back in those days, you work and you pay.  Our group of students in the 1970s 
<br/>and 1980s, we did that.  You wait for your FNPF to increase, so you use it to pay your fees or parents 
<br/>had to sell their properties - cars, farms and everything to send their children to school.  That is not 
<br/>the case now.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 50,000 students since the inception of TELS and Toppers have gone 
<br/>through education.  This is a Government that cares for the poor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  not  forgetting  that  this  the  first  Government  that  eliminated  racially 
<br/>segregating scholarship programmes, and recognised and supported meritorious awardees under the 
<br/>Toppers  and  TELS,  and  I  am  proud  to  be  part  of  a  Government  that  values  education.    I  think 
<br/>honourable Radrodro talked about how education is a game changer.  Education is something that 
<br/>helps people get out of poverty, we cannot deny that fact.   So, education is our priority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Pay your arrears to FNU and USP.  Put your words into action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! Do not carry out a conversation between you two.  Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Speaker! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, subsidised medical care, housing assistance, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Put your money where your mouth is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- You are not listening to me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Look who is talking! You want to question the Government, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government has done more than enough!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There you go!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.S.  AKBAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  subsidised  medical  care,  housing  assistance, 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure development, agricultural assistance, SME grants, subsidies on basic utilities are also 
<br/>amongst the many things that this Government has done to support low income earners.  But, far too 
<br/>often, Mr. Speaker, honourable Members on the other side of the House have shamelessly termed 
<br/>these assistances as  freebies in their anti-poor speeches.  In fact,  I take it as an insult to the poor 
<br/>people of this country when people say they are given assistance as freebies.  This is the assistance 
<br/>they deserve from their government, the elected government, and these are not freebies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to inform Parliament that the Ministry is in the process 
<br/>of establishing a national coordinating committee on poverty alleviation. The primary objective of 
<br/>this  committee  will  be  to  foster  partnerships,  coordination  and  oversee  the  implementation, 
<br/>monitoring and evaluation of the integrated national poverty eradication programme’s impact across 
<br/>Government, with the guidance of the Poverty Monitoring Unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir and to assure honourable Members on the other side, this 
<br/>Committee  comprises  of  Government  agencies  but  will  also  ensure  and  with  the  support  of  non-

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>government and regional and international development partners to adopt a holistic approach in our 
<br/>fight to alleviate poverty in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I, myself, have had a childhood in poverty.  Never did I see a 
<br/>Government that helps us, and I wish I was born and get educated and living in this era under this 
<br/>Government, life would be so different, and I hope our people, our children and our elderly appreciate 
<br/>the efforts of the Government in trying to release some of the discomforts that they have because 
<br/>they do not fit in that poor group.  We will continue as a Government, we will continue with  the 
<br/>schemes that we have in place.  We will continue to be a caring and a compassionate Government 
<br/>with the sole intention to make a positive change in your life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the womb to the tomb, we have cared for our citizens in every aspect.  Before a child is 
<br/>born, the mother is provided with a voucher to help her sustain her nutrition.  When a senior citizen 
<br/>passes away, there are schemes to help them with their funeral expenses. So, like I said, from the 
<br/>womb to  the tomb, from  putting food on the table to  taking  care of  your  health needs, education 
<br/>needs, housing needs, we are there for you.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take my seat and I do not support the 
<br/>motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion from the other side of the 
<br/></span><span>House  is,  again,  as  mentioned  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation, is just a suggestion that will duplicate the undertakings of the existing machinery, that 
<br/>is, the Poverty Monitoring Unit which is mandated with the responsibility to plan and formulate in 
<br/>collaboration with key stakeholders, an Integrated National Poverty Eradication Programme in line 
<br/>with Government’s target of reducing poverty to 10 percent by 2036 as per the National Development 
<br/>Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, reinventing the wheel through this motion will not necessarily mean that 
<br/>we will address all the root causes of poverty, but it will be just a total waste of public spending and 
<br/>disrupting  the  well  thought-out  processes  that  is  mandated  under  the  established  body  of 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  understand  that  poverty  is  a  global  problem,  and  now  with  the 
<br/>disruptions  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  compounded  with  the  forces  of  global  conflict,  climate 
<br/>change and natural disasters, it would basically slow down the progress of reducing poverty.  As a 
<br/>result,  about  100  million  additional  people  in  the  world  are  living  in  poverty  as  a  result  of  the 
<br/>pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is evident also in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are not going to deny that.  The joint 
<br/>assessment that was conducted by the UN agencies, I think honourable Radrodro was asking if a 
<br/>report has been made, yes, there was a report made about the impact of COVID-19 and how it affects 
<br/>the  wellbeing  and  livelihood  of  Fijian  communities,  and  we  are  working  on  that  Report.    This 
<br/>independent evaluation is crucial for the Government’s timely and effective policy interventions and 
<br/>immediate response to address the impacts of COVID-19 then. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  underlying  causes  of  poverty  have  been  well  documented  in  most 
<br/>Government and development partners’ reports and studies.  Some of the key underlying causes that 
<br/>are common globally, including here in Fiji, are low income level, and the honourable Minister has 
<br/>talked  about  the  various  packages  that  are  available  in  Government.    The  minimum  wage,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is to address the issue of low income level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of employment opportunities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was commenting to the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Economy when we were talking about the previous motion about Investment Fiji and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>

<div><span>Inquiry Into the Causes of Poverty – S/C on Social Affairs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1065 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Opposition opposed it, but that is what is going to create more employment opportunities for our 
<br/>people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The low level of skills and education attainment, the huge investment in the Education Sector, 
<br/>expiring of land leases and we have, through the Committee on Better Utilisation of Land (CBUL) 
<br/>and the Land Bank and, of course, subsidising the lease to the landowners so that that issue can be 
<br/>addressed because if you look at some of the trends when we analyse the poverty issues, especially 
<br/>post-2000 and early years - 2002 and 2003, one of the major contributing factors which affects the 
<br/>sugar industry significantly was the expiry of land leases which were not renewed.  So, these are 
<br/>some of the contributing factors, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The evidence are already there, and I think for 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the National Federation Party to come up with this, I think it shows that he 
<br/>is out of touch with what is happening in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of excess to affordable basic social services, such as education, health, infrastructure 
<br/>and other basis amenities.  I will not go into details but let me say this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is an 
<br/>independent report, a Systematic Country Diagnostic 2017 Report by the World Bank.  Let me read 
<br/>what this reports says, and I quote:  “The rate of Poverty has been declining between 2002 and 2013, 
<br/>according to the consumption-based poverty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will talk more about that because previously, as all honourable Members 
<br/>know, our Fiji Bureau of Statistics were focussing on income based report. But the same data was 
<br/>translated  into  the  consumption  analysis  by  the  World  Bank  and  this  is  the  summary  that  I  have 
<br/>stated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2019-2020  HIES  recorded  an  estimated  29.9  percent  of  incidents  of  poverty  in  Fiji. 
<br/>Honourable  Radrodro,  once  again,  29.9  percent  of  incidents  of  poverty  in  Fiji.  That  is  also 
<br/>understandable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- 2019-2020, it includes COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- COVID-19 started in the year 2019. There was a change 
<br/>in methodology from the traditional.  Before that, let me state the figures to the honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the consumption based method in 2002 and 2003 HIES, the incidents of 
<br/>poverty was 39.8 percent.  In the 2008 and 2009 HIES, the rate was 35.2 percent.  In 2013 and 2014 
<br/></span><span>HIES Report, the rate was 34.0 percent.  In 2019 and 2020 Report, it was 29.9 percent. Is that an 
<br/></span><span>increase or a decrease?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Decrease.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- You don’t know what he is talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have to be a rocket scientist 
<br/>to interpret this. It is just common sense. If it was 39.8 percent and if it is now 29.9 percent - that is 
<br/>a decrease.  If we go and take the income method, they are consistent. In 2002 and 2003, it was 35 
<br/>percent; 2008 and 2009, it was 31 percent; in 2013 and 2014, it was 28 percent, so from 35 percent 
<br/>to 28 percent – a decrease. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  figures  demonstrated  that  despite  the  change  in  methodology,  the 
<br/>overall trend remains consistent with the income method as our poverty rate, continued to be trending 
<br/>downward.  Of course, there has been a report post-COVID-19 but do not lie in this august House

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that it is increasing because the data says otherwise, and these are facts, honourable Radrodro.  Do 
<br/>not come and lie in this House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Radrodro talked about the Civil Service and let me quote 
<br/>from this report about them.  It says, “Fiji has a disciplined and well-dedicated Civil Service.” The 
<br/>problem is, you do not read.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Systematic  Country  Diagnostic  2017  World  Bank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  Do not waffle and baffle in this House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  across  the  Government,  international  and  local  organisations  baseline 
<br/>information on incidences of poverty have assisted us in the formulation of various proactive and 
<br/>amicable Government Poverty Alleviation Programmes to assist the reduction of poverty rate in the 
<br/>country. This is by providing with proper access to food, monetary help, the honourable Minister has 
<br/>covered this in detail, Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving infrastructure, improving access to basic services, 
<br/>increase awareness to reduce inequality, marginalisation and overall improving of the standard of 
<br/></span><span>living.  I have been touring the rural areas, the people are so excited, happy and satisfied with the 
<br/></span><span>amount of development that this Government is doing; unprecedented, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- That is the growth, those are the promises that we made 
<br/>to them, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We deliver.  As I have stated already when we debated the budget, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, they have a huge task in going back and facing the same communities with the same 
<br/>lies. What are some of these programmes?  Social Protection Programme, I am just focusing on the 
<br/>Revised Budget.  When we look at the Revised Budget, about $644.4 million is allocated towards 
<br/>programmes that have a direct impact on poverty issues.  That $644.4 million is about 51 percent of 
<br/>the total budget, which is about 6.3 percent of our GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.- That  is  the  level  of commitment, what  else are they 
<br/>looking for?  The Poverty Benefit Scheme is $31,667,542; that budget alone is far, far more than 
<br/>what it was to be like when the honourable Salote Radrodro was in that Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- What has that got to do with the present Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  She  was  doing  nothing  while  she  was  there,  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Food Voucher for rural pregnant mothers is $555,700. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Minister Seruiratu has to withdraw 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that comment about my work in the Civil Service and if it just triggered something, the women in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1067 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>craft that the honourable Minister for Women had been mentioning, those were one of our policies 
<br/>when  I  was  in  the  Ministry,  that  came  in  time  when  we  were  in  there.    The  Financial  Literacy 
<br/>Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in regards to the Social Welfare Programme, that was our policy when 
<br/>I was in the Ministry – when we changed the payment mode from manual into computerisation, that 
<br/>happened when I was in the Ministry. It is not a new initiative. Shame on you, honourable Minister 
<br/>and you should withdraw that comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It might have been a policy during her time but was it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allocated funds …   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  …  to  the  level  that  I  am  talking  about?    Just  one 
<br/>particular programme, Poverty Benefit Scheme is $31 million.  What was the budget during her time 
<br/>in the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Food  Voucher  for  rural  pregnant  mothers  is  $555,700,  Social  Pension 
<br/>Scheme is $53,956,958.  That scheme was targeted to support senior citizens above the age of 65 
<br/></span><span>years  with  no  superannuation  assistance,  the  After  Care  Fund  included  Fire  Victim  Allowance  - 
<br/></span><span>$100,000,  Bus  Fare  Subsidy  -  $6  million,  Disability  Allowance  -  $9,355,809,  Integrated  Poverty 
<br/>Eradication Programme - $200,000, Care and Protection Allowance - $12,386,631.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Ministry of Economy we have Unemployment Benefits to a tune of $193,950,000, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Reskilling and Retraining Programme is $1 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Ministry of Rural Development, Emergency Water is $300,000, Community Access 
<br/>Roads,  Footpaths  and  Footbridges  -  $2  million,  Grant  to  Self-Help  Programme  -  $1  million;  
<br/>Community  Capacity  Building  -  $20,000,  Rural  High  Risk  Water  and  Sanitation  Programme  - 
<br/>$500,000 and   Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation Fund - $800,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  we  have  the  Food  Security  Programme  on  freshwater 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aquaculture with an allocation of $500,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these contributes to addressing the issues that the honourable Member is again raising.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has done a lot through various intervention policies of Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation Programmes based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey findings locally 
<br/></span><span>and from the international bodies.  Therefore, I do not see a reason why we need to have another 
<br/></span><span>body to make an inquiry into the incidence or causes of poverty in Fiji.  With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I do not support the motion tabled before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  was  going  to  take  another  speaker  after  that,  but  time  moves  on.  
<br/>Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting 
<br/>times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move the Suspension Motion.
