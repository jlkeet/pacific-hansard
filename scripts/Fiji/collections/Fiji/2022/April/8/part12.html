<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with 
<br/>a 10-minute response by the Minister or Ministers responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s  
<br/>speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I now call on the Honourable Qereqeretabua to deliver her End of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Week Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Quality of Education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Good morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No Action Talk Only” is how I would describe the many, many rhetorical statements from 
<br/>the Government on education - on  how it has left no one behind, on how it has given everyone a leg-
<br/>up in terms of making education free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On paper free education looks enticing. It looks like a succulent dish described on a menu - 
<br/>wonderful to the ears of the people but sound is all it is good for, Mr. Speaker.  The reality is that 
<br/>education is not totally free.  There are free bus fares for certain stages within zones for students who 
<br/>come from families with the combined income of less than the tax threshold.  There are scholarships 
<br/>with strict conditions for those who enter tertiary institutions and mostly loans that need to be repaid 
<br/>once a student starts work.  We do not begrudge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reality is that, despite tuition free education and free bus fares, parents and guardians still 
<br/>have to spend a lot of money to ensure their children attend school daily, and this has been the norm 
<br/>all along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s most preeminent people both, locally and overseas, who have carved out a reputation 
<br/>for themselves have done their nation immensely proud sacrifice for the attainment of the highest 
<br/>standards.  They did not missed school or university, despite tuition not been free. They did not have 
<br/>access to loans that they could start paying off after gaining meaningful employment.  Why? Despite 
<br/>not being given the so-called leg-up or despite not being left behind, did they succeed nevertheless 
<br/>because of the quality of education they received, Mr. Speaker, right from their very first day at the 
<br/></span><span>then Kindergarten or Class One, right up to the then Form 6 or Form 7 and the progression up to 
<br/></span><span>University into either the then sole local tertiary institution - the University of the South Pacific or 
<br/>abroad if their parents could afford it, they turned the impossible into possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not for a moment, Mr. Speaker, am I suggesting that the current cadre of teachers at all levels 
<br/>lack the same level of competency or skillsets as their predecessors.  Might I add that, indeed, they 
<br/>are more qualified but just as practice makes perfect, Mr. Speaker, or the wine gets better as it gets 
<br/>older, teachers grow into their roles with experience, or for that matter in any other career.  But do 
<br/>teachers  have  the  freedom  to  grow  into  their  roles  through  their  classroom  or  peer  experiences?  
<br/>Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker!  It is more of a paper trail.  If one holds a Degree and passes a literacy 
<br/>test, like how to use a computer, a teacher is upgraded above his or hers vastly more experienced 
<br/>colleagues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Degrees and other tertiary qualifications are ironically the preferred choice of progression for 
<br/>teachers.  Yes, that same piece of paper, the honourable Madam Minister for Education called it, 
<br/>while defending the failure of a student with a highest marks to be supported in her medical studies.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Only  yesterday  Parliament  heard  the  Honourable  Minister  rubbish  Foundation  students 
<br/>studying medicine or MBBS.  Strangely, she said that if students could afford Foundation studies, 
<br/>they can also pay for their MBBS Programme.  This ridiculous remarks are an insult of the highest 
<br/>order to the many, many parents and their children, who missed out not only on scholarships but also 
<br/>TELS  loans,  just  because  they  opted  for  Foundation.    How  can  the  honourable  Minister  say  that 
<br/>MBBS  Programme  is  affordable  to  them  because  they  paid  their  Foundation  fees?  It  is  literally 
<br/>comparing horses with donkeys, the fee amounts are poles apart.  If they were ever an analysis on 
<br/>comments on education resembling animal farm, the honourable Minister for Education would win 
<br/>hands down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In keeping with her political masters, she wants to show that she and her Government are far, 
<br/>far superior to us.  She too is caught up in the Government’s toxic insecurity. She believes that if she 
<br/>says she is better and smarter than us, it will be so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, education is a subject for all of us.  It is something on which all of us can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribute for the betterment of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  all  the  experts  agree  that  the  quickest  and  most  effective  way  to  improve  a 
<br/></span><span>country’s economic and social status is through education and investing in education.  One has to 
<br/></span><span>work smarter.  One must have a vision and a strategy and to know where he or she is going.  But in 
<br/>the education field, the Government has never known what it is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The NFP has been calling since 2014 for an Education Commission - a group of experts to 
<br/>lead a national collaboration on resetting our education system for this century.  The last time Fiji 
<br/>had an Education Commission, Mr. Speaker, was in 1999 and here is the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The former Minister for Education, the honourable Dr. Reddy announced in his 2014 maiden 
<br/>speech that Government would set up another one.  But then someone must have reminded him that 
<br/>this the NFP idea because that was the last anyone heard about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the Bainimarama </span><span>coup </span><span>of December 2006, there have been several haphazard reforms 
<br/>in education and several ministers have come and gone, but 15 years on, the Ministry is just like the 
<br/>rest of Government.  It has no vision and no plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders, Mr. Speaker, communicate their vision and plans to others but in Fiji, none of the 
<br/>key education stakeholders have any idea about what is going on.  The Government shares nothing 
<br/></span><span>with them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government makes random decisions without consulting the teachers, parents or school 
<br/>owners.    It  veers  off  in  one  direction  and  then  another,  with  ministers  and  headquarters  officials 
<br/>issuing edicts that they all forget about a month later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry’s  piecemeal  handling  of  the  learning  and  teaching  losses  during  the  recent 
<br/>COVID-19  pandemic  showed  how  dysfunctional  the  whole  education  administration  system  has 
<br/>become. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  so  much  potential  power  for  good  in  the  education  system,  and  the 
<br/>ripples it can spread go far beyond teaching our children.  Schools, Mr. Speaker, are focal points for 
<br/>communities.  They serve as polling venues and they serve as evacuation centres during disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, many of us are invested very deeply in the education of our children.  We feel 
<br/>strongly about our loyalty to our old schools.  So schools are places where we all want to participate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and contribute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  seem  to  have  forgotten  that  teachers  have  always  been  leaders  in  their  community  – 
<br/>respected for their knowledge, trusted to care for our children, they have become sports coaches and 
<br/>event organisers and yes, many have become politicians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, the FijiFirst Government has always behaved arrogantly in the education 
<br/>sphere.  They think that because they pay teachers’ salaries and students’ grants, they have the right 
<br/>to  dictate  terms  to  everyone  else  and  these  include;  school  owners  and  managers,  parent-teacher 
<br/>associations and teacher unions.  These are the people who make education work.  The Government 
<br/>forgets that all they are doing is spending the people’s taxes.  But it is the Government’s treatment 
<br/>of our teachers in the past few years that has really stood out, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lecturing, talking down to, labelling teachers as unqualified and threatening to replace them 
<br/>is not only derogatory and insulting, but the bane of education in Fiji.  This has become a noticeable 
<br/>trait within the FijiFirst Government.  Blame everyone else when things go wrong.  Worse, labelling 
<br/>teachers as unqualified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, we all want better qualified teachers and, of course, we want teachers 
<br/></span><span>always to refresh and upgrade their skills.  But that does not mean you ignore the years of experience 
<br/>and commitment of the thousands of teachers who are in the system and treat them as the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is for the Government to provide a pathway for improving the qualifications and skills of 
<br/>teachers.    But  this  requires  proper  planning  and  funding,  and  to  do  it  properly,  Mr.  Speaker, 
<br/>experienced teachers need to be part of the process.  Their views need to be heard and respected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, until 15 years ago, all Governments encouraged and supported teachers’ skills 
<br/>and qualification upgrades, as well as giving them security of employment.  Over many decades, 
<br/>thousands  of  teachers  benefitted  from  in-service  training  and  other  professional  development 
<br/>opportunities.  But since 2006, the Government has undermined every aspect of this noble profession 
<br/>of  teaching,  including  forcing  teachers  into  contractual  employment.  As  a  result,  the  economic, 
<br/>professional and social status of teachers has been seriously diminished. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last decade, under several Ministers, recruitment, promotion and career development 
<br/>for  teachers  have  been  severely  compromised  and  in  many  cases,  politicised.    There  are  credible 
<br/>allegations  that  those  that  openly  support  the  FijiFirst  Government  receive  promotions  and  other 
<br/></span><span>favours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Teachers fear undertaking their social obligations and engaging with the community because 
<br/>they worry about being identified with the wrong political side.  Teachers fear suggesting changes to 
<br/>policies and practices because they will be singled out as critics.  Overall, teachers today have less 
<br/>democratic space, not only within the schools and classrooms but also in the community to be useful 
<br/>agents of change and good leadership, Mr. Speaker, and the same is true of their students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No  parent  or  guardian  wants  to  send  their  children  to  a  school  where  they  cannot  freely 
<br/>express  themselves  through  debate  and  discussion.    We  all  expect  our  children  to  do  well  in  the 
<br/>school, whether we are poor or rich, whether we are literate or not. We want our children to grow up 
<br/>in a free, open and transparent democratic framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next government, Mr. Speaker, needs to begin from a position of respect  - respect for 
<br/>education stakeholders, the school owners and managers, the teachers, the parents and community 
<br/>partners from business and NGOs, all of whom contribute to the broad education of our people.  That

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respect  must  be  extended  to  the  USP  where  this  Government’s  pettiness  and  vindictiveness  has 
<br/>resulted  in  massive  damage  to  our  most  important  educational  institution  and  the  education  and 
<br/>aspirations of thousands of our young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am on my last page now, Mr. Speaker.  Respect for others must be at the core of education 
<br/>and any education policy, as it must be for every policy.  And, Mr. Speaker, after the Government 
<br/>has changed and we are all freed from the shackles of the FijiFirst Party, that is what we promise to 
<br/>deliver.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  honourable  Qereqeretabua’s 
<br/>Statement on issues pertaining to quality education where she spoke about everything, except the 
<br/>factors  that  contribute  to  quality  education  and  Free  Education  Grant  (FEG)  is  so  important  to 
<br/>improve the quality of education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as usual, there is nothing substantial in what she said - nothing in terms of 
<br/>actual factors that she thinks has affected the quality of education and how it can be fixed.  Just as 
<br/>usual, aiming for sound bites that they think sounds good.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member said in various other forums, .and I quote:  “Free Education Grant 
<br/></span><span>does not mean quality education.”  She made that statement even now and during NFP Convention.  
<br/>It  is  very  disappointing  that  she  is  trying  to  diminish  free  education  which  has  opened  doors  for 
<br/>countless Fijian children who would not have been able to receive an education otherwise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, girls are most affected when FEG was not available.  Parents had to choose 
<br/>which child will go to the school and which one will have to stay back.  Today, FEG has helped many 
<br/>more girls to be in school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  our education is the reason why Australia, New Zealand, America and other 
<br/>countries are poaching  our nurses, doctors, lab technicians and other teachers.  They are in demand, 
<br/>Sir, so on what basis honourable Member said that the quality of education is not there.  Can the 
<br/>honourable Member seriously say that easing the financial burden of thousands of families, who can 
<br/>send their children to school is not important?  Can she not see that families no longer have to decide, 
<br/>as I mentioned earlier on, which child will go to school and which one will stay home?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are well aware that the quality of education involves several factors, 
<br/>such as school environment, flexible curriculum, learning and teaching resources, teaching standard 
<br/></span><span>which involves teachers and committed stakeholders like school management committee, et cetera.  
<br/></span><span>Did she really speak on all these subject matter?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  the  honourable  Member  may  not  think  that  the  FEG  is  important,  various  reports, 
<br/>including the Education Commission Report 2000, makes reference to finance amongst other things, 
<br/>which helps in improving the quality of education.  If the honourable Member really cared about the 
<br/>quality  of  education  to  our  children,  they  would  not  be  complaining  against  our  merit-based 
<br/>appointment system where we choose the best teacher for our children.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not 
<br/>care about the children and they do not care about their future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact is, with the FEG, school infrastructure has been improved, schools 
<br/>are  well-resourced  with  items  such  as  computers,  science  model,  library  books,  charts,  PEMAC 
<br/>items,  to  improve  teaching  and  learning.    These  are  aspects  of  FEG  provided  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government that honourable Qereqeretabua conveniently ignored.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1135 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FEG is also used towards providing internet connection for schools, which 
<br/>is critical for the digital age in which we live and yet she says, that the selection should not be based 
<br/>on someone who does not know computer.  In other words, teachers if they do not know how to use 
<br/>computers, they should be still teaching children of this era using computer and technologies.  How 
<br/>is  that possible?  Around 90 percent  of primary  schools and 98 percent  of secondary schools  are 
<br/>connected and we place a lot of importance to ICT technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government put wheels in motion for a change in the education 
<br/>sector.    The  vision  of  transforming  Fiji  has  education  at  its  heart.  The  FijiFirst  Government 
<br/>introduced reforms in education of which we can now see the results.  Our five rural schools are in 
<br/>top 10 schools that achieved high marks in Years 12 and 13, 2014 proved to be a game changer for 
<br/>education when the FijiFirst Government introduced two fundamental initiatives that changed the 
<br/>education sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first was the implementation of Free Education Grant which is in the tune 
<br/>of more than $60 million every year and this goes to all primary and secondary schools and from 
<br/>2015 we have included ECE centres as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The establishment of Tertiary Education Toppers and Loans Scheme 
<br/>was a second initiative which ensured that the education dreams and aspirations of our children could 
<br/>be realised right from Year 1 to tertiary level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, how can we create a level playing field if students end up doing Foundation 
<br/>studies can  repeat and get higher GPA as compared to a student from Year 13?  She is not able to 
<br/>understand the basic difference that we are trying to put on the table.  Our parents and guardians no 
<br/>longer have to worry about tuition fees, bus fares, textbooks and on top of that fundraising to fix 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key component of quality education is the standard of teaching.  How the 
<br/>curriculum  is  delivered  in  the  classroom  is  fundamentally  important.    To  enhance  the  quality  of 
<br/>education, the Ministry incentivises teachers to upgrade their qualifications, but who objects to that?  
<br/>We have heard it all!  It is the Opposition who do not think that the teachers should be upgrading 
<br/>their  qualifications  because  they  want  to  side  those  teachers  who  have  not  upgraded  their 
<br/>qualifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, curriculum is another integral part of quality education.  It is not always 
<br/>about no action and talk only.  Let me talk and I think honourable Member should listen carefully so 
<br/>you will know exactly what is happening in the education sector.  My Ministry has constantly been 
<br/>focusing  on  revising  and  modernising  the  curriculum.    I  am  pleased  to  say  that  we  are  trialling 
<br/>curriculum for literacy and numeracy in Years 1 to 4 this year and then for Years 5 to 8 next year 
<br/>that addresses systemic gaps and is aimed at a more holistic and practical approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2024, we will roll out revised secondary school English and Mathematics curriculum.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also revising our Social Science and History curriculum and carrying out a 
<br/>review of Early Childhood Education sub-sector to build a strong foundation for our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, we are introducing civic and moral education which will be the root of building 
<br/>a better society.  In recognition of the threat presented by climate change, we have also ensured that 
<br/>climate science is being taught to our children and they are well prepared for this.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  been  consulting  widely  at  every  opportunity.    In  fact, 
<br/>Ministry of Education has a think tank made up of experienced, qualified teachers who advise us on 
<br/>the area that we need to work on, so it is not that we are doing things on our own.  We consult and 
<br/>we constantly talk to our teachers, head of schools, parents, school management committees, teacher 
<br/>training institutions, faith-based organisations, principals association, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  simply  by  using  words  and  she  is  trying  to,  in  fact  create  this  mistrust 
<br/>between the Ministry and the teachers, this will not work, honourable Member.  Free education grant 
<br/>when  it  is  dished  out,  it  is  done  in  a  very  transparent  way.    We  have  partnership  with  school 
<br/>management  committees  and  this  partnership  has  never  been  better.    Again  in  their  old  familiar 
<br/>pattern, the Opposition complains and says that the Minister needs to visit schools and see things on 
<br/>the ground, but when I do visit schools to meet teachers, parents, students and committee members, 
<br/>NFP then changes tune and says that the Minister is engaged in electioneering.  Nothing we do seems 
<br/>to please the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir - damned if we do and damned if we do not.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  enhance  the  quality  of  education,  the  FijiFirst  Government  is  working  with  the 
<br/>development partners to develop education sector plan. Unlike the Education Commission Report 
<br/>which  was  not  a  new  bright  idea  from  NFP,  these  reports  were  developed  from  1969  before  our 
<br/></span><span>Independence, Mr. Speaker, Sir but the FijiFirst Government will be developing the education sector 
<br/></span><span>plan which will include the resource implication, evaluation strategies and monitoring mechanism 
<br/>which was absolutely missing in the Education Commission Report 2000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  hardworking  teachers,  Permanent  Secretary  and  the  staff  of  MEHA  are  consistently 
<br/>working on several fronts to improve the quality of education and I reiterate, quality improvement in 
<br/>education is a continuous process that needs to take place all the time. It is not one time fixed. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir the honourable member and honourable Prof. Prasad as well can talk all they want but 
<br/>the reality is, NFP cannot take away what the FijiFirst Government has done in the education sector 
<br/>under  the  leadership  of  our  honourable  Prime  Minister.  The  FijiFirst  has  educated  more  Fijian 
<br/>children than NFP, SODELPA and every other party combined. In fact, NFP’s count is zero at the 
<br/>moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importance of Pine Industry in Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, appreciation is given to previous government’s 
<br/>vision  and  support  by  the  Colonial  Government,  the  Alliance  Party  Government  through  the 
<br/>leadership of the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, SVT Government through the leadership of Major-
<br/></span><span>General (Ret’d) Sitiveni Rabuka, SDL Government through the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase for their 
<br/></span><span>continued  vision  and  support  for  the  establishment  of  pine  forest  plantations,  processing  of  logs,  
<br/>marketing of subsequent products for the benefit of the landowners and Fiji as a nation and for the 
<br/>reversion of the Pine Industry to the landowners to own and manage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Identifying of economically depressed areas particularly on the drier side of the Fiji Islands 
<br/>–  Viti  Levu  and  Vanua  Levu  with  smaller  islands  through  extension  services  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Forestry to establish pine plantations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefit to landowners will also benefit 
<br/>other races for various businesses and the nation as a whole. So, the purpose of the Pine Industry is 
<br/>to first benefit the landowners in substantial ways, with flow-on effect to others in doing businesses 
<br/>within the industry and to the nation as a whole; increase production, increase GDP, increase export 
<br/>foreign exchange, employment, business opportunities, et cetera.  That is how important (as planned) 
<br/>the Pine Industry is to the nation as a whole. What benefits the landowners flows on the other races 
<br/>and to the nation in totality. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, benefits to the pine landowners has 
<br/>been minimal.

<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- They have been deprived and this can be improved substantially. 
<br/>When we come into the Government, we are going to improve it substantially. Most emphasis are on 
<br/>others and to the nation- but to the landowners? That is the question to the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Forestry who is responsible for Pine Industry and Pine Board.  They have fallen short of helping the 
<br/>landowners. In fact, the FijiFirst Government has stolen from Fiji Pine landowners, fallen short of 
<br/>giving  them  maximum  or  fair  benefits  from  their  resources.  They  are  robbers.  You  know  what 
<br/>robbers do? They steal, kill and also destroy. That is them - the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order.

<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- The Ministry of Forestry was instrumental in the establishment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of these forests in obtaining consent/approval from the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member has said that the 
<br/></span><span>FijiFirst Government steals and kills. What are we stealing and what are we killing? He needs to tell 
<br/></span><span>us. You cannot just tell us, you need to prove it. What have we stolen and what have we killed?  There 
<br/>is a Point of Order, he cannot misrepresent things to Parliament, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The forest plantation consists of a total 
<br/>area between 76,000 hectares to 88,500 hectares excluding Private Woodlots or Extension Services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior consultation with the landowners were obtained through the Ministry 
<br/>of Forestry, Ministry of Lands, iTLTB and Ministry of Fijian Affairs. It is very important to have 
<br/>prior consultation. Benefits envisaged, discussed and agreed to by the landowners before giving their 
<br/>consent and approval for leasing were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Development of land  - opening up of locked lands, roads, water, buildings, et cetera, for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners and community and nation will benefit; 
<br/> A lease, providing security of tenure to the Government for such industry development and 
<br/>nation; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Lease premium and rentals subject to re-assessment of 25, 10 or 5 years depending on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lease issued. The landowners and community will benefit; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Employment and contract opportunities in  nursery, land preparation, planting, maintenance, 
<br/>logging, et cetera, landowners, other races, community and the nation will benefit as well; 
<br/>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Business  opportunities  both  for  other  private  entrepreneurs  and  landowners  themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Landowners and other races in the nation will benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also indirect benefits. It started off from the Ministry of Forestry 
<br/>with the experimental stations in transferring the management to Fiji Pine Commission who increased 
<br/>the  land  areas  required  in  raising  of  seedlings  and  nurseries,  land  preparation,  planting  and 
<br/>maintenance and these stations brought services and development assistance to the community in 
<br/>harvesting stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Pine Limited, commissioned the changed to a commercial company, 
<br/>the  Fiji  Pine  Limited  was  registered  to  be  responsible  for  the  efficient,  effective  and  profitable 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business management in harvesting of pine plantations.  This change from a Government Service 
<br/>Entity to a Commercial Business Entity also brought additional benefits in services and developments 
<br/>to the landowners, community and the nation as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Tropik  Woods  Limited,  in  the  early  1980s,  the  foundation  was  laid  for 
<br/>construction of the chip mill, I was there. This company was created to process pine logs to chips 
<br/>with  international  agreements,  and  also  value-added  pine  sawn-timber  for  marketing  and  selling 
<br/>particularly to Japan and China. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Malau  Fiji  Forest  Industry  (FFI).  Native  timber  subsidiary,  is  no  longer 
<br/>working, it has failed and assets have been sold, the FijiFirst Government too will also be sold as 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pine Group, to consolidate business efforts into value adding and marketing growth both 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>locally and internationally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Pine Trust, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners’ affairs of the pine industry was normally within 
<br/>the Commission originally but the Fiji Pine Trust was established to specifically focus on resolving 
<br/></span><span>and improving landowners’ affairs within the pine industry.  This move also saw improvements to 
<br/></span><span>services and developments to the local communities and the nation as a whole.  But what has come 
<br/>of the Fiji Pine Trust now?  Who is now handling the landowners’ affairs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a forest business is normally a long-tern one and Fiji Pine Industry business 
<br/>is no exception. Subject to natural disasters and political disturbances, most of the forest plantations 
<br/>in Viti Levu were severely and disadvantageously affected.  As a result and due to new experiences, 
<br/>struggles and teething problems associated, the Fiji Pine Limited operated at a reducing deficit over 
<br/>the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, in 1991 and 1992, the Fiji Pine Limited Board approved a capital 
<br/>structure  to  take  the  operations  through  to  another  15  years  to  20  years  before  it  can  expect 
<br/>profitability  by  2007  when  Bua  Planation  which  was  considered  the  best  plantation  come  into 
<br/>operation for harvest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Performance, from 2014, production came from about 539,000 cubic metres, dropped in 2016 
<br/>to 106,000 metres and recovered again in 2017there were a dropped of 200,000 cubic metres and 
<br/>recovered again in 2017 and 2018 of 395,000 cubic metres, it was good that they bounced back after 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also  the exported chips  dropped from  349,000 metric tonnes to  106,000 
<br/>metric tonnes in 2014 to 2016 and up again to about 232,000 metric tonnes in 2017 and 2018.  We 
<br/>do not have the figures for 2018 and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the export value also dropped to $18,000 but bounced back to $37 million 
<br/>in 2018.  There are two figures here for 2018 and 2019, which one is correct, I am not too sure.  You 
<br/>must be careful that annual reports that you produce are correct; one says $47 million for the export 
<br/>value, one says $78 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am concerned with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the proportion of export of sawn timber which 
<br/>is  ever  increasing.    It  is  between  50  percent  and  80  percent  of  export,  apart  from  chips.    The 
<br/>percentage  of  sawn  timber  export  to  value  added  products  remains  with  an  exceptionally  high 
<br/>proportion between 50 percent and 80 percent.  That needs to be rectified.     
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to value add more of our timber products for exports 
<br/>rather than exporting proportionately high sawn timber.  When we come to government, we will do 
<br/>that.  We will add more value add products for export.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine Limited holds 99.8 percent Government shares, but it needs to be properly explained 
<br/>to clear issues here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Through a share capital structure approved by Fiji Pine Board 
<br/>in 1991 and 1992 to ensure profitability and Government to, at least, recover its establishment costs, 
<br/>reversion  or  transfer  of  Fiji  Pine  Limited  to  resource  owners.    Resource  owners  are  to  redeem 
<br/>ownership of the pine industry in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The shares should be as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Class A - 0.2 percent for the Fiji Pine Trust or the landowners valued at $100,000, with 
<br/>voting right and dividend right. 
<br/>Class B - 0.2 percent with the value of $100,000 with the Government of Fiji, with voting 
<br/>right and chairmanship. 
<br/>Class C - 99.6 percent of Government with $69 million, the value for establishment cost, 
<br/>the Government of Fiji with no voting right nor dividend right.  But it is redeemable by the 
<br/></span><span>landowners  themselves  through  provincial  and  chairmanship  to  remain  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bua Pine Plantation on board profitable in 2007 and the Fiji Pine Trust to redeem Class C shares 
<br/>from profits because it is important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How much of the establishment cost of $69 million has been paid?  How much shares is now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>held by the resource owners?  That is the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bua  Pine  Plantation  commenced  harvesting  by  2007  as  envisaged  by  the  Fiji  Pine 
<br/>Management Board since early 1990s.  Fiji Pine Limited profited in 2009 - $11 million, 2013 - $20 
<br/>million and 2014 - $24 million.  When you total that, it amounts to $55 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine Limited had paid over the years about $9 million and $7 million in 2018.  It was the 
<br/>election year.  This year, we should expect another $10 million payout because of the election year.  
<br/>Where is the balance of $46 million?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it has been paid to redeem shares, fine - no one knows, where?  The resource owners are in 
<br/></span><span>the dark here.  That is exactly why I wanted an inquiry through a petition in this Parliament into the 
<br/></span><span>pine and mahogany industry to clear all these issues, but the door has been closed.  We need to clarify, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, where is the transparency?  Why do you keep supressing the resource owners? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What about the years from 2007 to 2022?  Taking away four years – 2007/2008, initial entry 
<br/>preparatory years of Bua Pine and 2020 and 2021 for COVID-19, we are left with eight years.  Profits 
<br/>assuming a conservative estimates of $20 million profit a year, would total $160 million.  Where is 
<br/>that?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, a total of $215 million should have been with Fiji Pine Trust now, less $69 million 
<br/>plantation  establishment costs  to  Government.    If  paid  in  full  by  now,  a  balance  of  $145  million 
<br/>should now remain with Fiji Pine Trust.  Where is the money, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  They have only 
<br/>been  paid  $9  million,  where  is  $206  million?    FijiFirst  Party  has  stolen  it  from  the  Fiji  Pine 
<br/>landowners.

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  continuation  of  the  suppression  of  the  resource  owners  in  this 
<br/>country.  It is part of the Sunset Clause - Cultural Autonomy Thesis.   When we will remove that 
<br/>Sunset Clause, we will free the landowners from suppression and oppression.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the capital structure, resource owners should be helped 
<br/>or assisted to rise to management level to attain at least 50 percent at management level by 2016.  We 
<br/>have already passed that now.  If this has not been done or achieved, why not?  Resource owners 
<br/>should have been awarded scholarships for management level leadership at various areas within the 
<br/>pine industry, but I noticed that during the Standing Committee of Natural Resources visit to the Fiji 
<br/>Pine Limited Office, there are only five managers, including the Chief Executive Officer, but none 
<br/>of them are resource owners.  When are you going to implement that?  Do you not have a heart for 
<br/>the poor resource owners?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forget it, we will do it for the resource owners.  It is too late for you now.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>under the capital structure as well, the vision and to fulfil the promises and purposes or reasons for 
<br/>the establishment of the pine industry in Fiji to revert pine industry to resource owners at a certain 
<br/>point in time and in this case by 2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the FijiFirst Party going to return the pine industry as promised and planned, Year 2025, is 
<br/></span><span>not far away, what have you done for the reversion?  What can you do now? It does not appear to 
<br/>me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no will for FijiFirst Government. Why cannot the resource owners own 
<br/>their own resources and business entity? When we become the next Government, we will do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will ensure the following, Mr. Speaker, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(7)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ensure investment confidence in general is enjoyed by business people - the engine of 
<br/>growth of any economy; 
<br/>Fiji Pine Limited and Tropik Woods Limited continue to be profitable; 
<br/>Ensure  majority  ownership  by  the  landowners  of  the  Pine  Industry  in  both,  Fiji  Pine 
<br/>Limited and Tropik Wood; 
<br/>Sustainability  of  both  the  plantations,  milling,  processing,  selling  and  marketing  are 
<br/>secure; 
<br/>Increased meaningful participation of resource owners in management, doing businesses 
<br/>in all areas within the pine industry; 
<br/>Increased dividends and benefits to resource owners and shareholders; 
<br/>Open up opportunities and promote simpler ways of doing businesses in and outside the 
<br/></span><span>pine industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up, Honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before we move on, Honourable Members, I remind everyone that you have an allocation of 
<br/>10 minutes for End of Week Statements. Organise your material so that you achieve that time.  We 
<br/>work to a timetable and when you are warned from the Speaker, take heed of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will move on and I now call on the Attorney-General and Minister 
<br/>for Economy, Civil Service, Communications, Housing and Community Development, to deliver his 
<br/>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, I do not know why the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SODELPA is leaving.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the same way Honourable Bulanauca could not keep track of time, in the 
<br/>same way he could not keep track of the funds when he was in Fiji Pine.  Let me go through the 
<br/>gobbledygook that he actually poured on his table.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pine Group delivered yet another record breaking result for the 2021-
<br/>2022 financial year in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Pine Group delivered a historical 
<br/>record operational profit of $41.9 million.  Not only that, Sir, the Pine Group became debt free for 
<br/>the first time ever after paying the last lump sum payment of $2.2 million which they owed to the 
<br/>Government to sell the last of its debts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pine  Group,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  contributed  $629,000  towards  landowner  community 
<br/>development  projects  which  included  education,  water,  solar  projects,  cyclone  rehabilitation,  et 
<br/>cetera.  Unprecedented levels of engagement and consultation with landowners was carried out and 
<br/>continues to be carried out.  The landowners now get firsthand information on Fiji Pine Limited’s 
<br/>plans and achievements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulanauca, please listen and honourable Leawere too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this record levels of lease renewals and new leases have been consented too by the 
<br/></span><span>landowners which I know Honourable Bulanauca is trying to actually stifle, adding up to more than 
<br/>5,000 hectares of lease renewals in just 15 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Pine Group of Companies has undertaken a journey of ambitious 
<br/>pine  planting.  This  is  to  address  the  neglect  of  the  past  where  pine  forests  were  irresponsibly 
<br/>harvested without focus on sustainability and business continuity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  last  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Pine  Group  achieved  a  record  planting  of  4,300 
<br/>hectares.  This year, the Group has challenged itself to achieve a planting of 7,300 hectares.  We can 
<br/>see the energy, we can see the drive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can see the happiness in engagement of 
<br/>the pine landowners which, of course, is unprecedented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of these has been achieved through the FijiFirst Government’s vision 
<br/>and bold actions to bring about reforms and changes.  The Pine Industry, figuratively speaking, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, was raped and pillaged  by previous Governments and Boards for whom only the petty 
<br/>politics or political point scoring by people like Honourable Bulanauca, mattered.  They served the 
<br/>elites and left the ordinary landowners behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulanauca, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was actually one of those who sat on the Fiji Pine 
<br/>Limited Board and shamelessly played with the aspirations of ordinary landowners, and he continues 
<br/>to do that.  Yet, he continues to harp about the pine industry and the forestry sector.  He continues to 
<br/>harp  about  the  shareholding  structure  of  Pine  Group  without  having  any  understanding,  nor  any 
<br/>genuineness towards landowners. The pine landowners are well-informed and we will not be fooled 
<br/>by the likes of honourable Bulanauca.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  in  terms  of  the  shareholding  itself,  he  does  not  understand  the 
<br/>shareholding classes.  The landowners own Class A shares or which is the ordinary shares which is 
<br/>the only class that has dividend rights.  Class B and Class C redeemable preferences are owned by 
<br/>Government, they do not have any dividend rights whatsoever.  If the landowners were to redeem 
<br/>those shares, they will have to pay $62 million.  He does not tell us that, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I also wanted to make to all the pine landowners out there, you have seen 
<br/>the results through all the reforms that the FijiFirst Government has carried out, you are now been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consulted on everything that the industry does. This is, of course is unprecedented.  Additionally, the 
<br/>Company has paid $34 million, honourable Bulanauca, in lease security bonus payments since 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister will be part of yet another dividend payout 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>later on in the next few months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in return for the trust the landowners have placed on the Group, Fiji Pine 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limited pays them back millions of dollars every year in the following ways: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land leased rental of $13 per hectare; 
<br/>Stumpage payment at 12 percent of net revenue; 
<br/>Lease premium of $20 per hectare on lease renewals when offer letters are received by 
<br/>iTLTB; 
<br/>Land on a community development funded 5.5 percent;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Pine  manages  this  and  landowners  apply  for  their  assistance  through  this  fund  for 
<br/>education  and  other  areas  that  give  priority,  for  example,  rural  electrification  and  various  other 
<br/>projects, cyclone rebuilt after the cyclone, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The dividend lease security bonus payments is announced based on the Company’s financial 
<br/>performance  after  the  annual  accounts  have  been  audited.    For  the  past  two  years,  Sir,  the  lease 
<br/>security bonus payment methodology was designed as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30 percent of the bonus amount is distributed equally to the members of the landowning 
<br/>unit through iTLTB’s equal lease distribution mechanism.  There is no deduction of any 
<br/>fee by iTLTB.  The Fiji Pine Group pays the service fees to iTLTB separately, so, we pay 
<br/>them separately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 70 percent of the bonus amount is directed towards the landowning based projects.  Again, 
<br/>we provide project options for landowners to choose from. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make is that, from a verge of collapse 
<br/>in 2008 prior to which the likes of honourable Bulanauca were involved, reaping all the benefits or 
<br/>the junkets they used to have, the Fiji Pine Group as we speak has cash at bank of $83 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are record levels of pine planting.  The six forest stations have been 
<br/></span><span>revived and infrastructure has been put back.  These stations are located on isolated areas, however, 
<br/></span><span>all of them have facilities of modern office, internet connectivity, et cetera.  As we speak, there is a 
<br/>brand new office complex being built in Lekutu in Bua.  This is a state-of-the-art facility and it is 
<br/>expected to be opened by the honourable Prime Minister in two months’ time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pine Group is also putting up a new sawmill at Drasa, they already have one, and you 
<br/>should go and see.  It is a state-of-the-art mill. They are putting up another one, as part of its business 
<br/>diversification plan, to process  or value-add other species logs, honourable Bulanauca.   Listen to 
<br/>that! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  done  because  pine  forests  are  quickly  facing  sustainable  issues  due  to  neglect  in 
<br/>planting in the past due to mismanagement which took the industry to its knees. The new sawmill 
<br/>facility will cost $16 million and the project has already commenced.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pine Group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also is planning to construct a shopping complex or mall 
<br/>at  the  Drasa  Avenue  in  Lautoka.    The  land  has  been  secured  and  surveyed.    Depending  on  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1143 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>feasibility study, this project will take form in the next two to three years.  A budget of $20 million 
<br/>has been allocated for this developer, honourable Saukuru, listen to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pine Group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a living example of how resources owners can be empowered 
<br/>and provided returns, if the organisation is run ethically, is run by good managers and in line with 
<br/>good governance processes.  That did not exist when he was there.  It is now happening because the 
<br/>right people are doing the right job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the day, what matters, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the dividend that the landowners get.  
<br/>And  for  the  landowners  to  get  the  right  dividend,  they  need  to  have  the  right  people  in  the 
<br/>management, not based on what honourable Bulanauca says, not based on provincialism or ethnicity 
<br/>or whatever, but the right people to do the job, so that at the end of the day it is the dividend that 
<br/>matters, not people who fill in positions.  They just want to fill in positions so they can get the perks.  
<br/>The  ordinary  landowners  will  suffer.    They  have  never  got  this  kind  of  bonuses  they  have  been 
<br/>receiving since 2013, they have never got it.  He knows that!  You go to church, do not lie. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  journey  of  transformation  started  through  the  vision  of  the  present 
<br/>government.  The industry since its inception was manipulated for self-interest and self-interested 
<br/></span><span>people, to name a few like honourable Bulanauca, with the likes of people like George Speight who 
<br/></span><span>were involved in Fiji Hardwood Corporation Ltd.  This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been transformed and 
<br/>there is no room for such activities.  People like him continue with their narrative but the reality on 
<br/>the ground is completely different and the landowners do that and they will actually show that in the 
<br/>next coming months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Removal of Year 1 to Year 3 Examinations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning I rise to speak on the Government’s initiative 
<br/>to do away tests and exams for Years 1 to 3.  Exams in early primary school has been experienced 
<br/>by all of us in this House.  How we coped and reacted to this is an individual experience, the degree 
<br/>of  lightness  and  dreadfulness  to  sit  for  mid-year  or  annual  exams  in  the  early  school  days  have 
<br/>imprinted some anxious and nervous depictions in our minds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  school  system  demands  a  satisfactory  score  in  standardised  tests  to  constitute  a  pass, 
<br/>however, administering these tests in early primary schools especially in Grades 1 to 3 three has put 
<br/>many young and developing minds through lots of pressure and agony.  The burden of increasing 
<br/>test scores in Maths and Science has inevitably drawn away the fun to learn and progress.  Tests and 
<br/></span><span>exams in early primary schooling has subjected young minds to the methods of memorising lessons 
<br/></span><span>and discourage a child’s creative impetus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The well-known Swiss  psychologist Jean Piaget  has categorised children  of early primary 
<br/>school into late pre-operational and much into concrete operational cognitive development stage.  At 
<br/>this early learning stage, children are getting better with language and thinking, however, they still 
<br/>tend to think about things in very concrete terms  thus loading them with homework, tests and exams 
<br/>effectively withdraws the excitement and time to learn new concepts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the stigma associated with not performing well in early school days have 
<br/>undoubtedly forced the slow learners to abstain from school and eventually drop out of the formal 
<br/>education sector.  These children may have the untapped potential to excel in fields of interest but 
<br/>the loads of tests and exams force them away from realising their dreams.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, removing exams for the young ones would become the game changer for 
<br/>the education system  and its future.  Removal of thematic teaching  and  introduction of civic and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>1144 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>moral values would inculcate everlasting good virtues in the young minds who would later take the 
<br/>nation to the desired achievement level.  Education with right thoughts, words and attitude will give 
<br/>more success to our future generations.  It is high time we become realistic and genuine towards the 
<br/>education of our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have heard lobbyists harping on removing exams would dilute the education system but may 
<br/>I remind them that Finland has completely revolutionised their education system outranking USA.  
<br/>Finland has no standardised tests but a voluntary test for students at the end of an upper secondary 
<br/>school.  The education system in Finland allows the students autonomy and encourage creative play 
<br/>instead  of  putting  students  in  a  competitive  race  for  top  grades.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our 
<br/>education  system  demands  a  test  and  exam-based  learning  starting  from  early  primary  school.  
<br/>Standardised testing is the blanket way we test for subject comprehension.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While immersed with this, it inadvertently takes away the components of happy, harmonious 
<br/>and healthy student and learning environment.  What often happens is that students will learn to cram 
<br/>just to pass a test and teachers will be teaching with a sole purpose of students passing a test.  Creative 
<br/>learning is unintentionally diluted and possibly distant.  Removing mandatory tests and exams for 
<br/>Grades 1 to 3 would give more time to focus on  rudimentary lessons on arts and crafts, food and 
<br/></span><span>health,  music  and  physical  education.    This  does  not  mean  that  the  basic  tenets  of  literacy  and 
<br/></span><span>numeracy are ignored. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The early primary schools should focus on these and help develop the young minds for more 
<br/>advanced primary schooling, more open learning where children are subjected to independent and 
<br/>interest guided learning should be encouraged with the grading system set by a teacher to monitor 
<br/>the progress.  These all are achievable and the present curriculum should be revisited to adopt changes 
<br/>and make room for more interactive learning with no formal assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  Government  under the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>began the education revolution in this country with the introduction of free education for primary and 
<br/>secondary  schools,  subsidised  transport  and  other  assistance  to  students  and  gave  unprecedented 
<br/>access  to  tertiary  education  with  the  Tertiary  Education  Loans  Schemes  (TELS)  and  National 
<br/>Toppers Scheme (NTS).  This Government will continue to ensure that every child receives primary 
<br/>and secondary education fully paid by the Government.  Not only that, the Government encourages 
<br/>children of school age to be in schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly support FijiFirst Government’s initiative to 
<br/></span><span>reform early primary school education, removing tests and exams for Years 1 to 3.  This would make 
<br/></span><span>going to school more fun and exciting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Lal for his statement which I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fully support and I would like to add further to what he had said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2022 academic year, schools will no longer conduct exams for Years 
<br/>1 to 3.  The current examination system distorts curriculum intention and kills innovative teaching 
<br/>and encourages rote learning.  This must change to create room for critical thinking and analytical 
<br/>mind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, students need to demonstrate a range of skills and qualities such as problem 
<br/>solving,  team  work,  communication,  initiatives  and  flexibility.    The  outcome  of  education  is  no 
<br/>longer  simply  acquisition  of  knowledge  which  is  readily  available.    It  is  about  exploring  ideas, 
<br/>without ideas there is no creativity and without creativity there is no innovation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1145 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a 37-week school year, students from Years 1 to 13 have been sitting for term exams.  In 
<br/>total, there are three term exams and some schools can have up to two mid-term exams in addition to 
<br/>this.  There is  a  constant  pressure on teachers to cover the  curriculum  and conduct  revisions and 
<br/>exams.  What is taught to our children are facts which they must rote learn because it can be tested 
<br/>in the exam.  A child’s educational journey should be an enjoyable one.  Learning should be fun so 
<br/>they become lifelong learners, it is  therefore critical  that we create learners who are interested in 
<br/>learning and are able to learn on their own. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a teacher centred teaching will take us nowhere.  At least in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, 
<br/>we must change the teaching style from teacher centred to child centred.  The emphasis needs to be 
<br/>changed to one that values process over content and understanding over rote learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, children learn more in the early years than at any other time in their life.  It 
<br/>is crucial that these early learning experiences are positive and appropriate to their age and not an 
<br/>imitation of the formal school system.  In fact students at such an early age deserve more time for 
<br/>inquiry- based learning and learning through games and activities. There is a need to move away 
<br/>from an examination system that stresses the concept of passing and failing and putting very young 
<br/>children in a hierarchal from smart, intelligent students to weak or poor students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such practice affects the self-esteem of lower achieving students and it could 
<br/>make it harder to convince them that they can succeed in life. At such young age, it can reduce their 
<br/>motivation  for  learning  and  gradually  they  dropout  from  school.  Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  our 
<br/>community and it is something that is often practiced in our society that we tend to compare our 
<br/>children’s’ results with our neighbours and family and that puts added pressure to the young ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, improvements  at  the lower Primary level  will mean that children would 
<br/>accomplish more at Secondary level. A strong foundation and learning at this level yields high returns 
<br/>throughout life.  Examination-oriented approach does not address the acquisition of practical skills, 
<br/>values and attitudes in young learners. It does not encourage higher-order skills such as critical and 
<br/>analytical skills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education  Superstar  Globally  is  Singapore’s  school  system.  Without  examinations,  their 
<br/>Primary school learning is designed to build a strong educational foundation for children. Their focus 
<br/>is the development of problem solving skills, building character, nurturing, sound values and good 
<br/>habits. The Education Commission Report 2000 clearly states and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Many  Submissions  to  the  2000  Commission  from  stakeholder  groups  and  the 
<br/></span><span>public at large were highly critical of the lack of creativity in the teaching and learning 
<br/>programmes of Primary schools and the extent to which the testing and examination system 
<br/>prevents this occurring.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  also  states  that  for  teachers,  coverage  curriculum  becomes  the  key  task  rather  than 
<br/>development  of  conceptual  understanding  using  methods  of  enquiry  and  problem  solving.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  removing  examinations  does  not  mean  students  will  not  be  accessed.  We  need  to 
<br/>introduce  a  variety  of  other  assessment  methods  and  procedures  capable  of  producing  a  range  of 
<br/>valued learning outcomes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This could take place in many forms including in-class discussions, quizzes, group work and 
<br/>reflections. These are highly effective because students get direct feedback to improve. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, by removing exams at this early stages of learning, we will expose students to discover their very 
<br/>own  interest  and  talents.  The  recent  launch  of  the  Revised  Literacy  and  Numeracy  Curriculum

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>focusses  on  the  enhancement  of  inquiry-based  learning  which  is  appropriate  as  this  would 
<br/>complement the non-examination atmosphere in the classrooms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Head Teacher’s Association fully supports the Ministry’s decision 
<br/>to remove examinations for Years 1, 2 and 3. The President of the Fiji Head Teacher’s Association 
<br/>said and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any educator with right mind should support this new call because this will allow 
<br/>teachers to spend more time on learning and teaching rather than preparing students for 
<br/>examinations, particularly at this early stage. It is high time that we need to be realistic and 
<br/>genuine when it comes to the education of our young ones.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  aim  to  develop  our  children  holistically  with  a  range  of  skills  and 
<br/>developed in their civic pride, the very core values that defines the character of a person. Assessment 
<br/>methods have a strong influence over what teachers teach and what and how students learn. We need 
<br/>to move away from pencil and paper test that upholds concepts of pass and fail. Putting children in 
<br/>the rank of first, second, third, et cetera will not build a strong foundation for lifelong learning as 
<br/>required in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> Century.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this change has been brought about based on the consultation that we had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and also the recommendation made in the Education Commission Report 2000.

<div><span>Rural Roads in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  ADIMAITOGA.-  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise this afternoon to speak on the End of the 
<br/>Week Statement under my name on the subject of Rural Roads in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I go into that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to praise the God Almighty 
<br/>for blessing this country with FijiFirst Government and I praise God for putting the Opposition to be 
<br/>the Opposition because that is where they rightly belong.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years ,rural road development in Fiji 
<br/>has picked up at a fast pace and Government is increasingly focussing on rural roads. This is because 
<br/></span><span>we know that there are many economic and social benefits offered by rural roads.  These roads are 
<br/></span><span>equally important as urban roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 2016 to 2022 an additional 188 kilometres of rural roads was constructed. Rural roads 
<br/>are often considered to be the lifetime of rural communities. They play an important role in poverty 
<br/>alleviation, enable transportation, linking producers to markets, workers to jobs, students to schools 
<br/>and sick to hospitals, as roads are vital to any development and economic recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Fiji Road Infrastructure, we have a total of around 11,000 kilometres 
<br/>of road in Fiji of which, 6,400 kilometres  is under the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) and the balance 
<br/>is categorised as community access roads, farm access roads, cane access roads, logging roads or 
<br/>private roads.  The FRA is the authority that manages 4,600 kilometres of sealed roads and 1,800 
<br/>kilometres of unsealed roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  constitutional  rights  to  reasonable  transportation;  the  2013  Fijian 
<br/>Constitution provides every Fijian with socio-economic and environmental rights.  The realisation of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1147 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these rights is critical for inclusive and sustainable development. This empowers every Fijian through 
<br/>the provision of essential social services and other public goods.  Sir, under the Section 34 of the 
<br/>Fijian Constitution, all Fijians has the right  to reasonable  access  to  transportation. This  is  further 
<br/>aligned to the 5-Year or 20- Year National Development Plan (NDP).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Government’s investment on rural roads;   Government has been taking 
<br/>various proactive steps to boost rural roads as they play a very important role in enhancing  income-
<br/>generating opportunities for the people, followed by other benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, while the construction of urban roads is important, it is equally important to develop rural 
<br/>roads.  Government regards all Fijians as equally deserving of development, rural or urban.  It is the 
<br/>same  reason  that  the  Fijian  Government  has  increased  its  investments  in  rural  road  development 
<br/>programmes over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  over  the  past  six  years,  Government  through  FRA,  has  invested  around 
<br/>$43.9 million on the construction of rural roads.  This has benefitted around 94 communities. Apart 
<br/>from  rural  roads,  a  total  of  $113.8  million  was  directed  towards  the  renewal  and  replacement  of 
<br/>crossings and bridges.  This has enhanced connectivity from our rural to urban roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  information  of  the  House,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development,  through  the  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and  Footbridges  (CARFF) 
<br/>Programme, also constructs community access roads in rural areas.  In doing so, from 2018 to 2021, 
<br/>a total of 199 CARFF roads were constructed, amounting to $22.9 million, benefiting over 3,900 
<br/>people.   This  has  not only provided basic  access, but  also  opened up these communities to  other 
<br/>opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  benefits  for  rural  roads;  one  may  ask,  what  are  the  benefits  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment on these rural roads?  To name a few: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  offers  better  transportation  facilities,  rural  roads  contribute  significantly  by  creating 
<br/>linkages, thus increasing the opportunities to access goods and services located in nearby 
<br/>villages or major towns and markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It boosts agricultural activities and productivity.  Rural roads are essential for sustaining 
<br/>agricultural development also.  A good network of rural roads can provide a boost to the 
<br/>agricultural  activities  by  timely  transportation  of  water,  seeds  and  other  raw  materials 
<br/></span><span>needed for farming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It improves mobility  and  saves time.  The  presence of roads in rural  areas increase the 
<br/>mobility of labour and materials.  Typically, rural roads can ensure shorter travel time and 
<br/>the time saved this way may help the rural poor to be productive and generate increased 
<br/>incomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  gives  access  to  essential  services,  such  as,  healthcare  and  education.    Improved  road 
<br/>connectivity can also enhance access of rural masses to education services.  They can travel 
<br/>to  nearest  towns  and  cities  and  get  better  and  higher  education,  which  can  open  better 
<br/>employment opportunities for them.  In addition, they can also access quality healthcare 
<br/>medical services, such as maternity services, dental, physicians, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all Governments in Fiji have been investing to some degree 
<br/>in rural roads.  The Bainimarama-led Government have not only continued their focus, but also raised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>1148 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their  focus  to  another  level.    It  has  continued  to  focus  on  the  needs  of  the  rural  and  maritime 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I speak today, work on the Vunisei to Vacalea Road in Kadavu is continuing and weather 
<br/>permitting, will be completed by September this year.  By next year, one should be able to drive from 
<br/>Nabukalevu-i-Ra and Kadavu up to Vunisea, on to Vunisei, drive past the villages up Naceva, go all 
<br/>the way to Vacalea in Nakasaleka, or drive up to Naleca Jetty in Kavala Bay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Island of Kadavu, there has been very significant investments in rural roads, and the 
<br/>same is true to other islands and maritime districts and rural parts of Fiji.  Kadavu is important for 
<br/>the Government and there has been considerable developments in Kadava these past few years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, it is not only Kadavu, also in other rural and maritime areas.   The emphasis on rural 
<br/>roads continues.  This Government focusses on leaving no one behind in everything it does, and that 
<br/>commitment will never diminish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, the FijiFirst Government will continue to develop rural roads to ensure that our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rural communities have access to social and economic opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for her End of the Week Statement.  For 
<br/>the  response,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure,  Meteorological  Services, 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  I  rise  this  afternoon  to  further 
<br/>contribute to the End of the Week Statement delivered by the honourable Adimaitoga, on one of the 
<br/>most critical determinants in our rural communities which is rural roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, as Minister responsible for infrastructure, I must say that the building and maintaining 
<br/>of rural roads is critical but challenging.  Probably more challenging now than it was years ago.  This 
<br/>is because there are other emerging factors that we have to deal with, such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> the effect of climate change; 
<br/>the more intensive tropical cyclones that have a direct impact on our road infrastructure; 
<br/>the changing weather patterns; 
<br/>intense rainfall resulting in floods that are washing away crossings and landslides causing 
<br/>road slips; 
<br/>high volume of traffic with heavy vehicles, such as logging trucks using our rural road 
<br/>infrastructure and damaging it, especially after heavy rains; 
<br/>the high demand and requirement to build more resilient infrastructure, taking into account 
<br/>the need to have the right design and also having a competent road contractor to deliver the 
<br/>works on the ground.  A good example is the damage to our road infrastructure due to 
<br/>adverse weather at the beginning of this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  travelled  around  Viti  Levu  earlier  this  year  to  see  first-hand  the 
<br/></span><span>damages on our road infrastructure due to the weather, in particular, flooding, and it was devastating.  
<br/></span><span>Along the Kavanagasau River Bank of Sigatoka, we could see the road that has slipped away on the 
<br/>side of the river.   It washed out nearly three-quarters of the road in Kabisi, Nadi, the Bure-i-Wai 
<br/>Crossing in Ra washed out by strong currents, landslides in the highlands of Ba, and looking also at 
<br/>the Burewai crossing in Tailevu North. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1149 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to FRA estimates, the cost of the damage from the flooding in the early part of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year amounts to around $100 million, and that is a lot of money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir, this  means  that we  need  to  lift  and  we are  lifting  our  game  because  we 
<br/>cannot continue to rely on the old way of doing things is as much as roads are concerned.  That is 
<br/>one of the reasons we have established the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), to ensure that we can lift the 
<br/>level of our service to match the kind of challenges we face today in road construction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  rural  roads,  there  are  a  number  of  implementing  agencies  that  are  involved  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>construction of the Rural Road Project.   These are namely the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Roads Authority; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>

<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Agriculture which has the Farm Roads; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Forestry for the forestry and pine roads; and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Sugar for cane access roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA manages most of the road infrastructure in Fiji.  Other implementing 
<br/></span><span>agencies that I have mentioned do construct basic rural access roads which can later be upgraded to 
<br/></span><span>FRA standard and some of these are eventually taken over by the FRA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the vision of FRA is to provide affordable, integrated, safe, responsible and 
<br/>sustainable network of roads, bridges and jetties.  As mentioned earlier, there is  a real  challenge, 
<br/>given the emerging issues that we have to deal with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA is now implementing best practices, to ensure that we have a robust 
<br/>rural road network, together with resilient infrastructure such as crossing and bridges. How is it doing 
<br/>this?  It is looking at design improvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taking  into  consideration  the  changing  weather  patterns,  FRA  infrastructure  design  is 
<br/>focussing more on resilience and sustainability.  As an example, now FRA constructs box culverts 
<br/>instead of the round culverts, box culverts higher to ensure that there is free flow of  water during 
<br/>heavy downpour which avoids the washout. As we know rainfall is heavy now, it is very intense so 
<br/>we have to redesign the kind of culverts that we use in these areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When deemed necessary, crossings are upgraded to bridges due to continuous washout.  For 
<br/></span><span>one example, right in the middle of Viti Levu, we are now building the Fiji $6.1 million Matawali 
<br/></span><span>Bridge which connects the main road network to the highlands of Nadroga/Navosa.  The existing 
<br/>crossing washes out in nearly every heavy downpour.  In some wet seasons, they will have to fix that 
<br/>crossing up to 10 times in just one season.  Now, we are putting in a $6.1 million bridge right in the 
<br/>middle of Navosa.  We are building a new 64-metre bridge that is currently being constructed which 
<br/>will be completed this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second that it is now focussing on is the procurement process.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has strengthened its procurement process to ensure that the best contractors are hired for the job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, FRA has a well-defined criteria for contractors who take up road contracts.  There is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strong emphasis on the ability of the contractor to deliver the project with a quality output. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, capacity building.  Sir, FRA is working with local contractors to ensure that they go 
<br/>through capacity building programmes to be up to par with overseas contractors.  This is not only to 
<br/>ensure that they have the right knowledge but for this contractors to deliver better.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly, standards is another important element that FRA is driving for newly constructed 
<br/>rural roads.  Most of the rural roads constructed in the past are unsealed. This is something that FRA 
<br/>is looking to change and, that is, for more newly constructed rural roads to be sealed.  For example, 
<br/>the first planned newly constructed rural sealed road is the Nakoro-Navitilevu Road in the highlands 
<br/>of Navosa. This is right in the middle of Navosa.  Nakoro is where the Honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>opened their solar electrification system recently, and I have visited the road that has been built up 
<br/>to Navitilevu and because of the terrain there, they are looking to seal that particular road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fifthly, availability of raw materials is another challenge when it comes to the construction 
<br/>of  rural  roads,  particularly  within  our  maritime  communities.    For  example,  the  availability  of 
<br/>aggregate to the gravel for road construction.  Now, FRA has identified and arranged for strategically 
<br/>positioned quarries in the islands so they can supply aggregate closed to where it is needed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have visited some of these quarries such as on Kiobo near the village of Namara, Sanima in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kadavu, Yale in Kadavu and also in Nukutocia in Ovalau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having these quarries on the islands is much more cost efficient because in the past, a lot of 
<br/>the road contractors would have to cart the aggregate from Viti Levu to the islands.  So, there is a 
<br/></span><span>major cost component there in carting the materials across.  With those quarries on site, a lot of these 
<br/></span><span>issues will be reduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has done far more on our rural roads, as has been expressed 
<br/>by the honourable Adimatoga, far more on our rural roads than any other government before us.  This 
<br/>has brought about immense benefits to recipients of these developers, these are benefits that are just 
<br/>access to materials.  People are able to take their farm produce to the market from the village on 
<br/>wheels, before they used to carry it on horseback or by foot, walking for miles to get to the road, wait 
<br/>for the bus and then go down to the markets or wait for the carrier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, we mentioned Nakida Village in the highlands of Naitasiri, before they had the 
<br/>road, I walked along the track, along the banks of the river that the villagers had been using with the 
<br/>honourable Waqainabete and honourable Vijay Nath.  It took us more than three hours crossing the 
<br/>same river 23 times in 2019.  The late honourable Osea Naiqamu came with us and he joined the 
<br/>team that walked on the planned route of the eventual road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today the pilot-cut of the road has reached the village. The villagers are already using it and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the road is being improved to a standard whereby it can be handed over to FRA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Today they can begin to supply </span><span>yaqona</span><span> and </span><span>dalo</span><span> to the market using 
<br/>the road and as the road is upgraded and finally completed, larger volumes of market goods can be 
<br/>sent to the market via this road.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similar partnerships are being done across Fiji where Community “X” road is built initially 
<br/>by the Community, Access Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF) Project under the Ministry 
<br/>of Rural and Maritime Development and eventually taken over by the Fiji Roads Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These roads allow for people to have access to quality education, a village boy, a village girl 
<br/>can  attend tertiary  education and achieve the dreams  that they  have for their career, accessing of 
<br/>health care and transporting of building materials. When I was in Nakida, I was told that building 
<br/>materials used to reach the village by bamboo rafts.  They would actually pull these rafts upstream, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over the rocks, they would camp on the banks of the river as they pulled the building materials up to 
<br/>their village.  So that now will be a thing of the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other rural works that are currently underway:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Wainiyavu to Wainilotulevu, Namosi Road, Namuamua to Nukusere, the Namosi Rural 
<br/>Road Access to Waibogi and Wainidiro, Serua, all of these costing $19.8 million.   
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Matokana Village Access Road, once again, in the highlands of Nadroga/Navosa - $3.7 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million. 
<br/>Nakoro to Navitilevu Access Road in the highlands of Nadroga/Navosa - $8.5 million.   
<br/>Vagadra Village Access Road in the highlands of Nadroga - $6.72 million. 
<br/>Nanuku to Nalotawa Village Access Road, Ba Province - $5.4 million. 
<br/>The road that I visited recently, a place where they thought they would never have roads 
<br/>because it is such a rocky and difficult terrain - Veidrala Village Access Road in the Ra 
<br/>Province, costing $2.78 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to develop our rural roads to 
<br/>ensure that everyone is connected and no one is left behind.  There are planned rural roads in Vanua 
<br/>Levu  to  be  done  by  FRA  and  there  will  be  continued  work  done  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and 
<br/>Maritime Development with the CARFF Programmes and the community access programmes which 
<br/>utilises the resources that landowners have in building the roads.  Eventually, these roads will be 
<br/>passed on to FRA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In parts of Fiji, we have existing non-FRA roads that are used for public transport on access 
<br/>to schools, access to health facilities, village, settlements, et cetera.  On an informal basis, FRA has 
<br/>tried to assist the maintenance of such roads in the past, now however, in this just recently revised 
<br/>budget, the Government has now provided a one-off budget of $5 million this year to improve and 
<br/>do some maintenance of these roads.  Some of these roads are in rural areas while others are in peri-
<br/>urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is committed to rural roads in all of Fiji.  As I sit in Parliament and listen to 
<br/>questions from the Opposition, each Member of that side always ask about the area that they regard 
<br/>as their constituency.  I can imagine if they ever came into power, that is what they will do, they will 
<br/>just focus on rural roads in their area.  This Government does not do that.  We look at the needs 
<br/>across all Fiji, we treat everyone fairly.  We look at the most critical issues and address those upfront.  
<br/>Just as this Government is pro-poor and pro-the marginalised, unlike those in Parliament who oppose 
<br/>the Revised Budget despite the many things included in the Revised Budget that help the poor and 
<br/>the marginalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government has shown itself to be focussed on the needs of all our rural areas, of better 
<br/>rural access by roads and crossing in jetty, not only to those who elected them into Parliament or 
<br/>elected us into Parliament but for all Fijians, all rural areas, all equally unconditionally.   
<br/></span></div>
