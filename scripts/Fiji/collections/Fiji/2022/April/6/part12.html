<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed with the next agenda item, at this 
<br/>juncture, I wish to advise that there is a correction to be made in the first question that is to be asked 
<br/>today. When it was pointed out to me, I had the thought of reprinting the whole Order Paper but that 
<br/>would  have  been  a  waste  of  paper  and  time.  So,  I  am  going  to  correct  that,  but  it  has  also  been 
<br/>corrected for you on the website.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first question, in line four, the words “proposed Asian Development Bank-funded” is to 
<br/>be deleted. With your co-operation, we can delete that, and the question remains as it is a part of that. 
<br/>I take full responsibility for that mistake, honourable Members, and I apologise for that.  
<br/></span></div>
