<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting.  I also welcome those joining us in the 
<br/>public  gallery  and  those  watching  the  live  broadcast  of  the  proceedings.    Thank  you  for  your 
<br/>continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.

<div><span>Chamber – Seating Arrangement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  whilst  we  have  reverted  to  the  normal  seating  arrangement,  the 
<br/>additional four seats at the back will not be used this week, but will definitely be occupied at the May 
<br/>Sitting of Parliament.  The reason being that, the IT Unit is awaiting some audio components which 
<br/>need to be installed.  We are adamant that we will receive this well before the next sitting.  It makes 
<br/>the sitting look cosier than before when it was spread out.

<div><span>Chamber - Voting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, for the purposes of voting, however, those present in the Chamber will 
<br/>vote electronically and those connecting virtually will vote by acclamation.  I will advise all those 
<br/>connecting virtually when the time comes.  It is a bit intricate, but I am sure we can manage it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Accounts Committee Publications - Parliament of India 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  advise  that  we  have  received  two  Public 
<br/>Accounts  Committee  publications  from  the  Parliament  of  India.    The  publications  were  in 
<br/>commemoration of the centenary celebrations. Copies of the publications are available in the Library 
<br/>for those Members who wish to peruse them.
