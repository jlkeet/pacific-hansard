<div><span>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of 
<br/>Parliament on Wednesday, 9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>606 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  remind  you  that  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of 
<br/>Parliament, debate will be limited to one hour.  This will also be the case for the next three Bills that 
<br/>will follow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as highlighted in the tabling of this Bill 
<br/>yesterday evening, the Liquor Act 2006 regulates, amongst other things, the sale and supply of liquor 
<br/>in  Fiji.    Under  the  Act  any  person  who  sells  or  supplies  liquor  must  be  licensed  subject  to  the 
<br/>conditions specified under the Act, and any other condition as the Divisional Liquor Licensing and 
<br/>Authority issuing the licence may impose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  section  15(1)  of  the  Act,  the  maximum  term  of  the  licence,  other  than  licence  for 
<br/>special use is three years.  For ease of doing business administration, the Liquor (Amendment) Bill 
<br/>2022 seeks to amend the Act to extend the maximum term of licence, other than the licence for special 
<br/>use or temporary licence, from three to five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the main gist of the Bill also is that, it seeks to amend the Act to exempt a 
<br/>person  from  the  payment  of  prescribed  fees  when  the  person  did  not  operate  as  outlined  in  the 
<br/>person’s licence due to difficulties faced as a result of COVID-19 restrictions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, which the Members have before them, will see that Clause 3 of the Bill is pertinent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this respect.  It says:  in Clause 3(6), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding subsection (2), a person may apply for the renewal of a licence 
<br/>after the expiration of the term of the licence if the Authority is satisfied that the person 
<br/>did not apply for the renewal of the licence due to COVID-19 restrictions.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that is also relevant is the exemption.  It states in Clause 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>86A(1), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Minister (which is the Minister responsible for this particular Act) may, by 
<br/>order in the Gazette and subject to any condition the Minister thinks fit, exempt a person 
<br/>from paying the prescribed fee…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the Minister is satisfied that the person – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paid the applicable prescribed fee for the licence issued for the term immediately 
<br/></span><span>prior to the term of a licence for which payment of the prescribed fee is due and 
<br/></span><span>payable; 
<br/>did not sell or supply liquor due to COVID-19 restrictions; 
<br/>did not sell or supply liquor for the term of the licence issued, in part or for the entire 
<br/>term; and  
<br/>incurred a significant loss of revenue for the term of the licence issued.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is essentially what this Bill seeks to do, Mr. Speaker,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, firstly, it extends the term up to five years and secondly, assist those businesses that used 
<br/>to sell liquor and predominately, this will apply to the hotels that actually have liquor licence, Sir. 
<br/>Well, a lot of them closed down and as explained yesterday if, for example, they had applied for a 
<br/>licence in 2020 and then they, however, shut down because if the border closure and they do not sell 
<br/>liquor for the rest of the year and then last year did not apply for it too, now this year when the hotels 
<br/>are open when they go to apply for it, the current restriction in the law is that, they have to go through 
<br/>the entire application process again as opposed to simply getting a renewal. This gives the latitude 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>607 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for them to be able to get a simple renewal and also, indeed, for them to be exempted from payment, 
<br/>should they have made some payments previously but did not use it for that particular term or period.  
<br/>Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Acting Prime Minister. Honourable Members, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor is now open for debate on this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, there was outrage last evening from this side of the 
<br/>House in the manner this Bill was tabled in Parliament.  We were ready to go home after 9.00 p.m. 
<br/>last night, and we were told that we need to consider four Bills to be debated today and to become 
<br/>law.  This was 9.00 p.m. last evening, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was bad enough that we used to get the Bill on Monday to be debated on Wednesday to 
<br/>become law on Wednesday.  Now, we have come to a new law that the Bill is given to us at 9.20 
<br/>p.m. last evening and to be debated now at 9.40 a.m. and to be made law within the next few minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said last night, Mr. Speaker, this is not a kindergarten.  This is the Parliament of 
<br/>the people of Fiji.  In actual fact, I need to apologise to the people who run kindergartens because 
<br/></span><span>they do a better job than FijiFirst in the way they run this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I know that whatever we say from this side to try and improve the process, is 
<br/>like talking to a wall. The people of Fiji are the losers because they elected a Government that is so 
<br/>casual in the way it manages the Parliament of the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Cdr. S.T. Koroilavesau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, the Ministers are saying, “We are following process.”  
<br/>Have respect of the people when you apply that process. Have respect of the people.  You cannot 
<br/>come at 9.00 p.m. on Wednesday evening with a Bill and expect it to be law at 9.00 a.m. on Thursday 
<br/>morning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just stick to the Bill that is there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Let us not create something out of nothing.  It is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>very simple matter.  Very simple! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  according  to  honourable  Koroilavesau,  it  is  a  very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>simple matter but with the people of Fiji liquor is not a simple matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Awwh, come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Alcohol is not a simple matter, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Liquor has been there ever since…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Our parents, Mr. Speaker, had taken precautions to ensure the society 
<br/>in this country - the Fijian people are safe from the abuse of alcohol.  Our parents have done that.  
<br/>And here we are, we are making it easy for people to make alcohol available to them when we know 
<br/>the danger of the abuse of alcohol.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Here is the Bill that says, “that a licence can be not only for one year 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or three years, you can now go to five years.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Cdr. S.T. Koroilavesau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the House also want increase in revenue 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as honourable Koroilavesau is saying, but in a responsible manner, not to destroy our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- And this is what is happening here today, Mr. Speaker.  This should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been taken to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Cdr. S.T. Koroilavesau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, can you give him a yellow card, please?  Can he go out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the House, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think I will give both of you a yellow card. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is he talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of Standing Order 51 is out of control in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this House now…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-This is the allocated process within the Standing Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Can I sit down and honourable Koroilavesau to speak, Mr. Speaker?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He needs to be shown the card, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the past, because of the control aspect of alcohol, we used to do it on a yearly 
<br/>basis. I was a hotelier, I did it every year.  I would go renew my licence and I would meet all the 
<br/>criteria, tick all the boxes, before I was given my licence, for that reason alone, Mr. Speaker. Now, 
<br/>anyone can get a licence for five years…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a Point of Order regarding 
<br/>honourable Koroilavesau on the interjections he is making which is  unprecedented.   It  is  another 
<br/>level  we are facing today, the disruption during  the presentation  by our  Member and his  level  of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>609 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disruption has never happened in this House.  When you are speaking and he is shouting from that 
<br/>side, Sir, you need to make a ruling on him.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, take a sit.  I have not finished. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, I do not know where you were last night, but we had a ding dong here 
<br/>last night that is worse than this.  Now, you are complaining because of one Minister shouting from 
<br/>here and there, it has been done before.  It is nothing new.  You can hear it, I can hear it as well, and 
<br/>it comes out loud on my earphones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have the floor, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to respect our people, we need to get their views on this and there should have been 
<br/></span><span>consultation on this.  We should ask the churches, the villagers, do you want to give licence now for 
<br/>five years instead of one year?  They will give you their views and that will help us, as leaders, to 
<br/>craft the Bill, to bring it here and make it law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I mean, in normal democracy that is the way it is done.  You care for your citizenry to have 
<br/>their say in the law that is being crafted.  This is total abuse, Mr. Speaker, and total disrespect for the 
<br/>people of Fiji, and I hope the people of Fiji will remember this Election year and I hope they will 
<br/>say, “enough is enough FijiFirst, we are sick of this abuse.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, specifically on clause 6, it says here that the amendments and the application 
<br/>can go to the Minister and he can say “aye” or “nay” to the application.  In the past, I ask the question, 
<br/>“What happened to the Central Liquor Board, the Western Liquor Board?”  What happened to those 
<br/>boards that used to hear all those applications and then they would go through the process, tick all 
<br/>the boxes and then make a decision because they cared about the danger of being casual about liquor 
<br/>licences.  What happened to them?  Will the Minister now have the only say in this?  Will he be the 
<br/>only one who decides whether it is yes or no?  No more Central Liquor Board. No more linkages, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Stop  lying  to  Parliament.    It  still  goes  through  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>same process.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  It  says  here  that  they  can  circumvent  that  and  go  straight  to  the 
<br/>Minister.  That needs to be made clear because it can be subjected to abuse. Mr. Speaker, I again say, 
<br/>this is not a Bill that should be passed in this manner.  It is one that needs to be taken to the people 
<br/>and one that needs to be brought in the way all Bills of this importance should be treated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have now, Mr. Speaker, is the concentration of population in a big way.  The corridor 
<br/>between Lami and Nausori, the population, if you are going to give liquor licences into just about 
<br/>every neighbourhood, Mr. Speaker, can you imagine the safety and the threat to the community.  It 
<br/>was bad enough before COVID-19 to walk the streets of Suva on some occasions.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this, Mr. Speaker, with the proliferation of liquor outlets and running for five years, we 
<br/>will be creating neighbourhoods that are not safe for our people.  We are very concerned from this 
<br/>side that we need to keep Fiji safe.  It is very thoughtless on the part of the part of FijiFirst to do this.  
<br/>Not only that it is wrong but the manner they bring it into Parliament would indicate that someone is 
<br/>trying to hide something, that someone is afraid of the opinion of the citizenry to say to you, “Do not 
<br/>do it.” That is what it is.  They are just afraid of the people of Fiji to say, “No, we disagree with you.” 
<br/>That is what it is.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we totally disagree, we totally oppose this Bill and shame on you for the way 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you are doing it and for treating people in this manner.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I wish to raise a Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- I do not mean to interfere with the process of Government but I 
<br/>am basically submitting that discussion of these Bills is out of order and I seek a ruling in relation to 
<br/>that maybe later in the day but I am relying on Standing Order 34(2) which basically says once the 
<br/></span><span>Agenda is stated, that is it unless the Business Committee determines otherwise which did not happen 
<br/></span><span>yesterday or you have it with the leave of the court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will see that the discussion of these three Bills came in during Question time after we 
<br/>had passed the Bills.  I can remember when we passed through that point in Agenda – Bills, you said 
<br/>there were no Bills to be discussed, so my point is that this is out of order because it did not come in 
<br/>by the consent of the Business Committee or with the leave of the court. That is my submission and 
<br/>I seek a ruling in relation to that, so I am relying on Standing Order 34(2). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  the  Business  Committee  was  told  that  there  were 
<br/>going to be Bills and our  Acting Prime Minister said that.  I was there at the Business Committee.  I 
<br/>made the announcement yesterday morning, there were no Bills at that time.  The Bills came in after, 
<br/>that is why I made the announcement that we are going to extend the sitting time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for sitting time, when I have been a former Speaker, I have extended sitting time to one 
<br/>o’clock in the morning.  There is no problem with that, but I am not worried about that side of the 
<br/>House or that side of the House.  When I do that, I am worried about my staff because after you leave, 
<br/>an hour after you leave then they leave.  But they are here next morning an hour before you arrive to 
<br/></span><span>start procedure.  That is why I have to guard against that, but we do not do that all the time, only on 
<br/></span><span>rare occasions we have to do it and if we have to do it, it is a necessary thing.  It is not done everyday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you for that clarity and I take that as a ruling in relation to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Point of Order that I raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as usual, this Bill is just a disorganised 
<br/>piece of writing from a disorganised Government that just cannot think ahead, so it just rushes laws 
<br/>through Parliament at 12 hours’ notice and the honourable Members on the Government side just sit 
<br/>there while this happens.  There they are, as we call them the “silent 25”, the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General insults this whole Parliament by introducing Bills on 12 hours’ notice, but they just sit there 
<br/>quietly accepting this insult. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>611 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  are  all  examining  the  historical  record  of  this  disastrous 
<br/>Government, the people will be asking the silent 25, “what did you do about it, why did you just sit 
<br/>there?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government cannot even get simple English right.  Please read the Bill 
<br/>properly, the third line of the amendment on page 2 to section 15(4) should read: “… and which is 
<br/>yet to be processed.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course we have had no time to discuss the Bill with anyone including 
<br/>hotels and small businesses and liquor outlets, and we certainly have not had time to discuss this Bill 
<br/>with other people and communities who may be affected by it.  The whole purpose of the Liquor Act 
<br/>is to ensure that people have reasonable access to alcohol for the enjoyment and their recreation, but 
<br/>not in a way which disturbs the community when it is consumed excessively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  many  instances  when  liquor  outlets  have  irresponsibly  sold  liquor  and 
<br/>intoxicated people have then become a problem for the community creating noise, threatening and 
<br/>harassing others especially women and girls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This extension of licences might be fine for big hotels but it does not work for everyone.  We 
<br/></span><span>have not heard from the people about this especially since taxes were lowered on liquor in 2020.  We 
<br/>have  heard  many  stories  about  people  spending  government  welfare  payments  on  alcohol  and 
<br/>becoming a nuisance to others.  Now we are talking about extending licences in situations which may 
<br/>become harmful to some communities, but, of course, Mr. Speaker, this Government does not consult 
<br/>anyone and it does not care and there is nothing new about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the amendment of the Liquor 
<br/>Act 2006.  I thank the honourable Acting Minister for the Bill which we disapproved of yesterday.  
<br/>This  side  of  the  House  did  not  approve  it  because  of  the  abuse  of  Standing  Order  51  to  proceed 
<br/>without delay.  That is the Standing Order in which you brought in from the Standing Orders. With 
<br/>the previous procedure, it is always submitted on Monday and we have about three days and then we 
<br/>debate it on Thursday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- 24 hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- We know from the Standing Orders is within 24 hours, immediate 
<br/></span><span>without delay; that is Standing Order 51.  But if you do in Standing Order 46(2), no less than two 
<br/>days.   But then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when they follow the Standing Orders in which I try to debate on 
<br/>Standing Order 41(3) in which oral questions and motions are given no less than four days.  Now our 
<br/>current proceedings is 14 days prior. We on this side of the House is giving-in in to your request, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it states in Standing Order 41(3)  that all oral questions are supposed to be 
<br/>submitted four days  prior to the sitting but then you have changed it verbally and put a note or  flying 
<br/>minute to 14 days.  We gave in to that and that Government is supposed to give us at least four days 
<br/>to read the Liquor Bill.   We think there is an abuse of Standing Order 51. The secrecy in which it 
<br/>came in, almost midnight yesterday, everyone left home at about 7 o’clock to come in to Parliament 
<br/>and then you bring in a Bill at almost 9.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- So?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- The secrecy of this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- So? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- There is saying on the secrecy of this Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny.  Not force, but secrecy and censorship.  When 
<br/>any government …undertakes to say to its subjects…you must not know…the end result is 
<br/>tyranny and oppression no matter how holy the motives.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have come to change the Bill because of all the hotels … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You listen because this is a health problem too. They drink alcohol 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they come over there and you have an outbreak in all the hospitals in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Listen, so that you can know something from us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Everything is excuses from Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You look 
<br/>at them, do not look at me, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how they react.  The Ease of Doing Business, these are 
<br/>their reasons of changing all these.  It is from a three-year to a five-year because of the liquor law.  
<br/>Their annual reports come five years later.  They introduced it last night to make it a law today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Ease of Doing Business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. R. RASOVA.- Financial Management Act (FMA), they cannot even rectify where 
<br/>Ministers and the Permanent Secretaries bring their annual reports.  We highlight that every day, it 
<br/></span><span>comes here five or six years later.  We have only about seven months to complete this session of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament. Things from 2015 and 2016 are still coming; that is who they are. That is the performance 
<br/>rating. This Bill comes in at midnight last night for us to pass it this today at around 10.15 a.m. and 
<br/>we strongly oppose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyday you trumpet about honourable Bulitavu as he is supporting you people, that is fine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is from Macuata, I am from Kadavu, I do not support the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Go to Macuata!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- He can say it, that is the President up there, he will of course support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Bill because he supports the President.

<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I will come to that, I will come to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- The Tobacco Bill is coming, you give licence to that, why not legalise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>marijuana</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Stick to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I think honourable Gavoka has touched on that.  What is the status of 
<br/>the  Central  Liquor  Board  in  existence?    What  is  the  existence  of  the  Commissioner  Western, 
<br/>Commissioner Eastern and Commissioner Central?  Those are people who do the licences.  They are 
<br/></span><span>the ones who sign.  Of course, you did that, now they have taken it away from you and it is going to 
<br/></span><span>go to the Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Usamate  says,  “The  doctrine  of  separation  of  powers”,  the  Minister  is  now 
<br/>intervening in this process where the Commissioner Eastern, Commissioner Western is supposed to 
<br/>write. But now the Minister is going there to sign the exemption. 
<br/>The doctrines of separation of powers Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have abused that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as honourable Leader for SODELPA asked, “What is the church?”  It is the 
<br/>people, it is the consumers that we are worried about.  It is the consumers!  You approve the licence 
<br/>from three years to five years.  Let them pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What is wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You did the hotel licence last year.  They are supposed to renew after 
<br/>12 months because if it is due diligence, we have to check them every time.  Now, you were given a 
<br/>five year last year, now you are given a three year to five years this year.  What is the matter with 
<br/>you people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Control, this is a sovereignty of Fiji.  We control our laws against other people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Convention on Violence against Women and Girls.  You approve the 
<br/>liquor, you are relaxing the laws for liquor.  What do they do?  Honourable Akbar was just talking 
<br/>about it yesterday, the violence against women and girls.  How to control it?  It happens over here 
<br/>but this is one of the number one reasons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Well, you are blaming liquor for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You talk to the Minister for Social Welfare.  You talk to the Minister 
<br/>for  Health  on  how  it  happens,  it  combines  –  the  liquor,  social  welfare,  so  it  is  a  combination  of 
<br/>everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, I just like to thank this side of the House in opposing this motion.  It is so shameful, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shameful!  The people are watching.  Honourable Lenora said it yesterday, “Shh, the people are 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>watching”, that is because of you people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Why?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- You want to know why?  Because this is an abuse of Standing Order 
<br/>51, abuse of Parliament, abuse of privileges.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution 
<br/>and I am against this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a small contribution towards the 
<br/>Bill.  I have heard a lot from the Opposition side on the Bill saying that the consumers would be 
<br/>affected,  the  liquor  sales  would  be  affected  and  honourable  Rasova  has  said  the  violence  against 
<br/>women would be increasing because of this Bill.  Absolutely not!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill only says, “Increase of the licence term”.  It does not, I repeat, it does not change the 
<br/>conditions  of  trade,  it  still  remains  and  for  sellers  licence,  the  condition  of  trade  is  8.00  a.m.  to 
<br/>midnight.  That still remains, nothing changes.  Absolutely nothing changes!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cumbersome task  of getting  the licence every  year or every three  years, that is being 
<br/></span><span>eased and extended to five years.  I have heard a lot, saying the Minister is intervening.  If they have 
<br/></span><span>read it correctly, the Bill says and I quote, “The Minister may exempt the applicant from paying the 
<br/>fee”, so he does not interfere in the licencing process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The liquor licence still has to be lodged with Commissioner Central, Commissioner Northern 
<br/>or Commissioner Western.  The liquor licence still goes the Tribunal.  The vendor or the vendee has 
<br/>to go to the Tribunal to present himself and get the licence.  Nothing has absolutely changed.  They 
<br/>are just creating huff and puff so that they can get mileage.  Absolutely nothing has changed.  I beg 
<br/>the Opposition Members to please read, the least they can do is read.  Nothing is changing except the 
<br/>term of the licence, the conditions of the licence, the trading conditions remains the same.  It is the 
<br/>task of getting that licence every year that is being eased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is alright for the people in the urban areas, they can go through the process every year and 
<br/>get the licence but little do they realise what tasks are involved in getting a licence.  It takes about a 
<br/>month to go through all the processes and get that licence and for people in the rural and outer island 
<br/>areas where they have to renew their licence every three years, they have to either do it through a 
<br/>lawyer or come to the mainland and get it done themselves.  There is a lot of cost and time involved; 
<br/>time that can be used to do something more productive in their businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They should read rather than opening their mouths first than reading later.  You think, you 
<br/>read, you think and then open your mouth.  Do not open your mouth then go and read anything.  So, 
<br/>that is what I am requesting.  Please, it is not for the sake of opposing the Bill, read the Bill and then 
<br/>oppose.  Nothing is changing, only the term of the licence is increasing.  Absolutely nothing else and 
<br/>the  Minister  will  not  be  intervening,  the  clause  only  says  that  the  Minister  may  exempt,  not 
<br/>necessarily will.  So please read the Bill and contribute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  is  for  the  betterment  of  the  tourism  industry  and  betterment  of  all  liquor  traders 
<br/>because it gives them the liberty of getting the licence once and trading for three to five years and 
<br/>not going through the process every year or so.  If the vendor or the licence holder is not abiding by 
<br/>the rules of the trade, the licence can be cancelled.  So there is nothing there that encourages the 
<br/>abuse of the licence.  Please do not go for political mileage, think why it is being done and what is 
<br/>the benefit of it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>615 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I rise in support of this Bill and wish 
<br/>to first make a few comments on the points raised from the other side.  I am, indeed, insulted by the 
<br/>comments made by the honourable Qereqeretabua about the Silent 25.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  whenever  a  Bill  comes  into  Parliament,  it  goes  through  Cabinet.    There  is 
<br/>Cabinet endorsement before it comes into Parliament.  That is the process.  It is something that the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General or whoever is bringing the Bill just plucks it out of thin air and brings 
<br/>it here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the President of NFP raised an oral question about the assistance 
<br/>that was to be given to the business community affected by the flood and it is exactly along the same 
<br/>principle.  These are businesses that were affected due to COVID-19.  We talk about the economy 
<br/>and how we can help our people but this is a different tune altogether again, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The processes and I thank the honourable Sachida Nand for clarifying that; nothing changes 
<br/>except for the term.  Just a few weeks ago, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I renewed my driving licence and I was 
<br/>quite surprised, impressed and thankful as well to LTA because they gave me options and god willing, 
<br/>I have renewed my licence for six years, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I paid $86 because I do not want to go 
<br/></span><span>back every year and renew my driving licence and it is exactly the same thing because for the liquor 
<br/></span><span>licence, they have to go through the City Council, Town Council, the Rural Local Authority, NFA, 
<br/>Health and to so many other industries to order to get a licence before it comes to the police or even 
<br/>the Office of the Commissioners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being  a  former  Commissioner,  particularly  in  the  Central  division-  when  it  comes  to  the 
<br/>Liquor Tribunal, it takes a lot of resources and time for the Ministry of Rural development. We are 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Rural  development  and  we  need  to  be  there  doing  other  things  but  whenever  the 
<br/>Liquor Tribunal sits and this is why I strongly support this motion.  It takes away a lot of work that 
<br/>can be dedicated somewhere else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me clarify to honourable Rasova as well that the process remains but we are talking on 
<br/>1986 about those that were affected during COVID-19. They paid their licence already but they were 
<br/>not ready as a business. So, the Liquor Tribunal does not power on them as they are limited by the 
<br/>Law that is already in existence. That is why, this has to be referred to the Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  the  process,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Unfortunately  the  honourable  member  does  not 
<br/>understand  that!  We  have  talked  about  the  issue  of  doing  business  and  this  assists  people,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir. Those that have liquor outlets have no problem but small hotels that have paid their 
<br/></span><span>licences, restaurants, bag packers- but have not been able to operate as such because of COVID-19 
<br/>restrictions and that is what, this bill is all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly support the Bill and I hope that the other side of the House will do so as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.-  I  thank  you  honourable  Minister.  I  give  the  floor  to  the  Minister  Faiyaz 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.F.S.KOYA.-  I  am  actually  amazed  that  the  content  that  are  coming  out  of  the 
<br/>Opposition this morning. Just last night, honourable Gavoka actually agreed to this. The first three 
<br/>he said he does not have problem with but he comes here today like a chameleon- and changes his 
<br/>tune again. This reminds me of </span><span>Boy George</span><span> song that sings </span><span>Karma Chameleon</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is actually quite astounding because what comes out as statements they 
<br/>made this morning by honourable Rasova, honourable Qereqeretabua and honourable Gavoka is that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>616 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they have no intention of supporting our MSME and businesses at all. They are not PRO Fiji and 
<br/>they have actually forgotten that COVID-19 actually happened.  All this Bill is doing is assisting 
<br/>those that have been affected during COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of these businesses had zero income because of COVID-19. It is our job to ensure that 
<br/>we can assist them as best possible. The amendments are twofold. Firstly, the licensing period have 
<br/>changed  from  three  to  five  years.  Secondly,  the  exemption  of  payment  of  the  prescribed  fees  for 
<br/>businesses  that  did  not  operate  due  to  difficulties  faced  during  the  COVID-19  restrictions.  These 
<br/>amendments are actually imperative at this time to provide the support the Private sector needs – to 
<br/>recover and ensure sustainable business operations. Nightclubs have been shut down for almost two 
<br/>years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They had to revitalise and reengineer themselves. The Fiji First Government from Day one 
<br/>of COVID-19 pandemic have responded. We have responded with smart policies, with respect to all 
<br/>Fijians  and  in  their  best  interest.  Be  it  closing  our  international  border  or  strategic  lockdowns  or 
<br/>rolling out hugely successful vaccination campaign, it was in the best interest to protect our lives and 
<br/>our  livelihood.    This  again  is  a  measure  to  protect  the  livelihoods  of  these  people.    Again  it  is  a 
<br/>measure that is going to protect people who are employed in that industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  has  strategically  opened  our  international  borders  in 
<br/>December 2021, backed obviously by science, good economic policies and most importantly, we are 
<br/>appreciating the challenges faced by our businesses and ordinary Fijians; a point that they do not 
<br/>realise.  The pandemic is an unprecedented event and this has affected every human being on the 
<br/>planet.  Unprecedented events like this call for extraordinary policy measures from Government to 
<br/>protect our businesses particularly our MSMEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the restrictions have been tough on bars and taverns. Bars and taverns last 
<br/>year in the second wave of COVID-19 were closed for more than six months, that literally meant 
<br/>zero income, so what they are saying is, “do not help them, just do not help them at all”.  The people 
<br/>of Fiji and all business operators should think twice before thinking about SODELPA or anyone else 
<br/>in Opposition.  This is the way they think. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, resorts and hotels were closed with zero income.  They were either closed 
<br/>or some operated on a part time basis and some maintained their liquor licences as this is an integral 
<br/>part  of  their  business.  With  the  successful  reopening  of  international  borders  and  the  easing  of 
<br/>restrictions, we must support these businesses that face the full brunt of COVID-19 restriction.  It is 
<br/></span><span>fair and it is the only right thing to do to support them.  This Bill will provide relief to those businesses 
<br/></span><span>to recuperate, be able to open their business without burden, to pay for licence renewal or arrears for 
<br/>the period they were not operating and the relief or validity of the licence will be for a period of one 
<br/>year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  amendments  also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provide broad exemptions  for those businesses 
<br/>with the liquor licence that were either operating or operating but were making a loss.  The conditions 
<br/>are there, they are quite simple.  It also provides a useful bridge particularly for MSMEs to commence 
<br/>operations in line with Government’s policies, operate safely in terms of opening up our economy 
<br/>especially our tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what we need, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Government is here to support these businesses 
<br/>in the private sectors.  We are leaving no business and no Fijians behind.  There is a great deal for 
<br/>business sustainability and survival and for the restoration of livelihoods and those that are employed 
<br/>in the sector and the supply chain.  The Bill will empower the responsible Minister to exempt the 
<br/>business from paying the fee for only one year which is enough time to recover losses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>617 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to COVID-19, we have classified nightclubs as high risk businesses based on science. 
<br/>Currently, they are not operating, however the vast majority of nightclubs have actually re-invested 
<br/>and re-modelled themselves as bars and taverns and are operating as such.  Essentially, since the re-
<br/>opening of bars and taverns last year, this is an important point, nearly 500 Fijians have been re-
<br/>engaged in employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill also extends the maximum term of the licence from three to five, which is in line 
<br/>with the FijiFirst Government’s vision to ease the administrative burden of doing business in Fiji as 
<br/>also alluded to by honourable Seruiratu.  This will give businesses a lot more certainty and confidence 
<br/>to continue operations and huge confidence to financial institutions to lend to those businesses with 
<br/>long term licences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would also  like to  add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that  we are responsible  Government.  Bars and 
<br/>taverns operate in adherence to COVID safe protocol.  We have our COVID-19 safe ambassadors 
<br/>also  that regularly visit  these premises and create awareness  about  COVID-19 safe measures and 
<br/>where businesses violate, we firstly educate and advocate before we take punitive actions. We are 
<br/>doing everything possible through these policies, the initiatives and the incentives to ensure that the 
<br/>tourism industry also remains competitive in the international market.  This is to ensure that Fiji is 
<br/></span><span>able to compete in a post-pandemic tourism architecture, something that we had discussed earlier on 
<br/></span><span>this week.  You have to look at the fact that there are other destinations that are equally hungry, if 
<br/>not more so, to gain market shares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the strategic vision to free our country from the grip of the pandemic 
<br/>and  to  return  to  some  normalcy,  it  is  crucial  that  we  give  a  helping  hand  to  the  private  sector, 
<br/>especially  our  MSMEs  and  the  tourism  sector.  Therefore,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  fully  the  support  the 
<br/>amendment to the Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  clarify  some  points;  I  think 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members on this side have highlighted the key reasons as to why we are doing this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members on the other side raised issues about, therefore, now there will be some 
<br/>form of unruly situation that people will be selling alcohol left, right and centre.  If they look at the 
<br/>amendments  made,  Sir,  it  does  not  alter  anything  under  the  Liquor  Act.    It  does  not  alter  the 
<br/>establishment of the Central Liquor Board and its functions, it does not alter the Divisional Liquor 
<br/>Licensing Authority as honourable Seruiratu highlighted where the Commissions are involved and 
<br/>people  living  in  that  Division  are  actually  members  of  the  Board.    None  of  that  changes.    The 
<br/></span><span>requirements as to how one can get a licence is not changed at all, Sir.  All of that remains.  It sets 
<br/></span><span>out clearly on what basis licences will be issued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not talking about here, primarily, new licences.  We are speaking 
<br/>here, primarily, in particular if you look at the proviso under section 43 of the amendment about those 
<br/>people who suffered from COVID-19.  We have the Opposition talk about, “Well, we must get more 
<br/>Fijians  to  have  resorts,  et  cetera.”    They  are,  in  fact,  there  are  a  lot  of  people  coming  up  in  the 
<br/>Mamanucas, in the Yasawas where particular landowning units have got together, put together five 
<br/>or six </span><span>bures</span><span> where a lot of tourists go to, very pristine waters, they also have liquor licences.  So, 
<br/>every time when they want to apply for liquor licence, they get a boat which probably costs $200 to 
<br/>$300.  Someone in Kadavu who wants to maybe open up, another  $200 to $300 to come across to 
<br/>Suva or to Lautoka or wherever it may be, and then apply on yearly basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had amended law.  Honourable Gavoka has got it wrong, he said, “It used to be on a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>yearly basis.”  The law as it is says three years.  We are amending from three years to five years.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  focus  of  this  actual  amendment  as  highlighted  in  section  43  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Principal Act says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Notwithstanding to subsection (2),  a person may apply for the renewal of the 
<br/>licence after the expiration of the term of the licence if the Authority ( Liquor Board) is 
<br/>satisfied that the person did not apply for the renewal of the licence due to COVID-19 
<br/>restrictions.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am running five </span><span>bures</span><span> in the Yasawas, I had a liquor licence in 2019,  I then applied for 
<br/>renewal  in  2020  and  half  way  through  because  the  border  closed  down,  I  paid  for  one  year  or 
<br/>assuming I paid for two years or assuming I paid for three years, I’m shut down.  I had a licence for 
<br/>one year and I paid for the one year but I never use it for six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, I did not apply because the borders are still shut down.  Come 2022 when I came to 
<br/>the Liquor Board and I want to apply for renewal they would say ‘no’ because the law says, if you 
<br/>have not  renewed on a  yearly basis,  you now have to  make a fresh application.   You have to  go 
<br/>through the entire new application process.  You pay an additional fee because the one you paid for 
<br/>one year and use it only for three months.  That is not our problem, that is what the law says.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What this amendment seeks to do under section 43(3), Sir, is to give the authority or latitude 
<br/>to say, “You did apply for it and, yes, because of COVID-19 you had a licence and you did not renew, 
<br/>therefore now when you want to come for renewal, we will give you a renewal. That is what section 
<br/>43(3) does.  Section 86A which is Clause 6 which they were harping on about, says and quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Minister  may,  by  order  in  the  Gazette  and  subject  to  any  condition  the 
<br/>Minister  thinks  fit,  exempt  a  person  from  paying  the  prescribed  fee  under  section  15, 
<br/>19,25 or 43 if the Minister is satisfied that the person -   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paid the applicable prescribed fee for the licence issued for the term immediately prior 
<br/>to the term of a licence for which payment of the prescribed fee is due and payable; 
<br/>did not sell or supply liquor due to COVID-19 restrictions;…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what the gist of it is all about, and again they have not read it.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at Clause 6(2), it says, “notwithstanding that.”  When a person, for example, 
<br/>comes and says, “Look, can you please give me the renewal.”  The Board will say, “Okay yes.”  
<br/></span><span>When it comes to the fee, they say, “Look, can you please exempt me for the fee because I paid 
<br/></span><span>last year and I did not use it?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the Minister exempts it, that person can only get a licence for an additional year.  
<br/>That is what it says – “for a term not exceeding one year.”  They can only get it for one year.  In 
<br/>other words, they cannot come and take a free ride and get a licence for five years, it is only for 
<br/>one year, because you got an exemption.  Thereafter, you can apply for the five year renewal and 
<br/>pay your fees.  They have jumped the gun.  This is the level of inconsistency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka, quite clearly pointed by honourable Minister Koya was that yesterday 
<br/>he said that he does not have a problem with the first three Bills, the Liquor (Amendment) Bill and 
<br/>the Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill.”  Now, of course he is going to change his mind.  This is 
<br/>the level of indecisiveness.  It is a symbolic of the level of indecisiveness.  Honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>has suddenly become a draftsperson saying that the word, “which” should be there, it should not be 
<br/>there.   I would urge her  if she wants  to,  like her colleague in  front  of her got  it wrong once too, 
<br/>commenting on drafting, she can talk to Lyanne Vaurasi, Glenys Andrew and Yabaki Vosadrau who

<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022

<div><span>619 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are the drafters of the Bill, and they can teach her how to do drafting, because modern day drafting 
<br/>is not done the way that you are proposing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  I  would  like  to  highlight  to  the  honourable  Members  that  when  a 
<br/>licence is given, even it is for five years, honourable Rasova, for a hotel for five years, even in the 
<br/>way the bus licence is given,  a taxi licence is given, there is nothing stopping the licencing authority 
<br/>from doing random checks.  There is nothing stopping the authority from getting complaints.  We 
<br/>have had complaints.  Hotels that were given licences started acting like brothels, they were closed 
<br/>down, and they had the licence for a longer period.  But there is nothing stopping the authority from 
<br/>doing that.  He misrepresented to Parliament saying, “Oh we must check, it is our sovereign right.”  
<br/>What is all that about?  This is theatrics.  Really.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is, that once a licence is given, there is nothing stopping 
<br/>the authority from doing so.  I would also urge the honourable Members to think about all the small 
<br/>businesses.  Around Namatakula there a lot of nice beaches there, what if the villagers through a co-
<br/>operative wants to set up five </span><span>bure </span><span>and started getting tourists?  It makes things easier for them.  And 
<br/>think, it is not only about business, it is about the workers, the people who are employed in these 
<br/>hotels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you have hotel small operators who cannot get liquor licence because they simply cannot 
<br/>pay  the  fee  and  because  they  have  not  operated  for  two  years,  but  the  bigger  boys  and  girls  can 
<br/>operate, guess where the business will go.  This is not a </span><span>carte blanche</span><span> saying all Fijians will now 
<br/>drink alcohol day and night; predominantly for hotels.  That is what we are trying to facilitate.  They 
<br/>have  come  here  and  brought  in  ethnicity,  land  owners  et  cetera.    It  got  nothing  to  do  with  that.  
<br/>Absolutely nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so I would urge all honourable Members to please, support this particular 
<br/>Bill.  I also saw in the </span><span>Hansard</span><span>, honourable Gavoka, when we brought the amendment for the hotel 
<br/>licences to move from three to five years, he said, “I support it.”  He supported it, the </span><span>Hansard</span><span> is 
<br/>here, and he knows being an hotelier, you cannot run a hotel without a liquor licence.  If you are 
<br/>going to say a hotel is going to be fully functional hotel …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- …as we all know, a hotel also has a bar, it has tavern licence 
<br/></span><span>and a hotelier as he would have done himself when he ran Mocambo and it was part of Shangri-la 
<br/>Fijian, they would have as management applied for those licences, and it goes under the hotelier’s 
<br/>name.  But you cannot have a hotel in this modern day and age without a proper liquor licence.  So 
<br/>you cannot agree and say, “let us get a hotel licence for five years, but by the way let us not get them 
<br/>to sell alcohol.”   Essentially that is what they are saying.  What we are saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is 
<br/>to make things easier. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  last  point  I  wanted  to  make  is  that,  we  needed  to  be  consistent  in  the  way  that  we 
<br/>contribute to these discussions.  We cannot pick and choose and what we are doing, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is that in this particular instance, the licence is already for three years. We extend it for five years 
<br/>but as we saw the gist of it, it was the exemption for those people who suffered because of COVID-
<br/>19. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister.    Honourable  Members, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament will now vote by acclamation.

<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> [Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 01/ 2022) enacted by the Parliament of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji.    Act No. …….of 2020] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  before  we  take  a  break  morning  tea,  in  the  days 
<br/>when Native Fijians could not go to the bars and have a drink, they had to have a permit.  Some were 
<br/>able to get a permit but some could not get it at that time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, those of you who been there, I do not think many of you have been, but I have been to 
<br/>the Garrick Hotel, the upstairs bar, there is a long bar there. Now, some relatives of mine used to 
<br/>work it out very well. They have a time moving upstairs. You walk up the stairs and right opposite 
<br/>the stairs, the Indian barman would be there. They will go up and said, “Hey brother, </span><span>dua na</span><span> beer”.  
<br/>At the other end of the bar, the host, Mr. Costello, will be there reading a newspaper.  The barman 
<br/>goes up to him, “Sir, there is a Fijian over there who wants to have a beer.” He will put his paper 
<br/>down, lowers his glasses, looks across and said, “He looks like a Costello, give him a beer.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, on that note, we will adjourn for morning tea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.43 a.m.
