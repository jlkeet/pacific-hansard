<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  follows  the  review  finding  of  the

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statutory Authorities and Other Entities in which five were related to the 2019 financial statements 
<br/>while three were for previous years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was one modified opinion issued for the 2019 financial statement and 
<br/>two of the financial statements from previous years were issued with a modified audit opinion as 
<br/>well. The Auditor-General  had issued an unmodified audit opinion on four of the 2019 financial 
<br/>statements that were audited for the various entities and one financial statement from the previous 
<br/>year was issued also with an unmodified audit opinion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The financial statements of most entities audited for 2019 were timely and of good quality. 
<br/>However, further improvements can be made to enhance the quality and timeliness of submission of 
<br/>financial statements to the Office of the Auditor-General for audit purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General had issued 11 audit opinions for the Statutory Authorities out of which 
<br/>three were related to the 2016 financial statements, one related to the 2017 financial statement, four 
<br/>related to the 2018 financial statements and three related to the 2019 financial statements for the 
<br/>various entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that some of the entities have resolved the audit issues that were raised 
<br/></span><span>during the time of audit while some are working towards resolving these control issues. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I wish to highlight some of the actions taken by some of the entities in addressing the issues that 
<br/>were raised during the audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly for Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Pte Limited (FBCL) in terms of 
<br/>the unpaid broadcasting licence fee, FBCL informed the Committee that all outstanding fees had 
<br/>been paid to the Telecommunication Authority and the invoices provided as evidence to the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  was  informed  that  in  terms  of  timeliness  of  financial 
<br/>reporting  by  the  Fiji  Public  Trustees  Corporation  improved  for  the  financial  year  2018.  The 
<br/>Corporation is currently pursuing on the procurement of a new accounting and financial reporting 
<br/>system supported by the digitisation project currently in progress which is part of the Corporation’s 
<br/>modernisation plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL) is currently addressing the 
<br/>issue  of  forest  valuation.  In  this  regard,  the  Corporation  highlighted  that  in  2016  there  was  an 
<br/></span><span>independent assessment by FHCL Management with an increase net asset value of $75 million. In 
<br/></span><span>2017, an independent Forestry Expert assessment increased the asset value by a further $8.3 million. 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently  the  FHCL  Board  and  management  are  anticipating  to  have  a  re-
<br/>assessment  of  its  current  assets  through  a  fair  valuation  done  for  the  forests  by  an  independent 
<br/>professional valuer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to the financial disclosures, the FHCL Board has appointed a new management 
<br/>that looks into this, therefore PKF was hired in August, 2020 to conduct a thorough review system 
<br/>and accounting processes at FHCL and during that period some major issues were highlighted and 
<br/>the Board has acted on the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL),  the  Committee  noted  from  the  response 
<br/>received that as at 11th February, 2021, EFL had a total of 56 projects for the Rural Electrification 
<br/>Scheme for which full  payment  had been received from  Government,  plus one for which partial 
<br/>payment had also been received. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquor (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>605 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  construction  of  stage  1  of  the  partially  paid  scheme  was  scheduled  to 
<br/>commence in 3rd Quarter of 2021, with completion targeted for the First Quarter of 2022. Sir, also 
<br/>noted that all projects should be completed by end of June this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, EFL had invested the funds for Rural Electrification into term deposits so 
<br/>that it could gain interest as procurement of raw materials from overseas were taking longer than 
<br/>expected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the other entities that are also covered in these two Audit Reports have taken 
<br/>necessary actions and measures to address those pertinent issues that were raised. The Committee 
<br/>strongly recommends that immediate action is required by the respective entities in order to improve 
<br/>financial accountability. However, it is also important to note that most entities are working towards 
<br/>achieving their contribution towards Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan in line 
<br/>with the relevant SDG targets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  I  thank  the  Executives  of  Government  Commercial  Companies,  Commercial 
<br/>Statutory Authorities and other entities, as well as the respective Statutory Authorities for positively 
<br/>responding to those audit issues that were raised, and the staff of the Office of  the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>for providing technical clarifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to extend my appreciation to all the honourable Members of the Committee who 
<br/>were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely; honourable Joseph Nand 
<br/>(Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable    Ro  Teimumu  Kepa,  honourable  Virendra  Lal  and  honourable 
<br/>Aseri Radrodro.  On behalf of the Committee, I also acknowledge the Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>Secretariat team for their timely support throughout the scrutiny process that was undertaken, and 
<br/>the compilation and finalisation of this detailed Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now commend this Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
