<h3>TOBACCO CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2020</h3>
<div><span>TOBACCO CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2020 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of 
<br/>Parliament on Wednesday, 9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022, I move:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That a Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 be debated, voted upon and be passed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill, in fact, has similar fundamental 
<br/>components as the previous Bill that we have just approved, the Liquor Licence Act.  This is similarly 
<br/>to do with the extension of time, in this particular one, licences were issued up to only one year and 
<br/>now what we are amending, Sir, is to substitute that up to five years.  In other words not exceeding 
<br/>five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a provision made in respect of if the person faces or has faced any 
<br/></span><span>problems  or  consequences  as  a  result  of  COVID-19  in  respect  of  payment  of  fees  or  indeed  the 
<br/></span><span>extension of their licence.  I will not elaborate any further.  I think the Bill is quite straightforward in 
<br/>that  respect  Sir  and  the  responsible  Minister  as  in  the  previous  one  has  the  ability  to  grant  that 
<br/>exemption  in  terms  of the payment of fees, if there has been an  application  made because of the 
<br/>effects of COVID-19, this particular business or individual was affected.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be referring to the Bill and be making an observation 
<br/>about the amendment.  Although I am making an observation on the amendment, it does not mean 
<br/>that I am supporting the Bill, I am not.  I am referring to amendment five – section 34(3) and I am 
<br/>referring  in  particular  to  3(b).  This  talks  about  the  power  of  the  Minister  to  exempt  people  from 
<br/>paying prescribed fee under the circumstances.  This one talks about, did not manufacture, import or 
<br/>distributed a tobacco product or e-cigarette or sell or barter </span><span>suki</span><span> or cause or permit </span><span>suki</span><span> to be sold in 
<br/>accordance with the licence granted due to COVID-19 restrictions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since we are tasked with making laws and making amendments where they are required, I 
<br/>am  questioning  the  reason  why  it  is  restricted  to  COVID-19  only.    Say  in  six  months,  we  have 
<br/>COVID-21 affecting this group of people.  Are we going to be considering amendments again?  So, 
<br/>I am suggesting that those circumstances need to be taken on board to cater and give the Minister the 
<br/></span><span>power to make that type of decision during times of unforeseen circumstances cropping in and not 
<br/></span><span>be specific to COVID-19 alone.  This is an amendment to the Act and I do not expect the Government 
<br/>to be coming again after a few months because of something that we do not foresee now. If there is 
<br/>another COVID-something coming again and I am saying COVID-19 in six months, would you be 
<br/>coming back to make a further amendment giving the Minister that power?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I would like to raise, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the process that this Government 
<br/>has  been  using;  Standing  Order  51(4).    I  think  this  Government  after  they  finish  their  term  in 
<br/>government, they will be remembered as the Standing Order 51 government.  I think that will be 
<br/>something that they will be remembered for; its abuse of Standing Order 51. A Standing Order as an 
<br/>abuse of power by this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  writing  up  some  of  the  things  that  I  see  about  this  Government  and  I  say  that  this 
<br/>Government lacks mature leadership, a leadership that lacks planning, does not have a legislative 
<br/>calendar, one that is reactionary, one that lacks foresight and balanced judgement and one that cannot 
<br/>justify its actions to the people. I am suggesting changes.  I have just suggested something that they 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>need to consider about the amendment and it is so important that the people of this country be given 
<br/>the opportunity to be heard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure a lot of other amendments, lot of other suggestions will come up if these Bills are 
<br/>taken to them.   I remember Bill No. 17 and one of the things that I would like to say, this Government 
<br/>will fall with Standing Order 51 because this is what the people hate that they have been misusing 
<br/>all these years.  You are going to fall with your Standing Order 51 and you are doing the campaign 
<br/>yourselves. We are not going to do much campaign because you are already shooting yourself in the 
<br/>foot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, there are a number of amendments being 
<br/>made to this Bill.  Now, this has clearly taken some time to work out. This Bill has clearly been with 
<br/>the Government for some time. We, of course, do not know if the big tobacco companies lobbied the 
<br/>Government for these changes but what we do know is that the people were not consulted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is suffering from an epidemic of Non-Communicable Disease (NCDs) 
<br/>- diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension and similar diseases. In some cases, we have the highest rates 
<br/>in the world today. Tobacco is a direct contributor to these diseases and the Government is rushing 
<br/></span><span>this Bill through on 12 hours’ notice. It is not stopping to consult health professionals and the people 
<br/></span><span>in the community who try to improve public health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, of course, to us is deliberate. The Government has had the Bill on files for a long time 
<br/>so why the surprise tactics now? What  is  the Government  hiding,  why is  it so afraid  to  give this 
<br/>Parliament its laws to read in good time?  Why is it so afraid to allow the public to read and comment 
<br/>on its Bills? What does the silent 25 on the other side have to say about this?  Nothing! Just yes Sir 
<br/>and no Sir, three bags full! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Is this what their voters elected them to do, I ask, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir?  The Fiji Tobacco Industry should not associate itself with these law changers. They 
<br/>are  not  transparent  -  they  have  not  been  put  up  for  debate.  This  gives  rise  to  the  worst  kind  of 
<br/>suspicions about the Tobacco Industry that they lobby for these changes quietly and out of the public 
<br/>eye.  So much for transparency and accountability.  I regret to say that you too are permitting this 
<br/>total abuse of Parliamentary process to continue by the Government.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill before us. The intent of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill is no different from Bill No.1.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Exactly! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- There is no major change. It is seeking the amendment to two major 
<br/>areas which is extending the licence granted, waiver of licencing fee because of COVID-19 and also 
<br/>if there is significant loss of revenue for the period of the licence granted. So, I just do not understand 
<br/>why the Opposition is making a mountain out of a molehill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regards to what honourable Tikoduadua has said, time and again, we have made it very 
<br/>clear that because some of the members in your Party have not run a Government, so they do not 
<br/>know  and  you  should  know  better  that  all  these  Bills,  any  amendment  to  the  Bill  or  new  Bill  or 
<br/>anything that has to do with the nation, it comes to Cabinet and the Cabinet goes through it and then 
<br/>we  do  the  endorsement.  It  is  not  that  we  do  not  know,  we  know  what  is  happening,  for  your 
<br/>information, but we use our common sense. We do not have to argue on every little thing. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 202 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 2623 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular case, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 51, we use our intelligence to bring 
<br/>Bills to this Parliament because the Bills that we are bringing under Standing Order 51will only do 
<br/>good for the people of this nation.  There is no other major impact, it is only going to make their lives 
<br/>better.    In  such  situations,  we  do  not  wish  to  refer  it  to  the  other  side  so  that  they  go  and  do  a 
<br/>consultation.  You think the people will say, “Sorry, do not extend it from three to five years”, or do 
<br/>you think they will say, “No, no, no, we still want to pay the money, even though I have not done the 
<br/>business well.”  So, what is the idea of taking and wasting our time in consultation as well as wasting 
<br/>a lot of money in consultation when the amendment is very, very simple?  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.-  Sir, I will reply to what honourable Kumar just said.  I think she 
<br/>forgets that it is the people who put her there, they pay for her salary, so it is very important to consult 
<br/>the people who will be affected through these changes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Affected?  They are not affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Have you done any consultation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just make a brief contribution to this Bill and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will focus on the part of the Act that gives the power to the honourable Minister to exempt fees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I consider this as an operational issue.  Exemption of fees, I believe, should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be done by the licensing authority.  Why engage the honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The day before, honourable Usamate (my OB) mentioned in this House that they are the smart 
<br/>Government, the only involved in policy making and this contradicts to what he just said.  They are 
<br/>involved  in  operational  issues.    Smart  government,  engage  in  operational  issue,  Sir,  they  are  just 
<br/>exposing themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Seruiratu said yesterday that if they keep on changing their stance, they are 
<br/>unfit for leadership.  Here, they changed their stance so they are just exposing themselves that they 
<br/>are not fit for leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, it is the Permanent Secretary that is responsible for the change of fees and issuing of 
<br/>licence,  so  why  give  it  to  the  honourable  Minister?    Everyone  questioned,  what  is  the  motive  of 
<br/>engaging the honourable Minister to exempt fees?  Probably, we are nearing election and this is one 
<br/>way to help their supporters.  We will question that because if the licensing authority is doing a good 
<br/>job, then why engage the honourable Minister?  He is a political figure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Those people selling </span><span>suki </span><span>in the market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes, they listen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Why  give  it  to  the  Minister  who  is  a  political  person?    Political 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decision will come from him.  He will talk on political issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>624 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It is simple. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- No, no, it is not simple. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- </span><span>Hare! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I would have welcomed it if the honourable Minister tabled in this 
<br/>House a Bill to relax the licence of grown </span><span>suki.</span><span> I would welcome if the licence for growing </span><span>suki</span><span> to 
<br/>be removed to help the poor farmers recover from this crisis.  Here, they keep another burden, shifting 
<br/>the responsibility to the honourable Minister and that will give birth to nepotism, corruption, and that 
<br/>is what we know about them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not support the Bill. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to raise a Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under Standing Order 62 (4), and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is out of order for a member, when speaking, to use —  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)   offensive words against Parliament or another member;  
<br/>(b)  
<br/>treasonable words;  
<br/>(c)   seditious words; or  
<br/>d)   words that are likely to promote or provoke feelings of ill-will or hostility between 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities or ethnic groups within Fiji.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Tikoduadua stated that Mr. Speaker is also part of the facade made by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst Party in making changes to the Standing Order 51. I want him to withdraw that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  have  no  problem  with  the  Standing  Order  51.  
<br/>Standing  Order  51  is  in  the  Standing  Orders  of  the  Parliament  of  Fiji  and  it  can  be  used  by 
<br/>Government  to  pass  legislation.    It  is  used  often  by  Government,  and  that  is  the  prerogative  of 
<br/>Government to do that.  I do not see any problem with that at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been a Speaker in the other House where we have gone through Bills, put out for 21 
<br/></span><span>days.  But now those days we never had the mod cons that we have now.  We never had internet, all 
<br/></span><span>these mod cons you can get instant information on Bills and everything is wired to you. And we are 
<br/>still trying to use systems of the past.  What we need to do, we need to get on with things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, you do not have to withdraw that statement. You have made it and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have taken note of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  very  brief  but  I  wish  to 
<br/>support the Bill before the House.  Again, let me clarify with the honourable Kuridrani, I have just 
<br/>corrected his old boy colleague, the honourable Rasova.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, it is  an operational  issue when it comes to  processes but  when it  comes to  changing 
<br/>according to what the Act says, that is where the Licensing Committee has problems, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. This is not about micromanaging.  Civil Servants are doing their job and they are doing their job 
<br/>well.  We  cannot  go  down  and  micromanage,  as  already  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Member.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>625 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, they are restricted by law and that is why we are seeking this amendment.  I am surprised 
<br/>in Naqalimare that is all tobacco growing area.  That is from his area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Are you listening? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- As we speak there are tobacco leaves. I would ask the 
<br/>honourable Member go to Lomolomo Stretch, when you reach the Police Post, look to your left, there 
<br/>is a double storey building with a new wall fence. This is one of the new operators that had paid more 
<br/>than $260,000 last year but cannot be processed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tobacco leaves are already there.  He has brought equipment from Italy, Germany and 
<br/>we have technicians that are here now, COVID related, Mr. Speaker, Sir, he would have started but 
<br/>the technicians were supposed to come from China (this is what they do not know). Unfortunately, 
<br/>China does not allow their people to come in because of the differences in our COVID protocols, 
<br/>medicine and whatever that are used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  has  to  look  for  alternative  technicians,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  believe  that  the  sister 
<br/>company from China has arranged for technicians from Pakistan to come and they are already here, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the very same people he is talking about - people affected by the Bill.  But how 
<br/></span><span>about people who will gain from the Bill?  These are your very own people, honourable Member.  
<br/>Naqalimare is known for tobacco and all the areas that go up from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Misleading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I think the honourable Minister has taken me wrong.  My issue here 
<br/>was, why give the power to the Minister?  He is saying operational matters and benefit to the farmers.  
<br/>What I said was, why give the power to the Minister to exempt fees when it is supposed to be done 
<br/>by the licencing authority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, no, read the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- But my fear is that, because the Minister is a political figure, he is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>political man.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Read the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  The  decision  will  be  influenced,  especially  by  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General.  I think he is misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Honourable Minister for Health, Sir, can you just go fix the Hospital 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Navosa, please? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member is confused 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but I am clarifying.  Let me again state, tobacco farmers all the way from Ba have already…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, let me go back and talk about diversification and broadening the economy base.  This 
<br/>is the position changing that I keep referring to, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But then when it comes to this 
<br/>Bill, of course, they are always worried about elections and as I have stated, let us deal with today’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>626 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business for the benefit of the people, let elections take care of itself.  We, on this side of the House, 
<br/>are not worried about the elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us do the work for what we are called and elected to do.  Again, this 
<br/>facility  has  been  waiting  for  more  than  18  months,  and  I  have  tried  so  many  times  to  facilitate 
<br/>discussions, but we were restricted by law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  of  my  connections  to  the  investor  as  a  former  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture, he used to be the Lift Manager for British American Tobacco, and he has decided to set 
<br/>up another business.  I have seen the new brands, it is all happening, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so let us look 
<br/>at the benefits this will bring.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, NCDs is a challenge but people have their choices as well.  We will continue to 
<br/>advocate, we have the laws and we have the Chief Health Inspector who is monitoring and ensuring 
<br/>that what we have ratified, particularly, on tobacco laws are observed and adhered to, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  But at the same time, we need to look at the benefits this brings, and of course, I again support 
<br/>this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I add my thoughts on the Bill, I 
<br/></span><span>have questions for the Parliament Secretariat.  This new Parliament under this Constitution is almost 
<br/>eighth years old, so where are we with the Standing Order 59.  Why has the Secretariat not actively 
<br/>sort out details from us as MPs to declare our financial interests as clearly laid out in Standing Orders 
<br/>56 and 59?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With your permission, I would like to read them out for the benefit of honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the public, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Member with financial interest may vote only with Speaker’s permission; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>A Member may not vote on a question in relation to which the member has a financial 
<br/>interest.  If the member does vote, the vote may be disallowed by a motion moved, 
<br/>without notice, either immediately after the vote is completed or, if the Speaker sees 
<br/>fit, at a later sitting day.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  The  Honourable  Member  is  discussing  something 
<br/>totally different.  If she wants to talk about something else then she puts up a Point of Order, not in 
<br/></span><span>the same context on the subject we are discussing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is related. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- It is not related. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Member, take note of that Point of Order  but  you have the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, my comments do relate to the 
<br/>point I am making and I understand where the honourable Minister is coming from and we will soon 
<br/>understand that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Standing Order 59 and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>627 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A Member must declare financial interest - A member must before participating in 
<br/>the  consideration  of  any  item  of  business,  such  as  speaking  in  Parliament  or  sitting  on  a 
<br/>committee, declare any financial interest that the member has in that business, if the interest 
<br/>is not already contained in any register of pecuniary or other specified interest of members of 
<br/>Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, my question is, there may be Members of Parliament here in this House who 
<br/>may  stand  to  gain  directly  or  indirectly  from  Bills  or  motions  that  we  are  debating  today  but 
<br/>Parliament and taxpayers do not know. We all file our annual declarations to the Elections Office, 
<br/>why are we not telling the people who pay us what our pecuniary interests are? So, that is it, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whenever the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy says that it is a simple 
<br/>amendment. We know the amendment is anything but. We know by now that everything that the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General introduces in Parliament by way of Bills under Standing Order 51 has 
<br/>a motive.  Just like the Capital Gains Tax exemption being made retrospective last year.  Why would 
<br/>any  Government,  especially one that is struggling for revenue (in the Minister’s own words) and 
<br/>dependent on budget support from Australia and New Zealand backdate legislation?   Why cannot 
<br/></span><span>other Decrees be legislated as Acts which did not reach the floor of Parliament for ratification but 
<br/></span><span>enacted under the 2013 Constitution have been made retrospective just like the Capital Gains Tax 
<br/>exemption?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order. We are talking about  the Tobacco 
<br/>Bill, Mr. Speaker.  Why is she going all over the place?  It is a very simple thing.  It is just a piece of 
<br/>paper that needs to discuss Tobacco Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, you have heard the Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely relevant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Stick to the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Why bypass the medicinal board to empower the Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister to approve COVID Test Kits and other equipment last December? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  truth  is,  these  things  are  not  done  for  the  benefit  of  the  economy  or 
<br/></span><span>Government’s responsibility towards compassion or care of its citizens, these are acts of deviousness 
<br/></span><span>either  aimed  at  electioneering,  benefitting  politically  by  filling  its  political  party’s  kitty  which  is 
<br/>FijiFirst or, in other words, helping someone who is sympathetic and an avid supporter of the ruling 
<br/>party.  This is the fact with anything and everything that is put before us with a speed of lightening.  
<br/>Not that we are afraid of being ambushed personally, Mr. Speaker, what we do fear and care about 
<br/>is how democracy is being ambushed and throttled in this Chambers, the people’s Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  what  I  am  saying  is  the  reality  of  the  matter.  It  is  the  unmistakeable  truth. 
<br/>Briefly,  did  the  people  of  Fiji  benefit  from  the  amendment  to  the  medicinal  products  legislation 
<br/>amendment last December?  Was the access to procurement of basic medication and COVID rapid 
<br/>testing kits made easier and cheaper?  Were all pharmacies in the country allowed to import approved 
<br/>or even sell testing kits distributed by authorised pharmaceutical suppliers?  The answer is, no. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The prices double for test kits.  Only a limited number of pharmacists were allowed to sell 
<br/>them.  One wonders whether they were directly or indirectly linked to a businessman in the West 
<br/>who controls the pharmacy chain that is registered under his wife’s name.  One wonders whether that

<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>businessman has had a red notice issued against him by Interpol in connection with hard drugs related 
<br/>investigations.  And  one  wonders  how  much  money  this  particular  businessman  donated  to  the 
<br/>FijiFirst Party in 2018?  We know one can personally make a donation of …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I think the Honourable Member is really wasting our time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- She is wasting our time. We are here to talk about a very specific Bill 
<br/>on a specific issue, a very small issue and she is going on to this dire tribe about this and that, she is 
<br/>like a river meandering around the globe, she will probably end up on the sun.  I think she should be 
<br/>directed, “let us talk on this Bill, we have another two Bills, we have motions to debate.”  Let us stop 
<br/>this meandering.  Focus on this particular Bill, this is getting absurd. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member you have heard the Point of Order. I have reminded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, stick to the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- I am, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am and this is what the people 
<br/>who voted me into this House expect me to talk about and if you do not like me bringing these matters 
<br/>up …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Yes, if you cannot take the heat …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Sorry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I should not be talking to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And one wonders how much money this particular businessman donated to the FijiFirst Party 
<br/></span><span>in 2018.  We know one can personally make a donation to a maximum of $10,000 per annum but in 
<br/></span><span>this case, was it $100,000 or more under different names but on the same dates?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we ask if there is a similar scenario unfolding with this so-called simple 
<br/>amendment.  The devil is in the detail.  The granting of licences for five years, exemption of licence 
<br/>if you are affected by COVID-19 and have been unable to operate your business and for </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers 
<br/>to have a vendors licence before first being eligible for this five year licence.  We know </span><span>suki </span><span>sellers 
<br/>will by far and large fail to get licence payment exemptions.  They will be told that municipal markets 
<br/>were open during the pandemic, for that matter we know that vendors in Labasa are being charged 
<br/>in excess of $80 to sell </span><span>haldi</span><span> and </span><span>masala</span><span>.  Perhaps, the Local Government Minister can clarify this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what is this Bill about, why the urgency?  Did this Government just realise after 12 years 
<br/>that </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers need a longer licence?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is more than just electioneering, it is 
<br/>more  than  likely,  extremely  similar  to  the  medicinal  products  and  the  CGT  legislations  rushed 
<br/>through  this  Parliament  last  year.    We  know  that  British  American  Tobacco  as  manufacture  of 
<br/>cigarettes was operational during the pandemic therefore it will not have any exemptions.  Its licence 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>629 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>period will not be increased and remains unchanged.  </span><span>Suki</span><span> sellers, yes they will get longer licences 
<br/>provided they meet other criteria at their local municipality.  So, why the rush? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rush is because there is likely a new tobacco manufacturer or importer who must have 
<br/>paid  the  maximum  amount  of  $250,000  but  wants  a  longer  licence.    So,  we  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General,  who  is  wearing  the  hats  of  the  Registered  Officer  and  General-Secretary  of 
<br/>FijiFirst?  Is this true?  Is there another manufacturer in the West, between Nadi and Lautoka?  Is he 
<br/>a naturalised citizen because he is married to a local lady?  Was he working for British American 
<br/>Tobacco  or  its  subsidiary  before  quitting  to  set  up  his  business?    Was  his  business  affected  by 
<br/>COVID-19  preventing  him  from  starting  operations?    Is  this  the  reason  behind  the  urgency  of 
<br/>bringing this legislation under Standing Order 51?  Why did the Government not alleviate the plight 
<br/>of</span><span> suki</span><span> sellers before?  We need answers, we need clarity.  We need transparency and do not use the 
<br/></span><span>suki</span><span> sellers as your bargaining chip.  I do not support this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I do not  think  in  the last five minutes  I have heard 
<br/>anything relative to this particular Bill that is before the House.  I think NFP has lost its way, lost its 
<br/>thoughts, lost just about everything, that is why they continue to harp on about other stuff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right down to the extent where honourable Tikoduadua starts this, I think, 
<br/></span><span>as of this week they have started saying the “Silent 25”.  I am sorry, no one on this side of the House 
<br/>is silent.  We are just actually one party, we all agree with what has to be done and we do it, not like 
<br/>you, we are not a silent 25, we all have a voice in this side of the House, that is why the FijiFirst 
<br/>Party is in Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Everyone has a voice on this side of the House and I think the people of 
<br/>Fiji actually know that.  So, please do not try and grandstand and tell us and besides, why should 
<br/>anyone on this side of the House support what you are saying?  You are asking them to stand up and 
<br/>support you?  Forget it!  Thank you very much, honourable Tikoduadua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill to amend the Tobacco Control Act. Again, it is very 
<br/>similar to the liquor one that we have actually just done.  The amendments relate to exemption of the 
<br/>prescribed  fees  where  the  business  did  not  operate  as  outlined  in  the  person’s  licence  due  to 
<br/>difficulties faced as a result of COVID-19 restrictions.  I think they are just completely forgetting 
<br/>about  COVID-19.    Fijian  borders  closed  and  restrictions  were  put  in  place  from  April  2021  and 
<br/></span><span>businesses that actually manufacture or distribute tobacco products and one of the most important 
<br/></span><span>things, Mr. Speaker, is our </span><span>suki </span><span>vendors.  They actually suffered significant losses and for us, it is all 
<br/>about the assistance that we can actually give them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a matter of fact, they played a major part in making sure that this Bill came to this House.  
<br/>They have a voice and they have spoken to us about it.  Our farmers that mostly produce </span><span>suki</span><span>, who 
<br/>are  mostly  classified  as  MSMEs,  they  have  suffered  losses  and  lost  markets  due  to  COVID-19 
<br/>restrictions.  This also includes infant businesses that recently invested in tobacco manufacturing as 
<br/>mentioned by honourable Seruiratu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Acting Prime Minister yesterday, the annual 
<br/>tobacco manufacturing licence costs about $242,000 per annum for a newly established business and 
<br/>this  is  actually  a  significant  investment.    These  businesses  are  taking  on  board  the  financial 
<br/>commitment to pay the licence fee, complete set up, support the farmers in growing tobacco leaves 
<br/>and create more jobs.  For example, a new business had invested over about $3 million in machinery, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>630 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engaged  30  farmers  that  have  planted  tobacco  for  them  in  2020-2021  and  which  employed 
<br/>approximately 100 farm labourers on these farms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  the  harsh  reality  of  this,  Mr.  Speaker.    However,  it  was  unfortunate  due  to  the 
<br/>pandemic, they led to international border closure and it became a stumbling block to commence 
<br/>operations as technicians could not enter and complete the set up.  Exactly the same person who has 
<br/>been referred to by the honourable Inia Seruiratu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, the Bill will assist those businesses that did not fully utilise their licence and 
<br/>manufacture due to COVID-19 restrictions.  The Bill will exempt the business from paying the fee 
<br/>for one year, giving them time to rejuvenate and recover, similar to what we just did with the liquor, 
<br/>Sir.  We are also extending the term of the licence, same thing, from one calendar year to five years, 
<br/>it  will  give  much-needed  security  also  to  earn  confidence  to  the  operators  particularly  to  our 
<br/>manufacturers to continue operations and expand.  This impacts the supply chain and more farmers 
<br/>will be engaged in producing tobacco leaves and ensuring a sustainable income source.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition keeps harping on about the ease of doing business, et cetera and the proponent 
<br/>is back in the House I see this morning but the FijiFirst Government actually takes action on these 
<br/></span><span>things, Mr. Speaker.  We want to take in many reforms and process improvements which I actually 
<br/></span><span>highlighted yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The extension of the licence period from one to five reduces again the administrative burden 
<br/>on operators to renew the licence annually and such exemption comes at a time when we are actually 
<br/>trying to recover and build back.  The Government aims to build a consolidated economic recovery 
<br/>platform and in partnership with the private sector.  The tobacco industry at large is one of the largest 
<br/>contributors towards tax revenue for the Government also, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government continues to support our farmers and various incentives of the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture also went through many of our economic programmes which Fijians on the grassroots 
<br/>level benefit from.  This is one example of a good economic case and potential benefits it will bring 
<br/>to our country.  Challenges and barriers continue to slow the growth of our MSMEs and that is why 
<br/>the Government is here, Mr. Speaker, to mitigate the costs and allow a more enabling environment; 
<br/>that is the whole idea.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Government  strives  toward  doing  business,  easier  and  encouraging  the  inclusive  and 
<br/>sustainable  development  of  businesses.  The  pandemic,  I  have  said  many  times,  Mr.  Speaker,  has 
<br/></span><span>given  us  unprecedented  challenges.    This  particular  practical  solution  is  necessary  to  ensure  that 
<br/></span><span>business resilience is there and it also has to make a positive impact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Minister responsible for Commerce, I take feedback from the private 
<br/>sectors very seriously.  We do not sit back and wait, we assess, find constructive solutions and we do 
<br/>all within our powers to build resilience and confidence in the private sector.  That is basically our 
<br/>engine for economic recovery and for prosperity.  Therefore, I support the Amendment Bill and thank 
<br/>you for giving me the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Bula vinaka </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you again for having me to speak 
<br/>on  this  Bill.    The  honourable  Member  is  asking  me  to  apologise  to  the  people  of  Vanua  Levu, 
<br/>especially Macuata this morning.  I thought I was the defending mechanism on this side to protect 
<br/>ourselves and not to support that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway, similarly to Bill No. 1, this Bill extends the maximum term of the licence, under 
<br/>this Act, to five years and the honourable Minister to exempt fees.  Did this Bill go to Cabinet?  Did 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>631 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any  of  the  Ministers  raise  the  question  of  risk  management?    That  is  more  appropriate  for  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary to decide or an officer at Director level, rather than a politician.  The question 
<br/>that may arise is, did FijiFirst Party try to get a boost in tax revenue at the expense of the safety of 
<br/>citizens and families of those locals who abuse?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally, the Bill is understandable, to facilitate the restoration of the tourism industry, as 
<br/>well as the bars and nightclubs and other providers.  However, there is no reason why this Bill had 
<br/>to be sprung at the Opposition at the eleventh hour, ambushed and foul-tricked by the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no explanation in this Bill, there is no good governance, no explanation and is kept 
<br/>a secret.  As I have said this morning, secrecy is the keystone to all tyranny, not force but secrecy.  
<br/>When any government for that matter undertakes to say to its subjects, “For this, you are forbidden 
<br/>to know, the end result is tyranny and oppression of the matter are all his motives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say that the abuse of Standing Order 51 as alluded by the 
<br/>honourable Members on this side of the House.  Why did it come at 9 o’clock last night and then it 
<br/>is still not 24 hours?  It is just 12 hours that we will be passing this Bill.  Why we are against this 
<br/></span><span>motion here is because we and our voters do not even know anything about this Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth is out there, they do not know anything about this Bill.  If we do not know about 
<br/>this  Bill,  then  what  about  the  people  in  the  villages,  those  in  the  capital  of  Suva,  Lautoka,  Nadi, 
<br/>Sigatoka and those farmers, they do not know anything about this.   So, give us time.  Put it in there 
<br/>so that we can go back.  It is just like the Bill No. 17 when it came here, we passed it over here and 
<br/>you sent the Ministry for iTaukei to take the news around, so you were putting the cart before the 
<br/>horse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was sad to note the Capital Gains Tax (CGT).  That was suited for some 
<br/>business people.  When the Fiji Airways Bill was passed last year, three MAXs arrived that night.  It 
<br/>was brought in through Standing Order 51.  We passed it on Friday and on Saturday, it was all over 
<br/>the news that they were given approval of ANZ loan, because we do not know, it is a secrecy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think they should not abuse Standing Order 51, that is my motion.  I am 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>against the motion before the House and that is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak in support of the Bill.  I will begin  by 
<br/></span><span>telling the Members of Parliament, especially the Members of the Opposition side, I have a liquor 
<br/></span><span>shop in Nadera and, please, do come down and enjoy the services that we offer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is a shop, so nothing is offered free. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding this Bill, once again, I am repeating myself. 
<br/>Honourable Opposition Members, please read, think, analyse and speak. You are following the wrong 
<br/>sequence - you speak and then think and then start reading.  Read it first, analyse it, think about it 
<br/>and speak.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is only two pages, three pages or four pages, how long does it take you 
<br/>to read?  I am sure you have enough people, if you cannot read, someone else can read and explain 
<br/>it to you.  Now, please do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People are talking that they paid huge fees and they want Liquor licence, five years is not an 
<br/>indefinite period.  Five years will come to an end. It is not like 20 years or 30 years or 100 years, it 
<br/>is only five years. If you spend $2 million or $3 million you cannot get a full benefit in five years. 
<br/>So what is the big deal?  It is Ease of Doing Business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are trying to ensure that the business community, whether it is a shop or local vendor or 
<br/></span><span>suki</span><span> vendor or market vendor who sells </span><span>suki</span><span>, it is easy for them to do business.  I remember early in 
<br/>January this year, like everyone else, I was queued up at Ministry of Health building to pay for my 
<br/>licence and I had an old lady in front of me.  She absolutely could not read and she was given a form 
<br/>to fill. She turned around and said to me in Hindi, “</span><span>Beta</span><span> please form </span><span>bhar do</span><span>” which means, ‘Son, 
<br/>please can you fill up this form”. Now do we want that lady to go and queue there every year asking 
<br/>someone else to help her out?  Do you people want that or do you want that lady to fill a form, get a 
<br/>licence for five years do business and feed the family? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- What do you expect?  It was an Indian lady but it could have been an </span><span>i 
<br/>Tauke</span><span>i lady too.  Our services, our actions are geared towards all Fijians.  Every market vendor, every 
<br/>poor lady, every man who sell </span><span>suki </span><span>will benefit from this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is not only the big tobacco dealers.  I am trying to keep it short, our focus 
<br/>is Fiji first. We want everyone in Fiji to benefit first, equally whether you are a multi-billion dollar 
<br/>business or you are $10 </span><span>suki </span><span>vendor, you all benefit from this amendment.  So let us put our self-
<br/>interest, egoistic politics behind, forget about political mileage and think about the people.  We do 
<br/>not stand up and speak just because we are Members of the Opposition, we want to speak, we want 
<br/>to get the political mileage and we speak. We do not do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  before  I  sit  down,  I  am  really  appalled  on  the  statement  made  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Tikoduadua, he has challenged the independence of Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- And to add to the misery, their Party Leader sits here smiling and does not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>even say anything.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Point  of  Order,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    In  fact,  the  honourable 
<br/>Member  is  now  bringing  disrepute  to  you.  You  responded  to  a  Point  of  Order  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau. He is bringing the point again.  You have made a Ruling, you have accepted that and 
<br/>he is whipping that again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  have  already  made  my  comments  on  the  contents  of  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tikoduadua’s, and that is so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I urge all honourable Members here to 
<br/>respect the Chair of the Speaker and the Speaker, and we do not undermine the independence of the

<br/>look the other way.  Now, you both have done that so many times, I do not know why, but I give the 
<br/>floor to the honourable Minister for Heath.

<div><span>time around.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 330 </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers for the last five to 10 years.  I have been told 
<br/>by my staff that, that number has not changed much for more than five years.  They come every year 
<br/>to get their licence renewed.  These are our Fijians who struggle the most.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost every time we have to extend the licence.  At the moment, we are going to extend it 
<br/>till March, by three months for them.  One of the reasons why this is being done is for the ease of 
<br/>business for them.  As my honourable friend had said, they come and they line up in the shop, they 
<br/>line up at the Ministry of Health Headquarters, we want to ensure that they have some surety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They line up at the hospital too, you worry about that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Wait, wait!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  next  thing  I  want  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  want  to  respond  to  what  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua had said, in saying that the changes that were made in Parliament in that Act in which 
<br/>we ensured that  the test to  come and the Minister can  give the exemptions,  has really helped the 
<br/>Ministry of Health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many  times  the  Ministry  of  Health  Officials  and  our  health  professionals  are  stuck  in  the 
<br/>health centres, trying to organise tests, because the only test that could be used was the one that we 
<br/>had.  By aligning ourselves to best practice which they are doing all over the world, in Australia, they 
<br/>have opened it up by just ensuring that the tests are the ones accredited by WHO that had been given 
<br/>the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and also the Therapeutic Guidelines Association of Australia that 
<br/>we have aligned to that then those tests can be readily available.  Those tests have come, they have 
<br/>been used now, RB antigen tests and there had been opportunities for growth in the economic sector 
<br/>also.  We have opportunities for young people who are laboratory scientists, who may not have the 
<br/></span><span>opportunity with us, they can then go and join the lab.  Because Reverse Transcription polymerase 
<br/></span><span>Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing is now available more and RB antigen testing is available more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to finish on this note before I sit down.  I again was irritated by 
<br/>the lack of disrespect to you Mr. Speaker, Sir by the honourable Member.  If any two in this House 
<br/>should respect  this, Mr.  Speaker,  and  you Mr. Speaker, it should be the  honourable Member and 
<br/>honourable Tuisawau the Whip. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Point of Order.  I note what the Honourable Minister is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I am coming to that.  What I am saying is that, you have 
<br/>already made the Ruling, Mr. Speaker, Sir in terms of how you view my intervention.  I am not trying

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to make justification myself.  All I am saying is that the Mr. Speaker has already made the Ruling.  
<br/>It is not a matter of disrespect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I made a point.  I respect the Speaker in all degrees, 
<br/>absolutely, but it does not mean that I have to agree all the time.  This is about what this House is 
<br/>about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I do not have to agree with Mr. Speaker, I disagree 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with him all the time, he knows.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- The Point of Order is that, for the Order of the House, 
<br/></span><span>the Speaker has made a ruling and I ask the honourable Minister and the Members of the other side 
<br/>to abide by the ruling of the Speaker.  There is no disrespect earned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- There is no disrespect made.  I respect Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not have to agree all the time and Mr. Speaker agrees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Well, Mr. Speaker has already made that ruling. You 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have to respect that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.-  Well he is already said  that there  is  no discussions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about it ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Why are you  scared? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- I am not scared about anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You are scared. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is why I am saying it here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out a conversation between you two.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  I  have  had  things  done  to  me,  I  am  not  scared  of

<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Seriously, I am telling you.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allow me to finish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I almost put a ban on the speaker but I have not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I WAQAINABETE.- I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for your ruling and as I said, I 
<br/>respect  you as a Speaker and  I wish and hope that all of us in this august House will respect the 
<br/>independence of the Speaker and his role and the work that he does. He is the oldest person in this 
<br/>House. He has a lot of experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, now you have gone too far.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR.  I WAQAINABETE.- Thank  you, Mr. Speaker  I support the motion before the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think a lot of the particular issues that I wanted to 
<br/>express have been already expressed, but every time we have a  debate on anything, there is always 
<br/>this element the people from that side of the House always seem to, anything that we propose, they 
<br/></span><span>try to cull as, underneath there is some sort of conspiracy, that we are hiding secrets.  It is constant.  
<br/></span><span>I think if we even said the price of ice cream should be reduced by 50 per cent, they will say it is a 
<br/>conspiracy. Everything is a conspiracy.  Everything is about secrets.  Well, I would like to put that 
<br/>to rest and I will confirm to the other side of the House, yes, we have a conspiracy.  The conspiracy 
<br/>is to do the best for all the people in this country. That is precisely what we are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Jale had said that this Government will go down regarded as the Government 
<br/>of Standing Order 51.  I will tell you that this Government will go down in the annals of history to 
<br/>say that when they built Monasavu, the people there had no electricity, when this Government came 
<br/>in, they gave those people electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government will go down saying that it is the Government that supported FDB which 
<br/>looks after the small farmers and the micro entrepreneurs of this country when you decided not to do 
<br/>so.    This  Government  will  go  down  and  say  that  we  were  the  ones  who  supported  all  those  </span><span>suki</span><span>
<br/>sellers,  the  micro  entrepreneurs  when  you  decided  not  to  do  it.      That  will  be  the  record  of  this 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Minister for his contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  couple  of  points  as  I  said  in  the 
<br/>introduction of the Bill itself, this is no different to the earlier Bill that we had and the focus of this 
<br/>particular Bill, of course, is they are two-pronged – one is the extension from one to five years, the 
<br/>other one, of course, which is predominantly the reason why this has brought about was because of 
<br/>the exemption to grant people firstly the renewal of the licence if they faced hardship and secondly 
<br/>was the exemption in respect of the payment of the licence fees.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if that 
<br/>exemption is sought, the Minister or the licence will be renewed only for one year not for five years, 
<br/>if they seek the exemption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, if they do not seek the exemption, then when they do apply, they can apply for five 
<br/>year.  It says not exceeding five years which means the person has the choice.  They can come and 
<br/>say, “I want it for one year, I want it for two years or three years or four years or five years.”  So it 
<br/>is their choice because it depends on how much fees they want to pay.  Again there has been this 
<br/>approach, they see the number 5 and they think,  “Oh, it is a carte blanche everyone will get five 
<br/>years.”  The wording is “not exceeding five years”, so basically it is up to them.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  also  like  to  make  was  that  in  respect  of  as 
<br/>honourable  Jale  said,  “Why  cannot  the  Minister  be  given  the  right  to  exempt  people  for  other 
<br/>reasons?” Well actually if they look at the history of the laws that we have been amending, Sir, we 
<br/>are trying to take away the powers that used to be given to the Ministers previously where they were 
<br/>given carte blanche powers and it became very subjective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Case  and  point,  previously  under  the  Immigration  Act,  the  Minister  responsible  for 
<br/>Immigration  could  actually  grant  citizenship  to  anyone  as  the  Minister  so  fit  and  Honourable 
<br/>Lalabalavu would know this.  There are people who came to this country, running away from the law 
<br/>and they in fact were given citizenship within six months or nine months because at that time the 
<br/>Minister had the discretionary powers to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  discretionary  power,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  taken  away  under  the  Bainimarama 
<br/>Government.  You had to meet a particular criteria and fulfil that criteria, and only then you would 
<br/>be  given  a  Fijian  citizenship.    You  will  see  a  number  of  areas,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  where  we  have 
<br/>amended the laws where the discretionary powers, in fact, the carte blanche discretionary powers 
<br/>which are very subjective have been taken away from the Minister. So, honourable Jale this is the 
<br/>reason why and it is specific to COVID-19 only. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Someone should not come along and say “I did not feel like paying it and by the way, you are 
<br/>from Navosa and I am from Navosa and therefore give it to me or I am from Lau, give it to me” that 
<br/>does not happen.  This is specific stated reason in the law why and only when that exemption can be 
<br/>given.  Honourable Jale and obviously honourable Kuridrani, I think or one of the other backbenchers 
<br/>seem to be in conflict 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is saying why cannot the Minister be given more powers?  Honourable Kuridrani said, 
<br/>“Why  is  the  Minister  being  given  the  powers  to  exempt  the  fees?    Why  cannot  it  be  licensing 
<br/>authority?”  Under the Tobacco Act, the licencing authority is the Permanent Secretary for Health. 
<br/>Fees is a policy decision. Parliament and Government set fees.  Most of the laws in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, there is an enabling provision in the substantive Act that says, “The Minister may make fees” 
<br/>and then it is put in the schedule under the regulations or in the regulations by the Minister.  It is a 
<br/>policy decision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way for example, when the Bainimarama Government was appointed, the fine 
<br/>for not wearing a seat belt was $80.  That was exactly the fees or fine that was paid in Queensland 
<br/>where the LTA Act was brought from. They used to pay AUS$80, when they brought it to Fiji, they 
<br/></span><span>did not change it.  We reduced it to $40, I think, it was - $40 or $20 because it did not sync with the 
<br/></span><span>income level of people in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, when you have a penalty that is too high, it leads to corruption because the person pulling 
<br/>you over for not wearing your seat belt knows that you probably some person whose is earning only 
<br/>$120 or $150 a week and if I am going to sop you $80 for not wearing a seat belt, there has to be 
<br/>some arrangement and that was what used to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the fees and the penalties need to be an alignment with the socio-economic conditions 
<br/>and that is why it is a policy decision and that is why honourable Kuridrani it is actually given to the 
<br/>Minister responsible; that is the rationale.  Because the civil servants are not answerable to the public, 
<br/>they  are  answerable  to  the  law  that  is  given  to  them,  that  empowers  them  to  do  x,y,z;  that  is 
<br/>fundamentally the reason.  Please try and understand that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other issue that I would like to also make, he said that it leads to nepotism 
<br/>and corruption not it does not, because he is guided by this.  If tomorrow the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>637 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gives exemption to someone because of some other reason other than COVID-19 actually he can be 
<br/>charged for corruption, that is precisely the reason why it is put in the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  other  point  that  I  would  also  like  to  make  very  quickly,  honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua really I think, she like her leader is watching too many conspiracy theories, movies or 
<br/>whatever it is.  She went on about Standing Orders 56 and 59. Standing Order 56 says, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A  member  may  not  vote  on  a  question  in  relation  to  which  the  member  has  a 
<br/>financial  interest.  If  the  member  does  vote,  the  vote  may  be  disallowed  by  a  motion 
<br/>moved, without notice ….”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it says “on a question” – you need to read the fine details of the law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one is Standing Order 59, and she had a go at the Secretariat. She said, “What have 
<br/>they  been doing?”  It  is  not  the Secretariat’s responsibility. The Standing  Orders are there  for the 
<br/>members to adhere to. It has got nothing to do with the Secretary- General of Parliament. Standing 
<br/>Order 59 states and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A  member  must,  before  participating  in  the  consideration  of  any  item  of 
<br/></span><span>business, such as speaking in Parliament or sitting on a committee, declare any financial 
<br/>interest that the member has in that business, if the interest is not already contained in any 
<br/>register of pecuniary or other specified interests of members of Parliament.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had honourable Naiwaikula yesterday speaking on FBC when he has a case before the 
<br/>courts in which the courts has actually said that he must pay $3,000 in cost. He did not declare that. 
<br/>Honourable Qereqeretabua, you are being very subjective and selective also in respect to what you 
<br/>take as an analysis and this whole entire conspiracy theory about some pharmacist et cetera, did he 
<br/>give us money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can tell you in the 2014 Elections under honourable Kepa, one of the candidates was actually 
<br/>someone, Cavalevu who was actually funded by him.  He worked for him. Let us compare apples 
<br/>with  apples.  You  are  sitting  there  in  your  little  corner  with  the  other  two  members  of  yours  and 
<br/>coming up with all these conspiracy theories. Everything must be linked!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Seruiratu, before  you spoke, he actually spoke about that former employee of 
<br/>British American Tobacco, but you have a written speech, you see, so you just read it. You did not 
<br/></span><span>hear what he said and he actually said that that person is starting up a manufacturing company with 
<br/></span><span>the tobacco leaves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  declared  it,  he  said  it  but  you  continued  to  make  it  sound  as  if  there  is  some  kind  of 
<br/>conspiracy  theory.  And  we  are  actually  glad  that  a  person  of  that  type  of  caliber  of  training  and 
<br/>exposure  worked  for  British  American  Tobacco  will  now  provide  an  alternative  manufacturing 
<br/>facility in Fiji because British American Tobacco as well as it has done, we are really grateful to 
<br/>them, there will be some competition now.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are farmers in Ba, I know specifically and in Nadi who are being offered more for the 
<br/>tobacco leaves. He is sitting there, “hehehe, I have discovered something.”  Nothing hehehe about it.  
<br/>This is competition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and she went on about how maybe giving money here and there.  We are 
<br/>the only political party that has declared all the donations. It even got published on the website. We 
<br/>do not do lamp chop curry night or whatever it is. We do not do that. We do not do </span><span>palau</span><span> night or

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whatever.  In  the  intro-gosfullier,  we  do  it  in  the  interest  of  transparency  and  they  have  made  a 
<br/>mockery of it.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think essentially it fundamentally boils 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down to the point that  NFP cannot digest that we have such support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Honourable  Minister  for  Health  has  already  commented  again  about  the  COVID-19 
<br/>testing kits.  What  is  so  conspiratorial  about  that? Even supermarkets  are now making enquiries  - 
<br/>Shop &amp; Save and others want to bring in these testing kits to make it more readily available and 
<br/>cheaply available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Permanent Secretary for Health, when we announced the easing of the restrictions said, 
<br/>“Once we have far more testing  kits and trained  people available, the three day requirement will 
<br/>actually be looked at again.  We are not necessarily have to do the three days, making it further easier 
<br/></span><span>both, for our citizens coming back and tourists coming back to Fiji.  Every country in the world that 
<br/></span><span>has  gained  the  efficiencies  in  respect  of  how  they  deal  with  COVID-19  has  had  private  sector 
<br/>participation, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  can  go  on,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  about  various  companies  that  give  them  money  -  gave 
<br/>SODELPA money or gave NFP money under the table, we know.   But I am not here to talk about 
<br/>that, but that is all they do.  That is all they do.  That is what they are obsessed with.  Not a single 
<br/>Member from the other side has given an alternative, not a single Member, and they are saying we 
<br/>are using </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers.  We receive text messages, emails from them saying, “Please, we need to be 
<br/>exempted.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, the Ministry of Health requires  all of these people to have a business registration, a 
<br/>business name at their very least.  Generally, if you went up, Sir, to the Companies Office, which is 
<br/>filled literally with hundreds of people, tens of dozens of people just wanting to come and do their 
<br/>registration. That is what honourable Sachida Nand was talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is obviously trying to improve the system.  There are many processes 
<br/>until today, we have had discussions in Cabinet.  We have said to all the Ministers, “Please, look at 
<br/></span><span>all your different Ministries.   Look at where there is processes, where there are applications and how 
<br/></span><span>we can fast-track things.  How we can amend the regulations and laws or even internal processes, to 
<br/>be able to make sure that the services are, in fact, delivered properly and in a lot more efficiently?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  honourable  Professor  Prasad  talked  about  having  a  jibe  at  the 
<br/>Honourable Minister for Health, “Oh, the queues are long.”  But, again, they do not talk about the 
<br/>fact that Government, in the past number of months since last year, has now began outsourcing GP  
<br/>services to the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had literally hundreds of people, the Minister for Health gets their feedback, other 
<br/>Ministers get that feedback, how people are so grateful now, who could not afford to go and see a 
<br/>private GP, can now go and see a private GP, reduce the lines because not everyone is seriously ill.  
<br/>They may have one particular ailment that a GP can fix up. As we have said, we are going to put out 
<br/>another  advertisement  because  more  GPs  are  interested  in  participating  in  this.    This  is  heading 
<br/>towards a national approach.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>639 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will find in Australia, we have Medicare system where 
<br/>if you are ill, you go and see your private GP.  You do not go rushing off to the hospital.  The hospital 
<br/>will see you for more serious matters.  If you have a headache, you have runny nose, you go and see 
<br/>the private GP, your local GP.  They will know your family history, they will know what happened 
<br/>to  you  one  month  ago,  et  cetera,  a  lot  more  closer  relationship  between  the  GP  and  the  patient 
<br/>themselves.  This is the building blocks of building a better health system.  Of course the Minister 
<br/>for Health himself has admitted that not everything is perfect. So, we have a number of policies in 
<br/>itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that addresses those issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I want to make, someone mentioned about Bill No. 17. I would like to reiterate 
<br/>that there is no more Bill No. 17, it is Act No.  22. Get on with the programme. If you say Bill No. 
<br/>17, it has got no merit. If you say Bill No. 17 in a few weeks’ time, that will be a bill    from this year.  
<br/>It is Act No. 22 of 21. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the shenanigans that came out after that because they saw for 
<br/>themselves a political opportunity, in the same way and I have to say this honourable Bulitavu and 
<br/>honourable Nawaikula, before the 2014 General Elections made all these videos or DVDs saying, “If 
<br/>you vote for this Government, this Constitution, your land will go away.” Nothing like that happened!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Before the Elections, they said Kadavu was going to be sold.  
<br/>Nothing happened!  Bill No. 17, they said your land will go away, et cetera, nothing has happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the level of contribution and intellectual input and disingenuity put 
<br/>out by the Opposition.  And I would like to urge all Honourable Members to support this Bill. I would 
<br/>like to thank all those people who reached out to us.  And it is not just the </span><span>suki</span><span> sellers, there are people 
<br/>who sell tobacco in their normal shops, the mum and dad shops around the corner in some rural area, 
<br/>in some co-operative, they also have to get a licence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Jale talked about a co-operative in the outer islands, they have to get a tobacco 
<br/>licence too.  Some of them go out trudging off in their boat, for three-four hundred dollars, get it 
<br/>every year, now they can get it for five years, that is going to help them, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, if they were not able to operate because of COVID-19 and there were shops that were 
<br/>closed down because of the lockdown, of course there were.  There were market vendors who could 
<br/></span><span>not  sell,  there  were  market  </span><span>suki  </span><span>sellers  who  could  not  come  down  to  Suva  because  Suva  was  on 
<br/></span><span>lockdown for six weeks so their income was affected.  They can apply for an exemption and they 
<br/>will get  it for one  year.  These are the people we are trying to  help,  Sir, as opposed to  some big 
<br/>conspiracy theory propagated by those three people in the corner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all honourable Members who have supported this Bill 
<br/>and I would like to wish the passing of this particular Bill into law and we would like to  tell all those 
<br/>people who have been affected by this, that we have actually come to their relief, once again, work 
<br/>for ordinary Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote by acclamation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
