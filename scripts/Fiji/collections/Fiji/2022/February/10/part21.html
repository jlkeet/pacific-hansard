<div><span>REVIEW REPORT- DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY 
<br/>1</span><span>ST</span><span> JANUARY TO 31</span><span>ST</span><span> JULY 2016 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That Parliament debates the Review of the Department of Forestry Annual Report 
<br/>for the period 1st January to 31st July 2016, which was tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I, as the Chairperson 
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources who moved the motion  take this opportunity to 
<br/>speak on the motion in regards to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources’ Review Report of 
<br/>the Department of Forestry Annual Report for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span>  July 2016, which was 
<br/>tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span>  September, 2021.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, on behalf of the Committee commended the 
<br/></span><span>Department for the satisfactory performance shown during the review period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 2016 was a challenging year for the Department as the nation 
<br/>encountered the severest  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  affecting Fiji’s economy.  The Department  had to redeploy 
<br/>funds on rehabilitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee would like to share the operations of the Department for the 
<br/>period under review.  The Department was able to achieve a number of significant outputs, including: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  successful  conclusion  of  the  Cocowood  Research  Project  which  was  conducted  in 
<br/>partnership with the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIR). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The delivery of a wide range of forestry skills training for both, forest-based companies and 
<br/>for the communities was another successful output.  The training focussed on people who 
<br/>depend on the forest as their source of livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another output achieved during the review period was the distribution of portable sawmills 
<br/>to assist community-owned pine schemes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department also worked on Reducing Emission from Deforestation and 
<br/>forest Degradation (REDD+), a project which is co-funded by the Government and the World Bank 
<br/>through its Forest Carbon Fund Facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even though the Department of Forestry was a standalone Department, it 
<br/>continued with its efforts to provide the much needed public service delivery to the community as 
<br/>required by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee considers it necessary that the Department of Forestry ensures implementing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the few recommendations put forth by the Committee for improvements.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, I commend the effort of the Committee  Members in the compilation of the 
<br/>Review Report of the Department  of Forestry from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 Annual Report.  My 
<br/></span><span>appreciation also to the Executives for their timely contribution in the compilation of the bipartisan 
<br/></span><span>Committee Report.

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few comments, as the Member moving the motion, I thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I could just comment on the environmental issue 
<br/>at Sovi Bay; every time, people used to go and complain to those people that they were breaking all 
<br/>the rules, they used to say, “Go and see the Prime Minister” - as a developer, they used to say that.  
<br/>That is why a lot of things do not happen in this country because developers claim that they have the 
<br/>sanction from Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Well, it went on for quite some time, honourable Koroilavesau.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when I look at the Annual Report here, I see the three types of forests that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pine; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Mahogany; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Native Forest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see here, Mr. Speaker, that pine is dominant.  In 2016, it was about 172,000 cubic metres versus 
<br/>mahogany’s 27,000 cubic metres and native forest - 25,000 cubic metres. So, Pine is dominant in this 
<br/>country in terms of our forests.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to spend a bit of time on that today, Mr. Speaker, and before I start, let me pay 
<br/>tribute to our former colleague, the late honourable Osea Naiqamu.  He committed virtually all his 
<br/>life to forestry, especially in the pine sector.  He was very much respected within the pine fraternity 
<br/>and people spoke warmly of him in that sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  if  you  look  at  the  Recommendation  No.  1  by  the  Committee,  it  says,  “The 
<br/>Committee recommends that in an endeavour to increase the Ministry’s contribution to GDP that the 
<br/>Ministry encourages millers to achieve production targets set by the Ministry of Forestry.”  I have 
<br/>been  highlighting  over  the  last  couple  of  days  that  the  resource  sectors  should  increase  their 
<br/>contribution to GDP and  I would like to touch on an area, Mr. Speaker, in terms  of pine that has 
<br/></span><span>problems brewing in the pine industry.  I would like to speak on that this evening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Towards the end of his life, Honourable Naiqamu was trying to resolve a rift that had emerged 
<br/>between the Fiji Pine Limited and the Fiji Pine Trust.  Mr. Speaker, Fiji Pine Limited is the company 
<br/>that  looks  after  the  pine  businesses  and  the  Fiji  Pine  Trust  looks  after  the  landowners.    The  two 
<br/>organisations run separately. Fiji Pine Limited respects the Fiji Pine Trust and does not interfere in 
<br/>the affairs of the Trust. That is the way it has been running, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine works hand in hand with the Trust.  Members of the Trust, Mr. Speaker, I remember 
<br/>Mr. Faiz Khan very fondly as someone who worked closely with them. This is the former CEO and 
<br/>Chairman who had passed away, Sir.  But, Mr. Speaker, the same is not true with the new CEO of 
<br/>Fiji Pine.  He is interfering too much into the affairs of the Trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened last year, Mr. Speaker, was that, Fiji Pine Limited had called a meeting of the 
<br/>Trust, which he cannot do.  The only person who can call a meeting of the Pine Trust is the Chairman 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="107">Page 107</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>707  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Trust.  However, this happened and out of that meeting, the Chairman of the Fiji Pine Trust 
<br/>was dismissed, and this, I believe, is where the Honourable Naiqamu was trying to come in to resolve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine Limited owns all the Class ‘B’ shares which is 99 percent. The Trust members own 
<br/>one percent – these are the Class ‘A’ shares, and they have voting rights and dividend rights.  So, it 
<br/>has been a very well setup structure, but it is now in turmoil, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  What has happened 
<br/>now is that they have dismissed the Chairman of the Trust and he is the biggest landowner in the area 
<br/>of Lololo, around the Drasa area.  He has been dismissed, together with a staff of the Trust and they 
<br/>have also taken all the equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have put in place a caretaker board and it is not sitting well with the members of the 
<br/>Trust.  The Trust members are saying, “Fiji Pine, you should just focus on managing the business, 
<br/>plant on the land that is leased to you by the members of the Trust, manage their plantation, harvest, 
<br/>process the pine products and market them”.  It is doing that, but also now interfering with the affairs 
<br/>of the Trust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He had no right to call for the meeting.  As I have said, only the Chairman can call the meeting 
<br/>and it was not a lawful meeting and is creating, as I have said, a lot of anxiety within the Trust, to the 
<br/></span><span>extent that the Office of the Trust is located in the premises of the Fiji Pine and those people who 
<br/></span><span>were dismissed cannot even visit those offices.  They are restricted from moving into their office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Trust and Fiji Pine Limited was established in 1998 and the landowners affairs to be with 
<br/>the  Fiji  Pine  Trust.    For  the  Fiji  Pine  Limited  to  concentrate  on  its  commercial  affairs  and  the 
<br/>landowners affairs to be on the Fiji Pine Trust.  The Trust would receive about $300,000 from Fiji 
<br/>Pine to enable it to run and a further $300,000 was given to the landowners’ Business Trust Fund 
<br/>(LBTF) for education, training, community development and business development.  But all those 
<br/>were suspended during the global crisis in 2008. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Naiqamu would have been one of the beneficiaries of that training programme.  
<br/>They  were  some  of  the  best,  Mr.  Speaker.    Within  the  Nadroga/Navosa  Corporation,  we  hired  a 
<br/>General Manager who was trained under this.  He was really a top accountant, trained through this 
<br/>scheme.  He actually lectured at FNU.  Honourable Naiqamu was also a financial person and they 
<br/>were all trained through this arrangement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Pine has come a long way, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am told that from the beginning it, all 
<br/>started from a loan from the New Zealand Government of about $100 million and it is just about paid 
<br/></span><span>off now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  landowners,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  who  belong  to  the  Trust  are  primarily  from 
<br/>Nadroga/Navosa, Ba, Ra, Bua and Macuata.  These are the people who own the pine land in Fiji and 
<br/>who were the dominant members of the Fiji Pine Trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be a member of the Trust, Mr. Speaker, one hectare of land leased to Fiji Pine is equivalent 
<br/>to one unit.  It is kind of a share within the Trust and for the maritime areas, 20 hectares of pine 
<br/>enables one to be a member of the Trust.  So, it is very well defined and one that should continue to 
<br/>function and produce what we want from the pine industry.  My concern, Sir, is that if we do not 
<br/>resolve this matter, it will impact on the future of Fiji Pine.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The pine problem, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is serious.  Factions are emerging.  The former Chairman 
<br/>who is the biggest landowner, may not renew the lease at  Lololo and likewise, other landowners. 
<br/>That is how bad it is because Fiji Pine is dependent on the land that is leased from the landowners.  
<br/>If they are aggrieved and it is not resolved, they can refuse to lease their land to Fiji Pine.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How to resolve is the way forward.  We believe, Mr. Speaker, it is time, Fiji Pine has come a 
<br/>long way, it is almost debt free.  The way it was set up was that, there would be losses along the way 
<br/>until they start harvesting in Vanua Levu. This is now happening and hence, the profit that is now 
<br/>accruing to Fiji Pine and on which they have been paid their dividends that FijiFirst has been paying 
<br/>out.  It has come to a stage whether we could afford to pay that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  a  long  term  objective  of  the  Pine  Commission  to  return  Fiji  Pine  Limited  to  the 
<br/>landowners and these are the people as I have said of Nadroga/Navosa, Ba, Ra, Bua and Macutata.  
<br/>We believe, Sir, the time has come that we do this and, in fact, it is part of the policy of SODELPA 
<br/>to give all the B Shares to the landowners and let them own Fiji Pine in the Class A and Class B 
<br/>shares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have done a lot for the country and we can all relate to the effort at that time to convince 
<br/>them, to lease out their land to Fiji Pine and I think it is more than 50 years, and the time has come 
<br/>that they take ownership of the Pine Scheme and Government will continue to offer them guidance, 
<br/>professional assistance, et cetera. You own it, it is yours and their new Fiji Pine Limited runs it.  They 
<br/>may even decide to bring in some professional companies to manage their business in Fiji under the 
<br/>Fiji Pine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what is happening, I believe this is the way we can resolve it because 
<br/>we cannot let these factions within the Trust - one siding with Fiji Pine Limited and the others are 
<br/>out on their own, to impact on the potential that we can see from pine.  We all want a thriving forestry 
<br/>sector and as the Committee have said here that  we must endeavour to maximise return from the 
<br/>forestry sector in terms of their contribution to GDP. This, Sir, is the way forward - resolve that issue, 
<br/>bring about peace between the two entities, give the ownership to the landowners which was due to 
<br/>them anyway (what was just going to happen) for the future of the Pine Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  is  my  contribution.  I  support  this  Report,  especially  the  call  that 
<br/>everything must be done to maximise return on the forestry and the contribution from the pine sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to again 
<br/>make a very brief response in support of the Report. Hopefully the line Ministry will consider the 
<br/>findings and recommendations of the Committee as well.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to pay tribute to my </span><span>Koicalevu ni Vesi</span><span>, the late honourable Osea Naiqamu for his 
<br/>enormous contribution to the sector.  He was the long serving CEO of the Fiji Pine Trust before he 
<br/></span><span>became the Minister for Forestry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Department of Forestry’s Annual Report for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 
<br/>was referred to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources on Monday, 7</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2021.  Sir, the 
<br/>Department of Forestry then was responsible for:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conservation, sustainable utilisation and management of forest resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of the Fiji Forest Policy 2007.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Administration and enforce forest legislation.  
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Approval and issuance of forest-related licences.  
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of training, extension services and research.  
<br/>Coordination with key stakeholders including forest resource owners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I wish to talk on two findings of the Committee in this six-monthly Report.  First, Fiji has 
<br/>a total of 1.2 million hectares of forest area, out of which natural indigenous forests comprise 82.1 
<br/>percent, pine comprises 7.2 percent, mahogany comprises 5.7 per cent and mangrove comprises 5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="109">Page 109</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>709  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per cent.  The Northern Division has the most forest areas covering 40.6 per cent of total forest area, 
<br/>followed by Central/ Eastern Division with 30.8 per cent and Western Division with 28.6 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, the national log production from January to July 2016 stood at 225,011 
<br/>cubic metres of which pine covers only 7.2 per cent of the forest area, produced 172,473.2 cubic 
<br/>metres which is about 76.7 per cent.  Mahogany was 27,017.1 cubic metres which is equivalent to 12 
<br/>per cent and native species which takes up 82.1 per cent of the forest area only produced 25,520.8 
<br/>cubic metres which is about 11.3 percent.  There you have it, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been talking about how the sector could improve on its contribution to GDP and I 
<br/>have just mentioned above an area that the now Ministry of Forestry could explore further. We need 
<br/>to  explore  on the  potential  of  the  native  forest  and  maximise  production as  they  take  up  a  major 
<br/>portion – 82.1 per cent of our forest area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second leg of my contribution is the legal framework and I thank the honourable Acting 
<br/>Prime Minister’s contribution that we would need specialised lawyers to take on this task.  However, 
<br/>Sir, the Forest Bill 2016 (Bill No.13 of 2016) which is a review of the Forest Act 1992 was tabled in 
<br/>this Parliament and also presented to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources in 2016.  The 
<br/></span><span>Bill is the outcome of several stakeholder consultations with a view of revising the 1992 Forest Act 
<br/></span><span>as  approved  by  Cabinet  to  include  recent  developments  within  the  forest  sector,  in  addition  to 
<br/>supporting the full implementation of the Fiji Forest Policy 2007.  It is sad that the Forest Bill is  yet 
<br/>to be passed by Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I reiterate my earlier call this week that all Ministries would need the necessary legal 
<br/>framework to enhance service delivery.  I, therefore, call upon the line Minister to, please, reintroduce 
<br/>the Forest Bill in this august Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I also would like to pay tribute to my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tauvu, </span><span>the late former Minister for Forestry, Mr. Osea Naiqamu, and I pray that he rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my intervention is going to be very short.  I just wanted to ask if the Acting 
<br/>Prime Minister as Acting Line Minister for Forestry, could explain the logic of an Annual Report 
<br/>being split into two.  The Committee has reviewed the Ministry’s 2006 Annual Report for January 
<br/>to July, but I am just wondering when we are going to be debating the latter part of the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture as well, perhaps the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological 
<br/></span><span>Services, Lands and Mineral Resources ought to talk to his colleagues in Cabinet to stop meandering 
<br/></span><span>on  reports  that  have  a  legislative  timeline  obligations  in  this  House.    Further,  Mr.  Speaker,    the 
<br/>honourable Minister loves to stand up and talk about meandering, even though he meandered about 
<br/>Rwanda and somewhere else, while the rest of us listening were convinced that he actually lost his 
<br/>own marbles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Fiji prepares to welcome the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, 
<br/>this weekend, I hope the honourable  Minister for Fisheries, the honourable Minister for Defence, 
<br/>National  Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management, 
<br/>honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources and 
<br/>the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs have been  useful in Cabinet and ensuring that 
<br/>the period of the Acting Prime Minister which the Gazette Notice says ends tomorrow, 11th February, 
<br/>has been duly approved by them as Cabinet Ministers and gazetted properly, not retrospectively as 
<br/>has been the habit, so that when Mr. Blinken arrives in Fiji, he is accorded the due respect he deserves, 
<br/>and dialogues and equal footing with an Acting Prime Minister backed by a Gazette Notice that is in 
<br/>effect on Saturday, 12th February, 2022.

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Page  No.  9  of  the  Ministry’s  Annual  Report  is  quite  amusing.  
<br/>Unfortunately, the Ministry has wasted a whole page with a blown up pie diagram, highlighting how 
<br/>many garlands or </span><span>salusalu</span><span> the honourable Minister received for opening events and making speeches 
<br/>and how many Parliamentary statements was made by him.  This is no joke! Yet for January to July, 
<br/>there was only one Cabinet submission on wood biomass for energy and export.  What about the 
<br/>people, Acting Prime Minister, since you are the Acting line Minister for the second last day, how 
<br/>do the </span><span>salusalu </span><span>or garlands improve people’s lives?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The remainder of the Annual Report, Mr. Speaker, is quite informative.  However, while the 
<br/>Ministry  puts  an  effort  on  logging,  there  is  also  a  lot  of  attention  paid  towards  nurseries,  seed 
<br/>collection and distribution, monitoring control and surveillance, research and development projects 
<br/>on trials, plots and pest and disease surveys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite noticeable that the Annual Report espouse on its REDD+ efforts.  As this House 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will know, the NFP has shared many views on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  that  is  understandable,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  urge  the  Ministry  to  remember  that 
<br/>globally-prioritised initiatives like REDD+ will only have global resources available for a certain 
<br/></span><span>amount of time.  After the project or readiness period ends, it falls back on the taxpayers to pay for.  
<br/></span><span>So while the World Bank is here right now, the ownership of REDD+ initiatives must be sustainable, 
<br/>even after the project ends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turning to the Committee’s Report, I note that they had three recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  increase  the  Ministry’s  contribution  to  GDP,  the  Ministry  encourages  millers  to 
<br/>achieve the production target set by the Ministry of Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  purpose  of  protecting  the  environment,  the  Ministry  should  ensure  proper 
<br/>monitoring  of  river  banks  and  other  buffer  zones  during  clear  felling  and  selective 
<br/>logging. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Ministry employs a legal officer that will review and fast-track laws, for example, 
<br/>Forest Bill No. 13 of 2016 and we have heard that mentioned here tonight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  note  here  that  these  recommendations  showcase  the  balancing  act  for  the  Ministry.  But 
<br/>hopefully, in light of the rampant flooding and extensive of road damages that we have seen in the 
<br/></span><span>past few weeks, more hardy trees are going to be researched and planted by the Ministry and that 
<br/></span><span>perhaps, sold to FRA to help deal with the excessive moisture content in the soil during heavy rainfall. 
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  contribute  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion and I also pay tribute, to our colleague, the late honourable Osea Naiqamu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was Minister for Forests for about 12 months way back in 2013 and on 
<br/>few occasions, I have acted as well on Prime Minister’s portfolio and I am well aware of most of the 
<br/>issues in the forest sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me thank the Committee and also thank the Ministry of Forestry for the good work that 
<br/>they are doing.  Although there are a lot of challenges, environmental issues and some issues within 
<br/>the industry, however, I can confidentially say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they are doing an excellent job 
<br/>for us in  looking after our forests and most importantly, in the  regulatory role because of the laws 
<br/>associated  with  the  forest  that  come  under  their  portfolio.    This  is  an  extractive  industry  and

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>711  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sustainability is something that we need to seriously consider and, of course, what we have continued 
<br/>to deplete over the years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me start with honourable Saukuru.  Of course, let us not be deceived by the native species 
<br/>and  the  forest  cover  it  provides  -  25,520.8  cubic  metres  which  covers  about  11  .3  per  cent.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I remembered when I was in Forestry way back in 2013, there was a request that came 
<br/>from the saw millers of Fiji, that is, if we can reduce the diametreof logs (native species) so that they 
<br/>can continue.  We stopped that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of the sustainability of the industry in the 
<br/>long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those of you who know Vanua Levu, when Fiji Forest Industries (FFI) left, that was signal 
<br/>to all Fijians that almost nothing was left.  We have a big mill there now that was designed for veneer 
<br/>sawmilling  and  then  Valebasoga  Tropik  Board  came  along  as  well.    But  they  have  to  stop  the 
<br/>operations there and just shipped the logs across to Lautoka because they no longer have what was 
<br/>supposed to be milled at that facility.  That is the story about this.  As I have stated, it is an extractive 
<br/>industry and depleting stock is what we have right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have an over-reliance now on plantations - pine and mahogany. That is the reality now.  
<br/></span><span>There is a huge challenge for us, particularly, with native species, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because these 
<br/></span><span>native species take ages.  Unfortunately, the logging that has taken place over the years, as I have 
<br/>mentioned, we have to stop the reduction of the diameter of the logs because we need to keep it for 
<br/>the various reasons, apart from the economic benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our forest is so important to our food security, our water sources and to the living organisms 
<br/>that are there.  There are so many benefits of  forests and in reality, it is a challenge because when it 
<br/>comes to sustainable development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and let us be honest with this, it is not only the 
<br/>economic benefits.  We have to be aware of the social implications and we have to be aware of the 
<br/>sustainability requirements as well.  So that is the reality, particularly with native species.  We love 
<br/>to but, unfortunately, there is not much left now for Fiji.  Perhaps, that will be a challenge for us into 
<br/>the future as well, when we start with the deforestation programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To make it worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those two companies, and I am speaking in particular 
<br/>because  there  was  a  lot  of  forest  cover  in  Vanua  Levu,  they  had  concessions.    The  FFI  had 
<br/>concessions  and  honourable  Bulanauca  knows  this  very  well,  Valebasoga  Tropik  Wood  also  has 
<br/>concessions.  Even in Wainunu, they want to use some of their land for agriculture purposes, but it 
<br/>is the concession that is still valid that restricts them from utilising those resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FFI did leave the country after they took all the cream of the native logs in 
<br/>Fiji and then we had the concessions again.  But we know that they are big employment providers 
<br/>for Vanua Levu because in Labasa alone, it is FSC, FFI and Valebasoga Tropik Wood that employ 
<br/>majority of the people and keep the economy running in Labasa, apart from the others, and of course, 
<br/>FSC as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is the story about native species. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue about the Fiji Pine Trust Board, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is more than that, honourable 
<br/>Gavoka.  We value our landowners.  Of course, we have to make sure and because of the role they 
<br/>play, we need to maintain that healthy relationship with them.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a lot 
<br/>of issues with respect to the former Minister, perhaps, that is also a case that is under investigation 
<br/>because there were some issues with the Board.  There were some debts that were created by the 
<br/>Board and they came back to Fiji Pine Limited and wanted Fiji Pine Limited to clear off the debts 
<br/>they accumulated because some of the businesses they invested in, failed.  But I would rather leave 
<br/>it at that, it is more than what we have heard from the honourable Gavoka.

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are fully aware of what is going on between Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Pine Trust and the 
<br/>Boards.  Let me say that Vimal, the current CEO, is doing an excellent job in trying to ensure that 
<br/>we maintain that relationship, together with his Operations Officer, Mr. Asesela Wata.  So, that is 
<br/>the story behind the Fiji Pine Limited and the Board as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me conclude my contribution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by saying that, particularly, to us, the 
<br/>landowners, it is about our responsibility when we are looking at our future and for the generations 
<br/>that will come.  Let us not be deceived by the economic benefits only, because it is not only for our 
<br/>environment,  it  is  not  only  for  our  food  security,  it  is  not  only  for  our  water  resources,  but  most 
<br/>importantly, it is for the benefit of Fiji and our generations in years to come.  Perhaps, that will always 
<br/>remain  as  a  challenge  for  us  in  the  Ministry  and  the  whole  of  society  because  we  need  to  have 
<br/>sustainable  development  that  fulfils  all  the  three  main  pillars;  economic,  environmental  and 
<br/>sustainability so that we can be in a better position to look at the industry and see how it contributes 
<br/>not only to the economy but also to the wellbeing of every Fijian. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee and the Ministry of Forestry. There is a lot that we need to do together 
<br/>and I hope that with the directions that the Ministry is taking, together with the key stakeholders, we 
<br/>should be able to achieve it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I also want to pay tribute to the late 
<br/>Honourable Osea Naiqamu who has passed away. We thank him for his involvement in the Fiji Pine 
<br/>Trust and also in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Ministry for the researchers, educational training, conservation activities on the 
<br/>parks, nature and native forests and also pine achievements which is good.  I have a few comments, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly on the recommendation that the mills has to achieve targets and this 
<br/>needs encouragement and support from the Government and also from the Ministry, technical people 
<br/>concerned particularly to increase the recovery rate of the timber coming out of every log. At the 
<br/>moment it is very low, from 42 per cent to 45 percent and up to 50 per cent; that is low.  We need to 
<br/>increase the recovery rate within the mills and they need to be assisted on what type of, it is technical 
<br/>but  it is  important  to  increase  that  recovery  rate  so  that  we  can  have  more  products  to  sell.   The 
<br/>Ministry has qualified people there too and encourage the millers to comply with or be encourage to 
<br/>drive with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  on  the  recommendation  of  coastal  rivers,  streams  banks  and  buffer  zones  as  already 
<br/>emphasised.  It is important particularly in the plantation forest when they do harvest, they plant and 
<br/></span><span>they also harvest right up to the river banks. Under the lease conditions and development conditions, 
<br/></span><span>we do not have to plant or particularly harvest right down to river bank. You have leave 20 feet for 
<br/>the buffer zone on either sides. You need monitoring and compliance of the development conditions 
<br/>and  also  lease  conditions  or  licence  condition  to  be  in  place  and  practical  right  in  the  field,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  It is important to keep our coastal and river banks in good hands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also on agriculture.  A lot of farmers are planting right down to the river banks.  It is important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the leave 20 feet on river banks to protect our rivers and streams and also our coastlines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Forest Bill (Bill No. 13 of 2016) is still pending and still there. We are still emphasising, 
<br/>from the Ministry’s point of view, we need to have this Bill formulised, passed in Parliament so that 
<br/>they  can  go  and  increase  the  ways  they  can  produce  or  perform  at  their  field  level.    Not  only  in 
<br/>fisheries, forestry, agriculture and all the archaic legislation are held up there.  Why not introduce as 
<br/>S0 51 and we deal with it because this will help with the production out here particularly for economic 
<br/>ministries such as forestry.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>713  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic  figures,  it  is  important  that  we  have  economic  figures  properly  laid  out  in  the 
<br/>annual reports and the production contribution to GDP export, import, value adding, balance of trade 
<br/>and the economics ministry and economic performance is paramount for 2018-2019 report which we 
<br/>have not gone through is not quite clear there, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would not go into detail, just a summary of the production.  For native from 2009 
<br/>is 59,614 cubic metres, 2017-2018 which is beyond this report is 39,242 cubic metres. In 2016, it is 
<br/>only 25,521 cubic metres because that is only seven months, we can accept that.   But for per year, 
<br/>59,614 cubic metres in 2009 cubic metres, down to 39,242 cubic metres in 2017-2018, the production 
<br/>is down.  You can accept the explanation already made by honourable Minister for Defence, National 
<br/>Security and Policing, Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management but there should 
<br/>be ways and means to increase the production into the future, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pine in 2009 was 249,769 cubic metres production down to 172,473 cubic metres in 2016 and 
<br/>that  is  for  seven  months  only,  so  you  take  away  that  part.    But  in  2017-2018  it is  395,276  cubic 
<br/>metres.  Pine is performing well Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I see the figures here.  Even though it only got 
<br/>172,000  cubic  metres  for  seven  months  in  2016  it  bounced  back  in  2016-2017  to  192,385  cubic 
<br/>metres then bounce right back to 395,270 cubic metres in 2017-2018.  That to me is good, sometimes 
<br/></span><span>you are hit and you can bounce back particularly in the plantation such as pine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In mahogany in 2009 63,758 cubic metres and it rose to 93,748 cubic metres in 2011 then it 
<br/>dropped to 2,000 cubic metres in 2016-2017 to 15,646 cubic metres to 17,000 cubic metres in 2016 
<br/>which is the subject of this report which is seven months we can accept that but 2016-2017 it dropped 
<br/>to 15,646 and again to 2017-2018 right down to 11,285.  So, it is a drop of production from let us say 
<br/>63,000 cubic metres instead of 93,000 cubic metres right down to 11,000 cubic metres  - that is a 
<br/>marked drop particularly for plantation and the best plantation in the world is mahogany. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know how many will come in 2018-2019 maybe 16,000 cubic metres, or a little bit 
<br/>up but the mahogany is not performing well.  It is important to look at that area and ensure that they 
<br/>perform to lead the Fiji Hardwood Corporation who is in charge here Mr. Speaker, Sir and it is under 
<br/>the Mahogany Industry Council in the Prime Ministers’ office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On export Mr. Speaker, Sir, the best export is by Fiji Pine and native timber and mahogany 
<br/>export are hiding behind Fiji Pine’s performance.  So, in the Annual Reports we need to have separate 
<br/>records of exports from native timber, pine and mahogany so that it is clear to us who is performing 
<br/>well, who is not then we can point out where to improve or how to improve.  It is important to separate 
<br/></span><span>the performance by species. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For export, Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly I do not have the figures for native timber but for 
<br/>mahogany  it  dropped  from  $38  million  to  $6  million.    That  is  very  bad  record  or  hardwood  for 
<br/>mahogany. So, it is important that the Mahogany Industry Council and Fiji Hardwood Corporation 
<br/>to look at how to improve their performance in order to rake in the foreign exchange that we need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Fiji Pine Limited as I had already mentioned, gain we need to help the 
<br/>landowners  as already highlighted by our Party Leader that we need to look at how to improve the 
<br/>businesses  within  the  pine  industry.    If  there  are  some  problems  there  you  have  to  come  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs or the Ministry of Forestry or Fiji Pine Limited to help them get up again.  
<br/>It is always important to know how our localisation for landowners are going on because in the capital 
<br/>structure that was made, there is supposed to be a 50:50 of local and others in the management level 
<br/>by 2016. I do not know whether that has been achieved or not.

<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in the same capital structure plan for 2023 or 2025, the pine industry to be reverted to 
<br/>the landowners and they should have paid the cost for establishment of $69 million to Government 
<br/>by that time.  It is important to find out where we are and where the landowners are heading. I hope 
<br/>it is on target for reversion of the pine industry to landowners by 2023 or 2025.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those comments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to make but to thank you 
<br/>for  allowing  me.    The  performance  of  mahogany  is  very  low,  Sir,  so  it  is  important  that  people 
<br/>concerned  or  the  organisation  concerned  should  look  at  the  ways  and  means  of  improving  their 
<br/>performance and production.  Thank you, Sir, I support.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not take too long.  I thank the Committee that 
<br/>did the work on this particular Report.  It is just that a number of things that I appreciate about this 
<br/>particular Report.  Firstly is the recommendation for the purpose of protecting the environment.  The 
<br/>Ministry is to ensure proper monitoring of river banks and other buffer zones during clear-felling and 
<br/>selective logging, and I think honourable Bulanauca talked about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that we have especially in the provision of water, now when you extract 
<br/>water from rivers, Waimanu for instance, whenever there is heavy rain, the place just gets flooded.  
<br/></span><span>There is a lot of siltation and we have the problem of pulling water out.  I think this is a reflection 
<br/></span><span>not only in the way that we have been cutting down trees, it is also a reflection of the fact that people 
<br/>are now habitating or living in places where people do not used to live - upstream. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of these are not very good agricultural practices and the practice of felling a lot of trees is 
<br/>not only having an impact on soil erosion, it is in turn having an impact on the quality of water we 
<br/>are able to extract out of rivers, especially for supply into the greater Suva area. So, that is something 
<br/>that we really appreciate, that particular recommendation and I hope that it can be strengthened right 
<br/>throughout the country, not only for the felling of trees and the felling of forests but also agricultural 
<br/>practices and good drainage practices because it will help us to ensure that we can provide good water 
<br/>in the way that WAF extracts water from rivers that we have.  We have slight rain now and it is all 
<br/>dirty water and that is going to clog up our pumps and at the end of the day when the pumps get 
<br/>clogged up, it is difficult to get the water into the reservoir which affects water supply across the 
<br/>greater Suva area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands has been involved also in terms of the mahogany plantations and we 
<br/>have a big exercise going on, to survey all the mahogany plantations.  The mahogany plantations 
<br/>have been in place but the survey has not been done well.  Now, the Ministry of Lands is doing this 
<br/></span><span>to try to make sure that the landowning units are well aware of their boundaries so that they can get 
<br/></span><span>their  appropriate  lease  money  paid  to  them  and  at  the  same  time,  it  protects  the  company  that  is 
<br/>paying, the Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited in terms of the leases so hopefully this kind of work 
<br/>that is being done at the Ministry of Lands will help this sector to grow into the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  few  points  just  to  reiterate  what  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Defence  mentioned  about  Fiji  Pine,  unfortunately,  honourable  Gavoka 
<br/>seems to have been swayed by about four or five people, who painted an entire wrong picture of what 
<br/>is happening.  In fact, the level of consent that the landowners have given in the recent past, in fact, 
<br/>has been quite overwhelming.  The person that honourable Gavoka is talking about has very small 
<br/>percentage of land that is currently leased.  One of them held the position of CEO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of them held the position of CEO in the Trust without an employment 
<br/>contract  and without the approval of the Board of Trustees.  He also held the position of Trustee 
<br/>Chair of the Board, he himself appointed himself to the Fiji Pine Limited Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="115">Page 115</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Department of Forestry Jan-July 2016 A/Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>715  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Trust’s Rules, Mr. Speaker, state and does not allow a person to hold the three positions 
<br/>concurrently.  A person cannot hold a position of Trustee for two consecutive terms of three years 
<br/>(unfortunately this person did). A number of his family members were employed at the Trust.  The 
<br/>Pine Trust did not produce audited financials for a number of years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can go on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I even got here testimonials from people in Wairiki (</span><span>Tui 
<br/>Wairiki)</span><span> where they are asking as to what has happened to the benefits they are receiving which, in 
<br/>fact, they have not received from the Trust itself.  Before honourable Gavoka comes to Parliament 
<br/>and paints a different picture, he really should get the full picture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  even  people  in  Tau,  Bavu,  Emuri  and  even  Navutu  have  all  given  their 
<br/>support  to  what  is  happening  and  the  people  in  Navala  have  even  given  up  their  private  pine 
<br/>plantation to work together with Tropik Woods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua had asked why January to July only.  That is when the financial 
<br/>year changed, that is why you see that it is for six months.  It is interesting the Cabinet Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers she singled out.  She did not singled out the other Cabinet Ministers and saying, 
<br/>“I hope they have given their consent for the Acting Prime Minister.”  I just want to let her know, the 
<br/></span><span>appointment of an Acting Minister or Acting Prime Minister is the prerogative of the Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>himself.    He  informs  His  Excellency  the  President,  who  then  issues  you  a  letter  for  your  acting 
<br/>appointment.  That is how it works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the forestry sector, the honourable Minister for Defence, National 
<br/>Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management,  of  course, 
<br/>mentioned a number of things in particular, the indigenous species, et cetera.  Honourable Saukuru 
<br/>talked about  the potential in  the indigenous species  and what  we can do.    It  goes  to  show a very 
<br/>fundamental way of thinking that it is not in alignment with modern day thinking about forestry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  approved  the  Climate  Change  Act,  we  talked  about  carbon  trading  and  in  that 
<br/>presentation, we mentioned that in Fiji, indeed, not with many other countries of the world, we only 
<br/>seem to value or give an added value in terms of its value to our GDP, only when trees are cut down.  
<br/>We only value trees in terms of the monetary value only when they are cut down.  The new way of 
<br/>thinking, Sir, is that you need to value the trees when they are actually in the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember honourable Saukuru stood up and said, “Are we now going to charge people for 
<br/>breathing oxygen? God has given us oxygen.”  He had the wrong end of the stick.  Carbon trading 
<br/></span><span>means is that people who own the land on which the forest is planted or is there naturally, actually 
<br/></span><span>get rewarded for keeping those trees in the ground.  That is the business, that is what you call ‘offsets’, 
<br/>because it sucks in carbon dioxide from the air and spews out oxygen; fundamental basis.  He does 
<br/>not understand that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to look at the offset market - enormous potential. One of the very 
<br/>few settler countries in the world where 91 per cent of the land is owned by the indigenous population.  
<br/>Vast tracts of land in Fiji are still under forestry.  It also does not mean that you have to have wild 
<br/>forest or just indigenous species.  You can have good forest management practices for which you 
<br/>will also be rewarded.  You can also go out and plant for which you will also be rewarded.  There is 
<br/>actually a value to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned in the Report too, we have a current agreement 
<br/>with the Emission Reduction Programme with the World Bank Forest-Carbon Partnership Facility.  
<br/>This is basically a precursor.  It is about to end soon about two years or so which will then mean that

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will be able to get some good pricing in the market and then through the facility that is actually 
<br/>provided under the Climate Change Act, Sir, we will actually be able to do carbon trading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last weekend someone from the Sabeto area (landowning unit) sent me a text message saying, 
<br/>“Please come and speak to us because we want to understand about carbon trading.”   I have heard 
<br/>about three people in three landowning groups that are wanting to talk to us about carbon trading and 
<br/>trying to position themselves.  So they know what to do when they are able to participate  in this 
<br/>particular growing sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also want to highlight, as we mentioned in the eulogy 
<br/>for the late honourable Naiqamu was that, he visited over 300 villages in the initiative that NFP has 
<br/>questioned about whether we actually planted 8 million trees or not.  Our target is to plant 30 million 
<br/>trees in 15 years.  Already 8 million trees have, in fact, been planted, Sir, and this initiative is working 
<br/>well.  Companies like Fiji Airways, every time its plane take off anywhere in the world, they plant a 
<br/>tree, that is their commitment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only about planting trees in what we call, a sort of terrestrial areas 
<br/>but is also in the foreshore areas.  Things like mangroves need to be added to the stock of the trees 
<br/></span><span>that we do plant because it is not only about protecting the shoreline but as we know, mangroves, in 
<br/></span><span>fact, have a high level of sequestration. In other words, it can suck in more carbon dioxide than the 
<br/>trees on a hill.  We need to look at forestry from that perspective.  It does not necessarily mean that 
<br/>we will, therefore, not have any deforestation, but it must be done in a sustainable manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is, of course, a lot of illegal operations that does take place.  Even in Vanua Levu, we 
<br/>did find that out. The Ministry of Forestry is working with organisations, like FRCS in terms of trying 
<br/>to track down those illegal operations too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  highlight  also  that  the  Ministry  has  launched  an  online 
<br/>licensing system in 2020 where import and export licences can be facilitated within 24 hours to 48 
<br/>hours.  A similar online licensing system for harvesting is also being developed and is targeted to be 
<br/>completed in this financial year.  These innovative measures, Sir, will address the Ease of Doing 
<br/>Business and economic growth but a new norm since the introduction of online, the Ministry has 
<br/>facilitated over a 200 export licences which fetched over $56.7 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not want to elaborate any further.  There are a lot details available and 
<br/>the Ministry of Forestry is doing a lot of public relations work in this respect.  Honourable Bulanauca 
<br/></span><span>talked  about  Fiji  Hardwood  Corporation  Limited  (FHCL)  and  mahogany  plantations,  there  is 
<br/></span><span>obviously a lot of work being done in that space.  As I had mentioned a couple days ago, the FHCL 
<br/>has  basically  managed  to  get  almost  all  its  debt  off  its  books.    Honourable  Bulanauca,  you  will 
<br/>remember when you were fairly active, there was a dead stock of around $27 million or so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to also thank the Ministry for their work.  A few years ago we 
<br/>started, and it is now a regular feature where we actually allocated specific value or dollars in the 
<br/>budget for nurseries for indigenous timber because we saw that the indigenous timber is very much 
<br/>in demand.  </span><span>Vesi</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>for example, I know is highly sought after and used.  It is very expensive, therefore, 
<br/>it  is  very  attractive  to  cut  down.  This  is  why  under  the  Bainimarama-led  Government,  we  have 
<br/>decided to start nurseries for indigenous species and that will be the focus in the future too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I would like to thank the Committee for their work.  My observation, again, you 
<br/>do not need an in-house lawyer employed, you need the specialist to do the work and I am sure with 
<br/></span></div>
