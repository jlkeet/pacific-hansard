<div><span>Reform – Local Government Act 1972 
<br/>(Question No. 32/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  inform  Parliament  what  steps  have  been  taken  so  far  to  achieve  the 
<br/>critical reforms of the Local Government Act 1972?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government has sanctioned a reform of 
<br/>the Local Government Act as a whole.  The first area of reform involved merging the two types of 
<br/>local government of the past into one.  That is, the former Rural Local Authorities were abolished 
<br/>and key functions given to the Municipal Councils.  This was done in 2018 where the Government 
<br/>provided funding for the provision of allocated services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to highlight that this exercise is extremely important.  There was 
<br/>a three-member Committee appointed at one time to review the functions and the work of Municipal 
<br/>Councils, and it was found that some Municipal Councils were kept smaller, out of fear that political 
<br/>control would be lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the other problem was that there was no boundary extension, so peri-urban areas did 
<br/>not develop the way they should have.  Haphazard development was seen in the peri-urban areas.  
<br/>Now, with the inclusion of the rural local area boundary into Municipal Council, the Council is able 
<br/>to monitor the development in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second area of reform is the review of the municipal services with an aim to promote 
<br/>ease of doing business.  This has seen the removal of the Businesses Licencing Act which has reduced 
<br/>administration loading on Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third area of reform was the change in the fiscal year of the Councils from the calendar

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third area of reform was the change in the fiscal year of the Councils from the calendar 
<br/>year  to  the  Government  financial  year.    This  was  to  ensure  consistency  and  uniformity  with  the 
<br/>national fiscal policies, which allow better monitoring of projects from planning to completion in 
<br/>line with the Fiji Government’s Budget announcement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  are  legislations  that  have  an  impact  on  the  review  of  the  Local 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Act 1972.  These legislations are currently being reviewed and includes, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Health Act; 
<br/>Town Planning Act; and  
<br/>Subdivision of Lands Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reforms of the Local Government Act could not be done without reviewing the Town 
<br/>Planning Act and the Subdivision of Lands Act, because these legislations govern the operations of 
<br/>the  Council’s  services.    For  example,  the  application  for  buildings,  subdivision  and  rezoning  are 
<br/>processed at the Municipal Councils before it is forwarded to the Department of Town and Country 
<br/>Planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  had  mentioned  earlier  in  this  House,  the  review  of  Town  Planning  Act  and  the 
<br/>Subdivision of Lands Act was completed and discussions are going on with the Solicitor-General’s 
<br/>Office.  So there is a draft legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been carrying out gradual reforms to the Local Government 
<br/>Act  and  the  system  and  processes  of  Municipal  Councils.    These  changes  are  fundamental  and 
<br/>necessary to make Municipal Councils efficient and effective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review of the Local Government Act requires new scoping, given the new framework of 
<br/>the Local Government operations with the inclusion of the rural local area.  It is significant to note 
<br/>that the Ministry has prepared a background or issues paper to guide the drafting of Cabinet paper to 
<br/>further  reform  the  Local  Government  Act.  In  addition  a  Terms  of  Reference  for  the  Local 
<br/>Government Act Review Committee has been prepared and provides the Scope of Work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the background paper and the Terms of Reference, the Ministry 
<br/>develop a draft cabinet paper that will require cabinet endorsement prior to undertaking this exercises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has proposed process in relation to this review: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>We need to look at key strategic and policy based issues on what a Local Government is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expected to do, how it should be structure to do this. 
<br/> What are the right governance and management structures that should be in place and what 
<br/>mechanisms should be in place to monitor performance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>We also need to review international good practices for relevant to Fiji and the second phase 
<br/>will  encompass  capturing  the  views  of  all  stakeholders  through  comprehensive  public 
<br/>consultations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  just  a  supplementary  question  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been led to believe or been told that there have been some problems in the processing 
<br/>of payments in Municipal Councils because Councils now need to send a payment requirements to 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry for processing an approval and this is causing delay in payments and it is even causing 
<br/></span><span>delay in the salary of staff. Is the honourable Minister aware of that or maybe she could explain that.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>719  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister., you have the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am not aware of the fact that the staff 
<br/>were not paid as far as I know the payment were made to staff. The only thing I am aware of is one 
<br/>service provider was not paid on time simply because one had to assess the work that he done. So, 
<br/>that took a bi t of time but other than that all the approvals or signing of the cheques is done by the 
<br/>Acting Permanent Secretary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>High Risk Water and Sanitation Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 33/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing, 
<br/>Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on 
<br/>the progress of the High Risk Water and Sanitation Programme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  Honourable 
<br/></span><span>Member for the question and I would like to keep it as brief as possible. But Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is 
<br/></span><span>a new programme. New allocation to the Ministry of Rural Development and Disaster Management 
<br/>and of course we wish to thank the Government particularly the leadership of the Honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This allocation reaffirms the commitment of Government to ensure that the living standards 
<br/>and the wellbeing of our rural Fijians are improved and of course it also firms the match that we do 
<br/>care and we will continue to look after them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this whole programme is about two things: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Giving our people clean drinking water; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Health issues that they face.  So it is about high risk water and high risk sanitation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just define High Risk Water.  It refers to water source that are considered high risk in 
<br/>which water is obtained from surface.  Water that is untreated which includes spring water that is 
<br/>unprotected and untreated and water from the well that are protected unprotected to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will give you an example, in Kumi Village, Sir, where I come from. We had our pipe system 
<br/></span><span>done way back in the 1960 but till today the water that we are drinking comes straights from the dam 
<br/>into the taps.  That is high risk, Mr. Speaker, Sir but we are still healthy.  No problem in Tailevu, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I can see that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Sanitation,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  mainly  related  to 
<br/>diarrhoea and, of course, typhoid and we have issues about dengue and sometimes leptospirosis as 
<br/>well but when it comes to high risk sanitation, the focus is mainly on typhoid and diarrhoea.  Why 
<br/>did we go into this programme?  Because the allocation on self-help which is for social and economic 
<br/>projects are although limited, there is a big chunk of that allocation that goes to water projects and 
<br/>sanitation projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir, averaging of around $0.7 million or $700,000 in a year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For example, in the last five years for these projects alone we have used about $3.5 million 
<br/>out of the self-help allocation and we presented the case to Government based on the data that we 
<br/>have, identifying the communities and of course we are thankful that we were given $750,000 in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="120">Page 120</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2020-2021 Budget.  That was given to the Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services 
<br/>and again very lately we have $500,000 allocated in the current Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, very briefly in terms of the identification, there is a Committee I will not go into the detail 
<br/>made up of the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Infrastructure, Water Authority of Fiji and Ministry 
<br/>of Rural Development and of course they look after the allocation and the communities that have 
<br/>been identified.  But very briefly in terms of the first ten projects that were identified, is Naqia Village 
<br/>in  Tailevu,  Naboutini  Village  in  Serua,  Dawasamu  Secondary  School  again  in  Tailevu,  Tavuki 
<br/>Village  in  Kadavu,  Nagadoa  Village  in  Bua,  Natewa  Village  in  Cakaudrove,  Namada  Village  in 
<br/>Nadroga, Saioko Village, Ra, Wainilotulevu in Namosi and Nasovatava in Nadroga, Navosa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And out of those already identified, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have four that have been completed 
<br/>out of the ten that includes the two from Tailevu, in Naqia in Dawasamu nothing to do with me, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, but one from Serua in Naboutini and one from Nadroga.  We are thankful to the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy because Water Authority had a lot of challenges last year after </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana, 
<br/></span><span>the  allocation  remained  with  Water  Authority  despite  the  end  of  the  financial  year,  so  that  the 
<br/>remaining six projects identified can continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms of sanitation out of that allocation, eight communities were identified including 
<br/></span><span>Dogusu and Qara Settlements in Ba, Nadave Settlement in Macuata, Korovou Village in Naitasiri, 
<br/>Wainaloka in Ovalau, Nukuilau Village in Nadroga, Navosa and Nuku Village in Moala.  That was 
<br/>for the allocation in the 2020-2021 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for the $500,000 for the current financial year, very briefly, very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>for the communities that have been identified  - Naiyaca in  Savatu,  Ba,  Tonuve and Namataku in 
<br/>Navosa,  Nacavanadi  in  Gau,  Beqa,  Yanuca  in  Raviravi,  Beqa,  Qelemumumu  in  Labasa  and  Lea 
<br/>Village in Navatu, Cakaudrove.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is high risk water and high risk sanitation that have already been identified, we have two 
<br/>in  the  Central  Division,  six  in  the  Eastern  Division,  two  in  the  Northern  Division  and  15  in  the 
<br/>Western Division but those that are considered early for this includes Kabisi and Naikeli Settlements 
<br/>in  Malomalo,  Nadroga,  Navosa,  Domokavu  Village  in  Vaturova,  Cakaudrove,  Mataso  Village, 
<br/>Sanima in Kadavu and Nasaibitu Village in Nayavu, Tailevu.  I will stop there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>unless there are any further questions.

<div><span>Agricultural Assistance on Farms 
<br/></span><span>(Question No.34/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  implementation  of  the  Agricultural  Assistance  on  Farm  Response 
<br/>Package, Home Gardening Seed Packages and Improvement of Farm Genetic attributes 
<br/>as part of the COVID-19 Response? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  member  for  asking  this 
<br/>question. The farm response and the home gardening seed packages started in March 2020. On this 
<br/>note, I would like to thank the Government of India that provided us with 6.9 tonne of dry seeds that 
<br/>supported our farm response programme. In addition to that, the COVID-19 response budget we had 
<br/>received $1 million from the Ministry of Economy to support these two programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="121">Page 121</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>721  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, till date- from 30</span><span>th</span><span> March 2020, we have distributed seed packages to about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>218,719,020 households. Each of this package consists five or six crop seeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year following TC </span><span>Cody </span><span>- we have distributed this home gardening seed 
<br/>packages to 20,000 households. In addition to that, we have supported a large number of farmers 
<br/>with respect to provisional planting materials- whether it is dry seeds or green planting material.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These programmes are continuing in the farm response package that the farmers are getting 
<br/>the  planting  materials,  8000  farmers  have  been  supported  since  March  2020.  On  the  part  of  the 
<br/>question we regard to the improvement of Farm Genetic Attributes- whether it is crop or livestock. 
<br/>This  is  an  ongoing  programme.  We  have  our  research  division  which  is  undertaking  continuous 
<br/>research. We have released new varieties for the crop, whether it is </span><span>dalo</span><span> /pidgin pea  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  continuously  undertaking  seed  purification  of  rice  and  also  other  crops.  We  have 
<br/>released new variety of eggplant, tomatoes and rice. These are undertaken by any country- research 
<br/>has to take place to deal with issues and pesticides diseases that arises as well adaptation to Climate 
<br/>change and come up with high leading varieties.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regard to livestock, again we are very much concerned about the loss of genetic attribute 
<br/></span><span>due to inbreeding. That is one aspect we are dealing with by providing them with breeders whether 
<br/>it is poultry, sheep, goat as well as the cattle. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these programmes are continuously 
<br/>on going and we are supporting our farmers to improve Genetic material.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assisting Women – Agriculture Sector 
<br/>(Question No. 35/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  inform 
<br/>Parliament on how the Ministry is supporting women engaged in the Agriculture sector?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  I    would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  asking  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry f Agriculture values the contribution of women in this sector 
<br/>and it is clearly highlighted in our five-year Strategic Development Plan.  By recognising women’s 
<br/></span><span>involvement in the sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last census that we undertook, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/></span><span>have a separate volume which deals with where this entire census has undertaken general analysis 
<br/>based on gender, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so that we can look at how we can have targeted measures to 
<br/>develop and support women farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the gender analysis report provides a platform that identifies vulnerability 
<br/>and exposes hidden trends that can help establish new policies which could be targeted to assist them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  found  that  47  percent  of  the  households  that  are  engaged  in 
<br/>agriculture involve women, and 14.4 percent are in fact women-headed households that are engaged 
<br/>in agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  a  long  period  of  time,  annually  the  Ministry  supports  women  in 
<br/>agriculture. There are specific programmes that we assist with in terms of funding and provision of 
<br/>small equipment such as Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO) processing.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the nine programmes that we announced, one programme 
<br/>is specifically targeting women where we have a specific line item allocated.  Under this programme 
<br/>we have assisted 500 women’s groups with respect to materials that be required for the activity that 
<br/>they were engaged in, whether they engaged in a small cottage industry, whether they engaged in 
<br/>nursery, so we provide them with nursery material or they require farm tools for agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall we are very excited that now we have a line item and a specific 
<br/>allocation  - a bumped up allocation and as economy  and budget improves,  we will see a parallel 
<br/>movement in terms of increase the allocation for women engaged in agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Free Education Grant for All Institutions 
<br/>(Question No. 36/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO T.V. KEPA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts,  and  Local 
<br/>Government  update  Parliament  on  the  Free  Education  Grants  for  all  educational 
<br/>institutions during the pandemic? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I also thank honourable Kepa for the 
<br/>question. The Free Education Grant initiative was introduced by the FijiFirst Government in the year 
<br/>2014 to provide accessibility to education for all eligible primary and secondary students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, the Grant was extended to cover all Early Childhood Education (ECE) schools.  This 
<br/>initiative was introduced by the Government to ensure students have access to quality teaching and 
<br/>learning environment.  Since its inception, eight years ago, the Government has invested a total of 
<br/>$565 million in the form of Free Education Grant to 736 primary, 175 secondary and 870-plus ECE 
<br/>schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  Government  has  been  first  to  provide  free  education  to  our 
<br/>Fijian children, contrary to what Mr. Rabuka has been saying.  During his time what he did was he 
<br/>provided  assistance  to  children  who  could  not  afford  to  pay  their  school  fees  but  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government took it as the first Government that made education for ECE right up to secondary school 
<br/>absolutely free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has been allocated Free Education Grant in the sum of $62 million in the current 
<br/></span><span>financial year, despite the pandemic.  The FEG has eased the financial burden on parents, students, 
<br/></span><span>teachers and the school management Committees.  Schools until then, used to engage in fundraising 
<br/>activities to improve educational facilities and to provide teaching resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we find schools with better facilities, such as tiled floors, fans, libraries with books, 
<br/>interactive boards, overhead projectors, computers, smart TVs, internet connectivity, and the list goes 
<br/>on.  Having said these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that schools are at different stages in terms of 
<br/>improving their school facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FEG has ensured that more students regardless of their financial background 
<br/>are  able  to  access  education.    The  Government  assists  approximately  236,000  students  annually 
<br/>through FEG. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in enrolment rates is a clear indication of the benefit of FEG.  In addition to this, 
<br/>our data shows that participation rate of students in the rural and remote areas, as well as enrolment 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>723  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of female students, have also increased.  The ECE Tuition Grant is currently set at $50 per term for 
<br/>each registered five-year old child, who is a Fijian citizen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FEG for Year 1 to Year 13 is provided on a per capita basis with smaller 
<br/>schools  provided  with  a  baseline  or  additional  grant.    The  amount  of  grant  provided  per  student 
<br/>decreases for larger schools with more students on the roll.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FEG amount paid to each school is determined by the number of students on the audited 
<br/>school roll.  During the pandemic, Government continue to provide grants to schools, to ensure that 
<br/>the school’s operational activities are not affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not necessary that schools will receive the same amount of FEG each 
<br/>year, as this depends on number of factors, including students  roll in the previous term and the budget 
<br/>allocations provided for that financial year.   In 2020, despite schools being closed for three months, 
<br/>due  to  first  wave  of  COVID-19,  the  Ministry  released  budgeted  grants  to  all  schools  that  were 
<br/>compliant for all three terms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time in Fiji’s history in 2021, the schools were closed for over 
<br/></span><span>eight months.  Before the second wave of COVID-19 in Term 1, 2021, the Ministry released grants 
<br/></span><span>to all complying school.  In term 2, 2021, when schools were still closed and teachers were at home, 
<br/>the  Ministry  released  full  grant  to  all  the  schools  to  prepare  for  reopening  of  schools  in  the  new 
<br/>normal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that schools meet the COVID-19 Safe School Re-opening Protocol for the safety 
<br/>of  our  children,  the  Ministry  released  a  further  50  percent  grant  to  all  schools  for  Term  3,  2021, 
<br/>despite the schools being closed. The Ministry did this to make sure that school were operational and 
<br/>ready for students.  In Term 3, 2021, the Ministry also cleared outstanding arrears for water bills for 
<br/>87 ECE schools, 70 Primary and 17 Secondary Schools at a cost of $483,000 and unpaid water bills 
<br/>accumulated over many years for the schools.  The Ministry stepped in to pay the water bill arrears 
<br/>to ensure that water, being the basic need is maintained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these payments are being adjusted from the FEG payout.  The Government 
<br/>has also ensued that ancillary staff wages and other operational costs, such as payment of utility bills 
<br/>and  printing  cost  of  worksheets  are  met  during  the  periods  schools  were  closed.    The  Ministry 
<br/>continued to release timely grants to schools, despite false claim that grants are not being paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  facilitate  proper  use  of  grants,  the  Ministry  in  2020  developed  a  School  Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Handbook, which provides guidance for the school on the use of the grants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  Government  recognises  the  importance  of  education  in 
<br/>empowering our nation and for creating a knowledge-based society.  The Government has and will 
<br/>continue to invest in education to secure better future for our children. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for her response. Just in regards to COVID-19, what is the monitoring process that is used 
<br/>by the Ministry to ensure that there is proper utilisation of these funds? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the School Management Handbook provides all the 
<br/>details.  How the schools are monitored in the use of the funds?  When the funds are allocated, it is 
<br/>divided into six parts and the percentages are given.  Besides that, the audited school roll is checked, 
<br/>the bank reconciliation is checked, the grant agreement which the school must have is checked and, 
<br/>obviously, the auditors at the Ministry can audit their accounts when we receive complaints or when

<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we see the bank reconciliation and we suspect something was not right. So that is when we intervene 
<br/>and do all the crosschecks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the sixth Oral Question for today, I have agreed that 
<br/>it would be tied over to tomorrow because the Minister had to leave urgently and she is not here. So 
<br/>we will move on to the seventh Oral Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar Price Increase 
<br/>(Question No. 38/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Acting Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Sugar 
<br/>Industry, Foreign Affairs and  Forestry  inform  Parliament how the recent  sugar price 
<br/>increase  will  impact  stakeholders,  including  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  (FSC), 
<br/>landowners and farmers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I will be a little bit longer than usual, Sir,  because it is a 
<br/></span><span>fairly topical subject and also, of course, the honourable Member,  well,  I have to  thank him for 
<br/></span><span>asking  this  question  has  talked  about  how  it  will  affect  FSC,  the  landowners  and  the  farmers.    I 
<br/>assume landowners meaning, </span><span>itaukei</span><span> landowners of landowning units.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC, like any other business, needs to stay competitive and reinvest in its 
<br/>organisation.  They need sufficient revenue, it is only possible and the prices for the goods that they 
<br/>produce are periodical reviewed and goods are sold at the right price.  Sugar of course, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is subject to price control.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FSC  is  no  different.    It  has  to  have  a  decent  investment  plan  and 
<br/>sufficient  cash to  implement the plan. The  Government  has put  almost  $500 million  in  the sugar 
<br/>industry since 2016 through various subsidies   and various other assistance to farmers directly and 
<br/>indirectly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also, of course, apart from Government funding, we need market driven 
<br/>solutions too.  There is a most suitable way to improve the efficiency at all levels and improvement 
<br/>for upgrading the three sugar mills, is a key priority for FSC.  We know what happen with the Indian 
<br/>upgrade that took place during the Qarase Government, much of it was in fact left idle and did not 
<br/></span><span>take place but the money was actually spent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last time the sugar prices was reviewed was four years ago. The review 
<br/>was conducted in \2017 by the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC). As outlined 
<br/>in the FSC submission to FCCC in June 2021, the company needed to carry out necessary investments 
<br/>in Sugar Mills but requires sufficient cash to implement major upgrading works. So price review is 
<br/>determined to be necessary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  FSC  has  been  hesitant  to  invest  in  its  milling  facilities  given  the 
<br/>shambolic upgrade that took place a few  years ago.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry was aware of 
<br/>sugar, was aware of the recurs for the price review, however, the Ministry does not interfere with the 
<br/>workings of FSC, and of course, its liaisons with FCCC.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FSC wanted 
<br/>an increase of 109 percent or $1.49 per kilogramme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  FCCC  in  fact  approved  an  increase  in  price  of  90  cents  per  kilogramme  of 
<br/>sugar, not the $1.49 that they wanted.  Where will the proceeds go?  All proceeds generated from the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>725  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sale of sugar is shared between the growers and the miller through a 70:30 ratio as stipulated in the 
<br/>Master  Award  and  this  formula  has  remained  there  for  ages.    To  put  it  simply,  it  is  not  the 
<br/>Government that benefits from the price increase, it is the growers.  On an average, the FSC supplies 
<br/>approximately 26,000 tonnes of sugar in the domestic market annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the increase in price, additional revenue of $23.4 million will be generated.  Of this, 
<br/>FSC will receive approximately $7 million which is about 30 percent.  That would be invested in the 
<br/>sugar  mills  and  to  carry  out  other  investments  plans.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  explain  to  the 
<br/>honourable Member and other Members in  Parliament, how the price determination was actually 
<br/>carried out, and FCCC has actually provided this information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole pricing review was conducted over seven months which included 
<br/>for a call for public submissions and a thorough review of the FSC’s financials.  The FCCC consulted 
<br/>members of the public and other relevant stakeholders from the sugar industry. A call went out for 
<br/>submissions through the FCCC website and social media to members of the public to submit their 
<br/>proposals.  This is, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the height of the various variants we had - Delta 
<br/>and the Omicron.  Sir, FCCC received a total of 118 submissions and it then deliberated on the request 
<br/>for price increase, bearing in mind the current market conditions and submissions and decided to set 
<br/></span><span>a new price from 20</span><span>th</span><span> January this year.  I understand only one political party made a submission, 
<br/></span><span>that was the Fiji Labour Party and not NFP or anyone else for that matter in this room. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this process obviously was an independent process and submissions were 
<br/>also made by the Ministry of Sugar objecting to the increase in the sugar price.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>FSC will use the additional $7 million to improve the efficiency of the mill.  As said, increased cane 
<br/>production improved the TCTS ratio.  This will reduce FSC’s reliance on Government and tax payer 
<br/>funds and is the right way to become a healthy and sustainable business.  The remaining $16 million 
<br/>will go towards the proceeds of farmers, the 70 per cent as per the Master Award.  As the price is 
<br/>guaranteed at $85 per tonne, Sir, Government will save the $16 million from the original subsidised 
<br/>price.    This  means  Government  can  use  these  savings  to  provide  other  assistance  related  to  the 
<br/>farmers.  As the farmers do know that some of the initiatives, because of COVID-19 restrictions in 
<br/>the Budget, some of it, was in fact, for example, new cane planting programme was somewhat slowed 
<br/>down or muted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, cane growers will continue to receive the guaranteed current price of $85 
<br/>per  tonne  as  well  as  additional  benefits  to  the  growers  and  other  stakeholders  including  the  land 
<br/>owners, lorry drivers, cane cutters, machine operators and financial institutions as the mill operations 
<br/></span><span>improve.  Upgrading work in the mill will improve production efficiency and better TCTS.  Less 
<br/></span><span>cane will be required to  produce a tonne of sugar, thus  the total volume of sugar production will 
<br/>increase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With increase in sugar production, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall proceeds generate from the 
<br/>sale of sugar will increase, thus increasing income for both the miller and the growers.  When the 
<br/>mills run efficiently, the crushing rate improves.  This will reduce the down time of lorries waiting 
<br/>for hours and queue to get their cane weighed and off load for crushing.  With an accelerated crushing 
<br/>rate, the lorries will be able to return to the cane fields much earlier for reloading.  This also brings 
<br/>efficiency  to  both  the  mechanical  harvesters  and  the  cane  harvesters.    Cane  harvesting  will  be 
<br/>completed in a shorter duration thus reducing the major harvesting and transportation cost of growers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  mills  are  not  effectively  functioning,  the  cane  cutters  and 
<br/>harvesters cannot perform their work and this increases grows cost, as they are compelled to provide 
<br/>food and other demands of the cane cutters.  Therefore, such cost will be avoided with the additional 
<br/>savings in their pockets and the growers will be able to make timely repayments to banks and make

<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investments on their farms.  Of course, we talked about this the other day, they can also get into other 
<br/>farming livelihood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FSC also placed utilised part of the additional income on increasing 
<br/>cane production.  This is a fundamental development needed to grow and sustain the sugar industry.  
<br/>Through their cane development plan, the FSC is focusing on reviewing and increasing areas under 
<br/>cane, improving productivity and ratoon management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plans are in place to establish more joint ventures in New Zealand and neighbouring Pacific 
<br/>Island countries. Therefore, there is a need to improve on packaging machine, distribution channels 
<br/>and  acquire  international  certifications  will  open  up  doors  to  new  markets.  Sir,  FSC  is  currently 
<br/>researching product diversification. They would see new variants of sugar being launched. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many positive benefits to be realise by the different stakeholders 
<br/>in the sugar industry therefore the price reviews is well timed for the FSC.  Of course some people 
<br/>do not necessarily comprehend this and they turn it into a political issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  to  understand,  honourable  Kuridrani  talked  about  FSC  being 
<br/></span><span>technically insolvent and all of that, it is not he said, may be it is.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a commercial 
<br/></span><span>entity that requires healthy cash flow to make investments for its sustainability and that of the entire 
<br/>sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As people know, Sir, FSC is  owned by the Fijian Government  but  also FNPF had shares, 
<br/>Fijian Holdings had shares and there are other shareholders but no one in the past number of decades 
<br/>or so have contributed a single cent towards the equity of this particular organisation. It is only the 
<br/>Government.  I will live it there, Sir and if the honourable Member has any question, I can answer 
<br/>from them.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Northern Connectivity Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 39/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O’CONNOR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications,  Housing  and  Community  Development  inform  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>progress of the Northern Connectivity Programme as announced in Parliament last year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must admit that since being in Parliament 
<br/>for a number of years now, for two terms nearly this was one of the most pleasurable tools I had 
<br/>actually in Vanua Levu when I went there last week because it was so immensely empowering to see 
<br/>of the immense empowerment of these people in very remote areas who are connected to the internet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have school children being excited because they can now access the internet; things we 
<br/>actually take for granted.  There are 40 sites, Sir, that have now been connected, they include schools 
<br/>and nursing stations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we worked together with the Ministry of Education, Heritage 
<br/>and Arts and Ministry of Health and Medical Services as to which sites should be connected.  There 
<br/>are still a number of other schools that need to be connected and I am sure some nursing stations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  very  quickly,  this  project  is  now  as  announced  in  Parliament  last  week  is  being 
<br/>completed.  It was in fact completed by December, we did go down to see a few of those sites.  We 
<br/>went  to  Lutukina  District  School,  Koroinasolo  Village  School,  Qalitu  District  School,  Dawara 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="127">Page 127</a></div>
<div><span>10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>727  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>District School, Saint Pauls Primary School, Wailevu East Primary School, Vunisalusalu Primary 
<br/>School, Volivoli Primary School, Laqi Health Centre and Dogotuki Nursing Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have now all these nursing stations where the nurses actually have access to internet.  
<br/>We gave them screens, we gave them web cameras, some of them were also given IT phones. A lot 
<br/>of these nursing stations do not have doctors.  So, they can, for example, the patient can sit in front, 
<br/>this is a very basic type of telemedicine they can have with the Labasa Hospital where doctors can 
<br/>see them.  So, that is one aspect of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other aspect, of course, was for the schools.  The teachers now as you know under FEMIS 
<br/>because for FEMIS they have to travel all the way to Labasa or Savusavu.  It takes them hours to do 
<br/>that, now they actually sit on the comfort of their office, get connected, download the worksheets for 
<br/>the students, they do not have to go two hours to print it somewhere.  We have given them printers, 
<br/>extremely powerful, Sir, and also some of the schools where there was a village or community living 
<br/>by we </span><span>WiFi</span><span> those schools also.  So, in other words as you get out of the school some places about 
<br/>300 metres, some of them about 150 metres, it was </span><span>WiFi</span><span>.  So, someone could come from the village 
<br/>and sit outside in the compound in the school  yard and actually connect to the phone, connect to 
<br/></span><span>Viber</span><span>, connect to </span><span>WatsApp</span><span>, connect to internet, things we actually take for granted in the city.  It is 
<br/></span><span>an extremely empowering situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to let you know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, how we got the funding for this. We had borrowed 
<br/>USD$5.54 million for the submarine cable that is built out of our cable that comes to the Southern 
<br/>Cross cable in Vatuwaqa, the Samoan one that came between Taveuni and Vanua Levu we have built 
<br/>a pipe of that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were some funds that were left and with that we committed it 
<br/>for the, what we call, “connecting the unconnected” for Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  by  way  of  information,  we  of  course  did  the  scoping  and  then  we 
<br/>outsourced the work, we called for tenders, Vodafone and Telecom were the main providers for their 
<br/>connectivity.  We had, of course, a lot of the schools do not have electricity also. So, we gave them 
<br/>solar  panels,  very  high  powered,  we  have  got  very  powerful  batteries  actually  that  will  store  the 
<br/>energy  and  of  course  we  gave  all  of  that  to  them.    Also,  like  I  mentioned  there  were  personal 
<br/>computers and the other peripherals that go with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, part of this programme also we have in fact expended about $1.1 million 
<br/>for emergency telecommunication solutions and those phones are now coming.  So, a lot of these 
<br/>areas because of cyclones, they are quite remote.  We now have the emergency telecommunications 
<br/></span><span>which is about to arrive into the country I think in about three weeks’ time.  So, these people will 
<br/></span><span>also be connected in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point Mr. Speaker, Sir, was that I have got a whole list, I know people want to go 
<br/>home of all the 40 sites that have been connected but we had the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> team also, Sir, that went with 
<br/>us and all of these places that I have just mentioned that we did go to, they all requested </span><span>Walesi</span><span>. All 
<br/>of  them  have  been  connected  with  </span><span>Walesi,</span><span>  if  the  students  want  it  because  as  you  an  Educational 
<br/>Channel on Channel 10 on the </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform so they have access to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was really interesting, Sir, in some of the schools we went to, the heads of the school 
<br/>from the other schools that were nearby, they all came over and said, “look we want to be connected 
<br/>also to the internet but also they wanted a connection to </span><span>Walesi” </span><span>and they will be doing all of that 
<br/>within the next two weeks, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all in all Mr. Speaker Sir, it was a very rewarding experience, we were just talking about 
<br/>the BPO council.  We were talking to some people that now we have the submarine cable landing in 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 10</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Savusavu, there is an opportunity in the future now, of course, we want to lay fibre-optic cable in 
<br/>Savusavu up to Labasa.  A huge opportunity to do that and even when we expanding the BPO sector, 
<br/>we can actually have some of these call centres in Vanua Levu because as we said we want to keep 
<br/>the people in Vanua Levu in Vanua Levu that is their home, a lot of them actually leave Vanua Levu 
<br/>to come to Viti Levu for jobs.  In fact we would like it to be the other way around.  We like some 
<br/>people from Viti Levu to go to Vanua Levu.        
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The real estate is a lot more attractive in terms of pricing and for the businesses, it will be 
<br/>good and, of course, will create a lot more jobs. So that is just a very quick update in respect of the 
<br/>Northern Division connectivity.
