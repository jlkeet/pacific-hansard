<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - PERFORMANCE AUDIT ON THE ACCESS OF PERSONS  
<br/>WITH DISABILITIES TO PUBLIC OFFICES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Performance  Audit  on  the  Access  of 
<br/>Persons  with  Disabilities  to  Public  Offices  and  Public  Transport,  which  was  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament on 16th August, 2021.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, I, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Public Accounts who moved the motion take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the Review 
<br/>of the Performance Audit Report on Access for Persons with Disabilities to Public Offices and Public 
<br/>Transport.   The United Nation’s Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was 
<br/>signed by Fiji on 2nd June, 2010 and ratified in 2017.  Further, the 2013 Constitution of the Republic 
<br/>of Fiji clearly outlines the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It establishes the right to equality and 
<br/>freedom from discrimination on the grounds of an individual act or supposed personal characteristics 
<br/>or circumstances including disability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, provisions in the Constitution even stipulates under Section 26(5) and (6) 
<br/>that the proprietor of a place or service to shops, hotels, lodging-house, public restaurants, place of 
<br/>public  entertainment,  clubs,  education  institutions,  public  transportation  services,  taxis  and  public 
<br/>places, must facilitate reasonable access for persons with disabilities to the extent that is prescribed 
<br/>by law.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Performance Audit Report carried out was based on the release made 
<br/>by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics on the 2017 Population and Housing Census dated 5th January, 2018, 
<br/>which recorded a total enumerated population of 884,887.  Out of this number, 829,907 were reported 
<br/>as being at the age of three years and above of which a total of 113,595 persons were reported to 
<br/>have had at least one functioning challenge.  The number equates to a rate of 13.7 per cent which is 
<br/>close to the international benchmark of 15 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main objective of the audit that was conducted by the Office of the Auditor-General was 
<br/>to assess on whether the strategies, action plans and processes for the provision of access for persons 
<br/>with disabilities are effectively and efficiently administered by the National Council for Persons with 
<br/>Disabilities (NCPD) and relevant stakeholders in order to ensure ease of accessibility to public offices 
<br/>and public transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit also covered the roles of the NCPD in working with the relevant 
<br/>stakeholders including the Department of Transport, Land Transport Authority, Fiji Roads Authority, 
<br/>Department  of  Civil  Aviation,  Department  of  Buildings  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and 
<br/>Meteorological  Services,  Municipal  Councils,  Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning, 
<br/>Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) of  the Ministry of Economy and other stakeholders, such 
<br/>as, NGOs, CSOs and Disabled Person’s Organisations to successfully plan, implement and monitor 
<br/>the provision of accessibility for persons with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Committee scrutinised the five main key focused areas of the audit that includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Legislation and Policy Framework; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Stakeholders Arrangements and Engagements; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Policy Implementation on Access for Disabilities; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Disabled Accessibility to Public Transport; and 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji,  in  recognising  its  international  and  regional  commitments,  the  Government  had 
<br/>developed a 10-year National Disability Policy (2008 to 2018) which was also required under the 
<br/>Fiji National Council for Persons with Disabilities Act of 1994.  The audit also pointed out the need 
<br/>for a review of the Fiji National Council for Persons with Disabilities Act 1994, as the current version 
<br/>of  the  legislation  was  an  administrative  one  and  discussions  for  a  review  was  underway  for  the 
<br/>purpose of determining its continuing relevance to the local, regional and international best practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission  has  been 
<br/></span><span>educating  the  public  about  the  rights  and  freedom,  as  well  as  receiving  and  investigating  alleged 
<br/>violations of human rights.   The Rights  of Persons with  Disabilities Act  has been developed  and 
<br/>aligned with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  The 
<br/>Act seeks to provide for, uphold and enforce the rights of persons with disabilities in Fiji, as provided 
<br/>for under the Articles of the Convention and Section 42 of Fiji’s 2013 Constitution.  The Act captures 
<br/>bulk  of  the  salient  features  of  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with 
<br/>Disabilities, and is envisaged to empower persons with disabilities in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is pleasing to note that while all rights of persons with disabilities are embedded into the 
<br/>newly enacted Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018, the rights of persons with disabilities 
<br/>specific  to  reasonable  access  to  public  transportation  at  the  national  level  are  ensued  through  the 
<br/>following legislative frameworks, namely; the 2013 Constitution, the Land Transport Act 1998 and 
<br/>its Regulations.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that some work was undertaken after the amendments with regards to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>priority sitting in public service vehicles and line markings for disabled persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Building Code is included in the Public Health Regulations 2004 in the Public 
<br/>Health Act 1935.  The basic objective of the Code is to ensure that acceptable standards of structural 
<br/>sufficiency, fire safety, health and amenity are maintained for the benefit of the community now and 
<br/>in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted that the requirements of the law have not been effectively 
<br/>enforced by the officers responsible for public health on those buildings that have been built without 
<br/>access  for  people  with  disabilities.  The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General’s  meeting  with  the  Public 
<br/>Health Officials mentioned the transfer of functions and powers of local authorities in rural districts 
<br/>and boards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On stakeholder arrangements and engagements, Mr. Speaker, the Committee has noted that 
<br/>sharing of information is still an issue with Ministries, especially if their legislation limits the sharing 
<br/>of  individual  information  with  outside  parties,  including  the  Fiji  Bureau  of  Statistics  (FBoS). 
<br/>However,  to  mitigate  those  challenges,  FBoS  has  been  signing  Memorandum  of  Understanding 
<br/>(MOUs) with some key Government stakeholders and other line agencies, and plans to partner with 
<br/>the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation in the near future due to the significant 
<br/>importance  of  consolidating  and  sharing  the  consistent  disability  statistics  for  necessary  policy 
<br/>decisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was informed that the lack of awareness and initiatives for 
<br/>everyone to be mindful of the plight of accessibility faced by persons with disabilities are the basic 
<br/>reasons  why there has  been slow progress  in  improving  accessibility to  public spaces. Generally, 
<br/>most people lack knowledge on the type of disabilities in Fiji and consequently are not aware of what 
<br/>is required in order to cater for people with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  was  further  informed  that  the  Construction  Industry  Council  (CIC)  Board 
<br/>members expressed that on the very initial stages of planning, the drafters of building plans generally 
<br/>lack this  knowledge  and in  most cases, work is based on their experiences and may not  be up to 
<br/>standards with new developments and best practices. This lack of awareness and initiatives may also 
<br/>be present with engineers. The other factor highlighted by CIC was the high cost of implementing 
<br/>these considerations for disabilities in the building plans.  Collaboration and engagement with the 
<br/>NCPD by the Department of Town and Country Planning and Municipal Councils is also lacking, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rights of Persons with Disabilities are provided and protected in Part 6 of the Rights of 
<br/>Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 (Act No. 4 of 2018).  It is important to note that the Act came into 
<br/>force in 2018 and the audit was conducted in 2019, while agencies were still working on the Action 
<br/>Plan with relevant agencies to implement the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Act clearly states that a person may apply to the High Court if 
<br/>a person feels that they are being deprived from their rights under the Act.  Section 29(6) of the Act 
<br/>clearly states that under the law, if a person with disabilities feels deprived of their rights, then the 
<br/>person is in a position to raise the matter in the High Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was also informed that NCPD also has a complaints register which deals only 
<br/>with mobility issues, while the rest of the complaints are referred to the Human Rights and Anti-
<br/>Discrimination Commission for their action.  The Commission has clearly stated that any person has 
<br/>the right to lodge their complaint to the Commission in regards to alleged human rights violation.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted the audit findings and it requires serious consideration 
<br/>by the National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) with relevant stakeholders to expedite 
<br/>the implementation and facilitation of access for persons with disabilities in public offices and public 
<br/>transport respectively.  In this regard, the Committee recommends that the NCPD: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honours its international and regional commitments through national policies and action 
<br/>plans  that  are  recognised  and  acknowledged  by  its  stakeholders,  adequately  resourced, 
<br/>implemented in a timely manner and using reliable, comparable and current and relevant 
<br/>disability data to support its policies; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>carry  out  periodic  reviews  of  such  commitments  for  the  purpose  of  determining  their 
<br/>continued relevance to local, regional and international realities on disability issues; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>work  more  closely  with  LTA  and  Department  of  Transport  to  have  a  better  working 
<br/>knowledge and understanding of the 2015 legislative amendments to the LTA Regulations 
<br/>on PSV issues on access for persons with disabilities; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensures that the Housing Transport &amp; Environment Advisory Committee (HTEADCOM) 
<br/>have  more  regular  meetings  to  expedite  the  timely  execution  and  monitoring  of  the 
<br/>Implementation  Plan  to  minimise  delays  to  disabled  access  inclusion  in  legislation  and 
<br/>policies; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considers some of the following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as those were 
<br/>reflected  in  the  Government’s  Budget  and  5-Year  and  20-Year  National  Development 
<br/>Plans: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(ii)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(iii)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(iv)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(v)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(vi)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SDG 1 - End Poverty; 
<br/>SDG 4 - Quality Education; 
<br/>SDG 8 – Decent Work and Economic Growth; 
<br/>SDG 10 – Reduced Inequalities; 
<br/>SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities; and 
<br/>SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  view  to  improving  access  and  mobility  which  are  two  important  factors  in 
<br/>reducing  poverty,  and  can  facilitate  the  participation  of  people  with  disabilities  in 
<br/>economic, social and political processes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be adequately resourced for a more conducive environment to co-ordinate and consult with 
<br/>stakeholders; and; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considers the schedule of meetings of the Advisory Committee to minimise delays and to 
<br/>ensure timely implementation of its policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  Sir, the  Committee  acknowledges  the progressive  work  done  by  the  NCPD in 
<br/>consultation with relevant stakeholders to ensure that access for disability in public offices and transport 
<br/>is facilitated.  However, more resources, commitment and engagement is required by all stakeholders so 
<br/>that Fiji could fully comply with the international, regional and local commitments which are mandated 
<br/>under the Convention and the relevant legislations that are currently in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has passed the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018, which sets the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>platform in ensuring no one is left behind.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words and as the Member moving the motion, I thank you for this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is open for debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to contribute to this  
<br/>motion on the Performance Audit on the Access of Persons with Disabilities to Public Offices and Public 
<br/>Transport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also acknowledge the Report by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in highlighting 
<br/>this great need by a great number of our population living with disabilities and their need.  It is good that 
<br/>they have highlighted that because it brings to fore, again, the importance of the work done by the Fiji 
<br/>Bureau  of  Statistics  rather  than  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  sacking  the  Chief  Executive 
<br/>Officer.    This tantamount to the great work that has been carried out by Fiji Bureau of Statistics, and we 
<br/>acknowledge the laws that are in place to look after the needs of our people living with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recalled, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when that piece of legislation was brought into the House for 
<br/>debate, we, on this House, highlighted the need for the legislation to be resourced accordingly in 
<br/>regards to its implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, it is interesting how this Committee has highlighted in their recommendations the role 
<br/>of  the  National  Council  for  Persons  living  with  Disabilities  (NCPD).    And  I  must  remind  the 
<br/>Committee, the Chairman and the members that Fiji, through the Government, ratified the legislation, 
<br/>not NCPD.  Therefore, the responsibility for the implementation or the lack of implementation or the 
<br/>ineffectiveness  of  the  implementation  of  this  legislation  rests  with  the  Government,  not  with  the 
<br/>NCPD. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will recall that during the Budget debates, we, on this side of the House, 
<br/>have always requested that the NCPD be given an appropriate portion of our National Budget so that 
<br/>they will be able to undertake their mandatory work.  As we have heard from the Chairman, that the 
<br/>implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 includes the wider scope of our 
<br/>society or in regards to the Government infrastructure.  It involves Ministry of Works, Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services, Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts, and in here particularly, we 
<br/>are talking about infrastructure on the building and also on land and sea transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will see, Mr. Speaker, that after the approval of that legislation that was brought into the 
<br/></span><span>House, very little resources were allocated to the Ministry responsible and also to NCPD, to be able 
<br/></span><span>to carry out the work they have been mandated to do under the Act. Also, we will see that it is beyond 
<br/>NCPD’s area of responsibility to be working with those responsible for buildings, particularly those 
<br/>that are privately owned, or for those owning ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recalled seeing someone having to travel from  Natovi to Nabouwalu, who has had great 
<br/>difficulty in having to get up the steps which is very steep.  The relatives actually had to carry the 
<br/>gentleman up the steep steps, Mr. Speaker, and that tantamount that there is not really any progress 
<br/>being done in regards to the owners of businesses, particularly those who own land transport and sea 
<br/>transport,  to  be  able  to  improve  on  their  infrastructure  to  accommodate  those  people  living  with 
<br/>disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, you hardly see them travel in public transport in regards to bus.  Even 
<br/>though they may be given transport or bus cards, most of them travel in taxis which is very expensive.  
<br/>They do that because only the taxi will be able to accommodate their wheelchair and their crutches, 
<br/>and also their helper to be able to get them to their destination. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am highlighting those because I believe the recommendation, emphasising that the National 
<br/>Council for Persons Living with Disabilities be responsible for all those seven recommendations is a 
<br/>bit  misaligned.    The  recommendation  should  have  been  targeted  to  the  Government  of  the  day 
<br/>because  as  the  keeper  of  the  instruments  with  regards  to  the  legislation,  it  is  also  responsible  for 
<br/>submitting a periodic report in regards to the implementation of the Convention on the people living 
<br/>with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the  National  Council for Persons with  Disabilities will contribute but  I believe 
<br/>there will also be the organisation responsible for providing a shadow report which is tabled to the 
<br/>meeting in New York.  Therefore, in my view, having to hold the National Council’s for Persons 
<br/>with Disabilities responsible for those recommendations are unfair and also misaligned, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, because those recommendations lies flatly on the shoulders of the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to contribute to the motion  
<br/>of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts Report on the Review of the Performance Audit on 
<br/>the Access for Persons with Disabilities to Public Officers and Public Transport.  Before I do that, I 
<br/>would  like  to  wish  our  two  honourable  Members  this  morning,  who  just  have  been  sworn  in  a 
<br/>successful tenure in the House as well as wishing the honourable Prime Minister a speedy recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
<br/>was  signed  by  Fiji  on  2nd  June,  2010  and  ratified  in  2017.  Further,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  2013 
<br/>Constitution  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  clearly  outlines  the  rights  of  persons  with  disabilities.    It 
<br/>establishes the right to quality and freedom from discrimination on the grounds of individual act or 
<br/>suppose personal characteristic or circumstances including disability.  The provision, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in the Constitution as stipulated under Section 26(6) where the proprietor of a place or service 
<br/>referred to in subsection (5),  “… to shops, hotels, lodging-houses, public restaurants, places of public  
<br/>entertainment, clubs, education institutions, public transportation services, taxis and public places” 
<br/>must facilitate reasonable access to persons with disabilities to the extent as prescribed by law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  also  noted  in  its  review  the  inaccessibility  to  build 
<br/>environments  and  is  still  a  major  barrier  which  prevents  persons  with  disabilities  from  actively 
<br/>participating  in  social  and  economic  activities.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  highlight  some  of  the  gaps 
<br/>identified which include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>The need for review of the FNCDP Act 1994 as the current version of the legislation was an 
<br/>administrative one and discussions for a review was underway for the purpose of determining 
<br/></span><span>its continuing relevance to local, regional and international best practices. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inquiries made by the Office of the Auditor-General into the achievements of the Fiji Human 
<br/>Rights Disability Action Plan developed by the Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination 
<br/>Commission were not facilitated as the current Commission was not in office at the time the 
<br/>plan was developed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has 
<br/>been educating the public about rights and freedom, receiving and investigating alleged violations of 
<br/>human rights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 42 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji  captures the 
<br/>rights of persons with disabilities to reasonable access to all public transport.  Prior to the enactment 
<br/>over the Rights of Persons with Disability Act which came into effect on 21st March, 2018 through 
<br/>the Act No. 4 of 2018, the only legislation relating directly to persons with disabilities in Fiji was a 
<br/>24-year old Fiji National Council for Disabled Persons Act of 1994.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2015, Mr. Speaker, Sir, amendments to LTA Regulations relating to public service vehicles 
<br/>saw a promising outcome with specific requirements to include disability friendly features in Public 
<br/>Service  Vehicles.    It  was  noted,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  that  the  lack  of  an  effective  environment 
<br/>enforcement  of  the  legislation  had  aimed  to  address  barriers  for  disabled  accessibility  to  public 
<br/>service  vehicles  is  too  weak.  Lack  of  collaboration  and  awareness  and  inclusion  of  disabled 
<br/>accessibility in legislation and policies governing sea and air transportation are yet to be formulated 
<br/>and we urge the Government to seriously look into this area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted 
<br/>that in the audit that Professor Rob McCallum, who made a submission to the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Social  Affairs  during  the  consultation  process  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities  Bill 
<br/>suggested that clause 29 of the Bill which deals with accessibility for disabled persons correlates with 
<br/>Section 42 of the 2013 Constitution.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Professor further stated that it 
<br/>would be better if clause 29 could be redrafted in order to align it with Article 9 of the UN Convention 
<br/>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as it does not cover just access to transport and buildings 
<br/>but also to communications and recreational areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similar  sentiments,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  were  presented  through  written  submissions  of  the 
<br/>Office  of  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights,  the  Regional  Office  of  the 
<br/>Pacific and United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to 
<br/>the Standing Committee.  The submission noted that clause 29 of the Bill falls short of Article 9 of 
<br/>the  CRPD  in  particular  by  limiting  the  rights  of  persons  with  disabilities  to  reasonable  access  to 
<br/>physical spaces, transport and information, and not including communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Information Communications Technology (ICT) and public services - while acknowledging 
<br/>that  accessibility  is  critical  to  persons  with  disabilities,  enjoyment  of  practically  all  rights  under 
<br/>CRPD and other treaties saw lack or denial of accessibility could be considered discriminatory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted in the Audit Report that the current management of 
<br/>LTA  did  not  have  knowledge  of  the  2015  legislative  amendments.    Similarly,  the  Department  of 
<br/>Transport was also not aware of the 2015 amendments made to the LTA regulations, however, the 
<br/>Committee noted that some work was undertaken but after the amendments with regards to priority 
<br/>seating in PSVs and line markings for disabled persons.  This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, indicate the lack of 
<br/>knowledge of the responsible agencies of the 2015 regulatory amendments relating to user-friendly 
<br/>PSVs for persons with physical disabilities thus compromising the implementation and enforcement 
<br/>of the land transport or Public Service Vehicle Regulations which came into effect in 2015.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On maritime,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, and transportation, the maritime and air transportation are 
<br/>governed  by  the  Maritime  Safety  Authority  of  Fiji  Act  2009  and  Maritime  Transport  Act  2013, 
<br/>Maritime Regulation (Ship Registration) Act 2013.  The Committee noted from the report that the 
<br/>inclusion of disabled accessible provisions in the governing legislations and regulation for sea and 
<br/>air transportation has not been effective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We urge the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to take this on board immediately as people travel 
<br/>daily either by sea, air or on land.  It was also noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Maritime Transport 
<br/>Policy of 2015 recognises the constitutional rights of disabled persons to reasonable access to public 
<br/>transport with the implications of the design of transport systems.  Unfortunately this is not happening 
<br/>in Fiji because there is lack of implementation and also legislations to ensure that these practices are 
<br/>enforced for the greater public of Fiji.  Again, there is a need to collaborate with FNCDP and the 
<br/>Government as their input is needed as far as inclusion is concerned.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO T.V. KEPA.- Mr. Speaker, according to the World Report on Disability 2020, 15 
<br/>per cent of the world’s population lived with some form of disability and if we were to apply that 
<br/>figure  to  Fiji’s  population  of  884,887  according  to  the  2017  Census,  15  per  cent  would  be 
<br/>approximately 133,000 people.  So roughly, 133,000 of the total population live with some form of 
<br/>disability in Fiji, and not just physical disability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People with disabilities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are told, have generally poorer health, lower 
<br/>educational  achievements,  fewer  economic  opportunities  and  higher  rates  of  poverty  than  people 
<br/>without disability.  This is largely due to the lack of services available to them and the many obstacles 
<br/>they face in  their daily lives. Mr. Speaker, Sir, here  I declare my interest being a Member of the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts, who looked at this review.  So, looking at the review of the 
<br/>Performance  Audit  which  includes  the  five-year  implementation  plan  from  2019  to  2023  of  the 
<br/>NCPD  and  its  10  objectives,  capturing  international,  regional  and  local  commitments in  terms  of 
<br/>accessibility to the Council public offices and public transport for people with disabilities, we know 
<br/>right away that the Council was faced with many challenges which included the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Restriction of movements due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the implementation of  
<br/>activities; 
<br/>Funding implications within the plan; and 
<br/>Commitment from stakeholders in the implementation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this really is a big humongous job for the stakeholders, especially with the 
<br/>Government’s commitment articulated in the National Development Plan on transforming Fiji and 
<br/>their pledge in leaving no one behind.  In this regard, although the annual reports, audited reports and 
<br/>review reports are sometimes printed in glossy and glamorous ways, the truth when we get behind 
<br/>the shiny sleek facade is something that needs to be tackled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, international conventions, for example, which Fiji has ratified and 
<br/>complied with and for Government to appreciate that when you sign those important commitments, 
<br/>proper  and  adequate funding is  provided,  and just  not  to  make  Government  look  good with  little 
<br/>happening behind the gleaming frontage.  In this instance, the stakeholders, as we have heard are the 
<br/>Municipal  Councils,  Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning,  Department  of  Buildings,  OHS 
<br/>Department,  Public  Health  Department,  Construction  Implementation  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Economy,  Department  of  Transport,  LTA,  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  Fiji  Bus  Association,  Fiji  Taxi 
<br/>Association  and  Construction  Industry  Council.    A  coordinated  multi-stakeholder  engagement 
<br/>approach is therefore fundamental for the harmonious provision of accessibility to public offices and 
<br/></span><span>public transport for the disabled population of Fiji, particularly in regard to sea, air and land transport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disharmony occurs when the main players are not coordinated and gaps start opening up as 
<br/>we see when we take a closer look at how the supposedly ease of access for people with disability 
<br/>becomes difficult to access.  In this instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the technical working groups of the 
<br/>NCPD, which is an essential tool or vehicle in the implementation of activities, need to have more 
<br/>regular meetings that are formalised with each technical working group incorporating a person with 
<br/>disability into their working groups, as people with no disability have little idea of the difficulties 
<br/>people with disability have.  For example, when I went to the Nausori Bus Stand, very familiar to 
<br/>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I heard, as I had heard from a friend how difficult it was for a person with 
<br/>disability to get into a bus, and trying to get into the Tebara Bus was like trying to get to heaven.  It 
<br/>was high off the ground with the steps so far apart, and if the bus is moving, as sometimes happens 
<br/>with impatient bus drivers, just imagine how precarious this experience is.  So, for the abled bodied 
<br/>section of the population or 85 per cent of the people, what is easy for you and what you take for 
<br/>granted can be quite intimidating for a person with disability, particularly for those relying on public 
<br/>transport, like the Tebara bus.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  hand,  whilst  boarding  the  boats  at  Nasali  Landing,  had  previously  been  a 
<br/>nightmare for people with disability. I would like to thank the Honourable Minister for Defence for 
<br/>improving  the  river  bank  access  for  commuters  and  in  the  process,  providing  a  ramp  that  when 
<br/>completed, will enhance not only the lives of people with disability but also the women, some of 
<br/>whom have ended up in the river and they have asked me to relay their appreciation to the Honourable 
<br/>Minister.  So, thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  the  review  emphasises  that  the  NCPD  honours  international  and  regional 
<br/>commitments  through  national  policies,  and  that  Action  Plans  are  adequately  resourced  to  be 
<br/>implemented in a timely manner using reliable, comparable and up to date disability data to support 
<br/>evidence-based policy-making to improve the lives of the 15 per cent of the population for whom 
<br/>this review was made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- All these years I have been trying to get on to the Tebara bus, but the steps 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are bit high, even for me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure you could jump on to the second step of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bus so I would be very happy to see you do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; a very good morning to all of 
<br/>you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to contribute to the Performance Report and I thank the Standing Committee for the 
<br/>work  undertaken  to  reach  the  recommendations.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  made 
<br/>comprehensive  contributions  to  the  Review  of  the  Performance  Audit  Report  on  the  Access  for 
<br/>Persons with Disabilities to Public Offices and Public Transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As described, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the United Nations in 2007, accessibility is about giving 
<br/>equal access to everyone and without being able to access the facilities and services, persons with 
<br/>disabilities will never be fully included.  The inefficiency of accessibility to public transport has led 
<br/>towards inconvenience and prohibits many disabled persons from moving around freely.  I am sure 
<br/>we will all agree to those particular statements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not a local issue but it is actually a global issue.  Access to 
<br/></span><span>public  transportation  is  one  of  the  biggest  issues  for  people  with  disabilities.  Without  accessible 
<br/>transportation,  many  people  with  disabilities  simply  cannot  go  to  a  school  or  to  a  workplace  or 
<br/>hindering  their  full  participation  in  society,  as  echoed  in  those  sentiments  earlier  expressed.    We 
<br/>understand that this was a performance audit undertaken by the Office of the Auditor-General, which 
<br/>is the type of audit that understands the current activities and suggests improvements to the processes 
<br/>and systems in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Performance Audit Report reveals that according to the 2017 Population 
<br/>and Housing Census by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics in 2018, 13.7 per cent of the total population 
<br/>were reported to have had, at least, one functioning challenge.  This means that 113,595 people out 
<br/>of the population of 884,887 have some form of disability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, what the Report fails to specify is whether all the functioning challenges restrict 
<br/>a person from using public transportation, or having access to public information.  In order for the 
<br/>Ministry responsible for transportation to develop better policies, it is important that data is available 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>305 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on how many people with disabilities access public transport and how many are actually finding it 
<br/>impossible  to  access  public  transport  because  of  their  disability,  and  that  the  public  transport  is 
<br/>actually not conducive to their specific conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, such Performance Reports by the OAG lack objectivity, and many times, a 
<br/>purpose.  The OAG did not undertake a performance assessment with an open and objective mind.  
<br/>Their mindset, as in all their audits, is always that the organisation is doing wrong, and that they are 
<br/>going to go in there to find problems and not to acknowledge the good work that has been done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, I know there are supposed to be independent, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but they are not acting like that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018 enshrines the right for a 
<br/>person to be able to access public transport, public office and information.  What needs to be said is 
<br/>that, there is no use coming here and making it a flavour of the month and come and speak loudly 
<br/>about it now, but before this Government came along, nothing was done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Absolutely nothing was done!  People with disabilities were just put by 
<br/>the wayside, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Never before were persons with even a hearing impairment able to 
<br/>access  information  that  was  made  available  to  the  general  public.    This  Government  did  so,  Mr.  
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Today, Parliament Sessions are televised and made online with experts 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>conveying the information through sign language. Who did that?  We did that!  We did that!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is no use jumping on the bandwagon now and nag about it because 
<br/>when you were on this side of the House, you never did anything.  Disability has been around since 
<br/>time immemorial, no one did anything about it then, and it has been done now by this Government, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  All important announcements relating to COVID-19 were broadcasted on all forms 
<br/></span><span>of media, not just in written form.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report fails to acknowledge such steps by the Government to have information readily 
<br/>available to all citizens of Fiji.  The Report identifies gaps in terms of coverage of Section 29 of the 
<br/>Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2018.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 29 provides broad 
<br/>coverage in terms of accessibility and it is not prescriptive as that the Act would limit the application 
<br/>of the legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  certain  recommendations  within  the  Report  of  the  Standing  Committee  that  we 
<br/>acknowledge, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as the Ministry responsible for transport, we have taken on board 
<br/>and we are addressing and we will continue to address those issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am personally working with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Maritime and Safety 
<br/>Authority  of  Fiji  (MSAF)  to  ensure  that  the  appropriate  changes  are  made  to  the  respective 
<br/>legislations to mirror the accessibility provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disability Act 2018.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is being done as we speak.  It is a large task, but it is being done, Mr. Speaker, I can assure you 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate that disability is a human rights issue and as highlighted 
<br/>in  the  Report  that  the  people  with  disabilities  have  the  same  absolute  rights  to  life  and  welfare, 
<br/>education, work, access to all community facilities, self-determination, independent living and active 
<br/>participation in all aspects of society as all other human beings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This little statement only became prominent because of this Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>The findings on the accessibility of disabled persons to public transport and noting that the Land 
<br/>Transport (Public Service Vehicles) Regulations 2000 was amended in 2015, to accommodate for 
<br/>access  of  persons  with  disabilities  to  public  transport,  and  I  wish  to  specifically  focus  on  the 
<br/>requirements of this particular provision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A driver of a PSV cannot refuse to carry a person with disabilities. The driver of a PSV must 
<br/>assist persons with disabilities when boarding or disembarking a vehicle. The owner of a PSV has 
<br/>the obligation to ensure that the vehicle is user-friendly for persons with disabilities.  Persons with 
<br/>disabilities must sit in the first two rows of seats in the bus or seats closest to the driver of the PSV, 
<br/>and  signage  needs  to  be  made  available  to  indicate  the  priority  seats.  As  we  can  see,  there  are 
<br/>provisions that are already there but we continue to better them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, the quality assurance maintenance systems and the household travel surveys 
<br/>are two crucial mechanisms that can actually be used to get the private sector to move towards user-
<br/>friendly buses.  I am sure that the honourable Minister for Economy in his wisdom is actually thinking 
<br/>about these things as we speak, maybe Budget time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HCS would also determine the travel partners and persons using public 
<br/>transport. The Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, criticises the lack of public buildings, having accessibility 
<br/>for persons with disability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst it is considered that over a decade ago, proper considerations were not being given by 
<br/>the approving authorities, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the inclusion of disability provisions in the building 
<br/>developments, greater efforts have been made and are continuing to be made by the Department of 
<br/>Town  and  Country  Planning,  especially  since  2019,  to  impose  conditions  and  to  enforce  the 
<br/>appropriate legislative requirement on disability  provisions under the Town and Planning  general 
<br/>provisions.  This  effectively  requires  proponents  of  all  commercial,  civic  and  high-rise  residential 
<br/></span><span>apartment developments to have disability provisions as part of their outlined and detailed building 
<br/></span><span>plans in compliance with the requirements of Schedule G of the Town Planning general provisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is noted that most of the public and private sector building developments 
<br/>that  have  been  newly  constructed  are  displaying  disability  provisions,  such  as  ramps,  designated 
<br/>carpark  and  access  to  lifts.  Those  are  thoroughly  checked  by  the  Municipal  Councils  before 
<br/>Completion Certificates for the buildings are actually issued. So, quite a considerable amount of work 
<br/>has been done and accepted. We continue to do so, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  important  to  acknowledge  that  some  of  the  recent  building  developments  have 
<br/>disability  provisions,  like  the  Damodar  City  Complex,  the  Rups  Mega  Complex,  Tappoos  City 
<br/>Buildings in Suva and Lautoka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether it is the Office of the Prime Minister or 
<br/>the Office of the Attorney-General or the Ministry of Economy or the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport or the Ministry of Health and Medical Services or the Ministry of Women, 
<br/>Children and Poverty Alleviation, access for all Fijians is provided.  Our staff are also available to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  Sir,  the  findings  of  the  Report  have  identified  some  important  areas  of 
<br/>improvement, and it is acknowledged. But at the same time, we do say that the Report has failed to 
<br/>acknowledge the reforms and the changes that have been undertaken by the Fijian Government over 
<br/>the years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government has worked on improving the standards of living 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for all Fijians. We will never deny anyone their rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, today is at a much better place than it was in over a decade ago. We will continue to 
<br/>work on the policies, regulations and initiatives that will enhance accessibility to public transport, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N. NAIWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for giving me this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was very concerned by the contribution from the previous speaker, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, criticising the work of the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General, and it reflects badly on that side of the House.  That is possibly the reason 
<br/>also that they want this independent body to be reviewed because this is the only truly independent 
<br/>body in this country that reveals the neglect and the bad management of that side of the House.  And 
<br/>I think I know the reason why the honourable Minister has criticised the Report because he is one of 
<br/>the culprits identified in this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister said that the inability of access to public transport is international 
<br/>and local.  That is not the point raised by the Auditor-General’s Report.  The point is, he is asking 
<br/>why have you not as Minister for Transport legislated or if he has found that you have legislated, 
<br/>why have you not implemented that?  He is the culprit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this reason, because I 
<br/>can tell you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today I caught the bus from 10 miles, unlike you Ministers who ride in your tinted vehicles 
<br/>and I was expecting as I climbed into the bus the facility for  disabled people to put their walking 
<br/>sticks and I was expecting that the first three rows as he has stated or as he has legislated would have 
<br/>signage.  It does not have that and that is the whole reason and the whole point that is raised by this 
<br/>Report.  Why have you done nothing given that in 2010 you acknowledged this Convention and you 
<br/></span><span>ratified it in 2017; five years; or if you include 2010, ten years - done nothing.  That is the whole 
<br/></span><span>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He  also  says  that  for  improvement  of  legislation,  you  need  to  have  data,  but  the  Auditor-
<br/>General is asking, why have you not gathered this data?  Why has it taken you five to ten years to be 
<br/>looking for that data?  This is what we are debating today, it gives a very bad and sad indictment on 
<br/>the Government side especially on its Minister and Prime Minister on the neglect of those 113,000 
<br/>people correctly indicated in the report who constitute the disability.  It is asking the Minister why 
<br/>have you not made the legislation?  There are policies that are there, why have not this gone down to 
<br/>the  legislation?    Why  in  relation  to  the  Land  Transport  Authority  amendment  is  it  not  being 
<br/>implemented?    Why  is  it  that  the  requirements  to  look  after  the  people  with  disabilities  are  not 
<br/>reflected in our building plans?  Why is it that public houses and it cited Sigatoka very badly.  Why 
<br/>are we not looking after those people?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  also  cited  the  shipping  services,  why  not  have  facilities  to  look  after  the  people  with 
<br/>disabilities  in  relation  to  the  people  who  do  shipping?    These  are  the  questions  that  the  Auditor-

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General is asking and is setting us, you signed that Convention in 2010, you ratified it in 2017 and 
<br/>you are still sitting on your backs; very unfortunate, because these people do not have any voice and 
<br/>it is reflected too in their budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The budget to look after people with disabilities, in 2017 was $200,000, then in 2018 it was 
<br/>$1.1 million and in 2019 to reflect your commitment to that, went back again to the old figures.  So 
<br/>you should admit the irresponsibility and bad management.  If I can refer now to the Chairman.  He 
<br/>says, “These things, it is pleasing to note these, what the Government has done and these are in line 
<br/>with a committed and articulated development plan and the Government’s pledge of leaving no one 
<br/>behind.”  But here it is, we have left them behind and he admits that in his Report on page 2 which 
<br/>states and I quote: “The Committee noted the audit findings and it requires serious considerations”.  
<br/>It is admitting that the Government has done nothing here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolute hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Government  has  done  nothing  as  pointed  out  by  the  Auditor-

<br/>responsible  for  Social  Welfare  will  have  her  time  to  answer  all  these  questions.    In  relation  to 
<br/>legislation and policy framework, you know what it found?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- What? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- One international and regional obligation incorporated in National 
<br/>Policy and Action Plans, several opportunities exist to improve but not done.  Sir, 2010  - what is 
<br/>relevant about 2010? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- When was it ratified? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- You look at your legislation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- When was it ratified? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Ratified in 2017.  What have you done? Have you co-ordinated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the legislation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Have you amended the Tax Act to give incentive to those who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employ people with disabilities? No.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>309 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Have you amended the Employment Regulation? No, you have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Sure, I tell that side, they have amended the Public Transport but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implemented  - no.  It is pointed out here and as admitted by the Minister for Transport…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N. NAWAIKULA.- There is no signage. Mr. Speaker, Sir, you go to any bus, you see 
<br/>the first three seats, you look for the sign, no sign there.  Maybe because he does not catch the bus.  
<br/>So, what does he recommend in relation to the legislative framework?  This is what he says and I 
<br/>quote,  “… to ensure international and regional commitments captured in national policy and action 
<br/>plans are implemented on a timely manner, ensure that full assessment of achievement and policy 
<br/>document is carried out to allow improvement on disabilities” - this has not being done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  enabling  legislation  on  policies  to  access  public  transport.  This  is  where  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Transport was talking from. Acknowledging that there were amendments 
<br/>made  in  the  LTA  Regulations  2015,  this  is  what  they  said,  “Nonetheless,  lack  of  effective 
<br/>enforcement of legislation that aim to address barriers for disabled accessibilities.” So yes, you made 
<br/>those  amendments  in  2015  but  for  what  use  because  you  have  not  enforced  it.    This  is  what  the 
<br/>Auditor-General is saying and if I can go to the next point, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On LTA, its recommendation and it should work closely in relation to the implementation of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this legislation and it goes on and on and on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Honourable Premila Kumar said, “Goes on and on and on like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I am talking sense, I am teaching them, I am telling them you have not done anything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- You passed this Convention in 2010 then 2017, five years now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and it is still sitting down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Nothing done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- This is another question that should be asked to the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Social  Welfare  in  relation  to  enabling  legislation  and  possibility  for  accessibility  to 
<br/>public offices.  Here, it gave some very bad examples in the Sigatoka area.  Its recommendation is, 
<br/>it should coordinate with stakeholders to ensure that timely review of legislation is carried out.  And 
<br/>here again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another problem in relation to the Report because it is only 
<br/>recommending this to NCPD.  It should be recommending this to the Minister responsible because 
<br/>the legislation is the responsibility of the Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  can  go  on  to  the  next  one,  is  the  shareholder  arrangement  on 
<br/>engagements.  The situation found while disability mainstreaming policies are in place at the national 
<br/>level, limitations at the implementation level is the problem because implementing agencies are not 
<br/>involved during initial consultation and formulation of policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will end there but to stress the point that the whole message here is that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you have done nothing.  Let me just add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before coming here I contacted a lot…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, do not laugh because this is a serious matter. People with 
<br/>disability do not have a voice and unless people like me stand up here to speak for them, they will 
<br/>continue to do nothing.  They only were interested in getting donations from the United Nations, 
<br/>UNDP and that is the reason why they formulated that, so that when they go to Geneva, they will 
<br/>say, “we are now implementing this Convention and we have been reviewed on it.”  Just because of 
<br/>the money because they do not have the money but if you come here, you will see that they have 
<br/>done absolutely nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  these  are  the  views  of  a  few  people  with  disabilities  that  I  contacted  before 
<br/>coming here.  Their first concern is the reduction of government allocation and as I said in 2017, it 
<br/>was $200,000 which then increased to $1.1 million in 2017/2018 then after that, it went right down 
<br/>again to where it was before and that is a reflection of the commitment from that side of the House 
<br/>to people with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in relation to the bus fare concessions, it used to be free before, it was much 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>better.  Now, with this Government … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who made it free?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- It was $40 …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who made it free?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Who made it free?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Then, without notice to them … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- … it came down to $20 then $10. What use is that?

<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>311 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Very poor!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  I  last  gave  the  example,  for  a  person  with  disability  from  my 
<br/>village, it takes $8 to come to Savusavu; you can only reach Savusavu, cannot go back with $10.  
<br/>Shame, shame on you!  They are asking, what has the Government done in relation to tax incentives 
<br/>for employers to  employ people with  disabilities?  What  have  you done?  Maybe the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Social Welfare will answer after this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then there is a need to review the laws to harmonise with the Disability Act, so honourable 
<br/>Minister for Social Welfare, why have you not reviewed the Disability Act of 2018. Why have you 
<br/>not  looked  at  sections  77  and  84  of  the  Employment  Relations  Act  to  synergise  it?    Can  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Social Welfare tell the House why the National Building Code has not made 
<br/>infrastructures accessible? Why has it not been implemented into that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- They are being reviewed right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Well, happening now, we are now at the last lap.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Time! It takes time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- In three months’ time, they will be out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  should  have  been  done  before  and  that  is  the  whole  point  that  I  am  saying.    You 
<br/>acknowledged this in 2010, you ratified in 2018 and five years later in 2022, it is happening right 
<br/>now.  Very soon they will be out and you go and complete that outside.  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/>urge that side of the House, do not give lip service to the plight of the people with disability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Committee  for  their  comprehensive 
<br/>Report.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be in compliance with the Rights of Persons with Disability Act 2018 
<br/>and the National Building Code, the new buildings and infrastructure built by municipal councils are 
<br/>disabled-friendly, despite honourable Niko Nawaikula with his favourite line that Government has 
<br/>done nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disability  Act  2018 
<br/></span><span>establish the requirements not to discriminate individuals with disabilities.  As such, the municipal 
<br/></span><span>councils  around  the  country  have  been  collaborating  with  the  NCPD  in  the  area  of  awareness 
<br/>programmes and trainings.  All NCPD organised programmes are fully supported by the municipal 
<br/>councils and council officers are part of the organised programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our towns and cities have grown rapidly in the last 10 years in terms of 
<br/>development.  Our municipal councils have been involved in the construction of new facilities and 
<br/>infrastructure upgrades.  These venues are focused to provide accessibilities and amenities for people 
<br/>with impairments.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are disability accesses in the municipal markets, the car 
<br/>parks and other public spaces owned by the municipal councils within the towns and cities and we 
<br/>do recognise more needs to be done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, considering that Government signed the Convention in 2010 and ratified it 
<br/>in 2017, in the short time, the Municipal Councils are recognising the rights of people with disabilities 
<br/>and it can be seen in some of the work they have already done.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils are putting ramps and lifts in new municipal markets.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, most 
<br/>municipal markets have provision for wheelchair ramps to allow appropriate disability access which 
<br/>are  either  inside  the  market  or  outside  the  market,  connecting  to  the  footpaths.    You  will  find 
<br/>wheelchair ramps  at  Suva Market,  Lami Market,  Nausori Market,  Namaka Market,  Nadi  Market, 
<br/>Rakiraki Market and Tavua Market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lifts in municipal markets, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the existing Namaka Market has a lift, the first 
<br/>one for a municipal market, and the proposed Savusavu Market and Levuka Market will have lifts to 
<br/>provide convenience to the users of the Markets.  Municipal Council Buildings provide lifts as well, 
<br/>for example, Albert Park, Civic House, Civic Tower and Civic Auditorium.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are Council structures buildings that have provision for the wheelchair 
<br/>ramps, as I had mentioned earlier on, and these are at My Suva Park, Suva Civic House, Suva Civic 
<br/>Tower, Suva Civic Auditorium, Suva Olympic Pool, E-Hub Building in Ba, Labasa Civic Centre and 
<br/>Levuka Town Hall.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  washroom  facilities  owned  by  Municipal  Councils  are  disabled-
<br/>friendly  and  has  access  to  wheelchairs  as  well.    These  facilities  can  be  found  at  the  following 
<br/>locations, in:  
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Pool,  Suva  City  Library,  Ram  Lakhan  Park,  Samabula  Public  Convenience  and  Sukhu 
<br/>Park.  
<br/>Lami - Tika Ram Park. 
<br/>Nasinu - Laqere Market. 
<br/>Nausori - Nausori Main Market. 
<br/>Korovou - Restroom which was built recently. 
<br/>Sigatoka – Sigatoka Public Convenience; 
<br/>Nadi - Namaka Market and Nadi Market, Nadi Bus Station and Civic Centre. 
<br/>Lautoka - all public convenience, including the main market and Tavakubu Market. 
<br/>Rakiraki - Disabled-friendly wash facilities. 
<br/>Ba - Disabled-friendly wash facilities.  
<br/>Levuka - Disabled-friendly wash facilities. 
<br/>Labasa - Disabled-friendly wash facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that a lot has been done in this area and I also want to now talk 
<br/>about the car parks.  There are car parking spaces specifically marked for people with disabilities.  
<br/>Disabled  car  parking  spaces  are  available  at  Laqere  Market,  Valelevu  Market,  Sigatoka  Town, 
<br/>Namaka Market, Levuka Town Hall, Labasa Market, Labasa Civic Centre, MPI Car Park, Market 
<br/>Car Park, Foreshore Car Park, Central Car Park behind old Regal, and Civic Car Park.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to these facilities, proper road markings and disabled signage have been placed 
<br/>on  the  footpaths  around  Suva,  Lami  and  Sigatoka.    This  has  been  possible  through  consultations 
<br/>between  Municipal  Councils  and  FRA.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Municipal  Councils  and  FRA  are 
<br/></span><span>further collaborating to improve walkways in the town centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to reiterate that all new Municipal Council projects undertaken are 
<br/>designed to be disabled-friendly.  Municipal Councils have been tasked to provide simple access and 
<br/>facilities for people with disability, in accordance with the legislative requirements and the standard 
<br/>that we have.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to,  once  again,  remind  honourable  Niko 
<br/>Nawaikula that he needs to move away from his favourite line, that ‘the Government is doing nothing 
<br/>and absolutely nothing’.  I hope the list that I have presented will convince him that a lot has happened 
<br/>in a very short time, considering that the Government signed the Convention and ratified in 2017, 
<br/>and during that period we have achieved quite a bit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution, as a Member of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Public Accounts Committee, in support of the motion before this House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I comment on the recommendations of the Committee in this Report, 
<br/>I would like to take this time to acknowledge the great support and guidance provided to me by the 
<br/>late </span><span>Turaga na Roko Tui Waimaro</span><span>, Ratu Peceli Ro Seru Tuisese, whose vision and leadership for his 
<br/>people  span  decades  which  included  his  service  to  Governments  from  the  colonial  era  to  post-
<br/>Independent, especially in the Province of Naitasiri.  The late Ro Seru is also known as someone who 
<br/>wore the Fijian Rugby Jersey when representing Fiji in the sport of rugby here in Fiji and abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  late  Ro  Seru  Tuisese’s  dedication  to  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  and  the  </span><span>lotu</span><span>  will  be 
<br/>remembered, and I will remain deeply indebted for it was under his solid leadership as the Chairman 
<br/>of the </span><span>Bose Vanua o Naitasiri</span><span> that my political career was endorsed and supported in the last eight 
<br/>years.  His words of wisdom will continue to inspire me as I continue to serve our people of Naitasiri 
<br/>and this great nation of Fiji. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu na Gone Turaga na Roko Tui Waimaro</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the recommendations of the Report that is debated before this 
<br/>House today.  Sir, this Report was compiled by the Committee when there were COVID-19 safety 
<br/>restrictions  in  place  and  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts  explored  Standing  Order 
<br/>112(1)(b) to gather responses through the use of written responses from stakeholders, limiting the 
<br/>Committee to carry out its role fully in exploring this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we thank the Government that the lifting of the curfew and some restrictions 
<br/>will  allow  the  Committee  to  meet  more  than  the  normal  current  three  days,  to  allow  for  proper 
<br/>deliberations with the stakeholders highlighted in the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report and, 
<br/>therefore, allows the Committee to properly scrutinise the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as already been alluded to by previous speakers on both sides of the House, 
<br/>the rights of persons with disabilities is provided for under Section 42 of the 2013 Constitution. Fiji 
<br/>became  a  signatory  to  the  United  Nations  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disabilities 
<br/></span><span>(UNCRPD) on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> June, 2010, and ratified it in 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Performance Audit conducted by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General  is  warranted  to  make  an  assessment  on  the  progress  made  on  the  ground  against  the 
<br/>commitment  by  Government  regarding  the  provision  of  accessing  of  mobility  for  persons  with 
<br/>disability.  On Recommendation No.1, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which states, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The National  Council for Persons with  Disabilities (NCPD) as  a Government 
<br/>place  entity,  has  been  recommended  to  honour  its  international  commitment  through 
<br/>national policies, action plans, reliable data and adequate resources with its other national 
<br/>stakeholders.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Report by the Office of the Auditor-General has highlighted that Fiji 
<br/>has  been  a  signatory  to  a  number  of  international  and  regional  framework  like  the  Beijing 
<br/>Proclamation and Agenda for Action, the Asian and Pacific Decade of Disabled Persons, the Biwako 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Framework, the  Incheon Strategy, the Sendai  Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 
<br/>and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General in its assessment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has noted that whilst 
<br/>there are international and regional obligations in place, there is not enough enforcement in place due 
<br/>to  lack  of  institutional  knowledge  from  staff  within  the  enforcement  and  policy-making  area, 
<br/>competing interests of implementing agencies, lack of resources, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, the Honourable Minister responsible for transport would take note of this, but the 
<br/>Committee noted that inquiries made by the Office of the Auditor-General into the achievements of 
<br/>the  Fiji  Human  Rights  Disability  Action  Plan  developed  by  the  Fiji  Human  Rights  and  Anti-
<br/>Discrimination Commission  were not  being facilitated as the Plan has been developed during the 
<br/>period  the  current  Commission  was  not  serving  in  office.    Thus,  the  Plan  according  to  the 
<br/>Commission, belonged to their predecessors, thus limiting their institutional memory and knowledge. 
<br/>So, there you go, Mr. Speaker, maybe the honourable Minister could be made aware by now that 
<br/>commitments to the disability had started way back before this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the comments by the Commission and perhaps, the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General would come up with a commitment on the work of the Commission, is very worrying.  The 
<br/>principle in any government setting is that, the retention of crucial knowledge emphasises the need 
<br/>for good documentation in data collection, to allow for those who will enter the institution at a later 
<br/>stage to not put to waste all the hard work done before them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst they may scoff at the work of those who preceded them in that office, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it is important to emphasise that the call made by their predecessors are Government endorsed 
<br/>policies of the time and must be respected for the time and resources spent to achieve those plans , 
<br/>Sir.  Anything less is a waste of taxpayers’ funds and an assault on the process of democracy and its 
<br/>governance principles that point to an abhorrent of the role of public policy and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current status of the Commission and their responses also 
<br/>highlights the need to ensure that staff retention is emphasised, and this is what this side of the House 
<br/>has  always  been  voicing  in  this  Parliament  over  the  years.    The  short-term  contracts  in  place  by 
<br/>Government is a classic example of the poor institutional memory that will be experienced, not only 
<br/>for  the  Commission  but  also  to  other  institutions  of  Government,  and  this  has  to  be  improved  as 
<br/>institutions has been highlighted in the OAG’s Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also raises the question on whether the Open Merit Recruitment System (OMRS) recruited 
<br/></span><span>by this FijiFirst Government is achieving its intended purposes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I think there is 
<br/>a lot of improvement needed in this area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- On Recommendation No. 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it states that the 
<br/>NCPD  is  also  tasked  to  carryout  periodic  reviews  of  such  commitments  for  the  purpose  of 
<br/>determining  their  continued  relevance  of  local,  regional  and  international  realities  on  disability 
<br/>issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  OAG  has  highlighted  that  it  has  noted  the  challenges  in  the  actual 
<br/>execution  and  implementation  of  the  disability  policies  which  points  to  the  lack  of  adequate  and 
<br/>proper consultations undertaken with the relevant stakeholders, Ministries and Departments, NGOs, 
<br/>CSOs and, sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this trend seems to be continuing.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>315 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  OAG  also  emphasised  the  need  to  report  on  the  achievements  and  progress  over  the 
<br/>period concerned on specific areas, such as the review of the National Building Code, formulation of 
<br/>the  Code  in  Practice  for  Disabled  Access  to  Buildings,  et  cetera.    These  accessibility  audit  will 
<br/>benchmark on the status of disability access in Fiji, which can reflect and include a review of public 
<br/>regulations, such as the Land Transport Authority (LTA) Public Service Vehicles Regulations 2015, 
<br/>which requires public service vehicle owners to ensure that their vehicle is user-friendly for persons 
<br/>with physical disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  OAG  has  noted  that  whilst  the  amendment  to  the  Land  Transport 
<br/>Authority (PSV) Regulations was made in  July  2015 through  Legal  Notice No. 66, the  LTA  and 
<br/>Department of Transport Management did  not have the knowledge of these amendments,  despite 
<br/>them  knowing  that  some  work  was  undertaken  with  regards  to  priority  sitting  in  public  service 
<br/>vehicles and line markings for disabled persons, as has already been alluded to by my colleague. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If what is said is indeed correct, Mr. Speaker, Sir, then someone again is sleeping on the job 
<br/>at the Land Transport Authority.  It is the role of the Legal Unit to educate its board and at all times 
<br/>of any changes in the law that are being made that will impact them and I expect better from the Land 
<br/>Transport Authority.  The same implementation audit can be done for airports and airlines which can 
<br/>determine their status on the accessibility structures in place for disabled people for their mobility, 
<br/>safety and travel in comfort. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reviews must be done in a timely manner and emphasis must be given 
<br/>to ensure compliance to the necessary infrastructure provisions.  For maritime and air transportation, 
<br/>inclusion  of  disable  accessible  provisions  is  yet  to  be  effected  as  already  been  alluded  by  my 
<br/>colleagues and consistent compliance to international commitments must be done to allow for the 
<br/>recognition of actual implementation to cater for this crucial sector of our domestic society as well 
<br/>as to external. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to refer the Members of this side of the House to page 27 of the Report which 
<br/>significantly highlights the commitment and the work that has been done in terms of percentage for 
<br/>the  respective  areas  in  the  Land  Transport  Authority  and  the  Maritime  Safety  Authority  and  the 
<br/>airports and airlines which shows a minimal commitment in terms of percentage achievements for 
<br/>the respective institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  this  Performance  Audit  is  being  recommended  will 
<br/>achieve, is also the need for timely and effective consultation that are identified and already being 
<br/></span><span>highlighted by my colleagues to bridge the social gaps in our communities.  The importance of the 
<br/></span><span>contribution of our people with disabilities must be appreciated and it is my firm opinion that when 
<br/>they are offered the proper facilities and amenities to assist them in their mobility, they will have 
<br/>much more to offer our nation in terms of economic, social and political contributions, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.    It  is  thus  incumbent  for  all  necessary  stakeholders  especially  our  government  supported 
<br/>institutions to do justice to the various policies that our people with disabilities deserve for today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Report of the Auditor-General 
<br/>on the Performance Audit on the Access for Persons Living with Disabilities to public offices and 
<br/>public  transport.  I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Report on the review of the Performance Audit and the Access of Persons Living with Disabilities to 
<br/>public offices and public transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should be noted that the Bill was passed in 2018 and the Performance 
<br/>Audit Report done by the Auditor-General’s Office was done in 2019 so obviously this was a rushed

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report.  From the time this Report was published, a lot of progressive work has been done and it has 
<br/>been highlighted by the Members on this side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.S. AKBAR.- We must acknowledge work that is being done.  No government, I must 
<br/>say, has made a budgetary line in the budget report on disability.  I must also acknowledge the work 
<br/>done by the National Council of Persons Living with Disability, it is a statutory body, it has a budget 
<br/>on its own and it works closely with my Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have close to 113,000 people who fall within the disability group.  While 
<br/>it is not possible to reach everyone, there are some unreported cases, the Ministry does reach out to 
<br/>the  persons  living  with  disability  in  many  other  forms.    These  two  reports  have  highlighted  the 
<br/>accessibility  issues  that  organisations  for  persons  with  disability  have  been  advocating  for.    The 
<br/>Report gives the Government a baseline on what is in existence. Of course, we must note what is in 
<br/>existence and the areas to be strengthened to ensure that the inclusion of persons with disability to 
<br/>fully participate without prejudice or discrimination as well as their ability to easily access public 
<br/>services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note that you mentioned, it is very difficult to climb the steps of the buses. 
<br/>Most of the buses in the country are old and the new buses obviously have some provisions.  I must 
<br/>say honourable Nawaikula you are not the only one who travels by bus. I have heard you say that so 
<br/>many times, I took the bus from here, we do that too.  We have done it and we still do it.  So let us 
<br/>not say that the Opposition takes the bus and the Government takes the vehicle.  Let us not go there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Fiji ratified the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of Persons 
<br/>with Disabilities in 2017, the Government has been approaching disability on a twin-track approach.  
<br/>While we provide grants to make homes and immediate living spaces more accessible to persons as 
<br/>mentioned by the Minister for Local Government and other relevant ministries, we work in trying to 
<br/>get more comfort to our disabled persons.  We provide disability grants, we have transport assistance, 
<br/>we provide economic empowerment to persons living with disability, school grants and a number of 
<br/>things that the Government has put in place. So to come here and say that nothing has been done to 
<br/>look after our disabled persons, let me say is hogwash.  I learnt that from my honourable colleague.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NCPD had discussed with the auditors the gaps that existed in the Policy 
<br/>of  2008  and  2018.  This  was  raised  at  the  district  level  during  the  consultations  on  the  Rights  of 
<br/></span><span>Persons with Disability Act 2018 and on the lack of awareness on the policy and implementation 
<br/></span><span>process. In order to bridge that, a five- year implementation plan was endorsed to help the NCPD 
<br/>with the stakeholders and other organisations that look after persons with disability to address these 
<br/>issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please  allow  me  to  address  the  recommendations  in  the  Report  of  the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Public Accounts 2021. Fiji has an accessibility policy that exists throughout 
<br/>relevant Government institutions. Again as mentioned by my colleagues from this side, however, as 
<br/>mentioned on Page 9 of the Auditor’s Report, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“While international and regional obligations are incorporated in national policy and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>action plan, several opportunities exist to improve efforts to implement them.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  audit  further  elaborates  on  weak  enforcement.  This  is  due  to  lack  of  institutional 
<br/>knowledge within the enforcement and policy arm.  I wish to inform this august House that objective 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>317 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.2  of  the  Implementation  Plan  for  rights  of  persons  living  with  disability  reflect  the  need  for 
<br/>institutional strengthening which includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Training on the Act - capacity building for the eight Disability Advisory Committees. We 
<br/>have 18 District Disability Committees and Council Members. This includes resourcing of 
<br/>activities  through  decentralising  of  disability  services  that  are  predominantly  located  in 
<br/>Suva and in no other district.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reconstruction, operations and the opening of the Western Disability Centre, a couple 
<br/>of months back is going to decentralise the work in relation to disability in the Western 
<br/>Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  ratification  of  the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with 
<br/>Disabilities by the Fijian Government has agreed to these principles of Convention.  These principles 
<br/>are  further  amplified  on  the  Rights  of  Persons  with  Disability  Act  2018.  In  strengthening  the 
<br/>recognition on the rights of persons with disability, Fiji has also began revising its policy to ensure 
<br/>our  compliance  to  the  ratified  UN  Convention.   In  addition,  the  budgetary  processes  which  were 
<br/>included for organisations with persons with disability is part of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2017, the Fijian Government introduced an accessibility budget in all relevant ministries.  
<br/>For example, through the special schools which are now accessible as inclusive schools are slowly 
<br/>complying with that. But at present, reasonable accommodation is being practiced. For example, we 
<br/>have special schools and special schools have special grants.  Special schools have a set of buildings 
<br/>which are accessible, and special schools have special grant.  Special schools have certain buildings 
<br/>which are accessible to the students and these grants are more than what the normal school would 
<br/>have and this is used to buy assistive devices for the children.  For example, if a class has a child with 
<br/>disability, he or she is supposed to be located at the bottom floor of the building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  things  are  being  progressively  done  and  in  2017,  representative  organisations  for 
<br/>persons  with  disabilities,  for  the  first  time,  were  invited  to  be  part  of  the  budget  consultations.  
<br/>Reasonable accommodation was provided in which the honourable Minister for Economy with this 
<br/>team  consulted  with  these  organisations  at  the  NCDP  Complex.    This  ensured  that  people  with 
<br/>disabilities, their voices were heard.  We are happy to report that in the same year, as I mentioned 
<br/>earlier on, specific disability budget lines appeared in the national budget and that goes to show Fiji’s 
<br/>commitment to Recommendation 3.1.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to inform the august House, there is so much talk about public transport.  The LTA has 
<br/></span><span>carried  out  awareness  to  respective  public  transport  associations  in  relation  to  access  to  public 
<br/>transport for people with disabilities.  Furthermore, LTA is conducting consultations including the 
<br/>industry impact assessment which was delayed due to the second wave of COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a current requirement under the quality assurance maintenance system for 
<br/>buses  indicates  the  allocation  of  priority  seating  in  the  first  two  rows  dedicated  to  people  with 
<br/>disabilities.  You do not need a sign board, you do not need a sign, if you see a person on a wheel 
<br/>chair, with crutches or with some sort of supportive walking device entering the bus, I am sure we 
<br/>Fijians can do our part.  Let us not look the other way because you have to give up your seat. Some 
<br/>of us do that, we look the other way. Let us provide all the assistance that we can do to these people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember in 2015, I stand to be corrected, we started an initiative – </span><span>Show You Care Initiative</span><span>
<br/>by the Ministry of Women.  I think it is time to  go back to that but  again, as Fijians,  I appeal to 
<br/>people, whenever  you see a person with  some form  of disability and  I think disabilities are quite 
<br/>conspicuous, we can give up our seat but I would encourage the buses to have those seats located.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  bus  companies  have  been  requested  to  adhere  to  this  quality  assurance  maintenance  system.  
<br/>However, there could be non-compliance issues but we can work with that to ensure that if we need 
<br/>to put the sign, well there has to be a sign, if it is not there, well we need to put it there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, I can assure the august House that since tabling the Report of 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General, the Fijian Government, NCDP machinery, partners like Pacific 
<br/>Disability Forum, ESCAP, International Disability Alliance and all donor partners are all working 
<br/>together to improve accessibility issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry with our budgetary allocations and work with our partners is 
<br/>also  helping  out  with  wheelchairs  and  other  assistive  devices.    I  understand  wheelchair  is  a  very 
<br/>expensive commodity but we try to assist people when requests come to us and we will continue to 
<br/>do so.  That is again a commitment by the Government through its budgetary allocation.  Let me 
<br/>finish  with  the  universal  motto  -  Nothing  About  Us  Without  Us  –  symbolises  the  principle  of 
<br/>participation and it has been by organisations of persons with disabilities in Fiji throughout the years 
<br/>to achieve the full participation and equalisation of opportunities for and by and with persons with 
<br/>disability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, since ratification, has delivered on its promises to persons with disabilities. This 
<br/>includes the introduction of disability allowance, social and economic empowerment of persons with 
<br/>disabilities, grants to organisations for persons with disability, housing assistance for persons with 
<br/>disability, early childhood intervention funding to Frank Hilton organisation, sporting grants, grants 
<br/>to special organisations, special education and disability scholarships of higher education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Government is fully committed and we will continue to enable our public spaces 
<br/>and transport fully accessible in order to fulfil its commitment to an inclusive, barrier-free and rights-
<br/>based society for persons with disability.  It is not right to come here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and talk all 
<br/>negative that the Government has not done this, not done that. We have a Government that is fully 
<br/>committed.  In some  areas, of course,  where structures have  already  been  built,  getting owners to 
<br/>make sure that buildings are disability friendly, is going to take some time.  But we are doing all that 
<br/>is in our capacity to make sure that we honour the international and local commitments that we have, 
<br/>and the rights of all persons is protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to say, “thank you very 
<br/>much” to the Committee for the Report, with just a few brief comments.   Yes, absolutely, we all 
<br/>know that our Constitution protects the rights of people living with disabilities and we have ratified 
<br/></span><span>the  UN  Convention  on  the  Rights  of  People  with  Disabilities.    We  have  heard  today  about  the 
<br/></span><span>stakeholder involvement, stakeholder engagement, the consultations and the many, many meetings 
<br/>that have happened, both with the public and private sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that though, I would like to touch on very quickly on the question of access, and 
<br/>I would like to start right here in Parliament, Mr. Speaker.  The access for people using wheelchairs 
<br/>up the stairs at the front of Parliament is not available, and there is no notice there for people who 
<br/>might like to come to their Parliament that access can be gained from going around the back, past the 
<br/>front door to the honourable Prime Minister’s Office.  So, that might be something we could think 
<br/>about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, something close to my heart as  well is rural  access and maybe I will start from 
<br/>where  I  am  from in  Naitasiri,  where  a lot of us are forced to  get  on carriers.   Buses are difficult 
<br/>enough and carriers are even worse.  And to go to the maritime zone, I think one of the problems is 
<br/>that the second-hand vessels that are being brought in by ship-owners to be used as passenger vessels, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>319 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are just not disability friendly and to make them so, would mean a huge outlay for the ship-owners.  
<br/>So, this is just something perhaps, for MSAF to think about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, indulge me, Mr. Speaker, I just want to digress very briefly and reply to honourable 
<br/>Koya and honourable Akbar, they might not remember that in the 2020-2021 National Budget, the 
<br/>Ministry of Housing’s budget was cut and that resulted in Habitat for Humanity losing their $0.5 
<br/>million dollar grant.  It meant at that time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is still meaning that now, that 
<br/>people living with disabilities will continue to be prisoners in their own homes because of that lack 
<br/>of funding to NGOs, like Habitat for Humanity, because the simple changes cannot be made to their 
<br/>homes to allow them to have things such as, widened doors and levelling of floors so that wheelchairs 
<br/>can roll out.  They also built purpose-built bathrooms.  This brought dignity to people who are living 
<br/>with disabilities because they could take themselves to the bathroom and toilet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Providing this assistance to families who live with disabilities also focusses on their carers 
<br/>and as we all know, they are mostly the women and young adults who are not able to live their lives 
<br/>normally because inevitably, the job of being a caregiver would fall on the shoulders of the women 
<br/>and older girls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At that point in time, that NGO came across people living disabilities who had not even been 
<br/>out of their home for months but as I have said, Mr. Speaker, I would digress very briefly into the 
<br/>lives at home of people living with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  coming  back,  what  is  missing?    I  have  heard  enforcement  is  missing,  information  is 
<br/>missing, resourcing, finances, again, and I think very importantly, empathy is also missing.  I would 
<br/>like to  invite all honourable Members, if  you have not  been to  the FNCDP Complex at  3 Brown 
<br/>Street in Suva, please, make an appointment and go and visit them.  At this juncture, I would like to 
<br/>say thank you very much to the honourable Members of the Committee and those who made public 
<br/>submissions, and especially to the people at 3 Brown Street in Suva for all the work that they continue 
<br/>to do and, in fact, also to all members of the disability community around Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>for the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  few  points  in  respect  of  the 
<br/>comments in particular that have been made both, in the Report itself and those people who have 
<br/>contributed to this debate which is actually quite healthy in respect of picking out some of the matters 
<br/>pertaining to persons with disability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to set the whole framework and actually for the first time, 
<br/></span><span>we have a Constitution that specifically recognises the rights of persons with disability. A specific 
<br/>provision in the Constitution - Section 42 and Honourable Leawere read that particular provision, I 
<br/>thank  him  for  relying  on  the  Constitution  and  also  Section  26  which  is  the  non-discriminatory 
<br/>provision in the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from  that actually then stems  the whole ethos, the whole policy 
<br/>drive about what we should do in the disability space.  So, we have seen, as highlighted by honourable 
<br/>Members on this side of Parliament, that we now have sign language interpreters for Parliamentary 
<br/>session, we see some of the new stations now having sign language and it has become more the norm 
<br/>than the exception, which never happened previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just also remind honourable Members of Parliament that for the first time 
<br/>and one of the very few countries in the world where the Constitution actually is translated into the 
<br/>braille language - the English language and the i Taukei language is in the braille language.  So, any 
<br/>person  with  disability,  in  particular,  who  cannot  read  and  does  not  have  eyesight  can  read  the

<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Constitution itself.  I think that in itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very empowering and does send a very 
<br/>strong message.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of the issues have, in fact, been highlighted but I fail to grasp the logic.  Honourable 
<br/>Radrodro is very, sort of, lying focussed on one particular budget line item.  As we have seen, for 
<br/>example, with women or youth groups, when we look at budgetary allocation, we need to look at it 
<br/>holistically.  It not only rests with the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, it is the 
<br/>entire budget, and I would like to read that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the allocation for disability is, 
<br/>in fact, spread throughout a number of Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will read the  actuals  for last  year’s Budget.  We spent  $9 million  through Allowance  for 
<br/>Persons with Disability, and again, let me reiterate, never before in Fiji that persons with disability 
<br/>actually receive a monthly allowance - $90.  It is a modest sum. We would like to, of course, increase 
<br/>it but the fact is, it has been introduced for the first time and she knows that it was never done before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Grants to Organisations for Persons with Disability - $379,428.35 (  I am talking about 2020-
<br/>2021); Economic Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities - $4,000; Implementation on Rights of 
<br/>Person  with  Disabilities  under  the  Disability  Act  -  $10,755;  Fiji  Council  for  Disabled  Persons  -
<br/>$416,567.57; Bus Fare Programme for Old/Disabled Persons (or Elderly Persons) - $3.45 million; 
<br/>Western Disability Centre - did not exist in the West and a new one has been built and the completion 
<br/>for the last round was $237,000. Overall cost is $800,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Grant to Hilton Special School - Early Intervention - $652,000. We have been giving them 
<br/>this  grant  since  2017-2018  and,  in  fact,  more  than  $652,000.  Scholarship  Schemes  for  Special 
<br/>Children or Special Need Students - $194,000. We now have disabled blind students, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, who actually are now graduates at university level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Grant  to  Special  Schools  -  Special  Education  -$772,930;  Mental  Health 
<br/>Awareness  -  $17,331;  Prosthetic  Unit  -  $46,579;  Crutches  -  $9,905;  Fiji  Albinism  Awareness 
<br/>Programme -$9,139.  This was the actual spend which is $15.15 million last year alone, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So  far,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  2016-2017  financial  year,  a  total  of  $62  million  has  been 
<br/>expended in  this particular space.  This  year’s  Budget,  we have $18.9 million  allocated for these 
<br/>respective areas.  So, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is very short-sightedness on the part of the 
<br/>Opposition to just look at one-line item.  They need to look at it holistically as to what the spend is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More specifically regarding this particular audit, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point has been made 
<br/>that when you actually have a new law in place and then within one year, you want to look at your 
<br/>ability to perform under the law, in particular if you are going to address decades and decades, in 
<br/>fact, a hundred years of neglect of that particular sector, then obviously the audit does not carry much 
<br/>merit, so that is the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way the Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, did so with the SDG performance.  
<br/>Within one year of the announcement of the SDG, then they simply then said, “Alright, let us do an 
<br/>audit as to how we are performing under this”, that is the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Nawaikula said that the Office of the Auditor-General is the 
<br/>only independent office. He does not actually acknowledge the fact that honourable Members of this 
<br/>Parliament, particularly from the other side, have attacked other independent organisations, including 
<br/>the Judiciary.  So, suddenly it now suits them to say, “The OAG is the only independent body.”  This 
<br/>level of hypocrisy really should not exist, we would not have a good healthy debate.

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>321 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to also make is that, with persons with disability and 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport (I think) mentioned that when 
<br/>you look at disability, it is also about their ability to access income.  Their ability to be mainstreamed 
<br/>into society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2016,  we  started  a  300  per  cent  tax  deduction  for  any  organisation  or  employer  that 
<br/>employs a disabled person.  If they employ them, they are able to claim a 300 per cent tax deduction 
<br/>on the salary that they paid them for the year.  In 2019-2020, we increased it to 400 per cent, so we 
<br/>are encouraging employers to actually employ persons with disability.  We need to look all of these 
<br/>holistically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation also highlighted the 
<br/>buses.  Some of them are fairly old.  We have reduced the duty, in fact, zero-rated duty so that bus 
<br/>companies can import newer buses with newer technology.  In fact, most of the buses in Fiji are fairly 
<br/>high, as we all know, Sir, so now we have to do a retrofitting of those buses.  The question is, someone 
<br/>needs to bear the cost and let me bring you a point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Nawaikula said, “Disabled persons used to get the free bus fare.”  He actually 
<br/>failed to mentioned, again, being disingenuous that in roundabout 2008-2009, when the world price 
<br/>of fuel escalated to about US$145 a barrel, the bus companies which are all privately-owned in Fiji 
<br/>were clamouring for bus fare increase.  At that time the Government then struck a deal with them, 
<br/>“Alright, we will increase the bus fare but you must make persons with disability to travel for free.”  
<br/>Even taxi companies or taxi owners agreed to carry them with a particular level of discount.  That is 
<br/>how free bus fare started.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After a few years, the bus companies came back and said, “We no longer want to carry them 
<br/>for free.”  That is when we started the bus fare voucher system.  Then, of course, we have the e-
<br/>ticketing cards for them.  That is how we started so, again, he is not giving full information.  That is 
<br/>how it started, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, of course, we had also asked them to carry people over the age of 65 years for free.  
<br/>They said, “No, we are not going to do that anymore”, so then we started the Bus Fare Subsidy for 
<br/>all the pensioners.  That is what we did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, there has been some reduction in the transportation allowance that was given because of 
<br/>COVID-19.  We were asked this in the Wainunu area, honourable Nawaikula, where you come from 
<br/></span><span>in that area. People actually asked, “Why has the bus fare allowance been reduced?”  We explained 
<br/></span><span>to them why, and they actually understood more than you, honourable Nawaikula. They understood 
<br/>that, they appreciated the fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What they were also very complimentary about was the fact that now, disabled people and 
<br/>ordinary people can take advantage of the fact that through Fiji Roads Authority and the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural  Development  and  the  Commissioner’s  Office,  a  number  of  crossings  have  not  been  only 
<br/>retrofitted but, in fact, completely replaced with new ones and they can now have better access to 
<br/>Savusavu and various other places. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I wish to also make is that, we have talked a lot about the 
<br/>Fiji Human Rights Commission, honourable Radrodro.  Of course, Commissioners change and of 
<br/>course that knowledge transfer needs to be there and knowledge transfer does take place.  And we 
<br/>have,  if  you  see  the  Human  Rights  Commission  used  to  be  known  only  as  the  Human  Rights 
<br/>Commission  but  it  is  now  called  as  the  Fiji  Human  Rights  and  Anti-Discrimination  Commission 
<br/>precisely for these reasons because we have seen tremendously throughout our history that persons

<div><span>Review Report - Performance Audit on the Access of Persons  
<br/>With Disabilities to Public Offices &amp; Public Transport 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with disability have also been discriminated as have been women and other groups that have been on 
<br/>the margins. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have allowed the Rapporteur on Albinism to come to Fiji, look at our policies, they have 
<br/>visited Fiji and looked at how we can improve our particular policies.  The last point I wanted to 
<br/>make is that this specific report, I do not think the report actually makes a mention of the fact that 
<br/>public transportation in Fiji is privately owned.  It is all privately owned.  Government does not run 
<br/>those bus services, it is privately owned.  We have seen in the past, particular bus companies take the 
<br/>latitude because they are the only bus operator in their particular area, decide not to run their bus 
<br/>service.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the hard core realties we have to deal with.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are currently looking at, for example, how we can encourage more private sector players 
<br/>to  in  fact  participate  in  our  objective  to  ensure  that  we  have  access  to  transportation.    We  have 
<br/>announced that we are building a bus terminal for what we call the suburban terminal services in 
<br/>Valelevu.  Work has already been tendered out.  As we are talking to LTA, one of the requirements 
<br/>will be that the buses that will run in this area will be smaller buses but they must have the ability to 
<br/>have disabled persons board and off-board in a friendly manner, which requires that, the lower buses 
<br/>in fact it is a lot easier for them to lower the steps down so people with disability or people with 
<br/>wheelchairs can actually get on the buses because that is one of the requirements now, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  So, a lot of work in fact has been done behind the scenes and a lot of work is currently being 
<br/>done.  I am sure if the Auditor-General wanted to look at performance, if the Auditor-General actually 
<br/>looked at the performance from the perspective of how much money has been allocated, we would 
<br/>have got a different report altogether.  They know that within one year you cannot retrofit all the 
<br/>buses in Fiji - everybody knows that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, they have not acknowledged the fact that now FRA has been doing it for 
<br/>the past few years, if you go down Suva now, a lot of the footpaths actually have a ramp. Before, 
<br/>they never had ramps, so if I am on a wheelchair, if I want to cross the road, I have to go with this 
<br/>bump. Now, most of them actually have a ramp. Of course, lot more needs to be done but there was 
<br/>a specific funding allocation as honourable Bala will tell you and Minister for Infrastructure where 
<br/>we said break down the cement, put a ramp. So, that is all being done because there is no point getting 
<br/>on the bus, when we get off the bus then you cannot access the footpath.   A lot work in fact has been 
<br/>done and unfortunately the OAG once again has very miserably failed to take a holistic view of it.  
<br/>And also carried out an audit in a specific area where they know even beforehand  your ability to 
<br/>comply with these standards will be very difficult to meet within one year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think we need to see the wood from the trees and that is, we need to look 
<br/></span><span>at the big picture.  Of course lot more needs to be done and of course I am sure that maybe the LTA 
<br/>at certain times are not necessarily enforcing that but that in itself bags a moral question - here we 
<br/>are in Fiji, through the Minister for Transport put in place regulations to tell bus companies to make 
<br/>sure they carry disabled persons and make sure they reserve seats for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In many countries, the corporates themselves, the bus companies themselves will come up 
<br/>with their own policy.  They will do it themselves but here we have to handhold every single thing.  
<br/>We have to tell them, make sure your bus driver stops otherwise it is an offence, make sure you keep 
<br/>the first two rows of the seats otherwise it is an offence, make sure you put a signage.  So, we need 
<br/>to look at overall our attitude.  Our attitude towards people with disabilities.  Is it just here for us 
<br/>grandstand in this Parliament or is it about actual moral values in how we actually value these people 
<br/>and give them a particular right in the society.  Honourable Minister Akbar said that. I think quite 
<br/>succinctly. That we ourselves need to change our attitudes too.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Committee for its report and we hope that this not 
<br/>going to be a political football and the reality of the matter is that we need to address this area and 
<br/>there is progressive realisation of these rights and we have expanded that much money and we indeed 
<br/>hope to do more so in the future.  And by the way, many of us have actually been to Brown Street 
<br/>for many decades actually and we have been down to the Frank Hilton School too, so please let us 
<br/>not patronise us by saying, “Go down to Brown Street”, just because one person may have done one 
<br/>or two visits, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all those who have actually 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributed in a positive manner, it is a sensitive issue and we need to take it positively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Chairperson.  Honourable Members, Parliament will
