<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON THE  
<br/>MINISTRY OF FISHERIES ANNUAL REPORT 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SIGARARA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017-2018, which was tabled on 17</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SIGARARA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/></span><span>I take this opportunity to speak on the motion with regards to the Standing Committee on Natural 
<br/></span><span>Resources Review Report of the Ministry of Fisheries 2017-2018 Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Report contains the findings of the Committee on the administration 
<br/>programmes, major achievements and performance of the Ministry of Fisheries during the 2017-2018 
<br/>operational year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  responsible  for  the  formulation  and  implementation  of 
<br/>policies that promote best practices, that will ensure a prosperous and enhanced fisheries sector.  The 
<br/>major functions of the Ministry can be seen in the 2017-2018 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major challenges that the Ministry encountered over the years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>is the archaic legislation going back to 1942 for the coastal fisheries community and the absence of 
<br/>any legislative regulatory framework for our aquaculture operations.

<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also during the review period, the Ministry became a standalone one and 
<br/>despite the change, the Ministry focussed on its continued service delivery, operations and ensured 
<br/>that its services to the general public and its key stakeholders were not affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee acknowledges the leadership within the Ministry and the hard work and the 
<br/>perseverance of the staff that enabled its operations to transit smoothly to the change as required by 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee valued the consistent performance of the Ministry during 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the review period and wish the same sentiments to the Ministry in the same years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  also  wish  to  acknowledge  the  current  leadership  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries and staff for the commitment shown towards meeting the legislated functions 
<br/>of  the  Ministry.      The  Committee  considers  necessary  that  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  ensures 
<br/>implementing the few recommendations put forth by the Committee for improvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  commend  the  effort  of  being  a  member  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural 
<br/>Resource in the completion of this Review Report for the Ministry of Fisheries 2017-2018 Annual 
<br/></span><span>Report.  My appreciation to the Ministry of Fisheries, the Executives for their timely contribution in 
<br/></span><span>the completion of this bipartisan Committee Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few words, as a Member moving the motion, I thank you for this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before contributing to the debate on 
<br/>the  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  may  I  ask  that  we,  as  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament,  remember  and  acknowledge  the  late  honourable  Osea  Naiqamu,  who  recently  passed 
<br/>away.  His contribution as a Cabinet Minister and as a Member of this august Parliament was, indeed, 
<br/>valuable.  May we all wish Ulukalisi Bale Naiqamu and family well with quick recovery from their 
<br/>time of grief.  May the honourable Naiqamu rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Natural Resources for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their review of the Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report for 2017 and 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give an update or response to the five recommendations that had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been highlighted by the Standing Committee in the Report itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  recommendation  is  the  formulation  of  Fiji’s  Aquaculture  Bill  and  making  it  to 
<br/>become law.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Aquaculture Bill 2016 was tabled as Bill No. 9 of 2016 in this 
<br/>august House. Due to the cautioned growth and development in aquaculture and the inclusion of new 
<br/>technologies, there is additional work needed within the drafting process.  Once this is finalised, we 
<br/>will have the appropriate legal framework to support the growth within Fiji’s Aquaculture Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recommendation  No.  2  is  to  increase  and  support  the  establishment  of 
<br/>shrimp farms, to enhance family livelihood and economic growth.  I am pleased to update this august 
<br/>House that since January 2019 and with the financial assistance provided by the Fijian Government 
<br/>and bilateral partners, we have been able to reconstruct the Caboni Multi-Species Hatchery which 
<br/>was  completed  in  December  2021.    As  a  result,  shrimp  production  has  increased  to  an  annual 
<br/>production level of 2 million post larvae every year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>361 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the increase in post larvae within our Hatchery, there is enough to be 
<br/>distributed to interested farmers.  As a matter of fact, at the end of last year, the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>through the development partners had an Open Day in Caboni, to showcase the viability of shrimp 
<br/>farms and towards the improvement of livelihood, food security and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  to  address  the  need  to  educate  aquaculture  farmers  on  new  technology, 
<br/>including  science  and  farming  methods,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  is  currently  constructing  an 
<br/>accommodation  building  in  Caboni  in  which  farmers  can  be  accommodated,  while  undertaking 
<br/>training on improved farm management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The accommodation facility would be utilised to accommodate research students, who will 
<br/>be engaged to assist our technical officers in researching on high-value fisheries products.  Moreover, 
<br/>through  the  development  partners,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  secured  improved  farming 
<br/>technology  which  includes  the  setting  up  of  a  collapsible  tank  that  has  now  been  tested  to  breed 
<br/>shrimps and other viable commodities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  optimistic  that  with  the  support  of    private  Hatcheries,  these 
<br/>developments will continue to increase with an increase in shrimp production, thus providing positive 
<br/></span><span>results towards the livelihood of the Fijian people and national economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 3, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to increase support and establishment of tilapia 
<br/>farms, to enhance food and nutrition security and family livelihood.  Firstly, I would like to thank the 
<br/>Government  for  its  continued  budgetary  support  to  aquaculture  development  through  the  Food 
<br/>Security and Freshwater Aquaculture Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  2018,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  have  received  more  than  $3  million  to  support  the 
<br/>establishment of tilapia farms, and address the need to move from subsistence to semi-commercial 
<br/>and commercial development.  In 2017 and 2018, the Ministry received a total of $600,000 budget 
<br/>to support this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  recommendation  four  on  the  establishment  of  sandfish  farm  to  enhance 
<br/>livelihood and economic growth through public and private partnership, I would like to inform this 
<br/>august House that this has been addressed through community partnership.  Through the production 
<br/>of sandfish in Galoa, we have provided more than 10,000 juvenile sandfish to communities in Serua 
<br/>as part of our reef enhancement programme.  In the next two months, juveniles should be ready for 
<br/>distribution in the Western Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  grow  out  is  taken  care  of  by  the  communities  through  MPAs  and  the 
<br/>construction of sandfish pens.  We will continue to invest in this method of grow out as it increases 
<br/>community  involvement  and  through  time  provide  economic  returns  to  our  coastal  communities.  
<br/>Lastly,  for  recommendation  five  -focus  on  being  more  vigilant  in  enforcing  the  law  concerning 
<br/>undersized  fish  and  crustacean.    Noting  the  need  to  conduct  more  enforcement  with  our  coastal 
<br/>fisheries, the Ministry of Fisheries in 2018 established the Inshore Fisheries Management Division 
<br/>with dedicated officers recruited for the sole purpose of enforcement.   Since the establishment of 
<br/>this  Division,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  has  been  able  to  address  enforcement  needs  and  more 
<br/>importantly raise awareness on legal size limits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  also  strengthened  its  collaboration  efforts  with  the  law 
<br/>enforcement agencies.  This has materialised through the formal establishment of MOUs in 2020- 
<br/>2021 with the Fiji Navy and the Fiji Police Force.   With that being highlighted, I once again would 
<br/>like to thank the Members of the Committee and I would like to reassure this august House that the

<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Fisheries is dedicated to continue to put in the needed efforts towards the growth of the 
<br/>fisheries sector.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  I rise to make a brief contribution to 
<br/>the motion on the annual report for the Ministry of Fisheries.  My contribution will focus on item six, 
<br/>that is on the SDG and 6.1 on the Gender Equality Analysis on SDG-5.  Also, I will bring to the fore 
<br/>again the importance of having appropriate budgetary allocation to this Ministry.  This is one of the 
<br/>ministries  that  I  had  made  recommendations  in  the  budgetary  debate  that  it  be  allocated  or  be 
<br/>increased in their budgetary allocation together with the Ministry of Women and having said that, I 
<br/>will just backtrack a little bit to the response of the honourable Minister for Economy in my remarks 
<br/>regarding the budgetary allocations for the debate on the performance audit for the access on transport 
<br/>and  public  offices  for  the  people  living  with  disability.    And  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  was  rather 
<br/>flabbergasted  for  that  kind  of  comment  and  it  is  very  unbecoming  coming  from  the  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy and for the Acting Prime Minister for that matter because as he knows that the budgetary 
<br/>allocation or the budget of Government is the numerical expression of the Government’s priorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And having to have that kind of allocation for a ministry like fisheries which is a big resource, 
<br/>like we are Small Island nations but we have big oceans and that is an area which we could tap into, 
<br/></span><span>given if there are adequate resources given to the Ministry, Mr. Speaker.  And I note that with the 
<br/></span><span>gender equality analysis, that gender equality has not been mainstreamed into the Ministry’s activity.  
<br/>That is very important as highlighted in this Report that rather than highlighting the contribution of 
<br/>women in terms of food security and the fisheries sector, it only highlights here the composition of 
<br/>women in the staffing at the Ministry but it does not say anything about the sex desegregated data in 
<br/>regards to women’s contribution in the fisheries sector, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And  even  though  it  is  highlighted  in  the  Report  on  the  training  that  the  Ministry  has 
<br/>undertaken but it fails to highlight on the capacity of women or how women have been included in 
<br/>the decision making in regards to the fisheries sector and what kind of assistance has been given to 
<br/>women because as we know women that do fishing contribute a lot to subsistence living especially 
<br/>in  regards  to  food  security.  If  the  Ministry  was  allocated  enough  resources,  then  that  would  also 
<br/>contribute to recommendation five in regards to the Ministry of Fisheries being resourced adequately 
<br/>to carry out the law enforcement aspect of the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  it  will  be  interesting  to  find  out  whether  the  fisheries  officer  accommodation  in 
<br/>Nabouwalu has been fully repaired because from the last time I know the officer was operating from 
<br/>his  residence,  using  it  as  an  office.    Also  his  residence  was  badly  damaged  in  the  cyclone,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker.  That is why I am mentioning the importance of having adequate resources in the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>to be able to ensure that the officers are in a position to carry their work effectively and diligently, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also another aspect that I would like to highlight is for example the NGO that we have in 
<br/>Fiji, for example, Women in Fisheries Network.  I believe it is a very good NGO and if the Ministry 
<br/>has  enough  budgetary  resources  in  its  allocation  then  these  are  the  kind  of  organisations  that  the 
<br/>Ministry could allocate grant from their budgetary allocations to ensure that there is a lot more focus 
<br/>in regards to the development and empowerment of women in the fisheries sector, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I would like to request the honourable Minister that in future annual reports that 
<br/>we have a proper gender equality analysis with regards to highlighting the contribution of women in 
<br/>the fisheries sector and also to provide some kind of desegregated data to be able to reflect the kind 
<br/>of contributions that we women make to the fisheries sector. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>363 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to make a 
<br/>very  brief  contribution  to  the  motion  and  to  thank  our  Natural  Resources  Committee  for  the 
<br/>recommendations that would greatly assist the Ministry of Fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister for acknowledging the findings of the Committee and the 
<br/>recommendations.  Sir, it makes the work of the committees of Parliament more meaningful when 
<br/>the line ministers are responding accordingly to committee reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies that promote 
<br/>best  practice,  equating  conservation  and  utilisation  that  will  ensure  a  prosperous  and  enhanced 
<br/>fisheries sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Aquaculture Division of the Ministry of Fisheries is responsible for the administration of 
<br/>the National Freshwater Species Hatchery in Naduruloulou and the satellite hatcheries in Ba, Dreketi 
<br/>and  Caboni  and  marine  species  hatchery  at  Galoa.    The  key  cultured  species  are  marine  shrimp, 
<br/>sandfish seaweed, freshwater prawns, tilapia, grass carp and ornamental fish. The other species of 
<br/>interest for research and culture include the giant clams and black-lip pearl oysters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Division administers three major projects namely Freshwater Aquaculture Development, 
<br/></span><span>Brackish  Water  Aquaculture  Development  and  Food  Security  Programme.    The  main  objectives 
<br/>being the provision of an enabling environment for the farmers and key stakeholders to address the 
<br/>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Food security by ensuring an easy access to fish; 
<br/>Protein to the rural inland communities; 
<br/>Improve livelihoods; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Rural  development  through  involvement  of  women  and  youth  groups  into  aquaculture 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activities; 
<br/>Income  generation  and  employment  creation  for  rural  and  peri-urban  populations;  and 
<br/>Import substitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  recognising  the  growing  market  demand  for  sustainable  aquaculture  produced  marine 
<br/>fish, the Division can grow and sell high quality, competitively priced, safe and delicious fish using 
<br/>innovative technology while preserving the environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I have just discussed at length is the potential of the aquaculture market here in Fiji to 
<br/></span><span>boost the fisheries sector and our economy but it saddens me Sir, that the Aquaculture Bill 2016, Bill 
<br/></span><span>No. 9 of 2016 has never seen the light of day.  Aquaculture in Fiji, Sir, needs the legal framework to 
<br/>support all the efforts of the Ministry of Fisheries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am asking my </span><span>weka</span><span>, the honourable Minister for Fisheries to reintroduce 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Aquaculture Bill to this honourable House.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  be  brief.  Again,  I  would  thank  the 
<br/>Committee particularly if I can request if they can improve the annual reports in having the first or 
<br/>after  the  Permanent  Secretary’s  message,  overview,  you  know  the  economic  performances 
<br/>particularly when you have these economic institutions, they are on production, on GDP contribution, 
<br/>export, import, balance of trade and maybe the trend over the years.  Then over 10 years, see the 
<br/>performance economically then we can make suggestions on ways wherever we can see weaknesses 
<br/>there or whatever.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>364 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Aquaculture  Division,  it  is  important  that  these  facilities  are 
<br/>improved.  You need to improve it to be the Pacific hub here in Fiji and we totally agree that it should 
<br/>be  financially  supported  with  expertise  so  on  and  so  forth  to  make  it  the  Pacific  hub  not  only  in 
<br/>Naduruloulou and Galoa but elsewhere throughout Fiji.  It is important to upgrade that aquaculture 
<br/>in  order  to  increase  production  and  reduce  imports  as  there  are  about  $25  million  to  $45  million 
<br/>imports that we have.  We need to reduce that by increasing our aquaculture production here in Fiji. 
<br/>So, that also would help the Aquaculture Bill, Bill No. 9 of 2016.  What is the delay here, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir?  Is it still with the Solicitor-General to correct the draft or whatever?  Is it still with the Cabinet 
<br/>or Parliament?  It is important that this Bill is reintroduced and to help the people out there in the 
<br/>field to move on with their production, processes and systems for increase output for export. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation two on shrimp farms, we totally agree with that to increase contribution 
<br/>economically and encourage increased livelihood of the people and also to increase organic farming 
<br/>and organic living.  That is where we should be going rather than going for processed foods Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  three  on  tilapia  farms,  to  increase  economic  contribution,  increase 
<br/>livelihood of the people and also increase organic farming and organic living rather than processed 
<br/></span><span>foods.  That should be important as we go ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation four - for sandfish farms, there is $8 million to $15 million export potential 
<br/>here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we need to fully support financially and with expertise and so on and so 
<br/>forth in the Bill for the upgrading of the Aquaculture Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the financial statements, a qualified opinion on operating fund account to an unreconciled 
<br/>variance of $1.7 million. That is quite a lot of money, Mr. Speaker Sir. So the emphasis here is in the 
<br/>internal control as I already mentioned. It is important that the internal control of finances within the 
<br/>Ministry do their work well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the trust fund account, the Ministry did not maintain a detailed listing of beneficiaries of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the trust account, consequently. So it is important to keep a proper listing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  other  matters,  the  Auditor-General  stated  that  internal  controls  of  revenue,  underline 
<br/>accounts and expenditure generally found to be weak. As I already emphasised, it needs improvement 
<br/>and  attention  to  get  correct  financial  statements  into  the  future.  Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to 
<br/>conclude, we need more emphasis in our primary industries- in domestic products, more funding and 
<br/></span><span>support  to  improve  facilities,  technology,  research,  expertise,  economic  performance  to  increase 
<br/></span><span>production, export, value adding for all the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  </span><span>Bula  vinaka</span><span>,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  A  big  </span><span>vinaka  vakalevu</span><span>  to  the

<br/>following year when our year end was 31</span><span>st</span><span> December or within such time as agreed to by 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary with the Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the above said in the Financial Management Act 2010, the Ministry of Fisheries 2017-
<br/>2018 Annual Report did not conform to the Act. It did directly the opposite as it was referred to by 
<br/>the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries on 9</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2019 which was almost one 
<br/>year after year end on 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 and presented to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
<br/>on Tuesday, 9</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2021 during the sitting of Parliament which was 18 months later and here 
<br/>we are on 7</span><span>th</span><span> February today, almost another year later.  Given the Financial Management Act, we 
<br/>can calculate from the 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018, the draft Financial Report should have been completed three 
<br/>months after and that is, 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2018 and the Annual Report to be presented by 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 
<br/>2019 to Parliament which is eight months later from 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 and be debated within the year 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, in this case today, 7</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022 is 43 months or 3 years 7 months later.  We 
<br/></span><span>will be debating 19 reports; 14 did not conform to the Financial Management Act.  To the Acting 
<br/>Prime Minister, Cabinet Ministers, all line Ministers and Assistant Ministers, herein is no measure 
<br/>of  accountability,  nor  credibility,  nor  transparency  and  on  time  of  our  procedures  of  our  Annual 
<br/>Report  which  begs  the  question,  how  is  the  Open  Merit  Recruitment  Selection  working  in  all 
<br/>ministries?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight the achievement of the Standing Committee of Natural 
<br/>Resources on offshore fisheries management.  During the current fiscal year of 2017-2018, a total of 
<br/>42 long line fishing licences were issued; 7 exploratory licence, 25 authorisations to fish beyond Fiji 
<br/>fisheries waters were issued.  In addition, 1,274 exports and 267 imports permits were issued from 
<br/>our Walu Bay and Lautoka offices respectively.  The division also issued 119 CITES permits for the 
<br/>fiscal year prior to the Department of Environment becoming the sole signatory as per Fiji CITES 
<br/>Management Authority meeting resolutions on 10</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2008.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major achievement for the Ministry was an anonymous decision in Parliament on 13</span><span>th</span><span> July, 
<br/>2018  to  sign  the  Port  State  Measures  Agreement  (PSMA)  to  prevent,  deter  or  eliminate  illegal, 
<br/>unreported  or  unregulated  fishing.    The  PSMA  is  a  tool  aimed  at  eliminating  illegal,  unreported, 
<br/>unregulated fishing through the development and deployment of effective Port State Measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development  of  the  draft  Offshore  Pelagic  Fisheries  Mahimahi  Management  Plan.    It  is 
<br/>anticipated  that  the  stakeholder  consultations  will  take  place  in  the  next  financial  year  before 
<br/>finalization of a draft plan. The Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) commenced on an in-
<br/>country survey of economic contribution of tuna fisheries in the Fiji economy. This survey will help 
<br/>understand the value that this important regional resource brings to Fiji and will continue into the 
<br/>next fiscal year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, achievement of the Aquaculture is such.  The Division activities targeted 
<br/>the production and distribution of freshwater and brackish water aquaculture species, together with 
<br/>extension advisory work, research and targeted trainings both local and overseas for both staff and 
<br/>farmers.  Freshwater Aquaculture Hatchery Production and Distribution: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>488,580 tilapia fries produced and distributed from hatcheries; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>158,500 prawn post larvae produced and distributed from hatcheries; 
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>14 farmers assisted under the Food Security under the 2017/2018 programme breakdown 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being four from the Central and West while there was six in the Northern Division; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Brackishwater Hatchery Production per distribution: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>647,129 brackish water shrimps post larvae produced and distributed from the hatcheries; 
<br/>30,100 sandfish juveniles produced from Galoa Hatchery and distributed to sea ranch sites 
<br/>for restocking of depleted sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the financial year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry produced 1.5 metric tonnes of seaweed 
<br/>targeted against the 100 metric tonnes that was supposed to be produced in a year.  These harvests 
<br/>were  from  Naividamu  Village  and  Nakalou  Women  Seaweed  farms  in  Macuata.  The  Ministry 
<br/>continued to assist communities in the establishment of seaweed nurseries and two were established 
<br/>during the year in Serua and Malake Islands against the target of four for the year. In addition to this, 
<br/>it assisted 13 communities with materials and drying sheds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight some recommendations in the area of development of 
<br/></span><span>draft  Offshore  Pelagic  Fishery  Mahimahi  Management  Plan.    What  is  the  status?    Draft  Pearl 
<br/></span><span>Development Plan, what is the status?  Its completion would meet the voluntary commitment made 
<br/>by Fijian Government at the United Nations Ocean Conference in New York in June, 2017. Culturing 
<br/>of  reef  fish  species  to  increase  food  security,  national  strategic  on  aqua  biosecurity  for  Fiji  in 
<br/>collaboration with PSC, what is the status?  Inshore Fishing Management Decree, what is the status? 
<br/>How will the new fees paid by the fishermen to </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> landowners be monitored? Increase issuance 
<br/>of  offshore  fisheries  license,  currently  a  quote  is  set  at  60.    Encourage  increase  and  support 
<br/>establishment  of  tilapia  to  enhance  food,  nutrition  security  and  family  livelihood,  empower  and 
<br/>encourage farmers income generations subsistence presumption.  Enforcement agencies should be 
<br/>more cautious concerning undersized fish.  Encourage the increase and support of sandfish farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Audit opinions of the Office of the Auditor-General, the Audit of the 
<br/>2018 Accounts of the Ministry of Fisheries slotted in a qualified opinion.  The qualification issues 
<br/>were the Ministry recorded a capital construction of $4,756,332 million and the capital purchase was 
<br/>$653,185  in  the  statements  of  receipt  and  the  expenditure  for  the  year  end  31st  July,  2018,  the

<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry was unable to provide payment and the journal with the payment and the journal vouchers 
<br/>totalling to $954,252 to support the above balances.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, the Office of the Auditor-General was unable to verify the completeness and the 
<br/>accuracy  of the balances and also  unable to  determine whether  any adjustments  might  have been 
<br/>necessary in respect of the capital construction and the capital purchase at the end of the financial 
<br/>year.    An  unreconciled  of  variance  of  $1,727,360  million    exists  between  Financial  Management 
<br/>Information System (FMIS), general ledger  and the Ministry’s payroll report for both the Established 
<br/>staff and Government Wage Earner.  In addition, internal controls of over payroll were generally 
<br/>found to be weak. This relates to the incorrect preparation of salary reconciliations.  Consequently, 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General was not able to establish the accuracy of the Established staff and 
<br/>Government Wage Earners balances record in the Statement of Receipts and Expenditure for the year 
<br/>end at 31st July, 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  did  not  maintain  a  detail  listing  of  beneficiaries  to  the  Trust  Account.  
<br/>Consequently, the Office of the Auditor-General was not able to substantial prudence of the closing 
<br/>balance of $261,684 were reflected in the statement of receipts and payments of the Trust Account.  
<br/>Other matter, internal records were over revenue underline accounts and expenditure were generally 
<br/></span><span>found to be weaken if not addressed properly may result in materials mis-statements.  This relate to 
<br/></span><span>the delay in banking of revenue collected and delay in preparation of online accounts reconciliation.  
<br/>Payments were also made without Local Purchase Orders being raised.  Three competitive quotations 
<br/>were not being obtained, misallocation of expenditures and payments were made without payment 
<br/>vouchers being certified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statements  of  receipts,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  allocated  a  revenue  of  $2,197,079 
<br/>million and incurred expenditure of $15,134,295 million of the year ending 31st July, 2018.  Revenue 
<br/>collected as of 31st July, 2018 were from the vessel registration which was $19,468, fishing license 
<br/>was $9,471, fish and off sale an ice was $266,028, off sea license was $1,838,670 million other fees 
<br/>were $63,442 making the total revenue of fisheries in 2018 year ending was $2,197,079 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Appropriation Statement, the Ministry had incurred expenditure of $15.1 
<br/>million in 2017 and 2018 against a revised budget of $18.8 million, resulting in a savings of $3.7 
<br/>million, resulting that you cannot do everything in the budget.  Anomalies in the payroll, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, a review of the Ministry payroll records reveal the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salaries reconciliation prepared in August 2017 to July 2018 were not dated. 
<br/>An opening balance in reconciliation for some pay periods did not agree with the closing 
<br/>balance of the previous pay reconciliation. 
<br/>The  Ministry  recommends  it  should  improve  its  reconciliation  by  including  dates  of 
<br/>preparation, checking and signing by the supervisor or officer to ensure the accountability 
<br/>of the reconciliation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You  are  the  Assistant  Minister,  you  listen,  ensure  the  closing  and  opening  balances  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accurately reflected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order!  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member 
<br/></span><span>is just reading out the pages.  There is no recommendation neither is he giving an alternative.  He is 
<br/>just reading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I had been following what you said but you are just 
<br/></span><span>repeating what is already in the Report and if you are going to make a contribution, make an original 
<br/></span><span>contribution.  Refer to the Report but do not quote the Report holus-bolus.

<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was from the Auditor-General’s Report.  It was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not in the annual report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the above anomalies, the natural resource-based sectors like fisheries and agriculture 
<br/>had a poor GDP growth in 2017 with 6.9 per cent and in 2018, a minus 14.7 per cent and in 2019, it 
<br/>was minus 4 per cent.  The agriculture sector’s GDP growth in 2017 was minus 12.7 perc ent.  I was 
<br/>just trying to compare all the natural resources, how they were performing in 2017 and 2018 which 
<br/>reflect that the economy was not even performing.  This is taken from the Bureau of Statistics, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  I would like to thank the Committee for the review of the annual report on the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries and I would like to support the motion before the House.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the 
<br/>Committee Report regarding the review of the Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report, 2017 – 2018 and 
<br/>I commend the Committee for their bipartisan efforts and the five recommendations they have put 
<br/>before us to consider.  I further note that my </span><span>kai,</span><span> the honourable Minister can be quite efficient when 
<br/>he chooses to be but I want to thank him in advance for the planned temporary lifting of the ban on 
<br/>beche-de-mer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  while  beche-de-mer  is  a  high  value  marine  species  product,  I  hope  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry’s Marine Resource Inventory Survey (MRIS) Project, as highlighted in this Annual Report, 
<br/>has  actually  given  him  firm  and  qualitative  scientific  guidance  for  harvesting  limits  during  the 
<br/>temporary lifting of the ban on </span><span>dri.</span><span>  I can appreciate the balancing act that the honourable Minister 
<br/>needs to weigh up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On one hand,  rural communities want to harvest these marine species because it is a high 
<br/>value commodity particularly for Chinese cultural cuisine but on the other hand, his own Ministry’s 
<br/>scientists  should be guiding and monitoring the  harvesting limits  of beche-de-mer  given the very 
<br/>fragile nature of these species from spawning to maturity and the integral biological role that beche-
<br/>de-mer plays in cleaning our oceans and if the Government wants to keep our oceans blue and our 
<br/>reefs alive, beche-de-mer are an essential link in that food chain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, how the Ministry manages this temporary lifting of the ban, I will 
<br/>speak  to  recommendation  one  in  this  Report.    The  Annual  Report  stated  an  intention,  “that  the 
<br/>aquaculture law will support overseas smart partners”.  But that is only as good as the regular and 
<br/>independent  scientific  national  assessments  of  beche-de-mer  stock  in  addition  to  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>impartial and robust monitoring control surveillance (MCS) system because if the Ministry cannot 
<br/></span><span>police it, then it should not be promoting it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, speaking of the Ministry own monitoring control and surveillance system, I am 
<br/>reminded of a newer and imaging issue apart from the issues in this Report and that is the horrific 
<br/>beheading of the Fijian national on board the doomed Fishing Vessel (FV Tiro II) while in Fiji waters. 
<br/>Now there seems to have been a convenient blanket of suppression of that incident and it is almost 
<br/>now as if it never happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that brings me to the numbers of offshore fishing licences detailed in the Annual Report 
<br/>and  I  have  to  wonder  if  these  offshore  fishing  licences  are  being  guided  by  scientific  stock 
<br/>assessments for highly migratory fish stocks that come near Fiji’s EEZ or whether the Ministry is 
<br/>content to continually abdicate its national responsibilities to the SPC’s Fishery Science Division in 
<br/>Noumea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Annual  Report  says  that  the  total  of  42  longline  fishing 
<br/>licences, seven exploratory licenses and 25 authorisations to fish beyond Fiji fisheries waters were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="84">Page 84</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issued in this period.  Of all these offshore fishery licenses, how many are Chinese? How many are 
<br/>Taiwanese, New Zealand, USA, European, Tuvalu or indeed local licences? There are no records of 
<br/>Illegal Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) cases of either Fiji flag vessels or vessels licenced to fish 
<br/>here in the Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Neither is there any data detailing Fiji recruited independent observers within the regional 
<br/>Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) Programme and the horrific issues that they face on board fishing 
<br/>vessels, chief among them the possibility of murder and extortion, not to mention the lack of fair 
<br/>compensation and holistic insurance cover for our independent observers.  Issues that NFP has raised 
<br/>in this House before, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also details that taxpayers should know, Mr. Speaker.  These are all details that 
<br/>taxpayers should know and the Ministry cannot afford to offload the key responsibility to the Ministry 
<br/>of Labour or the Fiji Navy or the FFA regional monitoring control and surveillance efforts because 
<br/>all this is merely at the back end of the incentives for fishing vessels permitted by the Ministry to be 
<br/>here in Fiji in the first place.   I am quite certain that the incoming U.S Secretary of State will also be 
<br/>very interested in this, given the thematic issues that are set to be discussed with us and the Pacific 
<br/>this weekend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2017-2018 Annual Report also states that Inshore Fisheries Licences - 942 were issued 
<br/>of which 226 licence were issued in  the Central  Division,  54 licences  were issued in  the Eastern 
<br/>Division, 486 were issued in the Western Division and the 176 licences were issued in the Northern 
<br/>Division.  But, Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but be more than a little bit worried about whether Fiji’s 
<br/>ocean-based protein sources have outflows greater than our inflows right now.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost similar to the national </span><span>dinau</span><span> situation that we have been talking about, taking in more 
<br/></span><span>dinau  </span><span>than we can actually pay  for.   The worry  here, Mr. Speaker, is  unlike our economic  </span><span>dinau</span><span>
<br/>situation, we cannot </span><span>dinau</span><span> fish or marine species living in our waters from the World Bank or ADB 
<br/>if we overfish what we are custodians of now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why while I commend the Ministry’s efforts as listed in the Annual Report to diversify 
<br/>and expand projects  such as ice plants and hatcheries, aluminium  boats,  prawns, shrimps, tilapia, 
<br/>sandfish, seaweed and pearl oyster farming, I would suggest that the Ministry’s priority still remain 
<br/>on the science.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the Ministry to place more funds toward biological and socio-economic surveys for 
<br/></span><span>offshore  and  customary  and  state  fishing  grounds  as  well  as  more  fisheries  impact  assessments 
<br/></span><span>especially as our reef and ocean ecosystem is under immense pressure in this present day situation 
<br/>from unemployment due to COVID-19 and forced vaccinations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And equally, more funds towards protecting our fisheries through more monitoring, control 
<br/>and  surveillance  and  urgently  amending  laws  for  tougher  penalties  as  solid  deterrents  against  the 
<br/>stealing of fish or marine species that belong to us, the people of Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief, Sir.  Just in respect to what 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Fisheries had mentioned and the previous honourable Member, last week 
<br/>when we were in Vanua Levu, there are two villages, Koroinasolo and Dawara where those villages 
<br/>depend solely in particular Koroinasolo, on beche-de-mer fishing and one of their greatest gripes was 
<br/>that there was a ban and they said it had a huge economic impact on them and so I am glad honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua had said that she did appreciate the balancing act that the Ministry of Fisheries does 
<br/>actually have to engage in and endure because here some villages actually completely depend on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>
<div><span>370 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Fisheries Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>beche-de-mer fishing and beche-de-mer of course is a very lucrative market because there is a huge 
<br/>demand for it in Asia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And so the lure of that can also of course ensure that we completely deplete our stocks and 
<br/>that is why of course the Ministry of Fisheries has put in place the bans.  So, there is a lot of pressure 
<br/>on the Ministry of Fisheries to lift up the bans.  On a wider perspective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have 
<br/>talked about the blue bonds and one of the objectives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the blue bonds is to ensure 
<br/>that we get the right amount of funding to be able to assist the Ministry of Fisheries and indeed those 
<br/>fishers whether men or women and those communities that actually depend on the marine life for 
<br/>their livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  idea  would  be  to  have  hatcheries  where  then  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  can  actually 
<br/>transfer those small baby beche-de-mer for want of a better word, where they can then go and put 
<br/>that in the wild within the area where for example in Koroinasolo, people would then sort of make 
<br/>sure it grows in the environment and then harvest that as opposed to going and getting it from the 
<br/>wild and that has been the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  mean,  we  will  see  so  many  times  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  cannot  be  everywhere  when 
<br/></span><span>people get catch, even lobsters, you know we love the fact a lot of people in Fiji love the fact that 
<br/></span><span>these lobsters have actually eggs in them and this is very tasty but just a few days ago, I was watching 
<br/>a documentary. In Australia where these people go around fishing, the moment they catch a lobster 
<br/>that has got eggs in them, they throw it back in.  In fact, they would put it back in the wild, so attitude 
<br/>of course needs to change.  I mean we have seen so many people, if you drive along the highway 
<br/>where people actually catch crabs, lobsters even they are this about this small, they will still sell it 
<br/>and people still buy it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And the Ministry of Fisheries of course is trying to build a team, honourable Salote Radrodro 
<br/>fixated obviously always on amounts of money.  We have to work within the balancing act of making 
<br/>sure for example in the past couple of years the restriction on government’s ability to spend because 
<br/>of COVID-19 but as the economy while it opens up and there is more funds available, of course more 
<br/>funds will be made available.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But I think just to inform the House that is why we are raising the blue bonds. It is to have 
<br/>sustainable fishing and give Ministry of Fisheries the access to expertise and funding to be able to 
<br/>carry out those types of exercises so we have people who do not actually go and fish from the wild 
<br/>but are actually able to grow those fishes, those beche-de-mer et cetera in their own backyard so to 
<br/></span><span>speak, in their </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> areas and then be able to then harvest that. That is the whole objective of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And also to have, you know for example encourage women to get into various other areas of 
<br/>fishing whether if it is even mariculture, aquaculture et cetera and it also includes things like aspects 
<br/>and projects like growing mangroves include seawall et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, honourable Qereqeretabua is talking about a subject matter which she is probably not 
<br/>very familiar with about </span><span>dinau.  </span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if anyone looks at the debt situation in Fiji prior to 
<br/></span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, the GDP per capita was on a downward trajectory and everyone knows that.  Those 
<br/>figures are available and obviously we had to spend over $500 million in order to rebuild schools, 
<br/>rebuild infrastructure and of  course then COVID-19 came  along, and as we have said,  it is  good 
<br/>expenditure if you are able to ensure that the funds that you do borrow goes towards socio-economic 
<br/>development and productive capacities.  Nowhere has anyone said that Fiji has the inability to repay 
<br/>its debt.  Fiji has never under any government defaulted on its debts and we most certainly do not 
<br/>intend to do so and honourable Qereqeretabua does not have that level of nuanced approach to debts.

<br/>0.01 per cent.  Effectively Mr. Speaker, Sir, that debt amount is in fact a grant of 60 per cent.  They 
<br/>are not looking at the interest rates that we are paying, concessional rates over a 30-40 year period, 
<br/>in fact end up paying less than what  you actually borrowed.  They are not looking at that aspect.  
<br/>They are simply looking at the nominal figure as opposed to the repayment period and the cost of the 
<br/>fund itself.  So please if we are going to discuss debt, you need to take a more sophisticated, more 
<br/>nuance and indeed a more informative approach when you actually talk about this particular aspect.
