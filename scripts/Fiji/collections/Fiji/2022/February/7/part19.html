<div><span>Relief Efforts in Tonga 
<br/>(Question No. 02/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the relief efforts by 
<br/>the Fijian Government and the RFMF in Tonga? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  eruption  in  Tonga  was  on  Saturday,  15</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  2022  and  immediately  after  the 
<br/>eruption, particularly the week after on Sunday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> January, 2022, we were inundated with a lot of 
<br/>calls, questions, queries as to how will Fiji respond to the disaster that has hit the Kingdom of Tonga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same Sunday as well, the honourable Acting Prime Minister managed to speak to the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Tonga but unfortunately, it was just for only a few 
<br/>seconds because of the disruption in communication in Tonga.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, planning 
<br/>continued,  particularly  by  the  RFMF  and,  of  course,  in  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development and Disaster Management Office, as to how we will respond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following consultations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were two components of the assistance to 
<br/>the Kingdom of Tonga.  One was the assistance through RFMF troops that were to deploy to Tonga 
<br/>through Australia.  Fifty troops left on Saturday, 29</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2022, for Brisbane in Australia.  The
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>372 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plan of the deployment was similar to the one that we had very recently in the Solomon Islands where 
<br/>we are embedded into the Australian Contingent and we would deploy together.  The planning was 
<br/>for the </span><span>HMAS Adelaide</span><span> to leave on Friday, 28th January, 2022 for the Kingdom of Tonga and then 
<br/>later on, for the troops to come across and marry up with the Australian component who are already 
<br/>in the ship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the team, together with the joint taskforce command element 
<br/>are still in Australia.  What it has developed into is, we still have the team in Brisbane and, of course, 
<br/>no troops has set foot on Tonga for now.  We still have the French, British, Australians and the New 
<br/>Zealanders.  The team are still consolidated, particularly the planning team that had caught steam in 
<br/>Brisbane, which will look like an international component that will be deployed into Tonga once the 
<br/>approval from the Kingdom is received.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak, there are notes being exchanged with the Kingdom of Tonga authorities, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and also the Commander of the RFMF and General Campbell and their counterparts in 
<br/>Tonga, Lord Tui Lepa, who is the Commander of the Armed Forces at the Kingdom, on the details.  
<br/>All  these  are  awaiting  approval,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  as  I  have  stated,  we  will  be  part  of  the 
<br/>Australian  component.    The  Fiji  troops  will  be  embedded  into  that  component  and  we  will  be 
<br/></span><span>deployed together. This is for obvious reasons, they are providing the strategic lift, they are providing 
<br/></span><span>the sustainment requirements and the equipment and other necessities for the deployment as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other component, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the deployment of relief supplies to the Kingdom 
<br/>of Tonga. I did mention that there was limited communication with Tonga post the eruption on 15th 
<br/>January,  2022.  Sir,  NDMO  Fiji  was  able  to  have  contact  with  National  Emergency  Management 
<br/>Office (NEMO) in Tonga on Tuesday after the eruption and NEMO Tonga was able to send us some 
<br/>of the critical items that they would need. Based on that and with Cabinet’s approval, NDMO together 
<br/>with the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs coordinated the response here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was an expression of interest put out so that all our 
<br/>stakeholders and agencies can indicate how they can assist according to the list that was put out as 
<br/>given to us by NEMO Tonga.  Let me highlight and acknowledge our partners that made the Tongan 
<br/>deployment possible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The New Zealand Government (MFAT) were also responsible, particularly with the bulk of 
<br/>the funding and  for the  cost  of the boat  that was chartered.   We have UNICEF, UNFPA  and the 
<br/>Tongan community in Fiji.  We are, indeed, thankful to Mr. Kitione Tuapati and the Taholo’s for 
<br/></span><span>arranging the Api Tonga community here in Fiji, and mostly the USP students who helped us a lot 
<br/></span><span>with manpower requirements; Swire Shipping and Goundar Shipping, World Central Kitchen, Office 
<br/>of the Prime Minister, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Health and 
<br/>Medical Services, the Department of Information, Republic of Fiji Military Forces, Fiji Immigration 
<br/>Department, Fiji Revenue and Customs Services and the Fiji Procurement Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  very  briefly,  after  the  Expression  of  Interest  was  closed,  we  started  the 
<br/>packing of items and the stakeholders that I have mentioned brought in their respective contributions.  
<br/>We  are  thankful  to  the  Fiji  Sports  Council  for  providing  the  Vodafone  Arena  Car  Park  for  the 
<br/>logistics, particularly for the packaging for Tonga.  That saw 11 x 40 foot containers, three by the 
<br/>Api Tonga communities and the rest by the stakeholders, so altogether 11 40 foot containers were 
<br/>deployed to Tonga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was a five days’ deployment - one and a half day’s sailing time to Tonga and return, and 
<br/>two days at the port in Nuku’alofa.  It was a contact-less deployment because of COVID-19 protocols.  
<br/>We took everything from here, dumped them at the port in Nuku’alofa, sprayed the trucks, sprayed

<div><span>the goods and then left them there and came back to Suva.  So, that very briefly is the assistance 
<br/>involving by the RFMF and the supplies that were shipped across from Suva to Tonga.  Again, I am 
<br/>indeed thankful to all the stakeholders who made this possible.

<div><span>COVID-19 Recovery Guarantee Scheme 
<br/>(Question No. 03/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the status of 
<br/>implementation of the $200 million in loans for COVID-19 Recovery Guarantee Scheme to 
<br/>micro, small and medium and large enterprises? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Just  by  way  of  background,  before  I  give  the  details  as  to  how  much  money  has  been 
<br/></span><span>disbursed through this particular, what we call, the COVID-19 Recovery Credit Guarantee Scheme.  
<br/></span><span>The  $200  million  was  essentially  allocated  for  the  micro,  small,  medium  and  large  businesses  to 
<br/>access this funding to help them meet their day-to-day cash flow needs, including the payment of 
<br/>wages, salaries, rental costs, utility costs, purchasing stocks and other working capital expenses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as announced in the Budget last year, the $200 million is, in fact, made available through 
<br/>the Reserve Bank of Fiji at a very low interest rate of 0.25 per cent to the financial institutions, who 
<br/>then on lend these funds to eligible businesses whereby they need to meet the criteria of financial 
<br/>institutions at no more than 3.99 per cent.  That is the maximum rate they can charge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, negotiated with financial institutions that were going to 
<br/>lend that there will not be any principal payments for the first two years on the basis that Government 
<br/>would pay the interest rate for these companies or these businesses on their behalf for the first two 
<br/>years.  So, there has been a budgetary allocation made to that effect, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially, therefore, these businesses for the first two years, get access to 
<br/>the loan but they do not have to make any repayments. Given the COVID-19 situation, that period is 
<br/>essential for them to actually get back on their feet because we do not want these businesses to close 
<br/></span><span>down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the criteria is that we also then try to ensure that financial institutions 
<br/>will lend to these businesses.  We said that for the 90 per cent of the loans to micro businesses with 
<br/>turnover of less than $50,000, Government will guarantee 85 per cent for small business with the 
<br/>turnover $50,000 to $300,000; 60 per cent for medium sized businesses with turnover of $300,000 
<br/>to $1.25 million; and 75 per cent for large businesses with turnover above $1.25 million.  So, the 
<br/>amount that one can actually get by way of loan for micro enterprises, the maximum they can get is 
<br/>$10,000; small can get $20,000; medium is $50,000 and large businesses - $100,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members will also see that we have actually set 
<br/>aside $5 million in terms of managing the loan guarantees.  Obviously there will not be a call on 
<br/>those guarantees because no one has to make a repayment in the first two years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of an update, the Reserve Bank of Fiji has already received and 
<br/>approved  5,244  loan  applications  with  the  total  value  of  $106.9  million.    In  addition  to  this,  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="89">Page 89</a></div>
<div><span>374 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, financial institutions are currently processing another 64 applications with a total value 
<br/>of around $3.4 million.  To date, Government has paid a total interest cost of around $1.3 million on 
<br/>the $107 million already disbursed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the applications disbursed, for micro enterprises there were 2,509 
<br/>applications,  small  businesses  -  1,648,  medium  -  652  and  large  -  435  businesses  have  received 
<br/>funding from that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the value of the loans disbursed, around 17 per cent of the total 
<br/>loan value is for micro businesses, 21 per cent for small businesses, 26 per cent for medium sized 
<br/>businesses and 36 per cent for large businesses.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that gives an update. I 
<br/>could, of course, give further clarifications should they require any.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tongan Volcanic Eruption 
<br/>(Question No. 04/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/></span><span>Mineral Resources inform Parliament as to what transpired on Saturday, 15th January, 2022, 
<br/>during the Tongan volcanic eruption in terms of providing warnings to the public in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Saturday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2022 was the date for the volcano that we had in Tonga, the Hunga 
<br/>Tonga - Hunga Ha’apai volcano.  The initial statistics suggest that this violent explosion is probably 
<br/>the largest volcanic blast we have had in the world since Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines 30 years 
<br/>ago.  That is according to the Volcanologist, Professor Shane Cronin, whom we referred to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  here  in  Fiji  under  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources,  we  have  the 
<br/>Seismology Observatory Unit that monitors earthquakes and tsunami activities on a 24/7 basis but 
<br/>the tsunamis that are being normally monitored because we monitor earthquakes, it is designed to 
<br/>monitor tsunamis that come out of earthquakes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, we have a lot of earthquakes. In the month of February alone, looking at the statistics 
<br/>that was given to me by the Department, we have had 70 earthquake events.  Most of them we do not 
<br/></span><span>feel,  13  of  those  were  local  and  about  57  of  them  were  regional.  So,  you  can  see  that  it  is  quite 
<br/></span><span>frequent and most of the tsunamis that we do get come out of earthquakes and already in the month 
<br/>of February, we have already had 20 earthquake type events in our area.  One of these is local and 
<br/>about 19 regional.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The whole tsunami warning system is geared towards earthquakes.  It monitors the parameters 
<br/>that determine when an earthquake takes place, whether that earthquake will lead to a tsunami or not, 
<br/>and  these  parameters  are  largely  around  the  depths  at  which  the  earthquake  takes  place  and  the 
<br/>strength of the earthquake and depending on those parameters, it feeds into the warning system which 
<br/>is then fed into the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre which comes out of Honolulu in Hawaii.  That 
<br/>is the organisation that is the official tsunami service provider for the Pacific Tsunami Warning and 
<br/>Mitigation System that delivers tsunami threats and advisories to countries in the Southwest Pacific 
<br/>Region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue that we had there was that the whole system is geared towards earthquakes and the 
<br/>vast majority of tsunamis that we have come out of earthquakes. This one that we had came out of a 
<br/>volcano and you know in Fiji, we have Vanuatu to our west and we have Tonga to our east and we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>375 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are in the middle, and both of these two, Vanuatu and Tonga, they have a lot of volcanic activities.  
<br/>There is always volcanic activity taking place in Vanuatu, a major event back in 2017-2018 and we 
<br/>have this one here but all of our focus and the history of tsunamis has always been largely focused 
<br/>towards tsunamis that come out of earthquakes, so because the whole system was oriented towards 
<br/>earthquakes, when they had this volcanic activity that might lead to a tsunami, they did not have the 
<br/>parameters to measure, which would indicate that this volcano leads to a tsunami.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had other volcanoes in our region, I think in this Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai we 
<br/>have had the volcanic eruptions there in 2009, 2014, others in Vanuatu area but it did not lead to 
<br/>tsunamis and the only parameters that they could work on was the tidal gauges.  We have gauges 
<br/>around the country that can measure if the water goes up or down.  Those were the only things that 
<br/>they (Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre) had to feed that into their own calculations which they had 
<br/>to do manually and then they issued the warnings which came out on the particular Saturday.  The 
<br/>tsunami advisory was issued at 6.35 p.m. on the Saturday and it was cancelled at 9.00 on Sunday 
<br/>morning. So, that was the issue that we had but since then there has been a lot of work that has been 
<br/>undertaken by MRD and also with the local agencies including the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre.  
<br/>There have been discussions and what is happening now is they are relooking at the way they try to 
<br/>give advisories to see if they can take in some parameters that arise out of volcanoes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say again that volcanoes are quite rare in terms of leading to tsunamis.  This one was a very 
<br/>rare incident but now the whole system, the experts, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre are looking 
<br/>at  bringing  in  those  volcano  parameters  into  their  system  so  that  in  the  future,  I  think  they  are 
<br/>developing an SOP, they are working on an Interim Tsunami Volcano SOP so this can advise us into 
<br/>the future.

<div><span>Cold Storage for Farmers - Sigatoka Valley 
<br/>(Question No. 05/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SAUKURU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  inform 
<br/>Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to build a cold storage facility for farmers in the Sigatoka 
<br/>Valley? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  raised  by  the 
<br/>honourable Member and I thank the honourable member for asking this question.  Unfortunately, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>this is the same question that was raised in the August Parliament sitting last year and I had responded 
<br/></span><span>to it.  But anyway, this always happens.  They do not listen to our responses carefully and they ask 
<br/>again and again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of cold storage facility is basically to delay the deterioration in 
<br/>case  where  farmers  are  not  able  to  take  the  produce  to  the  market.      So,  the  farmers  in  the  area 
<br/>concerned in Sigatoka Valley either take their produce to the market which is, most of them can reach 
<br/>the market within 20 minutes, 15 minutes of the time due to the good road, the tarsealed road that 
<br/>some of you have been criticising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, or then the other category of farmers and entrepreneurs are the exporters, 
<br/>who collect the produce from the farmers.  They get the required volume and then process it and 
<br/>export it.  So, for these exporters, we have assisted in establishing cold storage facility.  There are 
<br/>four cold storage facility for exporters at Sigatoka Valley. Shalen Export, Navosa Export, DKAY 
<br/>Export and Mahen Export.  All of them, Ministry was assisted on a one-third two-third basis because 
<br/>these are all our exporters.  They do collect from farmers, they are the ones who need cold storage 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="91">Page 91</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>facilities because they cannot immediately get into the market.  They need to collect the required 
<br/>volume.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to this, we also have cold storage facility at our research station 
<br/>right there in Sigatoka Valley which is available to farmers if they want to keep their produce in case 
<br/>if they are not able to get it to the exporter or to the market.  Some of the farmers have used it, but 
<br/>most of the farmers are using that cold storage facility to keep their seeds for the next season at no 
<br/>charge to them.  So Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have cold storage facilities at a number of research stations 
<br/>– the Koronivia Research Station, Seaqaqa Research Station, Legalega Research Station and Sigatoka 
<br/>Research Station. All these facilities are available to the farmers at no cost.  They can keep their 
<br/>produce if they want to and they are using, some of them are using it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  establishing  a  cold  storage  facility  is  one  thing  but  to  utilise  it  fully  is 
<br/>another.  We have got a cold storage facility that was constructed some time back at Keyasi, at the 
<br/>cost of $45,000 funded by Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and also the Ministry 
<br/>but the cold storage facility is not at all utilised now.  When we raised the issue with the farmers, 
<br/>then now they are saying that we need assistance to grow crops to supply.  Initially, they said that we 
<br/>are not growing because there is no cold storage facility.  When we have the cold storage facility, 
<br/></span><span>they are saying that we need assistance to grow, so Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a white elephant there 
<br/></span><span>now- not utilised, so we do not want to establish cold storage facility when there is no supply, so 
<br/>basically  we want  to  ensure that when we make  an investment,  it should  be fully utilised. So, in 
<br/>Sigatoka Valley, there is no need for any other cold storage facility because there is a cold storage 
<br/>facility at the Sigatoka Research Station. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  I raised that question because we 
<br/>listed them just recently after the workshop at Marriot and they raised the issue with the Committee 
<br/>on Natural Resources because of the road facility that during rainy days it is not accessible and they 
<br/>cannot even access the cold storage facility.  That is why I asked that question, honourable Minister.  
<br/>It is coming from the farmers.  The question is, since they cannot access the cold storage facility that 
<br/>you mentioned, how else can they because they are hampered now with the road, they cannot get 
<br/>their produce to the cold storage facility that you have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said,  no  farmer  wants  to  keep  their 
<br/>produce.  Basically, they want to get rid of their produce immediately, get to the market, so the only 
<br/>reason you want to have a cold storage facility is either you are collecting the produce to make up 
<br/>the required volume or you are far away from the market.  In the question, he is talking about Valley 
<br/></span><span>Road.  It is very close to the market and in the second question, he mentioned Nabitu which is not on 
<br/></span><span>Valley Road.  It is on the other side of the river. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>River De-Silting and Dredging Works 
<br/>(Question No. 06/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. NAGATA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  progress  of  the  Ministry  of  Waterways’  river  de-silting  and  dredging 
<br/>works? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking this 
<br/>question.  Climate change has and will continue to affect the intensity and frequency of precipitation. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>377 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our oceans are getting warmer. A recent study by the World Meteorological 
<br/>Organisation  showed  that  last  seven  years  has  been  the  warmest.    The  year  2021  is  the  seventh 
<br/>consecutive year (2015-2021) where global temperatures has been above one degree Celsius, above 
<br/>the pre-industrial levels.  With warmer atmosphere, it increases the amount of water that evaporates 
<br/>into the air, converging and resulting in strong storm systems, and further intensifying the events and 
<br/>rainfall. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, heavier rain means washing away of the sediments and seals.  If you look 
<br/>at the data in Fiji, the annual average rainfall in 2013 was 1,306 millimetres.  In 2020, the last data 
<br/>that we have, from 1,306 average annual rainfall in 2013 and now to 2020 is 2,612; nearly doubled.  
<br/>If you look at monthly average rainfall data, in 2013 it was 108 millimetres, now it is 270.  Let us 
<br/>look  at  </span><span>TC  Cody  </span><span>data,  for  three  days,  Ba  had  the  highest  –  566  millimetres.    When  the  monthly 
<br/>average now is 270 and the monthly average in 2013 was 108, those three days only during </span><span>TC Cody</span><span>
<br/>was 566 millimetres in Ba, 453 millimetres in Tavua and 459 millimetres in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these massive amount of rainfall in a very short period and when you 
<br/>have a lot of developments, it causes a lot of runoff water.  No amount of drainage, desilting will 
<br/>assist because these are mitigating factors; these are not preventing measures.  We have gone beyond 
<br/></span><span>prevention, we need to mitigate, and those are mitigating measures.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, we are undertaking de-silting and dredging 
<br/>in about 29 creeks and rivers throughout Fiji.  Two creeks in the Central Division, 11 in the Western 
<br/>Division and 16 in the Northern Division, as we speak.  Most of those are undertaken in partnership 
<br/>with private sector companies in a Public Private Partnership model</span><span>.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  larger  ones  in  the  Northern  Division,  we  have  got  Nubu,  Naduru, 
<br/>Nasealevu,  Wavuwavu,  Nagigi,  Naividamu,  Nakama,  Wailevu,  Vatudova,  Waitakala,  Buceisau, 
<br/>Naiyalayala,  Vunivutu,  Tabia,  Nakelikoso  and  Korotari.    In  the  Ra  District,  Nakorotubu,  Upper 
<br/>Wainibuka, Drauniivi (about to start), Narewa and the Ba District Saru in Lautoka, Solovi in Nadi, 
<br/>Malakua in Nadi, Nadele, Ba River (just started), Namosau, Vitogo (just started), Nawaka retention 
<br/>dam.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We constructed five retention dams to deal with flooding in Nadi.  Apart from dredging that 
<br/>is happening in Nadi and Malakua River, we have got five retention dams, the primary purpose of 
<br/>these retention dams is to collect the water that comes down, store it then gradually release it.  So, 
<br/>three of them were constructed much earlier (about three years ago), those were filled with silt. Last 
<br/></span><span>year, before this rainy season we de-silted retention dams one and two.  We completely de-silted it 
<br/></span><span>so that it regained its retention capacity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Central Division, we have Namosi, Wainibuabua and Wainadoi undertaking de-silting 
<br/>works as we speak.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this weekend, we are targeting to advertise the other 120 rivers 
<br/>and creeks that we have on our list to seek expressions of interest from  potential companies who 
<br/>would want to partner with us and clear this material so that we can get back to their original discharge 
<br/>capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. We all understand that 
<br/>this de-silting process and dredging process has not been working, considering the recent flood that 
<br/>we have been seeing.  Can the honourable Minister enlighten the House, what is the next plan to try 
<br/>and control this flooding because all these rivers that you have been dredging are still flooding? What 
<br/>is the next plan?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  M.  REDDY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  just  explained  that  this  is  mitigation 
<br/>strategies.  I think you should </span><span>Google</span><span> and check-up the difference between mitigation and prevention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>We cannot prevent the volume of rain that is coming in the short to medium term.  What we 
<br/>can do is to ensure that we quickly get this water discharged; that is what we want to do.   
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>The bigger plan for the Nadi River is to build dykes around the river so that it does not spill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what we are doing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Also at the same time, not only about dredging 
<br/>but  we  also  are  looking  at  some  of  the  rivers  where  we  can  increase  the  discharge  capacity  by 
<br/>widening them. For example in the Ba River, we did one kilometre work during river bank production 
<br/>last year which allowed the water to move out quickly faster. So these are some of the works we are 
<br/>doing to ensure that we: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>restore the discharge capacity;  
<br/>increase the discharge capacity; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>collect water upstream so that less water comes down (downstream) in a short period of time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by constructing five retention dams at Nawaka and Nadi River. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking at doing that in Ba as well as Rakiraki. In Rakiraki, three 
<br/>years ago, the Government spent $1.3 million to clear Nakauvadra River. For the last two years, there 
<br/>was no flooding in town, first time ever water entered town this weekend.  Why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>for two reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  massive  volume  of  rain  which  went  beyond  the  discharge  capacity  of  the  existing  
<br/>Nakauvadra River; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>over the last year, again, the silt material entered the Nakauvadra River and so we needed to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clear it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exemption of Audit - Energy Fiji Limited 
<br/>(Question No. 07/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.W. VOSANIBOLA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the reasons 
<br/></span><span>for exempting the Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) from being audited by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/></span><span>General? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the law actually allows for the exemption 
<br/>firstly to take place, and it does say quite specifically that the exemption should be what we call “Off 
<br/>Budget State Entities”.  In other words, Government does not give the State entities any money, EFL 
<br/>of  course  being  one  of  them,  including  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited  (FPCL).    By  way  of 
<br/>background, EFL now is owned 51 per cent by the Fijian Government; 44 per cent by a company 
<br/>called Sevens Pacific Pte Limited which is owned by Chugoku, which is a private Japanese company, 
<br/>and the other shareholder is Japanese Bank for International Corporation (JBIC) which is owned by 
<br/>the Japanese Government; and the balance of the 5 per cent is owned by ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could go into a lot of details, but essentially what has been happening, the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General has been outsourcing a lot of its own functions.  I have got a list of 
<br/>companies here that the Office of the Auditor-General actually outsources the auditing work to.  The 
<br/>EFL, since 2006 they have been outsourcing it, the last audit was done by Ernst &amp; Young; the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>7</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>379 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hardwood  Corporation  has  been  outsourced  to  KPMG,  this  is  all  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor- 
<br/>General; Food Processors Limited 2009 will be audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, moving 
<br/>forward,  the  back  log  will  be  outsourced;  Biosecurity  Authority  of  Fiji  2014  and  2016  has  been 
<br/>outsourced to HLB accounting firm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have seen also is that, the Office of the Auditor-General takes at 
<br/>least  four months, even  though it has outsourced, then they  carry out  their own what  we call the 
<br/>“operational audit”.  They will not release any of these, even though it is outsourced, until after four 
<br/>months.  There is a requirement under the Companies Act for the company to actually lodge their 
<br/>accounts within three months into the company’s office.  And, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the EFL will soon 
<br/>be listed on the South Pacific Stock Exchange.  Again, the SPX requires the submission of its annual 
<br/>financial statements to the SPX no later than three months after the end of its financial period.  So, 
<br/>there is absolutely no truth and I have got a whole list of very dramatic headlines by </span><span>Fijivillage</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  Times</span><span>  et  cetera,  where  honourable  Professor  Prasad  talks  about  no  more  accountability  and 
<br/>transparency, his pied piper talks about why there has been exemption.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>Narube says this is protecting corruption and some other people made all sorts of comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, what really interesting is, the honourable Members from the other side to-date has 
<br/></span><span>never raised an issue about FPCL.  The FPCL is not actually audited by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/></span><span>General.  Their annual report is done by external sources and comes directly into Parliament; they 
<br/>missed that point.  So what is the difference between that?  No one is saying that the accounts will 
<br/>not be tabled in Parliament, the accounts will be tabled in Parliament as they have been doing with 
<br/>FPCL.  So, there is nothing untoward about it.  It also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as allowed under the law, 
<br/>the audit must be carried out by an organisation that is actually certified to do so.  As we have seen, 
<br/>PwC, Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG and HLB are all certified accounting firms that can carry out the audit 
<br/>work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if they are saying that the Office of the Auditor-General, because it has not 
<br/>audited  it,  and  therefore,  somehow  or  the  other,  it  is  untoward  behaviour,  Office  of  the  Auditor- 
<br/>General does not audit the Red Cross, FRIENDS is not audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, 
<br/>Fiji Public Service Association is not done by the Office of the Auditor-General, the Fiji Teacher’s 
<br/>Union and the Women’s Crisis Centre are not audited by the Office of the Auditor-General.  But, no 
<br/>one says, therefore, that there is no transparency, they all claim to be transparent.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>it is illogical.  They have been caught out and, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the unfortunate thing about 
<br/>this Opposition. They look for some scams, some kind of untoward behaviour to score political points 
<br/>and get to the front page of </span><span>Fijivillage</span><span> or </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That is what they are doing.  They forget the fact that FPCL, 
<br/>all these years has not been using the OAG yet they do not have a problem with that.  It is tabled in 
<br/>Parliament and you called them in and they come and answer to you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  done by EFL. Similarly, other organisations are also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>done by outsourced companies.  There is nothing fishy about it.  It is about efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact one of the financiers a few years back did not want to rely on the 
<br/>OAG assessment. They said we want to go back to the private company that did the audit because 
<br/>they  thought  the  OAG  was  somehow  or  the  other  compromised.    One  of  the  financiers  that  was 
<br/>actually lending money to EFL, so  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is, the law allows for it, 
<br/>their reasons have been given as to why has been done. The annual report will be tabled in Parliament

<br/>you, Sir.

<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, Sir, a supplementary question. Could the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister explain the reasons for the sale of FNPF shares to the investor?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, I have already addressed that in previous occasions but 
<br/>in fact FNPF made lots of money from it actually by selling those shares.  They made a huge windfall 
<br/>in selling those shares.

<div><span>COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts 
<br/>(Question No. 08/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the COVID-19 vaccination efforts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the vaccination efforts are going very well and I would like to begin by thanking all the 
<br/>Ministry of Health staff, the frontliners and  also  the support teams  that have been supporting the 
<br/>vaccination programme.  It has not been easy as we are all aware at the beginnings of the vaccination 
<br/>campaign the challenges that were faced beginning in this honourable House and also in social media 
<br/>even in mainstream media, the challenges around the virtues of the vaccination.  We have gone past 
<br/>and beyond that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we speak, we have had two phases.  The first  phase was  initially targeted towards the 
<br/>frontliners and also those who are above 60 and those who above 50 with comorbid illnesses and 
<br/>those who are below 50 with other significance illnesses and also above 18. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After the first phase, we then progressed with the second phase which is vaccinating everyone 
<br/>18 and above and included in that second phase is the vaccination of our children initially beginning 
<br/>with those 16, 17 and 18 and then as we all are aware, we now vaccinating 12 to 14 with Pfizer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we have had more than 761,000 doses of vaccines that have been provided by our partners 
<br/></span><span>and I would like to thank them beginning with the Government of Australia, Government of New 
<br/>Zealand, Government of United States of America, the Government of India and also the COVID-19 
<br/>Vaccines  Global  Access  Facility  (COVAX),  United  Kingdom  through  COVAX  and  the  other 
<br/>multilateral partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our experts work hand in hand with COVAX and also with UNICEF and WHO.  They look 
<br/>at the data that comes and also the evidence that comes from around the world but also we are looking 
<br/>at what is happening with our COVID-19 epidemiology locally and based on that is the advice given 
<br/>on  the  vaccination.    Sir,  at  this  moment  in  time  there  is  98  per  cent  of  our  population  that  have 
<br/>received the first dose and 93 per cent have received the second dose.  To be actually exact about 
<br/>11,700 individuals in Fiji have yet to receive their first dose and I know that most of us in this House 
<br/>who know someone who have not had their first dose and I encourage all of us to keep on encouraging 
<br/>them to have their first dose.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>381 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  a  personal  experience  about  two  weeks  ago,  we  celebrated  my  grandmother’s  100</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>birthday and she was a lady who was at home with us during the midst of the COVID-19.  She was 
<br/>exposed.  I was isolated quite a few times.  She was isolated with us, she received both her doses and 
<br/>also a booster dose.  A personal family testament that COVID-19 vaccination does work and protects 
<br/>the vulnerable in our community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.  Can  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister update Parliament on the booster doses being administrated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  I.  WAQAINABETE.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  that  question.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, the booster doses we have identified that there are about 240,000 individuals at the moment 
<br/>who are eligible for their booster doses and we are inviting them to come forth for their booster doses.  
<br/>Majority of all of us who have had their first doses was predominantly AstraZeneca.  We are using 
<br/>Moderna  as  a  booster  dose.    Last  week  we  received  the  first  175,000  doses  of  Pfizer  from  the 
<br/>Government of Australia and it is our intention to also use Pfizer as a booster dose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  said  and  have  alluded  to  80,000  have  received  their  booster  dose.    I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable  Member  for  that  question  because  it  brings  something  that  is  very  pertinent  at  this 
<br/></span><span>moment.  Yesterday, I was quite amazed and really irritated when I saw an article by Dr. Ram Raju 
<br/></span><span>in  which he says that the booster dose had no use.  We know for sure  Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 
<br/>booster dose just increases the level of immunity and prevents severe sickness, hospitalisation and 
<br/>death. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  know  that  the  policies  that  have  been  formulated  by  this  Government,  the 
<br/>Government of the honourable Prime Minister and his decisive leadership including the mandatory 
<br/>vaccination that happened for places of work with the No Jab, No Job policy have allowed planes to 
<br/>arrive  back  in  this  country,  have  allowed  hotels  to  open,  have  allowed  businesses  to  work,  have 
<br/>allowed our people to go back overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have had people coming to our office, young men and women wanting 
<br/>to join the British Army and one thing that is being asked of them is to be vaccinated.  We have been 
<br/>able to do this because of the strong leadership of our Prime Minister and the vaccination came in 
<br/>and they are doing well.  And to actually say, that it is of no use, is to actually be careless and  I 
<br/>actually think Dr. Ram Raju was careless in saying those words which were published in the  </span><span>Fiji 
<br/>Times</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to make it very clear today that we are able to ease the restrictions that we have had, 
<br/></span><span>the ease of restrictions of the curfew, the ease of the restrictions of meeting, the informal meetings, 
<br/>the ability to be able to come together when somebody passes away because of the high vaccination 
<br/>coverage that we have.  And we are able to sit here in Parliament because of the high vaccination 
<br/>coverage.  I thank the honourable Member for that question.
