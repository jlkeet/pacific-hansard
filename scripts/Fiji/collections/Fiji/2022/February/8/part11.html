<div><span>Volume  1:  2017-2018  Financial  Statements  of  Government  and  2017-2018  Agency 
<br/>Financial Statements of Ministry of Economy </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 186 of 2020)</span><span>;

<br/>Economic Services Sector </span><span>(Parliamentary Paper No. 187 of 2020)</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted in the Audit Report that there were no acquisitions or disposals of controlled 
<br/>entities  during  the  financial  year.    The  Auditor-General’s  audit  opinion  highlighted  that  the 
<br/>accompanying financial statements of the Government of the Republic of Fiji which were prepared 
<br/>had all material respects in accordance with the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji,  Financial 
<br/>Management (Amendment) Act 2016 and the Audit Act 1969. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted that the OAG had issued 37 audit opinions on the 2018 
<br/>financial statements of Ministries and Departments out of which 24 or 65 per cent were unmodified 
<br/>opinions while 13 or 35 percent were modified opinions. This indicated that most agency financial 
<br/>statements did not contain material misstatements individually or in aggregate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted in its review that there were significant matters highlighted by the OAG 
<br/>which were matters of concern in which the Ministry of Economy with other relevant Ministries and 
<br/>Departments should have addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  view  of  those  issues,  the  Committee  came  up  with  few  recommendations  so  that  those 
<br/>relevant Ministries and Departments take serious consideration in the implementation of the audit 
<br/>recommendations.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of these recommendations include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Whilst the majority of Government Ministries and Departments have complied with their 
<br/>reporting timelines on submission of their financial statements to the Ministry of Economy, 
<br/>appropriate  measures,  however,  should  be  in  place  to  ensure  compliance  from  those 
<br/>Ministries and Departments that continuously delay submitting their end of year financial 
<br/></span><span>statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  to  provide  oversight  on  the  implementation  of  the  relevant 
<br/>recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Economy  should  take  the  lead  role  in  conducting  regular  and  timely 
<br/>training for all Ministries and Departments Accounting Officers in the area of FMIS, Trust 
<br/>Accounts, Stores, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministries and Departments should perform their reconciliation on a timely basis on their 
<br/>main  Operating  Accounts  and  Trust  Fund  Accounts,  to  ensure  their  internal  control 
<br/>mechanisms are in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee notes the work carried out by the Internal Audit and the Good Governance 
<br/>Division of the Ministry of Economy and recommends that adequate support be provided 
<br/>for efficient and effective audit conduct.

<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry  of  Economy,  in  conjunction  with  other 
<br/>Ministries, work with OAG for the reconciliation of the Main Trust Account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee commends the efforts of the Ministry of Economy in trying to address 
<br/>issues highlighted by the OAG.  Other relevant Ministries and Department Heads should consider 
<br/>those issues as priority, and take appropriate actions and take their cue from the Ministry of Economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this  juncture,  I  wish  to  thank my  fellow Committee Members,  namely; honourable Ro 
<br/>Teimumu Kepa, honourable Joseph Nitya Nand (Deputy Chairperson), honourable Virendra Lal and 
<br/>honourable Aseri Radrodro for their efforts and contributions in the scrutiny process of those Whole 
<br/>of Government Audit Reports and in the final compilation of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, it is also important to note that most Government Ministries and Departments are 
<br/>working  towards  achieving  their  contribution  towards  Fiji’s  5-Year  and  20-Year  National 
<br/>Development Plan in line with the relevant SDG targets.  With those words, I now commend the 
<br/>Report to Parliament.

<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A.MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion without notice that a debate on the content of the  Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>Motion agreed to.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report - Fiji Commerce Commission 2016-2017 and  
<br/>Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/>submit to Parliament, the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Commerce Commission 2016-2017 
<br/>and Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission 2017-2018 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The period of reports under review carried great significance to the organisation, as it was the 
<br/>year  when  the  Fiji  Commerce  Commission  was  officially  re-branded  as  Fijian  Competition  and 
<br/>Consumer  Commission  (FCCC).    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FCCC  plays  a  significant  role  in  protecting 
<br/>consumer  rights  and  promoting  fair  competition  amongst  Fijian  businesses  and  the  Committee 
<br/>commended the team at FCCC for successfully launching its five-year Strategic Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  its  deliberations,  the  Committee  noted  the  various  activities  undertaken  by  FCCC 
<br/>during  the  periods  under  review  which  included;  stakeholder  engagements,  ongoing  awareness 
<br/>sessions, trader inspections, et cetera.  While the Committee appreciates the data provided by FCCC 
<br/>on their activities and programmes, it made recommendations for data trend of, at least, five years be 
<br/>included into their future reports for better analysis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that despite the ongoing awareness sessions, complaints were still being 
<br/>received by FCCC for various issues, such as trader non-compliance or landlord and tenant issues. 
<br/>The Committee believes that the formulation of more effective awareness strategies, including

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>collaboration with various stakeholders such as Citizens Constitutional Forum (CCF), the Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit  (FIU),  Department  of Co-operatives and Ministry of iTaukei  Affairs, as  well as 
<br/>preparing and disseminating information packages regularly for all new and existing businesses on 
<br/>the various requirements under the Act would be beneficial.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee is aware that FCCC initiated its work towards the proposed draft 
<br/>Landlords and Tenants Bill.  Given the continuous issues surrounding rent complaints, the Committee 
<br/>recommends that stakeholder concerns be thoroughly considered and looks forward for the progress 
<br/>of the proposed Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  extend  our  appreciation  to  the  CEO  and  his  team 
<br/>members for being prompt in answering the various queries and questions raised by the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report:  Deputy  Speaker,  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  Veena  Bhatnagar, 
<br/>honourable G. Vegnathan, honourable Inosi Kurudrani and honourable Ro Filipe Tuisawau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the review of the Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commerce Commission 2016-2017 and FCCC 2017-2018 Annual Reports to Parliament.
