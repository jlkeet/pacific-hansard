<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- OMRS.

<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is important that we not just lose sight of it.  So, I would 
<br/>sort of encourage the Government, even though this is an election year, if they do not want to call it 
<br/>a Commission because we are suggesting it, that is fine, but have some kind of expert review because 
<br/>at this time it is even more important because we have had such learning and teaching losses in the 
<br/></span><span>last two years because of COVID-19 and the effect of that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be seen in a long-
<br/></span><span>term basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, this is a good time for the Government to appoint an expert group.  It may be able 
<br/>to get out the report before the election or even if they give the report after the election.  Whoever is 
<br/>in the government would benefit from that report.  But I would urge this Government to actually do 
<br/>that because this is the right time.  And without thinking that this is going to show up their weakness, 
<br/>it is not about weakness.  It is about improving the system, it is about improving the policies and it 
<br/>is about looking at the reforms that we have done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the place of Higher Education and the role of FNU.  I know 
<br/>when FNU was formed, when Ganesh Chand was the vice chancellor, he called me one day and said 
<br/>I want to have Dr. Reddy to become the Dean and I said I will give Dr. Reddy three years leave to 
<br/>go and build up the faculty in FNU and we did that.  We gave Dr. Reddy three years leave to actually 
<br/>go there to set up the FNU.  I have as much love for FNU and the University of Fiji as to USP and 
<br/>all three universities are very important.  Even if there are some elements of competition, that is fine 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>451 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because  competition  does  lead  to  improvements  in  terms  of  the  services,  in  terms  of  the  quality.  
<br/>Many small countries have many universities, they compete, they do things, there is always this idea 
<br/>of  getting  the  best  students  in  universities,  and  there  is  competition  for  PhD  students,  so  the 
<br/>competition in some sense would be quite healthy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  us  as  a  Parliament  and  for  those  in  Government,  it  is  important  to  promote  that 
<br/>competition in a very healthy and free environment because universities do create innovation, they 
<br/>do create ideas and these innovations and ideas only come about in a free environment where there 
<br/>is academic freedom, where universities are well resourced, where government does not interfere in 
<br/>the running of the university, that is when you create a lot of energy, a lot of innovation and a lot of 
<br/>ideas, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I support the Report and we support the operations of the FNU.  We urge them to look at 
<br/>the  completion  of  these projects  and  ensure  that  we  do  not  lose  sight  of  the  technical  part  of  the 
<br/>education that FNU is supposed to provide.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for the work they have done 
<br/>in  making some recommendations on the 2019 FNU Annual  Report.  The key highlights  and the 
<br/></span><span>achievements of the FNU in the year 2019 were many.  In 2018 the student head count was 17,525 
<br/></span><span>whereas in 2019 the number increased to 18,656.  We have also seen that female student enrolment 
<br/>in higher education programmes at FNU continued to grow bigger in number which we appreciate 
<br/>particularly in the year 2018 and 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major highlights for FNU was hosting the Australian Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Scott Morrison to the College of Engineering, Science and Technology at their campus in Samabula, 
<br/>Suva.    The  honourable  Morrison  toured  the  Australian  Pacific  Training  Coalition  (APTC), 
<br/>refrigeration and air conditioning training facility which is located on campus through an ongoing 
<br/>partnership between FNU and APTC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in partnership with the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, FNU hosted 
<br/>the  inaugural  World  Town  Planning  Day  with  student  displays  on  the  theme,  Sustainable 
<br/>Development Climate Change Adaptation and Economic Development through the Blue Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNU hosted the Survivor Series Season 4 Coordinator on campus to interview film and 
<br/>television students for attachment with the production unit.  Eight students joined the team in Kadavu 
<br/>and  in  Pacific  Harbour  for  the  Love  Island  movie.    FNU  also  hosted  a  visit  from  the  renowned 
<br/></span><span>American novelist Adam Johnson, the winner of the U.S National Book Award and also a faculty 
<br/></span><span>member of Stanford University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the highlight of all these was also the nine second-year FNU students who 
<br/>went to Israel to undertake practical training in commercial agriculture.  There initiative which is a 
<br/>first for Fiji is aimed at providing a boost to the Fijian agricultural sector and is a result of an MOU 
<br/>between the Ministry of Agriculture and Israel’s Agency for Development and Co-operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, virtual Fiji Institute of Pacific Health Research was established to further 
<br/>enhance the research activities at the College of Medicine.  The College’s Department of Medical 
<br/>Imaging and Anatomy was declared a centre of education by the World Federation of Ultrasound in 
<br/>Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) making Fiji the regional hub for the training of multi-discipline 
<br/>users of ultrasound.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the World Health Organisation also designated the College’s research centre 
<br/>that is Pacific Research Centre for Prevention of Obesity and NCDs as a WHO collaborating centre.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This collaboration provides benefit to both parties as WHO gains access to top institutions worldwide 
<br/>that  helps  in  the  building  of  institutional  capacity  to  support  such  work.    The  University  also 
<br/>introduced new programmes in 2019 in the field of media and communication, environmental health, 
<br/>non-communicable diseases, health research, education and develop courses in animal science and 
<br/>also in Masters in Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNU National Training and Productivity Centre handed over the Fiji 
<br/>Productivity Master Plan 2021-2030, 36 document to the Minister for Employment, Productivity and 
<br/>Industrial Relation.  The Plan comprises of productivity milestones and directions to raise national 
<br/>productivity.  NTPC published the Fijian Productivity Report 2018 which provides important insights 
<br/>into  capital  and  labour  productivity  in  Fiji  at  national  and  sectoral  levels  which  offer  valuable 
<br/>information for policy makers, researchers and non-government organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  this  is  possible  through  a  very  high-powered  FNU  Council.    FNU 
<br/>Council was put in place and if we go through the members, the Council itself is led by a lady, Ms. 
<br/>Tessa Price.  She comes with wealth of experience and let us not forget that the Council itself is made 
<br/>up of not just the local experts but also people from international arena as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have got individuals who have done a lot of research.  For example, Mr. Dharmen Sharma.  
<br/></span><span>He  has  been  given  if  I  am  not  mistaken  the  Australian  Award  for  the  work  that  he  has  done  in 
<br/>research.  We also have Mr. Vishnu Mohan.  He has got a lot of experienced in private sector, banking 
<br/>sector and he brings to the table a lot of expertise in managing human resources. We also have our 
<br/>local expertise. For example, Mr. Devanesh Sharma.  He is a lawyer by profession and he is in the 
<br/>Council.  We have Mr. Raymond Prasad as an architect.  He can also contribute to the development 
<br/>of FNU campus.   So, the way the Council was selected, it was selected to give that impetus so that 
<br/>the Council can perform well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do have legacy issues with FNU, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Previously the way the staff were 
<br/>appointed, merit was not considered.  It was whom you know kind of an approach but now with this 
<br/>high-powered FNU Council where they have got expertise from overseas as well, they are trying to 
<br/>streamline processes, they are trying to put systems at FNU so that we can improve FNU and take it 
<br/>to another level but as I have shared with you the achievements as well as the highlights of FNU in 
<br/>one year, it says a lot about the direction FNU has taken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  highlighted  three  incomplete  capital  projects  undertaken 
<br/>during this period.  I am pleased to say that the sports complex at Nasinu Campus is now complete 
<br/></span><span>and  fully  operational.    The  flooring  which  is  specialised  for  gyms  was  to  have  been  done  by 
<br/></span><span>international vendor but due to the lockdown they could not come over. Instead they trained our local 
<br/>contractor virtually who then completed the flooring and in the process built our local capacity in the 
<br/>specialised work.  The official opening of this complex is planned for March, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Maritime Academy, three-storey building contract was awarded in 
<br/>August, 2018 for full construction of the building.  The construction work was to be completed by 
<br/>March, 2020, the building was about 80 per cent complete by November 2020.  From April 2020, 
<br/>FNU was charging liquidated damage.  The contractor failed to deliver this project on time despite 
<br/>giving a new deadlines, ultimately the contract had to be terminated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, FNU then encashed the original bond which was $1.18 million and is in the 
<br/>process of completing the remaining work which is around $2.6 million and this work is expected to 
<br/>be completed by July this year.  The contractor has taken FNU to court and there is a mention in the 
<br/>court in March of this year.  So, if all goes well then this project can be completed according to the 
<br/>deadline that I had given.

<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>453 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Naiyaca  Campus,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yesterday  honourable  Prasad  also  placed  Nayaca 
<br/>Campus as part of his bucket where he talked about $500 million wastage that he calculated from 
<br/>thin air over so many years.  Even he talked about this new campus being placed in that list of $500 
<br/>million that he talked about.  The problem here is that some of these honourable Members they go 
<br/>around over the grog bowl, just collect  information and then they  come here and talk about  such 
<br/>important information but it is misled, it is distorted and again, I say it is more of a feel-good factor 
<br/>for him because as if he is the first one who was able to bring it to Parliament so that the rest of Fiji 
<br/>comes to know about it that yes this project did not go well.  But let me tell you honourable Prasad… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, you have to listen to what I have to say.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this 
<br/>project cannot be written off, everything is going as per schedule but I will explain that in detail for 
<br/>you to understand.  The construction work started on the campus in April, 2018, the contract was for 
<br/>the sum of $27.4 million for the building alone.  The project included the construction of lecture 
<br/>theatres, tutorial rooms, computer labs, science lab, conference room, library and admin spaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this project, FNU hired a project manager, a quantity surveyor, engineer and these were 
<br/></span><span>all professionals who were handling the project under the guidance of CIU.  The contractor was paid 
<br/></span><span>a total sum of $11.4 million for the 47 per cent work that was completed but because of the delays 
<br/>FNU terminated the contract in March 2020 as there was no progress seen on the site from August, 
<br/>2019 despite several completion plans submitted by the contractor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The contractor filed a case against FNU on 6</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2021, the court ruled in favour of 
<br/>FNU which means that the contract was rightfully terminated and that FNU can encash the bond of 
<br/>$2 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  However, the Bank of Baroda has some legal matters with the in regards 
<br/>to the bond money.  Sir, FNU has filed a Writ of Summons in the High Court against Bank of Baroda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we put all these together, one can calculate that we still have money to 
<br/>finish the job.  The matter is very well handled by the FNU Council and the only reason there was a 
<br/>delay  in  this  project  was  purely  because  of  the  contractor  and  when  the  matter  goes  to  Court, 
<br/>obviously we expect further delays.  That is what has happened to this project.  I am going to leave 
<br/>this with the FNU Council and I am sure they will be able to handle this and come up with a plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding what  honourable Gavoka said, he has been talking  about FNU competing  with 
<br/>USP.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU is a local university, we should be proud of a local university and there 
<br/></span><span>is  nothing  wrong  with  competition.    Sir,  FNU  has  been  there  for  a  while  in  the  form  of  Derrick 
<br/></span><span>Technical then later on as FIT and now as FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In certain areas, FNU is the leader if we talk about courses such as medicine, allied health, 
<br/>nursing, agriculture, USP does not offer that, it is only FNU that offers such courses and we need 
<br/>FNU to lead in all aspects of our country’s needs, for example, we need a lot more people who can 
<br/>be employed by our businesses and TVET, again becomes very important because TVET can give 
<br/>the businesses the workforce that they need.  So, FNU is still the leader in TVET and there is nothing 
<br/>to  worry  about,  FNU being a dual  university.  They  are offering  academic and vocational  course 
<br/>which makes FNU very different from any university and competition is always good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  highlight  about  the  Apprenticeship  Scheme  and  Honourable 
<br/>Professor  Prasad  has  mentioned  that.    The  Apprenticeship  Scheme  has  been  revived  by  the 
<br/>Government  in  the  last  budget  where  we  are  offering  $100  per  month  to  students  who  take  up 
<br/>apprenticeship.  We are encouraging them to take up apprenticeship.  So it is not that, that we are not

<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aware of it, we want our students to take up apprenticeship, complete the course, graduate from FNU 
<br/>and take up jobs as soon as they can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the motion on 
<br/>the  floor  on  the  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  National  University  Annual  Report  for  2019  and  my 
<br/>response  will  focus  on  the  recommendations  that  is  given  in  the  Report.    There  are  two 
<br/>recommendations and recommendation one reads and I quote, “The University continue to discuss 
<br/>with the Ministry of Economy for the release of funds as soon as applicable.”  The Capital Projects 
<br/>undertaken, the one that I will focus on is the new campus in Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation reads and I quote, “The Committee recognises the importance 
<br/>of  these  three  incomplete  capital  projects  for  the  benefit  of  the  University  and  its  students  and 
<br/>recommends that FNU continue to liaise with the relevant Government agencies and other partners 
<br/>for the completion of the works.”  Capital Projects are the maritime as alluded to by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education, the three-storey building, the Sports Complex at Nasinu and the new campus 
<br/>in Labasa.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will only focus on the Labasa Campus and few other issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, in the findings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the key factors pertinent issue that 
<br/></span><span>was  highlighted  was  that  the  final  quarter  payments  of  the  Operating  Grant  of  $20.7  million  and 
<br/></span><span>Capital Grant of $7.8 million for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 were not paid on time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second pertinent issue was that while the University’s baseline Operating Grant for Fiscal 
<br/>Year 2019-2020 was unchanged at $53.1 million, the Capital Grant was reduced to $15 million in 
<br/>the June 2019 Budget.  This shortfall resulted in the University’s contractual commitments for Fiscal 
<br/>Year 2019-2020 for the construction of the projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I was hoping to hear that from 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Education that the Ministry of Economy will pay all the arrears that is 
<br/>pending  and  also  the  grant  that  needs  to  be  released  to  FNU  so  to  ensure  the  completion  of  this 
<br/>project.  We continuously hear that we leave no one behind but the incompletion of this project will 
<br/>really see that a lot of our students in the North will suffer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  had  highlighted  that,  I 
<br/>continuously highlight the issue on the budget. In this case, it is important that the pending grant be 
<br/>given if indeed our priority is on education.  We know that the grant to USP was also withheld and 
<br/>that  tantamount  that  we  are  not  remaining  true  to  the  priorities  of  Government  in  having  to  hold 
<br/>education as a priority in the National Development Plan and also as we continuously hear in this 
<br/>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I  just  highlight  some  of  the  issues  or  challenges  faced  by  FNU  in 
<br/>regards to the Labasa Campus.  I will just add on to what honourable Professor Prasad had already 
<br/>highlighted but  I heard from the honourable Minister for Education that the blame is  now on the 
<br/>contractor. But, Mr. Speaker, let us look at the land that has been identified for this project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The land that the Government has identified for this project is near the river and is in a flood 
<br/>prone area.  As a result, the contractor in its initial work had to build up almost two and half metres, 
<br/>which is about looking at, from that floor right up to that wall.  Maybe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we look 
<br/>this side it will be from where you sitting, Sir, and way above that.  That has to be built up because 
<br/>of the wet land, the land had been identified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, for the honourable Minister to blame the contractor is… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The work was done separately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.-… is beyond me, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- It will be interesting to find out how the Government identified 
<br/>that land when that land is in a flood prone area and knowingly that the engineers have to work hard, 
<br/>they have to spend money to be able to build up that two and half metres so that the ground is solid 
<br/>enough to be able to accommodate the buildings that is going to be built.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, having heard the honourable Minister bring out the issues, even they have ended up in 
<br/>court. I am not surprised because the very important part of this project which is the land that is being 
<br/>identified  by  the  Government,  that  is  the  problem.    It  is  important  to  find  out  how  was that  land 
<br/>bought, who was it bought from, why could it not be taken to another site?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, even if it is on a State land, they could have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looked at another piece of land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Where? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- That is the Government’s responsibility to do that and not to go 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on a piece of land which they know very well is going to be problematic in the construction process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue that has also been raised on the technical college.  I will 
<br/>just add on to the closure of these technical colleges and the 370 staff more or else who had their jobs 
<br/>on the line.  The honourable Minister did not say anything about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that FNU brought about in their presentation was because of the delay in 
<br/>the grant, they were really faced with financial problems and they had to engage in stringent financial 
<br/>controls which saw the human resource recruitment being reduced to be able for them to work with 
<br/>the money that they had. The recruitment of teaching staff, for example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will impact 
<br/>on the education of the students.  It will affect their service delivery.  So, that is why it is important 
<br/>for the honourable Minister for Economy to make sure that those grants are issued on time, and even 
<br/>for the arrears to be paid up to FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because we were talking about the land, I would like to highlight again the land that belongs 
<br/></span><span>to FNU in Navua and was initially earmarked for the new Koronivia Agricultural College, that had 
<br/>been given on lease to Grace Road.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have brought into this House because 
<br/>we oppose that and now we are just wondering how that lease money, whether it is channelled back 
<br/>to  FNU, because now we have seen that Grace Road business  has really grown across almost  all 
<br/>sectors.  That has been facilitated by the Government by giving that piece of land in Navua, that was 
<br/>supposed to be for FNU, to Grace Road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It is very poor, very sad! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  It  is  not  very  poor,  it  is  not  sad,  honourable  Dr.  Reddy.    You 
<br/>should take the bullet and bite it.  That reflects bad, poor decision-making by the Government in 
<br/>having to give priorities to others and not to our own people in regards to the education of our people,

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Dr. Reddy.  That was supposed to be for the new College of Agriculture.  Now we still 
<br/>have to make do with Koronivia because you did not fight it in Cabinet to make sure that…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not converse between you two, through the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- I apologise, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to remind honourable Dr. Reddy that the College of Agriculture in Koronivia 
<br/>needs to be upgraded and that was a perfect opportunity which they gave away.  That tantamount 
<br/>to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  That  is  the  trouble,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  instead  of  listening  and 
<br/>taking in good ideas from this side of the House and turn it into workable policies, rather than failed 
<br/>policy on that Technical College, they refused to do that, and it would pay for the Government to at 
<br/></span><span>least listen, for example, and I will end on that note.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been hearing on the debate about the Commission of Inquiry on the Auditor-General, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House have continuously tabled and raised and requested that 
<br/>there be a Commission of Inquiry on Violence Against Women and Children because we have even 
<br/>seen deaths and yet, the Government never supported that motion from this side of the House.  Yet, 
<br/>the  Auditor-General  is  doing  a  good  job  by  providing  Audit  Performance  Report  of  Government 
<br/>Entities and exposing the areas of improvement, particularly by the Government in regards to their 
<br/>policies, allocation of funding and programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They do not listen, Mr. Speaker, and yet, they have taken this supposedly independent body 
<br/>to a Commission of Inquiry and yet, they do not hear us from this side of the House to look  at a 
<br/>Commission of Inquiry on Violence Against Women and Children which has caused deaths and it 
<br/>continues to increase.  Crime against violence and crime against women and children continues to 
<br/>increase and the nature of crime continues to be horrendous, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I bring in those issues, Mr. Speaker, just to highlight to the House on the misplaced or the 
<br/>politically motivated motions that have been brought into this House by the Government side, and 
<br/></span><span>having not to listen to us to attend to a genuine request in having to establish a Commission of Inquiry 
<br/></span><span>on  Violence  Against  Women  and  Children  and  yet,  they  saw  it  fit  to  establish  a  Commission  of 
<br/>Inquiry  against  the  Auditor-General.  That  is  a  good  reflection  on  how  politically  motivated  this 
<br/>Government is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to speak 
<br/>on the motion, on the Report of the Fiji National University for its Annual Report and I congratulate 
<br/>the Committee and I also think the honourable Minister for Education has elucidated quite well on 
<br/>the achievements of FNU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  one  point  before  I  get  into  this,  I  think  the  honourable  Salote  Radrodro,  before  she 
<br/>actually accuses Government of selling a particular plot of land to a company, she needs to go back 
<br/>and check her facts on how the land was acquired and who sold it to who. We need to get our facts 
<br/>right so, please, before you start pontificating and pointing, check the facts, and that is what I have 
<br/>been saying continually this past week.

<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>457 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Gavoka probably suggested that we should not have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>established a national university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. V.R. Gavoka interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Well, you suggested,  you hinted that we should have just left USP 
<br/>there, and that we should not compete with it.  The kind of things that are done in USP and FNU 
<br/>should not be in competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, it is important to remember one thing.  When you set up a national university, you 
<br/>design that national university to meet your national need. You should make sure that the kind of 
<br/>programme that you need for your national need is the kind of programmes that are delivered in that 
<br/>university.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you are doing a regional university, you are trying to develop programmes that suit the 
<br/>region as a whole.  That is why it is important to have a national university.  Even if you are going 
<br/>to  have programmes  in  engineering together or  programmes  in  law, the ones  that we have in  our 
<br/>National University are designed specifically for our national training need. That is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You must also remember that our sister and brother countries in the Pacific that used to be 
<br/>part of the USP, they have also gone down this road.  Solomon Islands has developed its own, Samoa, 
<br/>Tonga has its university and Vanuatu. They are all doing that on that same principle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is good to have a national regional body, at the same time, you must have your own bodies 
<br/>to address your specific needs as a country, and that is why it is appropriate to have the Fiji National 
<br/>University in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are number of things that I think are unique about FNU. Firstly, it is dual university. In 
<br/>normal universities, you have academically-oriented universities. This one is dual. You are merging 
<br/>together the need for technical and vocational which is people who do things and academic which is 
<br/>people can understand and talk about and elucidate things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dual universities are things that are very difficult to do.  A lot of countries in the world have 
<br/>tried to do it and have not done too well.  So, it is something that is progressing and it keeps on 
<br/>improving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had various systems in Fiji to try to develop these technical vocational skills and for 
<br/></span><span>me,  that  role  of  technical  vocational  skills  that  are  done  at  FNU  is  very  important  because  it  is 
<br/>developing people who can do the kinds of things that we need in our industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think one of the things that you are seeing at FNU is the possibility of coming from technical 
<br/>vocational stream and as you move up your knowledge can jump across to the academic field. A lot 
<br/>of times when you come up through this technical vocational stream, sometimes it is hard to become 
<br/>portable into the academic stream.  But when you have that in the same university, they develop the 
<br/>pathways so that what  you develop in  your technical skill can become portable to  your academic 
<br/>stream. I think that is very important for us because it gives us and for all the people who are in a 
<br/>technical vocational background, hope.  You will notice they will also have a lot of experience in 
<br/>doing that, probably honourable Professor Prasad talked about the trade testing that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade testing is a scheme that has been in Fiji for a long time, introduced by the ILO many 
<br/>years ago.  Basically at trade testing, you will find a lot of people who can fix cars, build houses but 
<br/>they do not have an academic qualification to their name, but they know how to do it.  So, what the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>458 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trade testing does, it takes that person with a lot of technical know-how, makes him sit a practical 
<br/>test and a knowledge-test and on the basis of that test, gives him a qualification to certify his level of 
<br/>competence.  So, that sort of idea too is now being built into FNU.  I think it is very important to the 
<br/>programmes that they have, the National Trade Test and the National Apprenticeship Scheme.  Both 
<br/>of these schemes look at competence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the problems that we have in the TVET sector is that, we get a lot of teachers who can 
<br/>talk about it but cannot do it. You put them in the classroom to teach theory, they are very good but 
<br/>if you put them in the workshop, they cannot deliver.  I have had people in the past who have attended 
<br/>some institutions and when the lecturers talk they can talk very well but when they come to the labs 
<br/>they  cannot do it.   I know my  own brother who  is  an apprentice, sometimes he  will wait for the 
<br/>teacher  to  go  out,  then  those  people  with  practical  knowledge  would  stand  up  and  they  would 
<br/>demonstrate the real way to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some of the things that are being grappled at FNU and I think they are beginning 
<br/>to move, they are getting to that level of combining their ability to move between the vocational and 
<br/>technical streams, and also the academic. So, the apprenticeship training programme, I am glad to 
<br/>hear that it has been strengthened and it is absolutely fundamental for Fiji.  It has never stopped, it 
<br/></span><span>has kept on going.  For a long time, Government was investing in apprenticeship training, especially 
<br/></span><span>for people in our Public Works Department, Government Shipping, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad to see that this continues to go on and it works very well with the kind of systems 
<br/>that  we  have  established  at  the  Higher  Education  Commission.  In  Fiji,  we  have  a  National 
<br/>Qualifications  Framework  in  which  we  have  developed  qualifications  based  on  the  needs  in  our 
<br/>industries.  A lot of these things are competency-based and having these programmes at FNU being 
<br/>recognised along these lines, strengthens our ability to develop our qualifications in Fiji and make 
<br/>sure that they are recognised, that they become portable - portable from the technical sector into the 
<br/>academic sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that is very important for us and also at the same time it is based on competency based 
<br/>assessments  where  you  can  just  look  at  a  person’s  competencies  and  tick-off  some  of  the 
<br/>competencies that he has, so that they can go and just do the training that plugs the gaps so that they 
<br/>get a qualification.  These are the kinds of things, I think, that they have been working on at FNU 
<br/>and also at the Higher Education Commission. That is one of the things that I think that FNU is very 
<br/>unique and is very important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other arm of FNU that I believe is very important and very unique is the bit that they 
<br/></span><span>have on productivity promotion.  A lot of the countries that are very successful in the world today 
<br/>have focussed on productivity for a long time.  You talk about the Unites States of America, you talk 
<br/>about Japan, Korea, Singapore, these are countries that have focused on productivity and increasingly 
<br/>now, on innovation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within FNU, they have one particular Division called the National Training and Productivity 
<br/>Centre  that  focusses  a  lot  on  training  and  upskilling  people  in  industry  and  also  on  promoting 
<br/>productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the important mechanisms that they have is the Fiji Business Excellence Awards. The 
<br/>aim of the Fiji Business Excellence Awards is to develop world-class organisations in Fiji.  It is a 
<br/>holistic award.  A lot of awards that we have now, we just look at organisations and see, whoever is 
<br/>the best in a particular field.  But this particular award looks at the processes that you need to look at 
<br/>in order to get the output. For instance, if they are trying to look at the manufacturing, they will not 
<br/>just talk about which manufacturing organisation sold the most products.  They will look at all the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>459 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processes that they had in order to become a world class organisation.  Their target is on world class 
<br/>organisations, so I think this is a very important tool that we have in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very unique part of the FNU and this is a part of the University that you will not find 
<br/>in any other university in Fiji, nor in any other university in the South Pacific and probably, very 
<br/>rarely in Australia and New Zealand. It is focussed on the productivity.  The work that they do on 
<br/>the Fiji Business Excellence Awards which has a lot criteria about teaching people how to lead, how 
<br/>to collect data, covert that data into information, to come with knowledge and make decisions on the 
<br/>basis of the knowledge, planning, how to focus on customers, processes and people; and how to get 
<br/>results out of all these  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the greatest benefits over the past few years through the work of NTPC. What they do 
<br/>is, they draw people from the public and the private sector, they teach them in the Framework of this 
<br/>Business Excellence Awards and they use them as evaluators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  programme  of  becoming  an  evaluator  under  the  Fiji  Business  Excellence  Awards  is 
<br/>probably one of the best management development programmes for high potential managing people 
<br/>in the organisation. By going through the process, they get a holistic understanding of what one needs 
<br/></span><span>in order to be able to run an organisation well at the top level. So, this is very, very unique to this 
<br/></span><span>particular  university.  The  work  they  do  on  the  Business  Excellence  Awards,  productivity 
<br/>measurement, the benchmarking and evaluators.  So, all of these things, I believe, makes FNU not 
<br/>just only for the academic programmes that it does, but also the productivity measurement that the 
<br/>Minister talked about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every country in the world wants to become more productive to have greater productivity, 
<br/>but very few are able to measure productivity.  Very few actually know what productivity means, 
<br/>and if you want to manage something, you want to improve it, you have to be able to measure it and 
<br/>that is one of the programmes that is being done there at the FNU.  So I just wanted to say those 
<br/>points.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having this University is a unique university, it has a lot of functions that 
<br/>are  absolutely  fundamental  to  raising  the  quality  of  all  the  organisations  that  we  have  in  Fiji,  to 
<br/>develop the world class organisation and to promote productivity for the betterment of Fiji.  And this 
<br/>can  only  be  done  in  a  national  university  that  is  focused  on  our  national  needs.  Thank  you,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before the House 
<br/></span><span>which is upon the Report of the Standing Committee on Social  Services regarding the Fiji National 
<br/>University (FNU) for the fiscal year 2019. From the outset, I would like to thank the Chairperson and 
<br/>the members of the Committee for the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU was established by the Fiji National University 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Decree in 2009, amended by the Fiji National University (Amendment) Decree in 2010.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Its principle activities, as alluded to by Honourable Members who have spoken before me.  
<br/>Our secondary programme to study in higher education, technical, vocational education and training 
<br/>that are responsive to the needs of the industry; the marketplace, non-formal sector of employment 
<br/>to students from Fiji and other countries in the South Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there are two permanent issues arising out of the recommendations made in the Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which are the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>460 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>The non-release and reduction of Operational Capital Grants; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>The completion of Capital projects undertaken by the University.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow me, Mr. Speaker, Sir to expound on these issues in some detail. It is important to put 
<br/>the record of the Fiji First Government under the microscope in so far as the release of funding is 
<br/>concerned to institutions of higher education.  That record, Mr. Speaker, Sir, includes an impressive 
<br/>list and let me just cite a few:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>The opening of Technical Colleges in Fiji with much fanfare which is now history.  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Withholding of grant to the University of the South Pacific (USP) for personal and political 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reasons.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is  the  motive  behind  this?      By  doing  this,  the  Government  is  depriving  our  Fijian 
<br/>students and taxpayers their inalienable rights as stipulated in the 2013 Constitution.  Now, here we 
<br/>are accepting another report but then we find the usual feature or pattern where funds have not only 
<br/>been withheld but reduced.  It is raising a very smart question and looking for a dumb answer as 
<br/>usual.  What  is  or  are  the  causes  of  these  heavy-handed  approach  upon  the  institutions  of  higher 
<br/>education by this Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Seriously,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  institutions,  our  students  enter  in  order  to  qualify  for 
<br/>employment opportunities.  One thing is for sure, it confirms that indeed the Government has run out 
<br/>of money.  The problem is that our major foreign exchange earners such as tourism are in deep trouble 
<br/>and the traditional sugar industry has been on life support ever since the 2006 coup</span><span>.</span><span> These are all our 
<br/>money earners which when affected caused the non-release of operating and capital expenditure to 
<br/>the institutions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs this to complete its activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- What report are you talking about?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- There is some financial …  I am talking about the FNU Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because of grants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Life support! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Yes.  There is some financial mismanagement by these institutions 
<br/>and if that is so then that needs to be made public.  
<br/> The  huge  allocations  in  the  budget  are  just  a 
<br/>show to hoodwink the people and these institutions.  Apart from the money Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/></span><span>Government has run out of ideas to deal with finances when it comes to honouring its word.  The 
<br/></span><span>Government wants to dictate its own terms and conditions in these universities and thus holding them 
<br/>to ransom by this cheap and unashamed tactic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Exploring this matter a little bit further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contents of the Report is subject 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to debate.  It now gives a qualified clearance to two of these points quite clearly -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Government has run out of funds as I have mentioned; and  
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Holds the institutions of higher education to ransom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to insinuate a very serious charge against this Government which 
<br/>by meting out this heavy-handed approach to these institutions, the State is seeking to control our 
<br/>institutions and academics, their right to be fair in the research and analysis development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as such public policy, this heavy handed approach compromise the teaching 
<br/></span><span>and learning process at these institutions which in turn victimises those who are learning there.  Now, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>461 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if that is the truth then it is very horrific truth, it is a very horrific truth and it has to be put to a stop.  
<br/>We cannot and shall not allow draconian measures, dictatorial actions and egocentric leadership of 
<br/>the Government to be a hindrance to the facilitation of our higher education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who writes this stuff? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- We did not hope for that to eventuate under FijiFirst and I leave 
<br/>this to the electorate to make their choice.  In accepting the certain recommendations made in this 
<br/>Report,  it  seeks  to  highlight  the  capital  projects  undertaken  during  the  period  under  review.  The 
<br/>Maritime Academy which is a three-storey building.  The other is a Sports Complex at the Nasinu 
<br/>Campus and the new campus in Labasa, and I thank the honourable Minister for informing the House 
<br/>that these projects are now completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is apparent from the recommendations that there were pending 
<br/>works for completion of these projects which demands an answer from the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Education  whether  these  pending  completion  works  have  been  completed  or  not  and  if    not  then 
<br/>when. Was it due to the capacity of funds as highlighted in the first recommendation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition to that if we can vividly recall being mentioned in the previous 
<br/></span><span>reports of FNU which have come up for debate where it was pointed out the need for a new dormitory 
<br/>at the Nasinu Campus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time that the FijiFirst Government grows up and displays 
<br/>maturity in dealing with institutions of higher education.  It must stop compromising the education 
<br/>of our children and denying the people a fair view of research and analysis on public policy making.   
<br/>As  such,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  gross  reservations  on  this  Report  and  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to highlight some of the 
<br/>financial aspects of FNU.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNU in 2019 there was a total of 12,226 equivalent 
<br/>fulltime students, a three percent increase in comparison to 2018.  It was also noted that the female 
<br/>graduates are accounted for around 56 percent of the overall graduates in 2019.  Of course, we have 
<br/>seen the trend since we have introduced National Toppers Scheme and TELS that we find a lot more 
<br/>female  in  universities  and  high  schools  now  than  ever  before.    In  fact,  in  many  areas  they  have 
<br/>surpassed that of their male counterparts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  overall  Government  funding,  honourable  Radrodro  unfortunately  has 
<br/></span><span>disappeared and I wanted to talk about that.  Government has allocated a total grant of $410.7 million 
<br/>as  operational  and  capital  grant  for  the  past  seven  years.    For  example,  in  2016  the  operating 
<br/>expenditure to FNU was $36 million, capital expenditure - $5 million.  I will not go through every 
<br/>single year.  In 2018-2019, Sir, the operating expenditure was $65 million and then $19 million for 
<br/>capital expenditure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we saw an increase in the operating expenditure was as 
<br/>honourable Prasad would tell you and honourable Dr. Reddy will also tell you that the lecturers at 
<br/>FNU received far lower salaries than those that were paid at USP. Far less! And in fact so we wanted 
<br/>to of course in order to attract good academics, good trainers to FNU, we need to increase the salaries 
<br/>that they would be able to pay to those people.  They have gone on about the capital expenditure 
<br/>which I will come on to that.  Honourable Radrodro seems to be just fixated on the $20 million capital 
<br/>cut  that  we  made  but  has  completely  ignored  everything  else,  every  other  funding  that  has  been 
<br/>provided to FNU, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNU 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  2016  to  2021-2022,  $344,191,841  has  been  given  as  an 
<br/>operating expenditure. The capital expenditure has been $66,554, 143 million.  Of course, that is not 
<br/>the only revenue they get because FNU as we know is a completely 100 percent Government-funded 
<br/>organisation.  Of course, none of this expenditure, probably a small percentage of it because we used 
<br/>to fund FIT cetera appeared in Government’s book before.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, National Toppers Scheme and TELS. For example, we paid in 2019-2020, 
<br/>$14,749,388 for National Toppers Scheme at FNU and we paid $33,701,736 million for TELS, so 
<br/>combined you are looking at around nearly $50 million or about $48 million on that year plus you 
<br/>are looking at about $65 million worth capital and operating just in that one year alone, so in access 
<br/>of a $100 million that was funded to FNU in one year.  They completely missed that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  every  single  year  FNU  receives  not  only  the  operating  expenditure, 
<br/>capital expenditure plus Toppers plus TELS.  That is the level of funding that have been provided to 
<br/>FNU and of course, we believe it is good investment. We are still a long way in establishing FNU to 
<br/>get a number of international accreditation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Academics over here will tell you that it is not an easy task.  We also know the shenanigans 
<br/></span><span>that used to take place at Derrick Technical Institute (DTI) those of you know that or Fiji Institute of 
<br/></span><span>Technology  (FIT)  and  in  fact,  FNU  inherited  many  of  those  people  who  used  to  work  in  those 
<br/>organisations.  Some of them do not even have the right qualifications.  When FNU was set up, we 
<br/>had students wanting to do Masters and the lecturers, who were their supervisors did not even have 
<br/>a Master’s degree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had people wanting to do PhDs but there is nobody over PhD qualification at FNU in that 
<br/>particular area of discipline.  These are the challenges faced by FNU. Any academic would tell you, 
<br/>honourable Prasad I am sure you will agree. Honourable Dr. Reddy and others will tell you cannot 
<br/>have a lecturer supervising somebody to do a PhD when you do not even have a PhD yourself.  So, 
<br/>these are the challenges in having a national university. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka says we will make university free. Tertiary institutions will be all free.  
<br/>This is the kind of funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is required and he is saying every single student in 
<br/>Fiji, so USP, University of Fiji and FNU.  And obviously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they will cut funding 
<br/>from somewhere else if they are going to stick to their word.  Of course let us assume they will get 
<br/>elected. That is another issue. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all need to come away from la-la land.  
<br/>In  the  2018-2019  budget,  FNU  Campus  was  given  $6  million,  the  FNU  Vet  Laboratory  was  $4 
<br/>million allocation, Nasinu Campus - $4 million and the Maritime Academy - $5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Leawere, who obviously has his speeches written because he just simply reads it 
<br/>off, many issues he raised, the honourable Minister for Education already addressed that but he kept 
<br/>on  asking  the  same  question.    This  is  the  problem.    The  maritime  building  of  course  is  about  80 
<br/>percent completed, bit delayed but it will get completed very soon.  The Gym Complex at FNU, I 
<br/>understand the opening is next week or week after next or in early March.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course we have continued to fund FNU.  There was a reduction in capital 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expenditure of course because of COVID-19.  We had to put that on hold and to say that Labasa 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>463 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>campus, when you know that there is a legal issue, why continue to make budgetary allocation for 
<br/>the sake of looking good.  If you know there is a legal issue, there will not be any construction going 
<br/>on, why do you want to allocate funding for that.  These guys have complete lack of understanding 
<br/>of how finance works if the matter is before the courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Radrodro, who I wish would smile a lot more, she is always so 
<br/>serious, in fact, I thought was suddenly an advocate for the contractor because she said oh, the poor 
<br/>contractor, they had to raise up the land.  When you bid for work, you know exactly the parameters 
<br/>of your contract work.  In any case the civil works were given by somebody else.  When you bid for 
<br/>work you know exactly, it is your job to go and check what you have to do, then you put in your 
<br/>tender.  It is not like suddenly it was revealed upon the contractor and therefore oh my God, poor 
<br/>contractor!  If that was the case, the court would not have ruled in FNU’s favour.  This is the kind of 
<br/>level of debate we have to engage in, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I also wanted to make was that one of the issues that 
<br/>honourable Minister Usamate raised which is very pertinent and so did Minister Premila Kumar. Was 
<br/>FNU’s ability to be responsive to the vocational area for the demands of the nation?  A case in point.  
<br/>I mentioned yesterday and also today about the BPO sector, fast growing, 3,000 jobs during COVID-
<br/></span><span>19, 3,000 jobs during COVID-19 is not any easy feat.  FNU has now developed a short- term course, 
<br/></span><span>so people wanting to work in the BPO sector can do that course, so when you have overseas company 
<br/>coming in, they know that our people have the right qualifications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other areas in the BPO sector, so what the BPO people are telling us, you do not 
<br/>have any courses available at any of the universities where you have management skillsets in running 
<br/>a  BPO  facility.    So  they  are  currently  looking  at  developing  those  types  of  courses  available  in 
<br/>collaboration with the BPO Council and Outsource Fiji.  So, we have the skillsets, it is a huge growth 
<br/>area. Things like lots of coding et cetera is critically important for us to have skillsets.  So, FNU does 
<br/>offer us that opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also through the climate change division looking at how we can collaborate with FNU 
<br/>in terms of not just this sort of academic side of climate change, but in terms of some of the practical 
<br/>issues  where  the  climate  change  matters  can  be  addressed  through  training.    Now,  Honourable 
<br/>Leawere again, please somebody wrote there and he is saying the economy has been on a life support 
<br/>since 2007.  I mean what nonsense. He said tourism sector is on life support, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNU of course has a lot of potential and there is a lot of work to be 
<br/></span><span>done.  I would also like to make the point about the number of people on the Council. We have a 
<br/></span><span>professor from Monash University in the area of medical sciences and we have people who are on 
<br/>the Council working in  artificial intelligence.   I think it is a very good Council, people from the 
<br/>private sector, the banking sector et cetera, so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNU will continue to fund some of 
<br/>the  capital  projects  and  we  look  forward  to  their  completion.    The  question  was  asked,  why  that 
<br/>particular land because it is actually State land so the State has basically given that land to FNU.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other buildings that are being built there, there is a cinema, et cetera, on that land.  
<br/>Of  course,  honourable  Dr.  Reddy  had    talked  about  dredging  the  rivers,  et  cetera  so  we  hope  to 
<br/>mitigate those issues regarding flooding and we will, of course, look forward to working with the 
<br/>Council and we should all be proud.  I am glad Members on the other side have also said that we 
<br/>need  to  have  this  University  which  will  give  us  that  level  of  competition  and  indeed  wonderful 
<br/>opportunities for our youth.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I want to say, honourable Professor Prasad, we are also talking to young people 
<br/>too.  A lot of them actually, some have come back to Fiji.  Some do not want to go to Fiji because of 
<br/>the opportunities that Fiji is offering.  For example, in the digital space because of the digital space, 
<br/>we now are actually recruiting.  One of the few ministries in the Government that is recruiting people 
<br/>is in the ITC space. We need the capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of people are now coming to Fiji because of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) 
<br/>Council, et cetera, so there are new jobs being created which a lot of the young people in fact are into 
<br/>and we will look forward to obviously making sure that we retain their skill sets and the brains that 
<br/>actually exist amongst them and we can do so by offering a number of courses and opportunities and 
<br/>of course jobs too.
