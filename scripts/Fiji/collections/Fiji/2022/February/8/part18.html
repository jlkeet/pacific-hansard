<br/>INVESTMENT FIJI 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Report on the Review of Investment 
<br/>Fiji  2016-2017,  2017-2018  and  2018-2019  Annual  Report  which  was  tabled  on  19</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Investment Fiji works for the benefit of the 
<br/></span><span>national economy  by creating employment opportunities, raising economic activity and bringing in 
<br/></span><span>foreign exchange to the country thereby increasing Fiji’s economic growth and prosperity prospects.  
<br/>Through this a core function of promoting and facilitating investment and exports Investment Fiji 
<br/>helps raise Fiji’s standard of living and contributes to the eradication of poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  various  initiatives  and  programmes  that  Investment  Fiji  undertook 
<br/>during the period under review were much appreciated as it enhanced Fiji’s position in the global 
<br/>market as a trading destination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  was  pleased  to  note  that  under  the  Foreign  Investment  (Amendment) 
<br/>Regulations 2013, a total of 17 activities were reserved for local businesses and recommended for 
<br/>Investment Fiji to collaborate with relevant stakeholders to design incentive packages to encourage 
<br/>more locals to start a business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  its  deliberations  the  Committee  noted  the  Prime  Minister’s  International  Business 
<br/>Awards Initiative and commended Investment Fiji for providing local companies with a platform for

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognition and capacity building.  Such events not only reward businesses and exporters who are 
<br/>positively  contributing  to  the  economy  on  an  international  level  but  also  provides  working 
<br/>opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was satisfied with the overall performance of Investment 
<br/>Fiji and acknowledges their contribution towards Fiji’s economy during the period under review and 
<br/>encouraged continued progress to enhance its service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members the floor is now open for debate on this motion.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir and before I discuss the Report, I just wanted 
<br/>to  respond  to  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister’s  attack  on  Mr.  Anish  Chand  and  Mr.  Vijay 
<br/>Narayan.  Sometimes I think the honourable Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Economy thinks 
<br/>that </span><span>Fiji Times,</span><span> Communications Fiji Limited and </span><span>Fijivillage</span><span> works for NFP.  At least that is how he 
<br/>tries to portray it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to appeal to him, let us not attack individuals who are not in Parliament and especially 
<br/>those from the media.  I know these two gentlemen, Mr. Anish Chand and Mr. Vijay Narayan.  They 
<br/></span><span>are seasoned journalists, they have a lot of respect in their media fraternity in this country and I know 
<br/></span><span>because I have been interviewed by both of them before I was a politician on so many issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must understand that the media environment in Fiji is quite a stifling environment for 
<br/>journalists, for media organisations and it does not look very good on Government, whenever they 
<br/>do not like news which is in favour of them, they start attacking the journalists. I would appeal to the 
<br/>honourable Acting Prime Minister not to please get into this attack on journalists.  I know there are 
<br/>media organisations that have said many things and defamatory as well at times but that is another 
<br/>matter but we do not go around attacking journalist in particular in those media organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to the Report, I want to thank the Committee for their Report.  
<br/>It is in some sense very comprehensive because I was just reading the verbatim notes of the meeting 
<br/>and  I  thought  that  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Manager  Investment  and  Trade  Manager 
<br/>Investment Facilitation actually provided very good responses to the questions that the Committee 
<br/>had put.  I think from reading the verbatim report and the responses,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I feel very 
<br/>confident that they actually know what the role of trade in  Investment Fiji or the importance of the 
<br/>organisation to promote investment. So, I want to take this opportunity to thank them for providing 
<br/>those frank answers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investment is a very important component of our GDP.  Basic economics 
<br/>tells us that it is made up of consumption, investment which includes foreign direct investment as 
<br/>well as domestic investment which includes Government expenditure plus export minus the imports, 
<br/>the trade deficit or trade surplus and all that put together, of course, is the GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If GDP grows, it means that three of those entities or all of them are growing and the ideal 
<br/>situation Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be to have a balance but in the long run the fundamental premise 
<br/>on  which  you  could  have  sustainable  GDP  growth  is  investment  and  trade  which  is  having  a 
<br/>reasonable level of trade.  Ideally, we would like trade surplus and ideally we would like both foreign 
<br/>and domestic investments, but one factor that is also very important when you look at investment 
<br/>because  in  private  investment,  domestic  investment  it  includes  not  just  businesses  but  people 
<br/>themselves.    People  build  houses,  do  all  types  of  investment  at  a  family  level,  community  level.  
<br/>These are all counted as investment but for that we also need savings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>466 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports   8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to highlight the importance of investment but for me to do that, 
<br/>let  me  just  talk  about  savings  as  well.    Unfortunately,  Fiji’s  gross  domestic  savings  rate  is  low 
<br/>compared  to  similar  countries  that  we  were  in  the  same  group;  the  developing  middle  income 
<br/>countries which was  Group C, now we are in  Group B, except  for some countries like Romania, 
<br/>Georgia and Philippines, Fiji’s gross domestic savings has been rated as low.  Of course, we run 
<br/>chronic trade and fiscal deficits which again is consistent with low savings rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important for us to understand that we need to make sure that we have a level of Foreign 
<br/>Direct Investment (FDI) as well as domestic investment and the ADB Report as I said earlier points 
<br/>out that Foreign Direct Investment has been modest averaging 6.9 per cent of GDP between 2014 
<br/>and 2019 and also has been very volatile.  We need to understand why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make is about Foreign Direct Investment.  I think the Report 
<br/>says that Fiji has been moderately successful in attracting FDI over the past decade aided by political 
<br/>stability and a system of tax and other concessions.  That is a plus for Government, however these 
<br/>FDI inflows have tendered to be volatile and highly concentrated in few sectors especially in tourism.  
<br/>Fiji’s net FDI average was 6 per cent of GDP during 2010 to 2020 with a minimum of 4.4 per cent 
<br/>on GDP in 2015 and a maximum of 8.4 per cent of GDP in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it also talks about personal remittances.  As I said, the GDP component is 
<br/>consumption, investment, government expenditure and trade.  We know that in the last seven years 
<br/>at least since I have been in Parliament, I think we have relied essentially on Government expenditure 
<br/>which is the “G” component of the GDP equation as well as consumption which can be driven by 
<br/>increase in Government expenditure, which also means that we are likely to incur more debt which 
<br/>is also what the ADB is saying that our debt level is at a point where we risk distress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  absolutely  important  for  us  to  understand  that  basic  point  that  in  the  long  term,  for 
<br/>sustainable economic  growth, we need to  remove the major obstacles which includes the need to 
<br/>increase the low level  of private investment  and reliance on public investment  to  drive economic 
<br/>growth.  This is fundamental, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have consistently talked about this and I know 
<br/>the Ease of Doing Business, World Bank stuff is no longer available but we used to talk about that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It did indicate to us on many instances that there were problems with respect to attracting 
<br/>Foreign Direct  Investment and encouraging  domestic investment in the country.  It  also says that 
<br/>major obstacles also include constraint access to quality services and economic opportunities caused 
<br/>in part by infrastructure deficits, vulnerability to climate and disaster risk and other external shocks 
<br/></span><span>which  erode  fiscal  buffers  and  cause  economic  volatility.    We  have  experienced  that  and  we 
<br/></span><span>understand that, but that is not the only factor.   These challenges are exacerbated by our country’s 
<br/>small size country and remote location, despite being one of the larger and more developed Pacific 
<br/>Island countries.  Fiji has opportunities, and I agree to leverage it central position in the Pacific which 
<br/>makes the country a natural and regional hub for trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the Report does point out that while there is interest, while people 
<br/>have  the    same  proposals  and  register  to  invest  in  Fiji,  the  difference  between  the  proposals  or 
<br/>registration  and  the  actual  implementation  remains  a  challenge  for  Fiji  and  might  I  say  for  any 
<br/>country.    But  what  I  want  to  ask  is,  what  are  the  constraints?  Have  we  identified  any  binding 
<br/>constraints that might be there which is keeping foreign investment or, indeed, private investment 
<br/>very, very modest.  We need to think through that carefully.  I have heard about one stop shop, for 
<br/>example, for a long time.  I am not sure how that is working or whether that is working at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  point  that  I  want  to  make,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  the  situation  with  respect  to  the 
<br/>services and the ADB Report does talk about infrastructure.  We are saying that we are spending a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lot on infrastructure and, again, it brings us to the point about value for money, priority, where the 
<br/>economic  services  are  needed,  where  the  social  services  are  needed,  how  is  the  infrastructure 
<br/>spending align to those two areas that would help us create more investment in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final point I want to make and I think the Report talks about the sustainable towns and 
<br/>cities. It talks about Goal No. 11.  I think it is a very important point that the Committee has raised, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, that we need to look at what is happening to our cities and towns.  Are they creative?  
<br/>Are they innovative?  What is the environment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here again, I tend to keep going back to the whole management of town and city councils in 
<br/>this  country.    We  have  heard  many  times  in  this  Parliament  that  we  had  corruption,  we  had 
<br/>mismanagement when we had elected councils but if you compare the way in which the cities and 
<br/>town councils are run today, Mr. Speaker, if you look at the availability of the services that are being 
<br/>provided, not only for consumers and ratepayers but also services that facilitate investment.  So, this 
<br/>idea of sustainable creative cities is important from the investment point of view.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  had  pointed  out  that  any  investment  is  linked  to  savings  as  well.  
<br/>Government expenditure is fine, it can mean more borrowing which is what has happened.  We have 
<br/></span><span>not given enough attention to the amount of remittances that we are getting and sometimes, we do 
<br/></span><span>not acknowledge that, especially the amount of remittances that we received in 2020 and 2021.  In 
<br/>fact, a lot of the economic activities are being driven by the amount of remittances that we received.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was in Nabitu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, about four to five weeks ago.  There were about 26 people, 
<br/>so I asked them a question.  They were telling me about the difficulties they were facing and I said, 
<br/>“How many of you have relatives overseas?”  Almost all of them put their hands up.  My second 
<br/>question was, “How many of you receive remittances?”  Almost all of them put their hands up to say 
<br/>that  they  have  been  receiving  remittances  from  their  families  and  friends.    It  is  a  very  important 
<br/>contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  Mr.  Speaker,  in  the  long  term,  consumption  through  remittances  and  Government 
<br/>expenditure through continued borrowing, is not going to provide sustainable economic growth, and 
<br/>that was what happened with this Government’s policy until 2019.  We got hit by COVID-19 and we 
<br/>are in a deep hole, so now is an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this Government to relook at its 
<br/>economic  policy  agenda.    Review  what  they  have  done  in  the  past,  and  not  just  brag  about 
<br/>unprecedented growth, because it is always important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an election year, they may be voted out or likely to be voted out, but they must leave 
<br/></span><span>a legacy.  They must put up a plan for the next government to actually work on.  We might be thankful 
<br/>if we come into government that they actually did that.  This is what a good government will do.  A 
<br/>good government will make policies in consultation with the Opposition because if they are genuine 
<br/>about leaving a legacy, they must feel that the Opposition also supports what they do.  This happens 
<br/>in every democracy.  When the government changes, the direction set by a party which has been in 
<br/>government for so many years, can be continued.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It makes sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for a government not to just rubbish the Opposition all the 
<br/>time, but to work together and try to leave a legacy that will be carried on.  Any government which 
<br/>is going to come after these people is not going to change everything that they have done, all the laws 
<br/>that they have put in, I mean, there are things that we acknowledge that have been done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you put up a plan which is honestly relooking at the economic agenda, the strategy, that 
<br/>plan, even if  you are not in  government,  can be  carried on.  So, Mr. Speaker, investment  is  very 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports   8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>important but it is also important that we create an environment for that kind of investment so that 
<br/>we have sustainable economic growth in the future.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  this 
<br/>important motion for debate.  As we all know, investment is actually central to growth and sustainable 
<br/>development and I think everyone will agree to that.  It expands on an economy’s productive capacity 
<br/>with driving job creation and an income growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  recognising  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Governments  around  the  world  have  actually 
<br/>established IPAs to create awareness of exiting investment opportunities and attract investors that 
<br/>can foster job creation and productivity growth, and to facilitate their establishment and expansion 
<br/>in the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  an  extended  arm  of  the  Government  that  provides 
<br/>services and assistance to promote, to facilitate and to stimulate investments and exports.  Investment 
<br/>Fiji actually continues on the course of executing its core functions.  However, it also to a certain 
<br/>degree,  plays  the  role  of  gatekeeper  and  regulator.  For  instance,  Investment  Fiji  issues  Foreign 
<br/>Investment Registration Certificates and undertakes background and due diligence checks pf foreign 
<br/></span><span>investors, whilst they also engage in promotional activities and advisory and information services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  can  say  that  Investment  Fiji,  at  present,  is  vested  with  two  totally 
<br/>different  roles  -  regulator  and  the  promoter.    In  order  to  correct  this  anomaly  and  to  ensure  that 
<br/>Investment Fiji is focussed on its core responsibility, the Government has undertaken a number of 
<br/>reforms. These reforms todate are inclusive of development of an Investment Policy Statement, a 
<br/>new and modernised Investment Act which was passed by Parliament in 2021 and a review of the 
<br/>Investment Fiji Act and this was done to align the role of Investment Fiji with the new Investment 
<br/>Act, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  reforms  basically  provide  an  overarching  architecture  to  anchor 
<br/>investment policies across Government Agencies towards a common goal, to align all the laws and 
<br/>regulations and processes and procedures to international best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The overall vision is to make Investment Fiji the leading investment promotion agency in the 
<br/>region and is demonstrated by increased levels of investment and exports.  The  role  of  Investment 
<br/>Fiji will be strengthened, Mr. Speaker, and it will be solely responsible for investment promotion and 
<br/>facilitation of both, domestic and foreign investors.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the Opposition focusses on is foreign investors but now, they are starting to talk about 
<br/>the  domestic  investors  also.    But  during  the  pandemic,  it  has  been  domestic  investors  and 
<br/>reinvestments that has been fuelling economic activity, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  had  presented  some  figures  earlier  on  regarding  the  Department  of  Town  and  Country 
<br/>Planning, which is actually on the growth on the construction sector.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, 758 permits 
<br/>were issued in 2021, of which 48 were major multimillion dollar building projects worth about $608 
<br/>million.    So,  about  600 Completion  Certificates were  issued,  worth  $162.8  million  and  this  is  an 
<br/>increase of about $42.5 million, compared to 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  in  line  with  international  best  practices,  Mr.  Speaker,  Investment  Fiji’s  role  will  be 
<br/>attracting investments, investment generation including targetted investment, foreign and domestic, 
<br/>investor facilitation and aftercare, and export and promotion and policy advocacy.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>469 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, like other successful investment promotion agencies, like Singapore’s Economic 
<br/>Development  Board,  Investment  Fiji  will  change  its  approach  and  become  proactive  in  pursuing 
<br/>desirable investors and multinational companies that will bring countless benefits to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have highlighted the future plans for Investment Fiji, it was interesting to note also, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, that the Standing Committee also was fixed on the fact that with respect to World Bank 
<br/>Group Doing Business Report and Ranking.  It was also again mentioned by Honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the Report that has been discontinued and it is important to say this today, that it has 
<br/>actually been discontinued due to faults found in the data collection processes and this is  the point 
<br/>that  was  raised  with  the  authorities  -  by  us,  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Commerce, Trade and Tourism. It was the Report that was skewered towards advanced and larger 
<br/>developing  countries  and  disadvantaging  small  island  development  states  that  have  made  real 
<br/>challenges.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We continuously said this, we continuously came here to this Parliament House and explained 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it and today, it does not exist anymore because of that very reason.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is so much information now, Mr. Speaker, out in the public domain on reforms that 
<br/>have been undertaken to improve and modernise business processes and to make doing business in 
<br/>Fiji simpler and easier, and I encourage the Opposition to read it. These reforms have been done to 
<br/>assist investors.  It was actually not being done to meet any particular ranking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee also failed to look at the Government machinery 
<br/>as  one.  It  treats  all  arms  as  different  and  I  bring  the  attention  of  the  House  on  one  particular 
<br/>recommendation.  It says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Committee  recommends  for  Investment  Fiji  to  collaborate  with  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders to design incentive packages to encourage more locals to start businesses.”    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Incentives for domestic investors, Mr. Speaker, especially in target growth areas are provided 
<br/>for  through  our  National  Budget  and  all  economic-related  agencies  contribute  to  that  particular 
<br/>process. There are programmes and initiatives from MSMEs, incentives for ICT and BPOs, as we 
<br/>have just mentioned, incentives for tourism development, incentives in the medical sector, incentives 
<br/>in value addition in agriculture, fisheries and forests, duty concession for investments, tax rebates, 
<br/></span><span>and I could on, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee also  note that  domestic investors are protected by maintaining  a 
<br/>reserve list.  But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not the best way to protect domestic business.  That is why 
<br/>we have bought in the protections through the new Investment Act.  The new Investment Act confers 
<br/>protection and obligations to both foreign and domestic investors.  The Act also makes a reserved 
<br/>and  restricted  list  more  practical  and  easier  to  implement.    The  main  principle  of  the  Act  is  to 
<br/>primarily ensure protection of national interest  and protection of MSMEs, protection of resource-
<br/>based sectors and protection of domestic infant industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reforms  in  the  investment  legal  framework  is  being  reflected  in  the 
<br/>forward plans of Investment Fiji and they are in the process of finalising the new strategic plan and 
<br/>furthermore  Investment  Fiji  is  actually  working  on  a  marketing  strategy,  aftercare  plan  for  both 
<br/>domestic and foreign investors and stakeholder relationships, the management plan, the strategic plan 
<br/>also  undertakes  demand  site  analysis  that  identify  the  historical  current  and  future  opportunities 
<br/>available in investment and trade and that is viable for Fiji to target.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports   8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The supply side analysis is one that identifies factors that an investor will typically consider 
<br/>when  making  an  investment  decision  in  a  country.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  refine  the  reporting 
<br/>mechanisms for investment, Investment Fiji has implemented a reporting model also whereby the 
<br/>investment value for one year is captured rather than for three years.  This mechanism is established 
<br/>to allow for collection of more realistic data and analysis on real time investments.  We have officers 
<br/>based in Labasa and Lautoka with the aim to reach out also to our resources owners, government 
<br/>agencies and other stakeholders in order to educate and encourage more locals also to take advantage 
<br/>of the initiative run by Investment Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Investment Fiji has adopted virtual platforms to conduct 
<br/>these missions and to date we have had about 36 virtual investments and trade events.  These missions 
<br/>aim to promote Fiji in trade and investment exhibitions and to strengthen our networking and identify 
<br/>potential export opportunities.  This is all well documented Sir.  Investment Fiji has also reconvened 
<br/>work  on  the  Prime  Minister’s  International  Business  Awards  and  we  will  make  the  necessary 
<br/>announcements in due course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is some data also that probably just needs to make it easier for our 
<br/>businesses to get registered and be a part of the economic recovery also, online companies, business 
<br/></span><span>registrations, no more business licences, risk-based businesses processes for starting a business, low 
<br/></span><span>risk businesses could start operating after tax and business registration. There is no need to  go to 
<br/>OHS, NFA et  cetera,  approvals,  if the buildings  already  had  a valid  registration and there  are no 
<br/>alterations done to the workspace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in the budget also, the Government will also pay for market 
<br/>fee for about 8,000 market vendors so these are small businesses, pay for base fees for taxis, buses, 
<br/>mini  vans,  carriers,  fishing  industry,  fisherfolk,  inshore  fishing  licence  fees  and  other  associated 
<br/>MSAF fees and to support our local exporters also the Government will pay Biosecurity Authority 
<br/>of Fiji fees on all exports for 12 months, waiver of business licenses continues, reduction of electricity 
<br/>rates for MSMEs from commercial to domestic rates and government foots the reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cashless society  also  is  an important  aspect,  paying fees for  </span><span>Vitikart 
<br/></span><span>platforms for</span><span> M-PAiSA</span><span> for fees for agents for MSMEs and it would also assist MSMEs to install 
<br/>mobile money transfer services and internet payment gateway.  The construction permit processes 
<br/>information is really available online and the fast-track process of Peg-b.    So,  a  lot  of  these  things 
<br/>have already occurred and I am sure if honourable Professor Prasad actually had a good read, you 
<br/>will see there is a lot of assistance that is being given to our companies that are either newly formed 
<br/></span><span>or currently exist. This is domestic investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unlike what the Opposition may believe Sir, the Fijian Government is actually focused on 
<br/>growing our economy and we continue to evolve on a daily basis.  COVID-19 has also taught us, we 
<br/>are not going to just lie and rest on our laurels from before.  There is a lot of work that is still being 
<br/>done in terms of changing the platform in terms of making sure that our businesses survive and we 
<br/>want  to  ensure  that  there  is  recovery  both  from  a  domestic  perspective  and  also  recovery  from  a 
<br/>foreign investor perspective.   This is actually a critical role that Investment of Fiji will play in terms 
<br/>of Fiji moving forward.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to contribute to 
<br/>the debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Investment Fiji obviously plays a pivotal 
<br/>role and we have continued to fund them and as the Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 
<br/>Transport highlighted that they do actually play a facilitating role not just for foreign investors but 
<br/>also for local investors.  We have also provided or relaxed a number of rules pertaining to business

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Investment Fiji 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>471 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>registrations, the turnaround times and of course in respect to removing some of these, what may 
<br/>some consider impediments completely from the landscape.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prasad  talked  about  you  know  where  is  the  plan.    We  have  the  National 
<br/>Development Plan that of course went into limbo after the 1987 coups.  We have the 20-year plan, 
<br/>we have a five-year plan, of course that has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic which has in 
<br/>fact turned the world on its head, not just Fiji but a number of jurisdictions including if we look at 
<br/>the debt to GDP ratio even in countries like New Zealand, significantly increased the debt to GDP 
<br/>ratios.   So it is not something peculiar to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is quite unbecoming of him to suggest that the Fijian economy since 2007-2019 
<br/>basically  rode  just  simply  on  remittances.    Obviously  that  is  quite  silly  to  even  suggest  that  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir and the ADB Report, they keep on harping on about it because obviously  that is the 
<br/>narrative with they have grabbed, hold on to like many other things they have done.  But of course, 
<br/>a number of incentives have been put in place, we have seen a number of incentives being actually 
<br/>driving investment now as I also mentioned in the BPO Council- a number of the other areas where 
<br/>investment interest is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue about the journalists.  I do not want to labour the point but I think 
<br/></span><span>the point that he said there is a stifling environment for journalists.  There is nothing stifling about 
<br/>what is happening. Nobody is actually stopped from printing anything.  There is no censorship.  In 
<br/>fact the quality of journalism many would argue has gone down.  They are not even adhering to the 
<br/>standards.  If you look at the schedules to the Act, nobody is actually adhering to those standards and 
<br/>you know that very well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prasad is on record for calling people, accusing them of skirt 
<br/>journalism et cetera.  Just a few days ago, he said I do not speak to particular media organisations. 
<br/>Somebody sent me a voice recording of it.  So let us not engage in this hypocrisy.  But the point I 
<br/>would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir is this and I have said this publicly.  There is nothing wrong, 
<br/>even Transparency International (TI) has said that.  There is actually nothing wrong with a media 
<br/>organisation taking an editorial position.  It does happen. For example, if you go to UK, you may 
<br/>find the </span><span>Daily Telegraph</span><span> saying they actually support maybe the conservatives or one organisation 
<br/>has supported the Labour Party.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no problem with that as long as they declare that.  TI will tell you.  I was a 
<br/>board member of Transparency International.  We had a speaker actually I remember at one of the 
<br/></span><span>USP  lecture halls a few years back and in which they said there is nothing wrong with that.  But the 
<br/></span><span>media organisation must declare its interest.  That is all we are saying.  Do not hide behind the facade 
<br/>of saying we are independent and we are doing balanced reporting when actually you are not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So there is nothing wrong if the </span><span>Fiji Times </span><span>wants to come out and say we support NFP and 
<br/>Rabuka.  They can say that. Their editorial position- no problem, they should make it in their editorial 
<br/>statement, not every day,  just say it once, so everybody knows what is the proclivity in terms of the 
<br/>way you write the stories.  That is all we are saying. Do not hide behind the façade.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many media organisations in the world actually practice that. </span><span>Fox News</span><span>, they came out and 
<br/>said we support Trump, so when you turn on the television, when you watch </span><span>Fox News</span><span>, you know 
<br/>that they will have a particular editorial line. That is fine. People are aware of that and those people 
<br/>that actually support Trump will go and actually watch it.  Nothing wrong with that but please, let us 
<br/>not pretend, let us not pretend that you are independent.  Let us not pretend that your editorials have 
<br/>a particular proclivity a particular stance.  That is all we are saying.  Thank you, Sir.
