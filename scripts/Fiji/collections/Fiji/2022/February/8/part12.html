<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY,  
<br/>TRADE AND TOURISM 2016-2018 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Report on the Review of the Ministry 
<br/>of Industry, Trade and Tourism 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 Annual Reports, which was 
<br/>tabled on 18</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled its 
<br/>findings on the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/>in August 2021.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>387 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism (MITT) now known as Ministry of Commerce, 
<br/>Trade, Tourism and Transport, plays a crucial role towards the economic development of Fiji.  It has 
<br/>various Units and Departments within it that actively work towards creating sustainable growth of 
<br/>commerce and industry through innovative and sound policies that lead to improved livelihood of all 
<br/>Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Innovation is an essential driver of economic progress that benefits consumers, businesses 
<br/>and  the  economy  as  a  whole,  which  is  why  the  Committee  is  pleased  to  note  that  the  Young 
<br/>Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES) continued to run successfully during the period under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Initiatives, such as the Micro and Small Business Grants (MSBG), which had over 18,000 
<br/>recipients  during  the  period  under  review,  carry  great  importance,  which  is  why  the  Committee 
<br/>recommended  for  stringent  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms  be  implemented  for  all  such 
<br/>projects,  to  ensure  that  applicants  are  compliant  with  the  conditions  under  which  the  grants  are 
<br/>disbursed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  commended  the  awareness,  informal  sessions  and  other  services  to  co-
<br/>operatives during the period of review.  The year 2016 brought its own challenges for the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>as it was the year that Fiji had to endure the devastation caused by </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>, despite which the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry continued key trade negotiations, investment promotions and policy changes to enhance the 
<br/>business environment in Fiji and abroad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like encourage everyone to have a read through MITT’s Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goals Report which is available on the Parliament website, as part of the annexures to this Report, 
<br/>as  it shows the significant work done by MITT during the period under review to progress towards 
<br/>its SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was satisfied with the overall performance of the Ministry and recognised the 
<br/>critical role they play in the economic development of the nation, and acknowledge the progress in 
<br/>the Tourism Development Plan, the MSG Trade Agreement 2, the Cooperatives, Micro and Small 
<br/>Business Grant and other programmes.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the  floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch specifically on the area of 
<br/>trade in this Report.  Yesterday, we spoke at length about the ADB Policy Paper which we all know, 
<br/></span><span>is quite sobering in relation to our economy.  And we make the point, Mr. Speaker, that our resources 
<br/></span><span>sector should be growing at a rate that can give us surpluses to grow the economy and also help pay 
<br/>our debt and bring it down to the level that we are comfortable with, which is normally about 40 
<br/>percent of GDP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday we spoke about the minerals and my colleague, the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources was very defensive and protective of his Ministry by I ask 
<br/>the question, how can you defend a Ministry that is contributing less than 1 percent to GDP?  We 
<br/>want growth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA wants growth!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also spoke yesterday about the fisheries sector.  This is where I would 
<br/>like to focus my contribution this morning, on what is happening with our Tuna processing capacity  
<br/>in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have the capacity,  Mr. Speaker, to  process  75,000 metric tonnes a year, and there are 
<br/>about seven processing plants in Suva.  But the problem is the supply of tuna.  Fiji’s water is not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>388 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ideal for tuna, but tuna is in plentiful supply in the waters of the Solomon Islands and the waters of 
<br/>Papua New Guinea.  We ask the question that these are our MSG partners, our Wantok.  Why is it 
<br/>that we cannot acquire tuna from their waters to fully utilise the capacity we have in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, is a sad indictment on the way FijiFirst handles the relationship within the 
<br/>region, with our neighbours in particular.  Of course, in the Northern part of the Pacific, there is also 
<br/>tuna  in  plentiful  supplies,  we  also  should  be  acquiring  tuna  from  that  area.    So,  I  would  ask  the 
<br/>Government, why is it that you cannot use your relationship to enable us to secure tuna from those 
<br/>MSG countries and to keep our processing plants in Fiji fully functioning?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it also goes down to the Suva Port which used to be hub of the Pacific.  You 
<br/>have what you call, the distant fleet vessels.  These are vessels from around the Pacific that used to 
<br/>come to Suva for resupply, for refit and the like.  And there used to be about a minimum  of 200 
<br/>vessels a year.  They have gone to Pompeii and they have gone to Pago Pago.  Imagine the impact 
<br/>on Suva when 200 vessels a minimum, Mr. Speaker, Sir, staying for three days or four days, have 
<br/>relocated elsewhere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my friends in the Pacific have told me that there is no market in the Pacific, 
<br/></span><span>like the Suva Market - no market.  From Port Moresby to Papeete and in between, nothing is like 
<br/></span><span>Suva Market. These vessels were helping our farmers in the Suva Market.  I mean, there is only one 
<br/>aspect of it, the resupply, and there is the refuelling and the refitting, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  lost  this  much  business  because  we  have  miscalculated  or 
<br/>mishandled our trade agreements. If this was tourism, we would have gone out to fill up the planes 
<br/>and fill up the hotels, and we would not have let go of this kind of business.  Ask the question to 
<br/>FijiFirst, how is it that these vessels that were bringing so much money to Suva had been allowed to 
<br/>leave Fiji to go elsewhere, denying the people of Suva, the income or revenue or the money that we 
<br/>used to make here? Why is it?  And I will tell you why.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SODELPA will bring back these vessels to Suva when we come into power.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, we will bring back those vessels to Suva.  In the same 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way we bring back tourism, we will bring back these vessels to Suva, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is all you hear from that side, ‘hogwash.’  But the fact of the 
<br/>matter is, if you go to Suva now, you do not see those fishing vessels anymore.  They brought money 
<br/>into the country and he was sitting here.  I do not know who convinced you to increase the wharfage 
<br/>charges, to increase the cost, without realising the multiplier effect on the visits of those ships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope they understand  the  multiplier effect,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.  You do not  let go of  your 
<br/>business because  you know it would multiply many times into an economy. They appear to have 
<br/>failed to understand that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I have said, the ADB Report is very worrying.  There is a lack of urgency on 
<br/>how to recover the economy.  As I have called for yesterday for an economic summit, but all we have 
<br/>is this very passionate defence from the other side of the status quo.  They are very passionate.  “We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are doing well.  It has never been like this before.”  However, Mr. Speaker, we know that we are in 
<br/>trouble.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SODELPA does not accept the status  quo and SODELPA will grow the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economy.  The status quo will change.  You are very passionate about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Oh mining, yes.  Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Economy questioned SODELPA on why we opposed the mining of the Sigatoka River mouth.  
<br/>He comes from Sigatoka, Mr. Speaker.  That operation would destroy Sigatoka, Koroua, Vunavutu, 
<br/>Nasama, Sigatoka, Yavulo, Laselase and Nayawa.  He knows, he comes from that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in here he is saying, “You do not want mining.”  Yes, we want mining, but 
<br/>not at the cost of the habitat of our people or a community that have survived for generations and one 
<br/>of the best communities in Fiji, Sigatoka.  We begin to wonder whether he really believes in being a 
<br/>Sigatoka person, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  a  message  that  I  would  share  today  and  I  would  impress  upon  the 
<br/></span><span>Government, look after your trade relationship properly.  Look at the benefits of what should come 
<br/>to  Fiji,  and  if  something,  like,  the  Melanesian  Spearhead  Group  (MSG)  and  the  Pacific  Island 
<br/>Countries (PIC) is not working, that we are not benefiting from the relationship, then something is 
<br/>very, very much amiss, Mr. Speaker.  And as we say in SODELPA, ‘Time for Change.’ Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to rise and explain in 
<br/>brief the points that have been raised by honourable Gavoka.  He seems to think that the transfer of 
<br/>tuna is a very simple matter.  He brings in the challenge of our status within the Melanesian Spearhead 
<br/>Group and Pacific Island Countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, since 2017, one of our major push was to actually secure the tuna raw products 
<br/>to  fill  the  newly-built  freezer  container  at  PAFCO  at  Levuka.    The  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  the 
<br/>whole of Government and with the assistance of the Roving Ambassador to the Pacific, have been 
<br/>briefed  to  try  and  secure  tuna  from  Papua  New  Guinea,  Solomon  Islands,  Vanuatu,  Kiribati  and 
<br/>Tuvalu. But Mr. Speaker, this is a new dimension of politics.  It is called tuna politics.  The whole of 
<br/>the Pacific countries have their own by-products. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Tell him, Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  They  have  their  own  factories.    They  even  have 
<br/>limited resources to feed the factories that they have.  So, all our attempts have been in vain.  In every 
<br/>Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) 
<br/>meetings,  I  would  call  ministers  from  these  countries  and  beg  them.    Please,  provide  us  the  raw 
<br/>products for our factory in Fiji.  They are looking after their own financial status.  Most of these 
<br/>countries, their national product, the actual financing of the governments constitutes 70 percent from 
<br/>tuna alone.  They depend on it to finance the running of their countries.  It is 70 percent, money that 
<br/>they spend on their budget is from tuna and then we have other political matters that is involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is talking about the reduction in the number of fishing vessels coming to Fiji.  It is not 
<br/>only Fiji.  During the past years of COVID-19, we were not even allowed to accept vessels that are 
<br/>trading around the Pacific.  The vessels have found it much cheaper for them to return to their mother 
<br/>country, unload their catch, go on the slipway, change crew, then retrofitting and come back into the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pacific to fish.  There is nothing similar to what the honourable Member is saying.  He should not 
<br/>bring  unconfirmed  statements  into  Parliament  and  try  and  highlight  facts  and  issues  that  are  not 
<br/>factual.  He must refrain from doing that. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  My contribution essentially is going 
<br/>to be very brief.  I note that these are reports that we are talking about, it is from 2016, 2017 and 
<br/>2018.  So, essentially we are looking at reports which are more than four years old.  Obviously a lot 
<br/>of the issues that could have been highlighted at that point in time are not perhaps relevant but I just 
<br/>wanted to pick on because we have really looking at the review of Ministry of Industry, Trade and 
<br/>Tourism and maybe the honourable Minister Koya might want to address some of those issues when 
<br/>he speaks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  I  just  look  at  the  recommendations,  really  the  Report  does  not  touch  much  on  trade  or 
<br/>tourism and tourism is an important focus of the Ministry itself.  There are a couple of points I wanted 
<br/>to make, Mr. Speaker.  One of course is the tourism industry itself.  We all know what has happened 
<br/>to  the  industry  and  what  are  the  challenges  going  forward,  you  know  in  terms  bringing  some 
<br/>semblance of normalcy with respect to the number of tourist that will arrive in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was looking at the statistics for December and I found a big contradiction there, you know 
<br/></span><span>the  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  as  I  said  the  honourable  Minister  could  correct  this,  the  Bureau  of 
<br/>Statistics said that we received 23,000 visitors in December alone while the honourable Minister said 
<br/>it was 36,000 so I am not sure who is correct and the Bureau says that the whole of 2021 was more 
<br/>than 31,000.  So, I do not know whether we are getting the correct statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wanted to make Mr. Speaker, is with respect to the tourism industry and 
<br/>our recovery efforts.  I know this issue has been pointed out before.  We have had so many changes 
<br/>with respect to the CEOs of Tourism Fiji and I am not sure what is happening there.  Obviously there 
<br/>are issues that need to be dealt with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second point Mr. Speaker and I think the honourable Attorney-General referred to that, 
<br/>I think it was yesterday that there will be a lot of competition while Australia is opening up, its own 
<br/>domestic tourism is going to be a focus for them.  We know that Australia is our largest source market 
<br/>and we need to look at the plans that we have to understand the infrastructure damage that we have 
<br/>seen and we are continuing to see with the floods et cetera especially in the Nadi area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the fact that we hear the  Ministry talk about Tourism Fiji’s plans, the tourism 
<br/></span><span>operators and the composite efforts that is being made to ensure that our infrastructure is ready when 
<br/></span><span>we begin to possibly get more tourists later this year.  If you look at the infrastructure around Nadi 
<br/>obviously damaged by floods but there are a lot of areas where I think the Ministry, the Government 
<br/>needs to pay attention to ensure that our infrastructure is on a regular basis looked-after in the tourism 
<br/>areas.  I was talking to some of the operators last week, obviously before the recent floods in Nadi, 
<br/>many of them were concerned about the state of the infrastructure and what are the plans from the 
<br/>Government to ensure that it will be recovered and improved to facilitate the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue which the Report does not mention much, except the Melanesian Spearhead 
<br/>Group Trade Agreement (MSGTA) which it says has worked well and that the recommendation is 
<br/>that there needs to be more avenues within the Trade Agreement, improvements to see how we can 
<br/>facilitate trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the ADB Report quite rightly points out that Fiji has been moderately successful 
<br/>in  attracting  foreign  direct  investment  over  the  past  decade,  of  course  it  says  aided  by  political 
<br/>stability and a system of tax and other concessions.  It also says that however these foreign direct 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>391 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment inflows have tended to be volatile and highly concentrated in a few sectors especially 
<br/>high-end tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s net average, net foreign direct investment averaged 6.6 percent of GDP during 2010 to 
<br/>2020 with a minimum of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015 and a maximum of 8.4 percent of GDP in 2018.  
<br/>One thing, Mr. Speaker, we know  and  I think the Government  does not  seem  to  acknowledge it, 
<br/>which they should, is the role of the remittances.  In 2020 alone, we had over $652 million coming 
<br/>into the country through remittances and for 2021 I think it has already gone over $700 million or 
<br/>close to $800 million.    Imagine if we did not have those remittances, a lot of the recovery that we 
<br/>might see or we expect to see or that we have seen in 2021 and that we expect to see in 2022 will be 
<br/>fuelled by these remittances as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the point that I made yesterday with respect to a narrow base and us putting in 
<br/>some sense, all eggs in one basket, must bring us back to reality.  And we must ensure that while we 
<br/>concentrate  on  attracting  foreign  direct  investment  which  we  have  not  been  too  successful  in  a 
<br/>decade.  It is very low, it is modest.  You know if we want to rely on high-end investment particularly 
<br/>in tourism and other sectors, we need to do better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing that we need to understand is that we at any cost must avoid just becoming 
<br/></span><span>a remittance and a tourism economy because going forward, I think for the next five to ten years,  the 
<br/>tourism industry worldwide is going to be a big challenge and we are going to be also part of that 
<br/>challenge because there will be a huge competition at least in the next two or three years, so once 
<br/>again, we need to bring back,  you know it must dawn to us now that we need to focus on broadening 
<br/>our economic base and not end up becoming a tourism and remittance-driven economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I think the Ministry would need to do better in terms of putting out plans.  It is 
<br/>no point producing these annual reports which come late anyway.  I think every ministry and this 
<br/>Ministry in particular must at this point in time at least before the election, they must come out with 
<br/>a comprehensive 5-10-year plan as to what and how they are going to deal with diversification of the 
<br/>economy and promoting new industries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard a lot about tax concessions, I know yesterday the Acting Prime Minister was 
<br/>talking about it but these are mere talk.  A lot of these is talk, a lot of these is feel-good kind of 
<br/>statements that we think would be building confidence.  Yes, sometimes it is good to talk in those 
<br/>terms, make people feel good, create some confidence but at the end of the day, the bottom line will 
<br/>be what happens and that I think has been missing from all the public campaign that this Government 
<br/></span><span>has been doing with respect to what and how they are providing opportunities for new industries and 
<br/></span><span>new sectors so that we can broaden the base of our economy. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to give a brief response to the motion 
<br/>before  the  House  and  I  thank  the  Committee  for  preparing  this  Report  and  giving  some  good 
<br/>recommendations for the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the outset, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe and I still do not understand why this Government 
<br/>joined together some important Ministries considered to be the drivers of our economy, for example 
<br/>the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  This is considered to be the main drivers 
<br/>of our economy.  We have just heard from the honourable Professor Prasad repeatedly saying in this 
<br/>House that our economy is narrow-based.  We rely too much on tourism and that sentiment has been 
<br/>raised by economists and experts in financial matters. That is why I am saying that I do not understand 
<br/>if this Government relies on tourism, why has it been downgraded to a department?  Why has the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade been downgraded to a department?   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Why  a  department?  According  to  the  Annual  Report  they  are  all 
<br/>departments.    The  Department  of  Co-operatives  used  to  be  a  Ministry  but  now  it  is  under  the 
<br/>Department of Co-operative.  I cannot understand, why? If we consider tourism to be the main driver 
<br/>for our economy then we should give the tourism the respect and the importance it deserves. Give it 
<br/>a full Ministry, there are a lot of honourable Members of Parliament sitting on the other side who do 
<br/>not have any portfolio, give it to them and distribute it to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point here is, the Department of Tourism only 
<br/>has 23 staff to look at tourism which we are relying on as an economy. How can the 23 staff monitor 
<br/>and evaluate programmes on tourism development?  That is why from the 15 years they have been 
<br/>in Government, we still have not reached the one million mark of visitor arrivals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  That  is  it.    Look  at  the  small  countries  like  the  Maldives  and 
<br/></span><span>Mauritius, they have exceeded the one million mark, long time ago.  However, Fiji still cannot reach 
<br/>the one million visitor arrivals. Why? Because they are not giving the tourism ministry the respect it 
<br/>deserves.  They only have 23 staff, so how can they monitor, evaluate and design programmes to 
<br/>facilitate the development of tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my second point is the Department of Co-operative. This is one area where 
<br/>this Government should put more focus on because of the importance of co-operatives in our country.  
<br/>The  Committee  was  right  in  recommending  the  importance  of  co-operatives  in  economic 
<br/>development especially in the rural sector.  It commends the awareness information, resources and 
<br/>other services to the co-operative during the period of review and urges the MCTTT to expand this 
<br/>service to  other stakeholders, such  as landowners, trustees and provincial  councils.   Before and  I 
<br/>clearly remember that all villages in Fiji had co-operative stores.  Why? Because this is our culture 
<br/>especially the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people, we work on a </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> basis, co-operative basis and that is where 
<br/>we can grow our economy.  We own land, we own resources …

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span>HON.  I. KURIDRANI.-  … on a communal  basis.  Co-operative should be the solution in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>broadening and widening our economy base.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he does not understand what co-operative means.  
<br/>Look at what the Ministry has achieved in co-operatives.  There is a total of 42 cooperatives in Fiji.  
<br/>Imagine that, only 42 co-operative organisations in Fiji.  What have they been doing all this time?  
<br/>As I had said yesterday, they are slacking in their jobs.  They are not giving co-operatives the respect 
<br/>it deserves.  If you want to broaden and improve our economy, this is one area that you need to focus 
<br/>on; co-operatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I beg and plead to this Government, please relook at the human resource for each of these 
<br/>departments, especially tourism and co-operatives.  They have been saying that the civil servants are

<div><span>over worked.  Yes, they are over worked because of what?  Look at the big portfolio that they have 
<br/>to look after with only 23 staff.   That is why 400 nurses have resigned recently.  They are overworked 
<br/>but they are not well looked after and their welfare is not looked after.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see the honourable Minister for Health smiling, he knows it.  They are not giving the civil 
<br/>servants the treatment they deserve for working so hard.  They come here saying that they care for 
<br/>the civil servants.  No, they do not.  They did not pay for their overtime allowance.  Most of these 
<br/>civil servants, if you talk with them, they express their anger because of the ill treatment of these 
<br/>Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, time moves on, we will suspend proceedings for a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.07 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker. Thank you very much for giving me 
<br/>the  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  motion  before  the  House  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Economic Affairs on the Review of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism of 
<br/>2016-2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 18</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  along  with  the  truth  that  is  being  said  before  me  by  my  honourable 
<br/>Members,  I like to just briefly continue.  What  I am trying to establish over here is the Financial 
<br/>Management Act. This is the 2016-2017 Report and 2017-2018 Report, and this is 2022, after four 
<br/>years then it comes here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Financial Management Act on 2017 gives you three months to draft the financial report 
<br/>to the honourable Minister. Five months after that he should give an Annual Report to Parliament by 
<br/>the honourable Minister  responsible. This  was  even before  I  came into Parliament. These reports 
<br/>were supposed to be tabled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister amended the Financial Act and knowing fully well that his 
<br/></span><span>Government, his Permanent Secretaries, his line Ministers and Cabinet Ministers will confirm to the 
<br/></span><span>Financial Management (Amendment) Act of 2010, meaning that within two weeks after the end of 
<br/>each month or any other time specified in the financial manual, the Permanent Sectaries must provide 
<br/>a management report to their respective Ministers.  Within two weeks after the end of each quarter, 
<br/>the Permanent Secretaries must submit to his or her Minister a report on the financial operations of 
<br/>agency as compared to the budget and the progress on the implementations on the output specified 
<br/>by the annual report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  here  after  four  years  to  argue  about  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Trade  and  Tourism 
<br/>Review  Report  2016-2017  and  2017-2018.  So,  where  is  the  transparency,  credibility  and 
<br/>accountability that this Government trumpets every time?  This is unprecedented of any government 
<br/>for an Annual Report to arrive into this Parliament for debate after almost five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that the Acting honourable Prime Minister and the Cabinet Ministers will take heed of 
<br/>the Financial Management Act that was gazetted and signed by the honourable Prime Minister, which 
<br/>you were supposed to conform.  Unfortunately, we have 14 Reports that have come late into this 
<br/>Parliament.  The Report has come late, that is why I say that it is almost irrelevant to argue about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the report of the Cooperatives, I support honourable Kuridrani’s claim on the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Industry, Trade and Tourism’s formulation and implementation of policies and strategies that would 
<br/>facilitate growth in industry, investment, trade, co-operatives businesses, micro and small enterprises, 
<br/>standards and consumer protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  industry  plays  a  pivotal  role  towards  Fiji’s  economic  growth  and  have  designated 
<br/>Departments looking to specific activities. These Departments are the Economic Unit, Trade Unit, 
<br/>Tourism Unit, Department of National Trade and Measurement Standards Unit, Department of Co-
<br/>operative Services Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even though they have Trade Commissions in in Taiwan, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Papua New 
<br/>Guinea  and  even  though  it  has  seven  statutory  authorities  -  the  Consumer  Council  of  Fiji,  Fiji 
<br/>Commerce Commission, Investment Fiji, Film Fiji, Tourism Fiji, Real Estate Licencing Board and 
<br/>National Centre for Small and Micro Enterprises, that does not give you the right to delay the Annual 
<br/>Reports.

<div><span>Tell your Permanent Secretaries and the Ministers to deliver these Annual Reports in time 
<br/>and I hope most of the Annual Reports are still delayed.  It has to come here before we move out of 
<br/>this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  has  too,  because  that  is  accountability,  its 
<br/>credibility, and that is what you people trumpet every time and the honourable Prime Minister said 
<br/>that in the Financial Management (Amendment) Act in 2010.   He wrote it in the Gazette that you 
<br/>are supposed to….   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- (Inaudible) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Stop laughing, honourable Acting Prime Minister.  On his absence, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you should trial these people… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- … the Permanent Secretaries and the Deputy Secretaries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all my contribution and I would like to thank the Committee on their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity.  
<br/>I, first of all, would like to congratulate the Committee for the work that it has done on reviewing the 
<br/>activities that have been undertaken by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, in all the kinds 
<br/>of work that it is doing.  And in so doing, I would just like to comment on some of the issues that 
<br/>have been brought up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that seems to have been discussed from yesterday and today is the need for 
<br/>economic diversification.  As we all know, the Acting Prime Minister has talked about Fiji’s history 
<br/>in  terms  of  its  economy  where  we  were  initially  dependent  upon  sugar.    Over  time,  we  have 
<br/>developed tourism and now, we all know that our economy is becoming more of a service-based 
<br/>economy and you can also see that there are a lot more services that are involved.  So, in fact, there 
<br/>has been that diversification over time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diversification has been taking place.  We have gradually begun to move out of just dealing 
<br/></span><span>with private commodities, now we are doing a bit more of value addition, so that we get more out of 
<br/>the commodities that we are able to have in this particular country.  And if you look at this particular 
<br/>Annual Report, you can see there is a strong emphasis now in this Ministry on the developing of the 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. There are a lot of programmes that are there and there is also 
<br/>the Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme that is getting the  youth involved. Not just the adults like us 
<br/>being involved in entrepreneurship but also the youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I think this is also a great diversification because that is where the future of the economy will 
<br/>lie when our micro enterprises will become small enterprises, then they become medium enterprises 
<br/>and then they can grow and they will be able to value-add to our economy as a whole. So, that is 
<br/>something I have been very glad to see.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of that, there has also been discussion about mining. I think yesterday and today, the 
<br/>honourable Gavoka was also talking about mining and referred to the mining of the Sigatoka River 
<br/>mouth.  I would just like to clarify in this House that there is no mining currently being undertaken 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>396 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at the Sigatoka River mouth, nor has there been a licence given for the mining of Sigatoka River 
<br/>mouth. The only thing that has been given is the right to explore.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The impact on the environment of exploration and mining is very different.  But at the same 
<br/>time, before anyone gets the right to explore or to mine, they have to meet the stringent requirements 
<br/>of the Ministry of Environment. They have to meet those requirements. No one is allowed willy-nilly 
<br/>to come in and do whatever they want to do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very  successfully,  if  you  go  now  to  the  mouth  of  the  Ba  River  where  there  is  this  great 
<br/>resource of Iron sands, there is a company there called Amex, which has invested more than $140 
<br/>million into that enterprise.  They are mining the iron sands and at the same time, they are giving 
<br/>employment to people. They still have to recover the amount of money they have invested into that 
<br/>area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everything that they do, has to be done with the approval of the Ministry of Environment. 
<br/>While we all talk about the importance of mining, it is important also to make sure that we are talking 
<br/>about diversification and we talk about mining, that we support mining within the parameters of the 
<br/>protections provided by the Ministry of Environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes here in this House, we see people go anti-mining and then pro-mining. But I think 
<br/>for all of us, we are talking about sustainable mining.  Mining is very important. Amex has been very 
<br/>successful and I think it is important for us.  This is one particular sector, and when the economy 
<br/>goes down, they keep going on, they keep on their investments. An example in point is the Tuvalu 
<br/>Gold Mine.  It has not had any productions yet, but they have put a lot of money into that mining.   
<br/>People have been employed through COVID-19 and they are still employed. It is a very resilient type 
<br/>of sector because a lot of the investment is done upfront and at the same time, the returns come much 
<br/>later.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to add here two points for mining.  The first point is, we need to able to agree in 
<br/>this  House  to  give  out  the  message  that  we  support  this,  as  long  as  it  is  sustainable  within  the 
<br/>parameters that have been set by the Ministry of Environment. The messages that we sometimes get 
<br/>from the Opposition seemed to be mixed. Sometimes, you seem to be on for it and sometimes it is 
<br/>just for your own political mileage or whatever, you are against it.  As a country, if you talking about 
<br/>diversification, we need to support it and at the same time, make sure that we take into account the 
<br/>interests  of  landowners  and  also  the  interests  of  the  environment  because  the  interests  of  the 
<br/>environment is the interests of the future generations of our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point is, the Ministry that we have, the Ministry of Infrastructure, at one point in 
<br/>time, this Ministry used to build all the Government roads.  At one time, this Ministry used to look 
<br/>after the water supply in all our towns and services. But over time, what Government has done, it has 
<br/>taken the direct operational entities and placed them into bodies on their own. That is why we have 
<br/>created the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), and when you do that 
<br/>Government then reserves the role of policy and regulation for itself and setting directions. The direct 
<br/>operations are put into these entities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  the  same  sort  of  thing  we  have  in  tourism.  At  one  time,  the  Ministry  would  do 
<br/>everything, but what the Ministry is doing there in tourism, it is keeping a small team and if you look 
<br/>at this Annual Report, you will see all the different agencies that they have set up to do the actual  
<br/>operational work.  This is how smart Governments work across the world.  So, if you are standing 
<br/>and asking, “Why is it that you have 20 people in Tourism?’  It is because this is the new approach.  
<br/>This is how we do it.  The result is seen in the yield that you see.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will see, post-COVID now, our numbers have gone up, and it is important to realise that.  
<br/>This is how we do a smart Government.  We do not do all the operational activities.  We maintain 
<br/>the policy, the regulatory bits, the budgeting, we control the money that is given to these entities, 
<br/>then we set up Boards and Ministers give policy directives to Boards.  They require them to achieve 
<br/>the results for the money that is given to them.  That is how Government is done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No Minister here goes and does all the work of the workers in an organisation.  We do not do 
<br/>that.  I do not go and tell the people in FRA, “Go and fix this particular road.”  I expect them to have 
<br/>a framework in which they operate, that I have agreed to.  You do not go and check all the drains and 
<br/>do all those kind of things, no!  We set up entities and through strong governance principles, we make 
<br/>sure that they work and we hold them accountable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you were asking about why is it that the number of people in Tourism in that Ministry is 
<br/>small, because we are working smart.  We are not trying to do everything.  You look at the regulation, 
<br/>the governance and you make sure these entities do what they are supposed to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A smart government is the way forward, the way in which Government used to do everything 
<br/>is the days of the past.  Looking forward, Government becomes smaller.  The operational arms are 
<br/></span><span>outsourced  and  they  do  their  work  under  the  guidance  of  the  Government  and  also  through  the 
<br/></span><span>monitoring of Government.  So, that is the way forward.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  JALE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  the  time  to  respond  to  the 
<br/>Report before us  for discussion.   I must thank the Chairman  and the Committee Members of the 
<br/>Standing Committee for their Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you said that you are only allowing two more speakers, I was thinking that I will not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the opportunity to talk on this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You know, I always look after your interests. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- I do understand that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I will only talk about co-operative 
<br/>only.  I know the Report has covered a lot of phases about the Ministry, but I thought that I will also 
<br/>speak about co-operative.  When you see me, you see co-operative in me because the co-operatives 
<br/>paid for my education.  So, that is why I have said that co-operative is so important for rural people, 
<br/>in particular the people in Lau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you do go to Lau, you will see the development of villages.  These have been through the 
<br/></span><span>proceeds they get from co-operatives.  It is quite alarming to see the number of co-operatives that 
<br/>have gone down to 42 only, as in the Report.  I think the honourable Minister should do something 
<br/>about it to revive those co-operatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The emphasis that this Government is putting into co-operative is not the same as what was 
<br/>in the past.  In the 1960s and the 1970s and now recently, there have been a lot put into that because 
<br/>there  were  some  good  reasons  for  doing  it,  and  I  am  going  to  be  touching  on  some  of  that  this 
<br/>morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, it was a way to consolidate the people in rural areas and unite them.  The word ‘co-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operative’ is very clear, it is to bring people together, and that is exactly what the co-operatives did.  
<br/>It  did  a  lot  of  work  in  harmonising  the  people,  and  get  them  together  to  focus  on  developing 
<br/>themselves.  That means some of the roles that the Government was supposed to do at that time, was 
<br/>taken away from the Government because they were helping themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The better utilisation of resources are resources in rural areas, not many, but what they were 
<br/>doing was to consolidate their good use.  The co-operative had that role to play for them, like copra.  
<br/>They buy copra from the planters and then ship them to Suva, sell them and they get money from 
<br/>that to plough back into the development of people.  But there have been some alarming trends that 
<br/>have been seen recently and I will quote one in respect of the province of Lau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“People that came in to buy sandalwood from the islands.  They came in and were 
<br/>offering very low prices for sandalwood and in some of the islands they were buying at 
<br/>$10 to $20 a kilogram.  But when they came down to Ono, we got our co-operatives to be 
<br/>involved and our co-operatives negotiated with TLTB that they be given the sole licence 
<br/>to sell sandalwood from Ono.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That was the reason why the price of sandalwood went from $20 to $50 a kilogram and now 
<br/>it is over $100 a kilogram.  And I must emphasise the importance of unity in respect of this because 
<br/>there are some business people that are coming in with their own agendas to get profit out of the 
<br/>resources of the people.  We should think about those people, they do not have much resources, how 
<br/>can we help them to utilise and sell their resources to benefit them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the good things about co-operative, it was teaching the people in the rural areas about 
<br/></span><span>financial management.  They were taught on how to look after their money, how to run businesses.  
<br/>I think it was very important because most people do not understand that. But co-operatives were 
<br/>helping in a lot of way in doing that and most of our people in the rural areas particularly in the 
<br/>islands, they are elderly now but they can manage finances and be able to keep records about how 
<br/>their businesses are running.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There used to be a very highly expected time in rural areas when co-operative people come 
<br/>in to close their books.  It happens once in the year when they come to audit the books, to decide how 
<br/>much profit they have gained during the year and how much dividend or bonus needs to be given 
<br/>back to the people.  I am expecting a time when this will occur again, that the people work hard in 
<br/>order to improve their livelihood and also be able to develop their villages and settlements through 
<br/>their hard labour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are things about the weakening of co-operatives and results.  I think the problem facing 
<br/>the coconut industry now, it is a direct result to the weakening of co-operatives in rural areas.  There 
<br/>are co-operatives plantations that are going into ruins.  There are old trees, no new coconut trees have 
<br/>been planted … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- That is not right. It is not correct. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- That is my assessment.  You can talk about it if you want to assess it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- But the copra industry … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.-… proceeds are declining and something need to be done about it.  I feel that 
<br/>lower number of co-operatives and the weakening of the co-operatives movement in Fiji has a direct

<div><span>399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>link  to  the  decline  in  the  coconut  industry  or  copra  industry  in  Fiji.    Worst  still  I  must  say,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the Government is working against co-operatives in rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Post Fiji is directly running in conflict with co-operatives in the rural areas.  
<br/>They bring in their own products like sugar, flour and all those selling from Post Shop outlets.  These 
<br/>are things that co-operatives should be doing, so that the people can get the money and I am asking 
<br/>the honourable Acting Prime Minister, please, look into it.  You should not be doing that if you are 
<br/>promoting co-operatives on one-hand and then doing something to kill them, that is not right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is exactly what is happening now in rural areas where Post Fiji is directly in conflict 
<br/>with co-operatives selling the same products that they depend on to be able to survive and I am asking 
<br/>them, not only that, their agents and officers are being used by businesses in urban areas to be their 
<br/>agents  in  the  islands  and  rural  areas.    Something  needs  to  be  done  about  it.    I  must  say  that  co-
<br/>operative means unity for </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and rural people. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Before I delve into the actual report, might 
<br/></span><span>I just quickly deal with some of the issues that have been raised.  The most recent one was a topic of 
<br/></span><span>conversation regarding co-operatives.  Once again, I think it just requires reading, it is actually written 
<br/>in quite a simple English.  They are saying that there is only, one said there are only 24 co-operatives, 
<br/>one said there are only 42 co-operatives, that is very misleading, Sir, very misleading considering the 
<br/>Report says a total of 42 co-operatives were registered in 2017 - 2018 financial year of which 26 
<br/>were cane farming co-operatives.  Now, what that literally says, Sir, in that year we registered 42 
<br/>new co-operatives.  Misinformation on a huge part coming out of that particular direction and the 
<br/>correct statistic is that we have over 400 co-operatives – 42, ten times as much… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Thank  you.    A  very  apt  description  by  the  honourable  Acting  Prime 
<br/>Minister.  A Quick Draw and Quick Draw McGraw, both of them, Sir. So, 42 as opposed to 400 is 
<br/>the actual number for co-operatives.  The fact that honourable Jale says that we should be doing a 
<br/>whole lot more for co-operatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we pay very close attention to co-operatives.  As 
<br/>a matter of fact, I will give you a live example of how close attention we do pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We just had a volcanic eruption in Tonga, we have co-operatives in Lau, when the first ship 
<br/></span><span>that went across, I made sure and the honourable Minister accompanied them, that a team from my 
<br/></span><span>co-operatives  department  went  across  to  check  on  the  co-operatives  in  Lau.    That  is  the  kind  of 
<br/>attention that we give to our co-operatives.  You may think that you have a licence to only talk about 
<br/>them, I do too.  I care about them and this is why we did what we did as a Government especially 
<br/>because it is Lau. I know he is laughing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  Sir,  I  shudder  when  I  listen  to  some  of  the  misinformation  that  comes  up  from  the 
<br/>Opposition and gets passed on into the public space.  That is wrong, Sir.  That is wholly incorrect, so 
<br/>please correct your figures and in future it does not take much to simply ask us what is the number 
<br/>in terms of co-operatives.  You would not come here and I would not have to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as honourable Biman Prasad is concerned, honourable Member, there 
<br/>is a question on tourism this afternoon which will answer all the questions that you actually raised 
<br/>earlier and with respect to the issues that were raised by honourable Gavoka, I think it is fairly well 
<br/>answered  now  in  some  parts.    He  was  talking  about  Fiji  needing  to  do  more  et  cetera  about 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diversification and  he specifically  chose to  talk  about  tuna and with  very little knowledge on the 
<br/>industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Honourable Minister for Fisheries pointed out to him that it is not about Fiji going to one 
<br/>of  our  neighbouring  MSG  countries  and  just  asking  them  for  their  tuna.    They  have  their  own 
<br/>industries which they want to grow and they are in the same space as we are in terms of their fishing 
<br/>industry.  We cannot just go and acquire their tuna from their waters to use because they have their 
<br/>own industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of our relationship with the MSG countries and I think he 
<br/>again is misleading.  We have a perfectly good relationship with our Pacific Island neighbours.  As 
<br/>a matter of fact they look at us, we have put ourselves in a position and they look at us very highly.  
<br/>They look at us as to what Fiji has done around the world. When we speak and I know that all of us 
<br/>when we are in international forums, when we speak we do so also not just about Fiji, we are very 
<br/>protective of our neighbours and our country, MSG countries, et cetera, all of them.  In every single 
<br/>forum and Fiji is looked upon very highly in terms of being able to protect our Pacific neighbours 
<br/>and our own interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  terms  of  tourism,  I  think  the  honourable  Kuridrani  on  the  other  side  was 
<br/></span><span>talking about tourism and he said we have only got 23 staff.  According to his numbers we have got 
<br/>23 staff in tourism.  Again, we are not paying much attention. He forgets, Sir.  Most of the activity 
<br/>with respect to Fiji and its tourism is looked after by Tourism Fiji.  There are three arms to tourism, 
<br/>Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji and the private sector.  He needs to realise that. We cannot have a tourism 
<br/>ministry on its own.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are being smart about how we run Government so Tourism Fiji takes care of the marketing 
<br/>arm in terms of all of tourism activities, so he needs to realise it, Sir.  You cannot blindly just turn 
<br/>and say it is only 23 people working there.  That is just being smart and being efficient. Sir, you come 
<br/>from a tourism industry area and you should know that.  You probably have people who are part of 
<br/>your own village that actually work for Tourism Fiji, so when you read these things it does not take 
<br/>much to simply pick up the phone and ask me.  I would tell you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, with respect to the Report, I thank the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs 
<br/>on its assessment of the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism and the recommendations that have 
<br/>been put forward.  Just quickly also, Sir, honourable Rasova was  talking about the  delay in reports 
<br/>et cetera, I think what has actually happened is he has gone through the Report, he cannot find any 
<br/></span><span>faults and he has found something that he can actually just hang his hat on just for the day.  That is 
<br/></span><span>wrong, you should not do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  majority  of  Ministry’s  budget  in  that  particular  year  increased  from 
<br/>about  $77  million  to  $105.4  million  and  about  50  to  60  percent  of  that  was  allocated  to  capital 
<br/>projects.  Majority of the capital projects were targeted to support and to grow businesses especially 
<br/>by encouraging MSMEs, as pointed out by my colleague, honourable Usamate. We have successfully 
<br/>supported young Fijians to pursue their dreams in doing businesses and under the leadership of our 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  we  have  created  an  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurs  and 
<br/>businesses to thrive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, over the last decade, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have invested about $100 million into 47,900 
<br/>businesses and have close to, as I said 400-odd co-operative businesses which are operational, so that 
<br/>is not some small feat, Sir.  I always say this, Sir, with respect to FijiFirst, we are focused on creating 
<br/>opportunities for all Fijians so we spend money for our future.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  you  really  need  to  understand  why  we  invest  in  MSMEs  and  why  we  invest  in  our 
<br/>youth, they are actually the engine for growth for this country and you have been seeing this being 
<br/>successful right up until the pandemic and through this investment our businesses, we have actually 
<br/>pretty much created a middle income society and an entrepreneurial society.  We have closed the 
<br/>income gap between all the different groups and Fiji now has a group of people who actually spend 
<br/>a whole lot of more money than they would have been able to do so before.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the highlights and the key achievements with the Ministry during the period that we 
<br/>are talking about and that is under review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a recommendation to include 
<br/>a detailed breakdown on YES, that is actually noted but since the inception, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>have received a total of about 685 applications and out of which we have had in the agriculture sector 
<br/>- 176 applications or 26 percent, wholesale retail sector by 111 and the service sector 104.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also happy to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that YES has a success rate of about 90 per 
<br/>cent.    The  Ministry  has  a  young  and  a  dedicated  monitoring  and  evaluation  team  responsible  for 
<br/>monitoring all our MSMEs-related projects. Since the pandemic and natural disasters, the team’s role 
<br/>has  actually  expanded  into  doing  surveys  and  to  stay  engaged  with  the  MSMEs  with  regard  to 
<br/>adherence of protocols, et cetera.  We have also partnered up with other ministries such as the Poverty 
<br/></span><span>Monitoring Unit to undertake monitoring and evaluation and there is a joint exercise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  results  of  this  exercise  actually  speak  themselves.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  75  per  cent  of 
<br/>businesses supported through our Livelihood Assistance Programmes are successfully operating and 
<br/>clearly  illustrating  the  kind  of  resilience  that  we  have  trained  them  into  and  despite  the  difficult 
<br/>economic conditions over the past two years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is basically down to the fact that FijiFirst Government’s investment policies had been put 
<br/>into the right place in order to increase employment and diversification is at the front of our minds at 
<br/>the moment to expand operations and graduate these small businesses to accessing a bigger package, 
<br/>et cetera through financial institutions.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, again honourable Kuridrani turns around 
<br/>and says, “Why have we not a million tourists?”  Let me put some numbers into perspective with 
<br/>respect to what they talk about in tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  we  do  a  comparison  with  the  Maldives,  why  have  we  not  a  million 
<br/>tourists?  The statistics are, in 2019 Maldives received 1.7 million visitors and earned approximately 
<br/>$6 billion. Fiji  on the other hand received 894,389 and we earned  about  $3.1 billion.  Per visitor 
<br/>spend in Fiji was $3,379 whilst the Maldives earned $3,529.  Are you really saying that we are so far 
<br/></span><span>worse off?  Are we worse off than the Maldives?  Per visitor income is approximately same but the 
<br/></span><span>visitor numbers are halved, so that is not a small fee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our tourism industry plan is actually very focused on  quality tourism.  It  is not just about 
<br/>quantity so we definitely are doing something right despite the fact that him saying that we have got 
<br/>only  23  staff.    One  cannot  just  pluck  things  out  of  the  air  and  say,  “why  have  we  not  a  million 
<br/>tourists?”  Sir, $3 billion-odd was earned from the tourism industry Sir.  In a nutshell, Sir, the reports 
<br/>are unqualified, there is nothing in there that would deter and I am very happy to say that none of the 
<br/>earlier reports that have actually come out from the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism have 
<br/>ever been negative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trade and investment also play a critical role in the development of the economy and we have 
<br/>seen a growth in our Trade and Investment Economic Recovery post pandemic also apart from the 
<br/>tourism sector will depend on trade.  The region has actually further isolated from global trading 
<br/>partners.  Our resolve also is to focus on the region.  Discussions we have had recently, Sir, also 
<br/>centred on that and also to diversify into new goods.  You would have heard yesterday the honourable 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General spoke about some other parts of the economy that we are diversifying into; the 
<br/>Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector, the light manufacturing, et cetera.  It is not as if like the 
<br/>picture as painted by the Opposition that we are actually sitting back and doing nothing.  Also with 
<br/>regard to agreements such as the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement and the MSG, that will 
<br/>be instrumental in strengthening our regional integration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our exports to the Pacific accounts for about 25 per cent of Fiji’s total exports and the MSG 
<br/>region  accounts for approximately 27 per cent of exports to the Pacific.  So, you can see, Sir, that it 
<br/>is  critical  for  Fiji  to  continue to  pursue this particular market  and  also  enable an increase market 
<br/>access  for  goods  and services.   Also the Fijian skills  are being engaged  by the MSG  and Pacific 
<br/>countries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has actually continued to explore these opportunities and new markets.  Another 
<br/>new market that has opened up for us, Sir, they are pilot for commercial exports of </span><span>kava</span><span> to Australia.  
<br/>It  is  something  that  we  have  been  working  on  for  many  years  has  commenced.    I  think  it  was 
<br/>December 2020, Australia has already received what six tonnes of </span><span>kava</span><span> export of which 80 per cent 
<br/>was from Fiji.  So that is another market for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have </span><span>kava</span><span> capsules actually going into Coles and Chemist Warehouse in Australia and 
<br/></span><span>this is a major breakthrough for </span><span>kava</span><span> exports and diversification of the market.  As a matter of fact, 
<br/>in  conjunction  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  we  have  already  had  a  workshop  with  our  </span><span>kava</span><span>
<br/>producers just about a week ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  2017,  there  has  been  a  major  increase  in  our  ginger  exports  and  2020  alone,  Fiji 
<br/>exported about a million dollars’ worth of fresh and preserved ginger to Australia, New Zealand and 
<br/>United States while the  processed one was about 2.8 weeks is being exported to Australia, Canada, 
<br/>Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand and USA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also, Mr. Speaker, with the help of the Singaporean Government worked on the 
<br/>re-designing of some application permits, et cetera we needed to get done.  This is the beginning of 
<br/>some reform projects that have been undertaken with the Ministry.  We also had considerable amount 
<br/>of  work  that  we  undertook  with  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  and  the  World  Bank  to 
<br/>review our investment framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019 the Investment Policy Statement was also endorsed and these actually sets out the 
<br/>overall  vision  of  the  Fijian  Government.    In  2021,  the  Investment  Act  was  actually  passed  by 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.  An Act is the region’s most progressive and it completes the reforms.  The Investment 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Act is currently under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Sir, I want to emphasise that the Ministry has broad responsibilities, I think 
<br/>everyone recognises that, but we have successfully undertaken all its tasks for the betterment of Fiji.  
<br/>This would not be possible without a very strong, courageous, young team.  I wish to express my 
<br/>appreciation  to  the  Permanent  Secretary  and  the  team  who  have  ensured  that  the  funds  are  all 
<br/>managed with full accountability and transparency.  These civil servants, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have not 
<br/>only  been  responsible  for  prudent  utilisation  of  funds  but  they  have  ensured  the  efficacy  of  the 
<br/>programmes and each dollar spent, creates values and opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to contribute very briefly 
<br/>and  of  course  add  clarity  as  well  to  the  issue  about  co-operatives.    Let  me  assure  all  Fijians  and 
<br/>particularly those in rural Fiji that Government is pro co-operative and Government has revived the 
<br/>co-operative since 2014.  As Minister responsible for rural development, we liaise very closely and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>403 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in constant consultation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade about co-operative movements in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>About  the  reduction  in  co-operative,  there  are  a  few  reasons  but  the  history  in  this,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, there was a paper years back, and I know that when I was Commissioner Northern way 
<br/>back in 2007-2008, the team came to Vanua Levu and all the Divisions for the closing of most of the 
<br/>offices in Fiji and the reduction.  This was a paper written by Mr. Are Wakowako.  I know that Mrs. 
<br/>Mataikabara was then the Permanent Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the reasons  in  the paper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is top  heavy but  there was not  much 
<br/>happening in the co-operative back in those days for some obvious reasons which I will go to.  One 
<br/>of  the  major  problems  that  we  are  facing  and  we  have  to  be  honest  with  ourselves  here  is 
<br/>mismanagement.  That is why a lot of co-operative movements in Fiji were closed.  The same thing 
<br/>happening too now in postal agencies.  We want the services and Government supports it, but the 
<br/>problem is mismanagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will probably give one or two examples.  When I was Commissioner Northern, I wanted 
<br/>to know which co-operatives were running well in Vanua Levu and I was told about the Wainikoro 
<br/></span><span>Co-Operative.  The </span><span>Turaga na Tui Namuka </span><span>would know this very well, so I went to Wainikoro, had 
<br/></span><span>my first briefing.  In the briefing, I knew that something was seriously wrong.  I came back and told 
<br/>the Divisional Planning Officer that I wanted the Senior Co-operative Officer, Northern Division, 
<br/>my Chief Accountant and one from another Ministry to do an investigation about that co-operative.  
<br/>I knew from the briefing that something was seriously wrong. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we handed over the 
<br/>investigation to the Police, two of the management ended up in prison because of mismanagement.  
<br/>One is from Druarua Island, and the Co-operative Officer himself is from Yaroi.  That is the problem 
<br/>that we have in most co-operatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  two  weeks  ago,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  team  went  to  Lau  as  alluded  to  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, the Co-operative Officer, Mr. Iosefo had to cancel one of the appointments that 
<br/>I  arranged.    This  is  another  co-operative  in  Tailevu  -  the  Dairy  Co-operative.    There  is 
<br/>mismanagement as well in that co-operative and we are trying to revive it. This is a common issue in 
<br/>most of the co-operatives in Fiji but let me assure everyone in this august House that Government is 
<br/>pro co-operative and is reviving co-operative.  As seen in the report, the number of new co-operatives 
<br/>that are recently established.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  a  month  ago  has  launched  our  strategic  development 
<br/></span><span>plan.  We are working with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs and, of course, one of the key elements 
<br/></span><span>of that strategic plan is the economic empowerment of rural Fijians, particularly, </span><span>iTaukei.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also look at fisheries and the co-operative in agriculture. In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>when the cluster system in agriculture was established, the intention behind that is they started as 
<br/>farming clusters, once they are market oriented and they have regular production, they have a buyer 
<br/>and through contract farming, they will then establish their own co-operatives.  So, this was one of 
<br/>the  plans  but  cut  it  short,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again  we  are  working  according  to  our  Strategic 
<br/>Development  Plan  and  working  very  closely  with  the  Ministry  because  we  want  all  these  co-
<br/>operatives to be revived and of course  to be strengthen as well.  We are working now with the key 
<br/>agencies particularly SMSEs, UN Women and UNDP for the capacity development of our people, 
<br/>particularly in entrepreneurial skills, some basic bookkeeping skills so that these co-operatives can 
<br/>survive and sustain in the long term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick, short intervention. The honourable 
<br/>Members from the other side said that a large number of co-operatives before and the number has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>
<div><span>404 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come down. It is not necessary a bad sign when the number of co-operatives have gone down.  The 
<br/>reason is this, why are co-operatives established? Co-operatives have been established because when 
<br/>individual farmers, I will talk from a farming point of view, do not have enough of their own resource 
<br/>to make the required investment that they want, so, co-operatives allow pulling of those resources. I 
<br/>am  telling  you  from  a  practical  purpose  because  we  are  with  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade 
<br/>forming co-operatives in agriculture and then they pull the resources to buy tractors.  In fact, there is 
<br/>a large number of co-operatives being formed in agriculture over the last three years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  going  back  to  my  earlier  point,  so  they  pull  the  resources  to  make  that 
<br/>investment whether they would want to buy a tractor, they want to buy a new land for the group. 
<br/>Over time when they do well, when they now have got enough of their money, then they break up to 
<br/>make commercial ventures, commercial investment for individuals. You will not see a co-operative 
<br/>for a long period of time because they grow. If you see a co-operative for a long period of time that 
<br/>means there is no growth at the individual level.  So, it is not a good sign, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I suggest 
<br/>that the honourable Members on the other side really understand full about why co-operatives are 
<br/>formed, how they operate over time and some of the indicators and measures to see whether they are 
<br/>doing well.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just very briefly on a couple issues that we 
<br/></span><span>would like to address.  Obviously, I think a lot of the honourable Members of the Opposition talked 
<br/>about cooperatives.  You got the figures wrong, you are saying 42, in fact, there are 400.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing has highlighted 
<br/>a very critical point, that many cooperatives actually have a lot of management issues.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Cooperatives does work with them to try and resolve those issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The society is changing.  Honourable Jale talked about what happened in the 1960s and 1970s.  
<br/>In the same way, we can talk about the sugarcane industry.  It was very different in the 1920s, 1930s, 
<br/>1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  Those children do not actually work in the sugarcane plantations.  We used 
<br/>to have no problems in getting access to cane cutters.  We now actually have to use people from the 
<br/>Corrections Service to actually do cane cutting.  We now have mechanical harvesters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Society is changing, honourable Jale, and you need to keep up with the time.  The younger 
<br/>population, a bulk of them below the age of 40  years (70 per cent) have a very different outlook 
<br/>towards life.  People want to do their own investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think, to say that Post Fiji is, therefore, undercutting cooperatives, again, it is nonsensical 
<br/></span><span>because many people want a regular supply of goods and services, and Post Fiji actually offers that.  
<br/>Does he know also that a lot of Lauans who live in Suva order through Post Fiji to send goods and 
<br/>services to their families in the outer islands?  That is what they are using the Post Fiji for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was also some talk about remittances not being acknowledged.  We 
<br/>have repeatedly said  that.   In fact,  the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji,  in  their reports, the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy in the Budget, we have always acknowledged remittances.  Of course, it is a 
<br/>great contributor, but that does not mean we were simply dependant on remittances.  Of course, it is 
<br/>a great source of foreign exchange, no doubt about that, but we are not simply dependant on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have highlighted and, again, the Opposition seems to have some kind of amnesia about 
<br/>this or probably do not even know about it, that in the last two years, during COVID-19, 3,000 new 
<br/>jobs has been created in the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector - outsourcing, call centres 
<br/>and business processing.

<br/>years and 33 years.  It is a $140 million industry in Fiji.  As highlighted, we have enormous potential 
<br/>to grow more jobs up to 100,000 in the next 10 years and this has only been possible because of the 
<br/>huge investments and, indeed, the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector in Fiji.  That is why 
<br/>Fiji has become attractive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We,  of  course,  have  a  number  of  natural  advantages,  we  are  exactly  12  hours  ahead  of 
<br/>Greenwich Mean Time, so the time fits us. We all speak the English Language, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the cost of telecommunications is a lot more attractive now in Fiji because of the liberalised approach.  
<br/>The FCCC has done a lot of good work in that space, and as we are told, we all have neutral accent, 
<br/>so a British, American, Australian or Kiwi can actually understand our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the new areas of growth, and I am highlighting this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not to take 
<br/>up Parliament’s time, but there is so much lack of knowledge or misinformation being spread  by 
<br/>honourable Members of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We now have ASPEN Medical, an Australian operator in the medical services.  They went 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through a proper tender process. Of course, because of COVID-19, certain things have been delayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ba Hospital will be up and running in the next month.  We have now gone to Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital where, as soon as they take over management, they will be providing open heart surgery 
<br/>facilities 24/7.  Chemotherapy will be available.  They will also be building a new wing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, a lot of people have not thought about it.  We have said this in Parliament.  Why did 
<br/>we choose Lautoka, why not Suva?  One of the critical issues is because we thought about the long 
<br/>term.  Lautoka is very close to Nadi International Airport.  It is easier for doctors to come and easier 
<br/>for medical tourism purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people are extremely good at looking after children and elderly people.  Most of  you 
<br/>probably know relatives or friends, people who actually work in the West Coast of North America in 
<br/>California, who are caregivers to elderly people.  A lot of them are there illegally, some of them are 
<br/>there legally, but they are very good at it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there is enormous potential with ageing population in Japan and Australia for us to set up 
<br/>retirement villages in Fiji.  We need them to be set up here, we need our people trained.  We are 
<br/>currently  talking  to  FNU  to  develop  courses  where  there  are  recognised  certification,  so  that  our 
<br/></span><span>people get trained here and we have retirement villages in Fiji.  No one will set up a retirement village 
<br/></span><span>unless you have an internationally certified full care tertiary medical facilities available. That is why 
<br/>it is in Lautoka. Pacific Islanders can also come there, it is very easy for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These what we call the building blocks of the diversification of our economy. These things 
<br/>do not happen overnight. The way they speak as if it should happen overnight.  But, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, these are some of the things that, in fact, has been done and we will continue to do so. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  want  to  reiterate  what  the  Honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure, 
<br/>Meteorological  Services  and  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  mentioned  and  what  the  Honourable 
<br/>Minister for Fisheries mentioned in the fisheries sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, it is like saying to Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, if they came to us and 
<br/>say, “Give us your sugarcane, we are going to set up a sugar factory in Solomon Islands or Papua 
<br/>New Guinea.”  We do not want to give them our sugarcane, we want the value adding to be done 
<br/>here.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report-MITT 2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is really quite prosperous to say that we have not done well just because we are not getting 
<br/>Solomon Islanders or the Papua New Guineans to sell us their tuna. They are not going to do that. 
<br/>They have their own canneries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, similarly about mining, our main priority is the environment.  As we have 
<br/>seen in many countries, you can actually provide that balancing act between managing environment 
<br/>and also being able to have some extractive sector, but it is a very fine line at times and we have to 
<br/>manage that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point that I would like to make is, there has not been any large scale 
<br/>investment, et cetera.  The world is changing.  A few years ago in the1990s when Fiji had free market 
<br/>access to the American market, we had about 22,000 garment factory workers in Fiji, predominantly 
<br/>women.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  we  were  declared  to  be  a  middle  income  country,  we  stop  getting  that  free  market 
<br/>access  to  the  US  market.  So,  the  Bangladeshis  of  the  world  and  Chinas  of  the  world,  produced 
<br/>massive shirts - 10,000 pieces or 100,000 pieces of one shirt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had to remodel our garment industry.  It plummeted to about 2,000 or 3,000 jobs.  As we 
<br/></span><span>are currently working with the BPO Council, we also gave the Textile and Footwear Council of Fiji 
<br/>amounts of money, I think it was $200,000 or $300,000 for three years to carry out marketing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, the garment industry employs about 7,000 people, mainly women again, but we have 
<br/>reengineered ourselves.  We do not do mass production of one type of shirt, we do 300 pieces. We 
<br/>have provided the Victorian Police Force their uniforms, private schools actually get their uniforms 
<br/>sewn in Fiji and rugby jerseys.  Before COVID, if there is a final match, it is produced in Fiji very 
<br/>quickly and flown away as far as the United Kingdom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Garments that are actually being supplied now do not go to warehouses from Fiji, they go 
<br/>directly to the retail shop, and that is what you need to do, to reengineer yourself. That is what the 
<br/>Government did, we did a lot handholding. We provided the funding, work with the Australians, now 
<br/>that industry is now on stronger footing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, we are doing handholding with the BPO Council. and God willing, in a few 
<br/>years’ time, We currently are talking to a particular company, just looking and providing what we 
<br/>call 1,500 seats, which means 4,500 jobs because 1,500 seats in one shift and they do three shifts.  
<br/></span><span>So, these, again, are the new works that we are currently doing.  There is actually a six star hotel that 
<br/></span><span>is currently looking at a location in the Yasawas.  They want to start the investments and we have 
<br/>provided a number of incentives in that space, and obviously these things do not happen overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as I have highlighted, we need to be competitive in the tourism sector.  I would 
<br/>like to take this opportunity, again, to highlight to all those tourism operators, please, do not take it 
<br/>for granted because the competition will be extremely tough.  Once the world opens up, moves away 
<br/>from pandemic to epidemic levels, a lot of the countries will open up and will make themselves a lot 
<br/>more attractive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Kuridrani  talked  about  1,000,000,  but  I  think  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport actually highlighted that fact.  It is simple mathematics.  
<br/>You can get 10,000 visitors and they may spend $1,000 each, and that is $10 million input into the 
<br/>economy.  But you can get 5,000 visitors and they spend $3,000 each, you get $15 million.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have to look at the yield.  Of course, the numbers will be great to increase but you also 
<br/>have to look at the yield because if you have 100,000 people more, even though they will spend less, 
<br/>they will still need to use your infrastructure, your sewer system, roading system, electricity system, 
<br/>so you need to get a good rate of return.  That is the point. You need to get a new rate of return, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  When you get a high yield, of course, you are able to get a lot more money into the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Honourable Jale talked about cooperatives.  Again, I can mention Cicia 
<br/>Co-operatives, with all the issues that ended up with Cicia Co-operatives, we know that, it is very 
<br/>well documented in the public space and what happened there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Commerce and Trade has been highlighted in the 
<br/>2016-2017 Report.  Honourable Rasova would also know that many of the industries, even prior to 
<br/>many, many years ago were not actually producing their reports on time too. Of course, that is a KPI 
<br/>of the Permanent  Secretaries.  The Permanent  Secretaries, of course, are employed by the Public 
<br/>Service Commission and these are some of the efficiencies that the Permanent Secretaries need to be 
<br/>responsible for and they need to, indeed, highlight, and I am sure with the work that PSC is doing, 
<br/>we will be able to improve those services too, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
