<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review  of  the  2018  Audit  Report  on  Government  Commercial  Companies, 
<br/>Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  and  Other  Entities,  which  was  tabled  on  17</span><span>th</span><span>

<br/>Review of the 2017-2018 Audit Report on Statutory Authorities which was tabled on 
<br/>18</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/>I, as Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, take this opportunity to speak on 
<br/>the motion on the Review of the 2017-2018 Audit Report on Statutory Authorities and the Review 
<br/>of the 2018 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory Authorities 
<br/>and Other Entities.

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2017-2018 Audit Report on Statutory Authorities covered the audit of 13 entities.  In this 
<br/>regard, the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) had raised 12 audit opinions out of which eight 
<br/>were  related  to  2017  Financial  Statements,  while  four  on  the  2018  Financial  Statements  for  the 
<br/>various entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that the audits that were carried out on the 2017 Financial Year were 
<br/>issued with unqualified opinion on five or 62.5 percent of the Financial Statements audited for the 
<br/>various entities.  However, the audits that were undertaken in the 2018 Financial Year were issued 
<br/>with unqualified opinion on all or 100 percent of the Financial Statements audited for the various 
<br/>entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  Government  Commercial  Companies  (GCCs)  and  Commercial 
<br/>Statutory Authorities (CSAs), there was no modified opinion issued for the 2018 financial year.  The 
<br/>OAG had issued an unmodified audit opinion on all the 2018 Financial Statements that were audited 
<br/>for the various entities, and one of the Financial Statements that was in backlog for the various entities 
<br/>was issued with an unmodified audit opinion.  Financial Statements of the most entities audited for 
<br/>2018 were timely and of very good quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  pleasing  to  note that there were some outstanding  performances by 
<br/></span><span>some entities that I would like to highlight, and these includes Airports Fiji Limited (AFL).  In 2018, 
<br/>AFL’s net profit increased by 0.5 per cent or $300,000, compared to 2017.   This was mainly due to 
<br/>increase  in  revenue  generated  mostly  by  landing  and  parking  fees  of  international  airport  by  19 
<br/>percent, domestic airport by 11 percent, domestic passenger service charge by 10 percent and rental 
<br/>from check-in counters by 15 percent. AFL’s total profit for the financial year ended 2018 stands at 
<br/>$79,212,882. Also, net asset increased by $185,342,950 or 84 percent in 2018, compared to 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, there was increasing in investment made with various financial institutions by 
<br/>$21  million  in  2018.    A  total  of  15  Airports  altogether  operated  in  Fiji  and  this  includes  two 
<br/>International airports- Nadi and Nausori and 13 Domestic airports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Copra  Millers  of  Fiji  Limited  made  a  profit  of  $67,220  in  2018, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>compared to a loss of $162,393 recorded in 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), it was noted that FDB’s net consolidated asset had 
<br/>increased by 7.4 million or by 5 percent in 2018, compared to 2017.  Fiji FDB Nominees Limited 
<br/>Company in 2018 recorded an increase in its operating profit by 25 percent, compared to the profit 
<br/></span><span>of 2017.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Broadcasting  Corporation  Limited’s  (FBCL)  net  assets  increased  by  31percent  or 
<br/>$4,736,768  in  2018  compared  to  2017.  This  was  mainly  attributed  to  the  increase  in  investments 
<br/>made by the company during the financial year and additions to property, plant and equipment.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, FBCL has made a total of 17.97million of Capital investment in THE 2018 financial 
<br/>year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Post Fiji Limited recorded a net profit of 2.32 million in 2018, compared to a net profit of 
<br/>$0.47 million in 2017. This was attributed to the reduction in administration and operating expenseS 
<br/>by $1.8 million or 18 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  company’s  total  income  in  2018  also  increased  which  was  largely  due  to  agency 
<br/>commissions from international parcels by $1.9 million and sales revenue from Post Shops by $0.97 
<br/>million.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>409 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted that the net assets increased by $2.32 million or 22 percent in 2018, compared to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017. This was mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalent by $1.93 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Energy  Fiji  Limited (EFL), Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  2018, there was  an increase in  EFL’s net 
<br/>assets by 7 percent or $53.8 million, compared to 2017. This was mainly attributed to the increase in 
<br/>cash on hand and property, plant, equipment, receivables and prepayments balances.  In 2018, EFL’s 
<br/>total profit was $79,800,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Housing Authority’s total comprehensive income increased by 3.1 million 
<br/>or 216 percent in 2017, compared to 2016- which was largely attributed to the increased in the value 
<br/>of Land and Buildings from the revaluation the authority had carried out for the 2017 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Teachers Registration Authority (FTRA) in 2017 recorded net surplus 
<br/>of $14, 142 compared to a net surplus of $2,937 in 2016. An increase of $11,205 or 382 percent. The 
<br/>increase in net surplus was mainly due to decrease in the Administrative expense by $36,000 due to 
<br/>decrease in printing and stationary excise in Computer expenses compared to 2016.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  had  signed  a  five  year  7.3million  agreement  with 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of New  Zealand on 27</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2016 to  improve the higher 
<br/></span><span>education sector in omission of internal capabilities. In the End-fact project funding variation was 
<br/>made to  allocate  $220,000 as  a diminishing assistance towards  the management  remuneration for 
<br/>three years.  This variation was approved and signed off by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
<br/>(DFAT) Development Manager and the Commission’s board chairperson on 26</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2016 
<br/>and $100,000 was released to the Commission in the 2016/2017 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Meats  Industry  Board,  Mr. Speaker, recorded a net  profit in 2017 compared to  a loss 
<br/>recorded in 2016.  This was largely due to the sale of three acres of leasehold land to the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force for the construction of the Nakasi Police Station. There was an increase in net assets for 2017 
<br/>compared to the balance in 2016 which was largely due to increase in cash at bank and increase in 
<br/>account receivables.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Public  Rental  Board  (PRB)  in  2017,  the  Board’s  net  asset  had  increased  by 
<br/>$851, 204 or 4 percent compared to 2016 and this was mainly attributed to increase in property, plant 
<br/>and equipment which increased as there were some additions and the capitalisation of repairs and 
<br/>maintenance to the properties of the Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji National Sports Commission in 2018, its total revenue increased by 50 percent or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$3.25 million.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Fire Authority’s net operating surplus increased by 61 percent  or $1.9 million in 
<br/>2014 compared to 2013.  The increase was mainly due to the increase in revenue received from fire 
<br/>levy contributions and Government grant during the financial year 2014.   It was also noted that the 
<br/>Authority’s net assets had increased by 41 percent or $5 million in 2014 compared to 2013.  The 
<br/>increase was mainly due to the increase in cash and cash equivalents.  In addition, it is also important 
<br/>to note that most entities are working towards achieving their contribution towards Fiji’s five-year 
<br/>and 20-year National Development Plan in line with their relevant SDG targets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we commend the vast contribution made by these entities towards Fiji’s 
<br/>economy  in  these  challenging  times.    This,  in  terms  of  providing  of  employment  to  our  people, 
<br/>dividends  paid  to  Government  from  the  revenue  generated  through  its  operations  and  other 
<br/>contribution towards our overall GDP.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, Mr. Speaker, I thank these authorities and entities for their outstanding contributions 
<br/>towards economic development in Fiji and this will set a benchmark for other entities to improve 
<br/>their performance in moving forward.  With these few words, as a Member moving the motion, I 
<br/>thank you, Mr. Speaker. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  As a Member of the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee, I stand to make my contribution in support of the motion before the House which is the 
<br/>Review of the 2018 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies, Commercial Statutory 
<br/>Authorities and Other Entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the outset, the OAG Report has highlighted the systematic occurrence 
<br/>of chronic delays in the submission of financial statements by Government Commercial Companies, 
<br/>Commercial Statutory Authorities and those reorganised statutory entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General has highlighted that the reasons for the delay provided by the entities 
<br/>were mostly due to the incomplete draft accounts submitted for audit whereby it is unnerving to note 
<br/>that some of these backlogs date back to 11 years from the date of the audit in question being 2018.  
<br/>Such entities are drawn out for the attention of the Public Accounts Committee.  These include but 
<br/></span><span>are not limited to:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Viti Corporation Limited which had 11 years of delays in its audit,  
<br/>Food Processors Fiji Limited which had a 10-year delay, 
<br/>Fiji Investment Corporation Limited which had 13 years delay, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Walesi Fiji Limited had a four-year delay despite being a new entity and 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span>Biosecurity Authority of Fiji had a delay of six years to name a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  outset,  these  kind  of  practises  are  unacceptable,  Government-
<br/>supported entities with its appointed boards and executive management cannot afford to proceed with 
<br/>such business practices where international standards of good governance and crucial accounting of 
<br/>taxpayers’ funds are not considered as a priority, to ensure accountability and value for money is 
<br/>attained.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I borrow from the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, his description of 
<br/>a smart Government.  In this kind of situation what will Government do to address the chronic issues 
<br/>as it appears.  These trends of delays in submission of financial statements to the OAG will continue. 
<br/>What will Government do?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is noted that each time the OAG highlights these various anomalies, they 
<br/>come under heavy attack by Government side and the various entities that they scrutinise.  In essence, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the performance of these entities would not be acceptable in a commercial world 
<br/>and  would  warrant  a  total  overhaul  of  the  managements  and  boards  given  they  have  commercial 
<br/>targets, service delivery and the ultimate reporting authority are the line ministers or the Minister for 
<br/>Public Enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whilst  the  OAG  has  highlighted  the  backlogs  for  institutions  under  the 
<br/></span><span>Government  commercial  companies,  commercial  statutory  authorities  and  reorganised  entities,  I 
<br/></span><span>would like implore the Auditor-General to investigate why majority of the Government entities that 
<br/>are reported on this Auditor-General’s Report are not following the new fiscal years of Government 
<br/>where it used to be from January to December in their financial reporting and has now changed to 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July.  This has been something that we have been highlighting from this side of the 
<br/></span><span>House, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With these entities still adopting the old fiscal years of Government, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>411 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>may result in the consolidated books of Government being greatly misrepresented and will not give 
<br/>a true reflection and value of Government investments in these entities and the state of economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  OAG  has  highlighted  that  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  has  now  made 
<br/>necessary changes to its reporting timelines and its financial year in line with the Government fiscal 
<br/>year.  It would be good that the honourable Attorney-General take note of the comments that are 
<br/>coming from this side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government on an annual basis provides financial support apart from other 
<br/>subsidies to these entities that we are scrutinising today and it is therefore quite dismaying to note 
<br/>that the Tourism Fiji in 2018 had a delay of four years in their audited accounts.  The National Fire 
<br/>Authority,  a  delay  of  four  years.  The  Agriculture  Marketing  Authority,  nine  years  delay,  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs Board, 16 years delay, Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission, 11 years of 
<br/>delay,  Fiji  Servicemen  Aftercare  Fund,  four  years  of  delay  and  Independent  Legal  Services 
<br/>Commission, a delay of three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  a  Point  of  Order!    The  Auditor-General’s  Report 
<br/>nowhere says how many years of delays.  We have a very specific mandate that were given, review 
<br/></span><span>reports of 2017 and 2018.  That was our mandate. That were the reports that were actually provided 
<br/></span><span>to the Public Accounts Committee … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-… for 2017 and 2018. Nowhere in the Report, is he saying that how 
<br/>many  years  of  delays  were  there.    We  were  just  given  this  Report  which  we  were  supposed  to 
<br/>scrutinise.  Let us not go back and talk about 2010, 2016 and all those. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, just these ones.  The ones that were given to us, we scrutinised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that and we are debating that, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  Honourable Member, you have heard that Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  would  just  like  to  direct  our 
<br/>chairperson that all these delays were reported in the Auditor-General’s Report, page four and page 
<br/>56 - appendix one.  It is all from the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to reiterate, no more comments from 
<br/>this side.  Let me continue, Fiji Servicemen’s Aftercare Fund - four years delay; Independent Legal 
<br/>Service Commission - three years delay and Telecommunication Authority of Fiji - four years delay.  
<br/>Those are just a few, I have a whole list in the Report and probably Mr. Chairman can inform them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- He is bringing up entities that are not in these Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is here, it is in the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We need to limit our discussion to the entities that we are talking about 
<br/>in this particular Report. We need to limit our debate on what there is to be debated, not just what 
<br/>they want to talk about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, just stick to the Report.  Is that the information you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have in the Report? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  lifting  from  the  Report.    Maybe  the 
<br/>honourable Minister can just refer himself to the Auditor-General’s Report. I am not complaining 
<br/></span><span>about the Auditor-General’s Report.  I can continue with the list if they want.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are many others that were delayed in their audits as highlighted in two 
<br/>of the Office of the Auditor-General Reports by one to two years.  None of these delays are acceptable 
<br/>by any standards, no wonder the reaction from that side of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in noting issues highlighted in the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report, 
<br/>various alarm bells ring when I see issues like resources of various entities not being utilised to full 
<br/>potential, withholding and incorrect financial transaction disclosures and improper record keeping to 
<br/>name a few.  Those anomalies that has been pointed out are consistent with a lot of entities audited 
<br/>by the Office of the Auditor-General.  Their performances present a whole set of issues that we need 
<br/>to scrutinise further.  Do these entities have people with the right and necessary skills to perform the 
<br/>required roles within the entities?   That is the question.  Are the reforms being implemented to the 
<br/>entities working or should the Government acknowledge that they have failed?  How long does it 
<br/>take to admit that the management and boards of such entities are not equipped to manage the various 
<br/>organisations and companies?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  note  that  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General’s  Report  has  not  directly 
<br/></span><span>discussed workers issues, like employee recruitment, workers welfare, attendance, etcetera.  Perhaps, 
<br/></span><span>it means that generally employees of such entities are well catered for, however, things do not add 
<br/>up when we note the structural and procedural errors being highlighted, which in essence will lead 
<br/>us  to  question  the  capacity  of  workmanship  and  leadership  in  summary.    When  we  have  well 
<br/>established  companies  like  the  Post  Fiji  Limited  and  Housing  Authority  highlighting  that  their 
<br/>companies are still in a process of establishing procedures, it is very alarming.  Does this mean that 
<br/>prior to 2018, these entities were operating without proper policies, given the Housing Authority is 
<br/>now suggesting the implementation of a formal policy on provisioning of inventory as per the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General’s Report? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial that new management that enter into entities do not rewrite the 
<br/>will of existing systems.  What needs to be done is simply a review of the gaps that exist in structural 
<br/>policies, and as such, those that warrant improvement are done so without upsetting the cart of apples 
<br/>and starting from scratch all over again.  In my experience and work as a Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>in the last seven years in Parliament, the insight that I have gained has consistently highlighted that 
<br/>institutional  knowledge within entities are not  properly  recorded and valued, and every time new 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>management enter into various entities, they present a new target and a new vision for their term of 
<br/>leadership, and this could be contributing to the five-eighth performances of such entities.  The scripts 
<br/>need to be consistent and reflect long term sustainable development, not a new turn and twist at every 
<br/>corner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the two Reports, the age old problems of mismanagement is obvious, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Unauthorised use of contractors and machines continues which should result in responsible officers 
<br/>being investigated and removed for possible collusion and corruption, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Workers and 
<br/>CEOs, Ministers and boards are governing taxpayers’ funds and as such any unauthorised hiring and 
<br/>engagement  of  machines  of  personnel  must  be  strictly  investigated  and  disciplinary  measures 
<br/>warranted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I draw out under the Water Authority of Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, audit issues as per the Office 
<br/>of  the  Auditor-General  Report  before  us,  this  is  without  a  doubt  a  non-performing  entity.  They 
<br/>continue  to  engage  contractors,  vehicles,  machines  and  professional  services  without  proper 
<br/>authority. An accounting firm was engaged to provide a three years risk based internal services which 
<br/>was done on an annual basis costing $58,000 from January 2016 to December 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is interesting is  this was done without following WAF’s tender processes and when 
<br/></span><span>asked by the Office of the Auditor-General, the response was that this awarding of internal services 
<br/>was a board decision. Such engagement cannot be a board decision alone. It will require a tender 
<br/>process to ensure the best services are provided as identified at the most competitive price.  Collusion 
<br/>and corruption can and maybe raised in the absence of such independent processes and scrutiny when 
<br/>we do not follow existing financial procedures and processes which, if not done, point to a laxity in 
<br/>the good governance aspects of such entities like the WAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reform of the WAF much like the Fiji Roads Authority was supposed 
<br/>to have improved services provision and removed corruption.  The best skillset was supposed to have 
<br/>been  engaged  and  harnessed  and  yet  it  is  evident  that  the  reforms  were  a  total  failure.  If  water 
<br/>shortages and water cuts are a daily occurrence, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, a new water connectivity despite 
<br/>being fully paid by customers remain unconnected two years later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Government  has  to  admit  that  it  has  lost  direction  when  it  comes  to 
<br/>infrastructure reforms and the sooner they admit that we have busted our budgets unnecessarily by 
<br/>increasing costs in these two entities from when it was Public Work Department.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For FRA, obviously their books are in a mess according to the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>despite the reform and the qualified audit opinion. It was noted that the Authority had not recognised 
<br/>the amount it was expected to collect.  It was expected to pay municipal councils, for instance, $34 
<br/>million and $22 million respectively was not properly recorded in the books of FRA as income and 
<br/>expenditure.  These anomalies noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may have resulted from a legal directive to 
<br/>transfer all roads, drains and management from municipalities to FRA. Their transition period has 
<br/>likely not been done properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  these  entities  being  reviewed  are  Government-owned  and 
<br/>supported and if anomalies highlighted point to systems, management and leadership problems, we 
<br/>have to be very weary and apprehensive over the other Government entities that are no longer under 
<br/>the audit review of the Office of the Auditor-General’s ambit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  trust  Government  will  not  go  through  these  processes  for  the  sake  of  presenting  OAG 
<br/>Reports as if it is required by law but they take corrective measures to ensure proper utilisation and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>415 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.34 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Public Accounts Committee deserves 
<br/>our thanks for these Reports.  Although the Committee reviewed these Reports with the Auditor-
<br/>General and since then Mr. Speaker, Sir, many interesting scenarios have unfolded and they are very 
<br/>important.  They unfolded after this Report was compiled and tabled in Parliament in August 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The findings of the Auditor-General in the Report reviewed and noted by the Committee as 
<br/>well as its audit of the Government Commercial Companies, statutory organisations and other entities 
<br/>following the scrutiny for 2018 has led to far more serious issues.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>have  been  hearing  particularly  from  two  entities  listed  in  the  report  -  the  Fijian  Broadcasting 
<br/>Commission (FBC) and Walesi Communications giving their own spin to the so-called objectives 
<br/>and how wonderfully they have performed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned these two entities because in the last decade, both have jointly 
<br/>been allocated about $150 million of taxpayers funds in grants.  Walesi has been granted until the 
<br/></span><span>end  of  this  financial  year  $67  million  while  FBC  has  been  allocated  over  $80  million  in  the  last 
<br/></span><span>decade and in this Auditor-General’s Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reviewed by this Committee, FBC 
<br/>shows a profit of over $4.7 million just because they got $11.3 million in grants from Government 
<br/>under the guise of Public Service Broadcast fees for television and radio.  This, of course, has been 
<br/>treated  as  revenue  or  income  and  not  a  capital  grant  and,  of  course  without  it  FBC  would  have 
<br/>recorded a loss of almost $7 million for 2018.  This is similar to a profit as we saw before declared 
<br/>by the Fiji Sugar Corporation a few years ago because it received a last minute injection of around 
<br/>$50 million in taxpayers funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, these are essentially Government grants given to those organisations which then translates 
<br/>into  profits.    Worse,  Mr.  Speaker,  FBC  has  now  for  all  intents  and  purposes  become  a  State  or 
<br/>Government broadcaster instead of a national radio and television service provider and that too after 
<br/>consuming $80 million of public funds.  From a mere $1.5 million before the </span><span>coup</span><span> in 2006, 15 years 
<br/>ago in grant, this Government has raised the bar to $11.3 million.  We only saw a little dip in the 
<br/>current budget and the amounts still stands at an extremely high of $9.3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One wonders, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why the exceptional rise in Government grants? What is the 
<br/>nature of the Public Service that FBC provides which benefits the entire nation or is this like exclusive 
<br/></span><span>print advertising by Government in the </span><span>Fiji Sun,</span><span> another excellent example of exclusive beneficiary 
<br/></span><span>of taxpayers’ dollars and no prizes for guessing that </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> is also a Government rag a propagandist?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then there is Walesi, a 100 per cent taxpayers own communications body which is listed as 
<br/>having a revenue based of $30 million on a United States Analytical site called Dun &amp; Bradstreet. 
<br/>Walesi’s board chairman, Mr. Robert Khan is listed as the principal despite not owning a single share 
<br/>in the organisation.  The question is, why?  Is this a mistake?  Is this erroneous as claimed by Walesi 
<br/>a week after the NFP revealed this information through honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua and I want 
<br/>to ask, has it been corrected if it was wrong? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of this Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if Walesi’s income is in the millions of dollars, why 
<br/>the financial statement as pointed out by my colleague honourable Aseri Radrodro were not presented 
<br/>for four years?  The Committee could not scrutinise Walesi because it did not provide anything to 
<br/>the Auditor-General until this report was compiled.  However, Walesi has been in the news lately 
<br/>and that has led to a scenario never before witnessed in our history since the enactment of the Audit 
<br/>Act  over  50  years  ago  in  1969.   Way  past  the  completion  of  this  Report  by  the  Public  Accounts

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee is the stunning development of a Commission of Inquiry into the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General announced by Government on 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021.  We will not die wondering why. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General’s Reports because of this tabling in Parliament with rapidity, made the 
<br/>news, and the news was not very pleasing for this Government. It mirrors Government’s interference 
<br/>through  amendment  of  Standing  Orders,  the  change  in  provision  since  Independence  of  an 
<br/>Opposition Member always chairing the Public Accounts Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, what was announced on New Year’s Eve, Mr. Speaker, is far worse than anything 
<br/>else in terms of transparency and accountability.  A Commission of Inquiry into the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General, just for doing his job as an independent constitutional office holder.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And any government worth its salt must ensure that the Office of the Auditor-General remains 
<br/>independent under credentials of the Chairman of the Inquiry, Mr. Speaker, is highly questionable.  
<br/>His role, you and I both know, in the biggest financial scandal in our history, at least, that is what the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Economy says, the National Bank of Fiji collapsed, is never mentioned at 
<br/>all by the Government announcement of the inquiry.  Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it suits the honourable Minister for Economy and the Acting Prime Minister 
<br/></span><span>now, and his devious agenda to lay the blame squarely on the shoulders of the then Prime Minister, 
<br/>Sitiveni Rabuka.  Yesterday, he referred to Mr. Rabuka as piped piper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Acting Prime Minister is obviously frightened that the former Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  former  Leader  of  the  Opposition  has  become  a  formidable  political  opponent  by 
<br/>attracting a large chunk of support away from FijiFirst.  And this is forcing the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and his Party to scurry all over the country because they fear being buried in the political 
<br/>grave like …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are debating about GCCs, Statutory Authorities and CSAs.  I do not 
<br/>know what Rabuka has to do with it.  I do not know what Election has to do with it.  I do not know 
<br/>what the National of Bank of Fiji has to do with it and I do not understand what the Acting Prime 
<br/>Minister has to do with it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I request honourable Professor Prasad to remain on the subject.  Please, debate the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am perfectly on the subject and I can see 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the honourable Member is complaining like a little kid who has lost all his lollies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, their fear is genuine and will become a reality after voters 
<br/>give their verdict because we now see the honourable Attorney-General and Acting Prime Minister 
<br/>and most of his silent 25, aided with equally silent replacements who are scattering away like the 
<br/>bullets  that  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  talked  about 
<br/>yesterday, failing to hit the target because they are shooting blanks.  A good example of shooting 
<br/>blanks is not giving the full credentials of the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General.  The Chairman, as we all know is, Winston Thompson. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We know that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  into  the  Office  of 
<br/>Auditor-General has nothing to do with the Report that is before Parliament.  I request the honourable 
<br/>Member to refrain from bringing all those things to this debate.  It is as simple as that.  Now, he is 
<br/>behaving like a kid and not understanding what is supposed to be debated and what is not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report is from the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General, and this Parliament has all the right to talk about the inquiry into the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The credentials of the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry.  Mr. Winston Thompson was 
<br/>the Chairman of the National Bank of Fiji Board from 1992 to 1995 until replaced by the Rabuka 
<br/>Government after the discovery of the financial scandal that the honourable Attorney-General raises 
<br/>time and again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, we had discussed this matter in the Business Committee 
<br/></span><span>meeting about the Commission of Inquiry.  I did alert the honourable Member, who continuously 
<br/>refuses  to  come  to  the  Business  Committee  meeting  when  he  is  a  permanent  Member,  sending 
<br/>honourable Qereqeretabua all the time.  I urge him to read, please, the Commission of Inquiry Act 
<br/>and the boundaries that you need to actually adhere to once the Commission of Inquiry is put in place 
<br/>by His Excellency the President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he continues to do that, I urge him to go and say that outside because he 
<br/>will be in breach of the law and that is precisely what he is going to do now.  The Commission of 
<br/>Inquiry is independent to this particular report that is before the House, and he is now trying to use 
<br/>this Parliament to slander the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry.  That is what he is doing, that 
<br/>is the path that he is following now, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Professor Prasad, just stick to the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Parliament has all the right, no one in 
<br/>this country is  above the law, including His Excellency the President.  And if a Chairman of the 
<br/>Commission of Inquiry has a credibility, a record problem, then this is the forum that needs to know.  
<br/></span><span>This man was the Chairman of the NBF Board… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …who ignored the Auditor-General’s Report at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not yell! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED.-KHAIYUM.- Because you cannot hear, you are so far at the back.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>next thing, you will be out of the door this year.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You wish!  Do not threaten! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, while that process is in the process, it should not be touched by anyone 
<br/>else. It is not a matter of who is not above the law, that is the normal procedure, and you know that.  
<br/>Every Member in  this Parliament knows that.  So,  you have the  floor but  stick to  what  is  on the 
<br/>Agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I do not take the threat from the Acting Prime Minister.  He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>should stop threatening me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We leave you to get voted out, it is not a threat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- While you wish and you should think about that as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we heard from honourable Aseri Radrodro, I mean the details that he 
<br/>provided  is  actually  a  very,  very  sad  indictment  of  the  way  in  which  this  Government  has  been 
<br/>functioning.  And it shows the kind of transparency and accountability that they want. No wonder, 
<br/>the Code of Conduct Bill has not been enacted, although it was introduced in April 2006, revived in 
<br/>2018  post-Elections  and  still  gathering  dust.    No  wonder,  the  Accountability  and  Transparency 
<br/>Commission has not been appointed due to that deliberate delay in enacting the Code of Conduct 
<br/>legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yesterday, the honourable Acting Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister 
<br/>for Economy, kind of, subjected us to his own curriculum about economy, about their transparency 
<br/>and accountability, and last  night  he talked  about  financial reporting standards, saying we do not 
<br/>demand reports of unions and organisations, the Women Crisis  Centre, FRIEND, FPSA, to  be in 
<br/>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, I did not say that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Reports of these institutions are provided. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order! He is  again  misleading 
<br/>Parliament. I did not say that Parliament does not demand those reports from those organisations.  
<br/>What I said, Sir, was that, those organisations do not get audited by the Office of the Auditor-General. 
<br/>They get audited by other accounting firms. Does that mean, just because it is not being audited by 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General that their accounts are not credible?  That was what I said. Do not 
<br/>mislead Parliament! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the honourable Acting Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is further confusing himself.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, you are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yesterday, he talked about some organisations which are not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, therefore, the reports do not come here.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>419 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order, again. I did not say that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>will reflect that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You said that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- I did not say that. Sir, I know the words I uttered.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I follow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  what I said, once again, for him to be able 
<br/>to  comprehend and  I will  speak slowly,  that these organisations that I had mentioned do not get 
<br/>audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, they get audited by audit companies.  Does that mean, 
<br/>just because they are not audited by the Office of the Auditor-General, that their accounts are not 
<br/>credible?  That is what I said, it was a question.  However, he is saying now that what I said yesterday 
<br/>was  that  that  should  be  presented  to  Parliament,  I  never  said  that.    I  know  that.    He  is,  again, 
<br/>misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  and  Fiji  Ports 
<br/></span><span>Corporation  Limited  reports  can  be  tabled  in  this  Parliament,  why  not  Fiji  Airways’?    He  has 
<br/></span><span>constantly  denied  bringing  the  Fiji  Airways  reports  to  Parliament  or  Air  Pacific,  trading  as  Fiji 
<br/>Airways Annual Reports tabled in the people’s Parliament.  So there is still this contradiction.   Why 
<br/>are we asked to get the reports from the company’s office in case of Fiji Airways?  What law prevents 
<br/>tabling of Fiji Airways reports on the floor of Parliament, Mr. Speaker?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister  also  gave  his  own  interpretation  of  the  Asian 
<br/>Development  Bank  Classification  Report  of  2021.    As  the  honourable  Usamate  always  says,  “no 
<br/>amount of hogwash can now camouflage the truth”, and the truth is, Fiji’s economy and debt levels 
<br/>are like a decaying egg, shiny on the outside, but rotten inside.  That is the ultimate truth, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to respond to what he said yesterday, the reclassification of Fiji’s status means we are 
<br/>a  step  away  from  hitting  the  rock  bottom.    The  honourable  Minister  for  Economy’s  claim  that 
<br/>reclassification  is  because  we  are  being  ravaged  by  the  climate  change,  therefore,  need  access  to 
<br/>concessional loan, is not the single most important reason provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been reclassified for the following: The substantial and sustained 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deterioration in Fiji’s public debt … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are complaining like little kids. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really do not understand how many times we, 
<br/>from this side, actually had to stand up and tell the honourable Member that he should stick to the 
<br/>two Reports that are being debated.  He has been uttering all these nonsense for a while which is not 
<br/>part of this Report.  Let us not waste the time of Parliament and of the honourable Members, it is 
<br/>almost 3.00 p.m., so let us stick to the Report, debate on the contents of the Report and let us proceed 
<br/>further.  He needs to understand that he needs to stick to the Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, look who is talking?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Report, Mr. Speaker, as you had allowed quite rightly, we do respond to issues that 
<br/>have been raised by honourable Members previously.  So, it is about the Report and I do not know 
<br/>why they are complaining like little kids, again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has been reclassified for the following reasons:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The substantial and sustained deterioration in Fiji’s public debt sustainability (that is what 
<br/>the ADB says).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The downgrade in Fiji’s long term sovereign credit risk by Moody’s Investors Service and 
<br/>Standard  and  Poor  global  rating  (S&amp;P),  to  highly  speculative,  reflecting  a  longer  term 
<br/>deterioration in Fiji’s sovereign ratings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why has ADB done this?  They have pointed this out very clearly.  Fiji’s poverty rate has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been rising, even before the outbreak of COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>As at February 2020, poverty had increased to 29.9 per cent, and we have talked about this, 
<br/>despite  Fiji  enjoying  what  the  honourable  Minister  for  Economy  says,  unprecedented 
<br/></span><span>growth. 
<br/></span><span>The economy declined by 04.4 per cent in 2019 before COVID-19 and 19 per cent in 2020 
<br/>according to ADB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were told it was 15.2 per cent, RBF projects a 4.1 per cent decline in 2021.  Even if we 
<br/>take figures of ADB for two years, the economy declined by 19.4 per cent.  And if we add RBF 2021 
<br/>forecast, we end up with a 23.1 per cent decline in three years, compared to a modest average growth 
<br/>of 3.1 percent from 2015 to 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.  Sir, I ask for your judgment to ask 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this honourable Member to actually stop this nonsense in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ADB Report is nowhere mentioned in this Report.  We seriously do not understand what 
<br/>he is  talking about.   Economy about  2020, he is  talking about,  the decline in  economy that he is 
<br/>talking about is not in this Report.  He needs to stick to this Report, Sir and I ask for your judgement 
<br/>to ask the Member to either stick to the Report or sit down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I have asked you to stick to the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  as  I  said  earlier  I  am  not  defying  you.  I 
<br/>understand what you are saying but I am actually quite surprised when we speak from this side, they 
<br/>have an opportunity to respond, this is what the debate about these reports are and therefore we have 
<br/>the opportunity, I mean the Acting Prime Minister always speaks last and he says things that we have 
<br/>an opportunity when we have another opportunity to respond to, so I do not know what is the problem 
<br/>with these guys. What is the problem with these guys that we are responding to what the honourable 
<br/>Minister said?  But let me come back to the Report as he wants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his own presentation, Mr. Speaker, the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and 
<br/>we all know what his role is as the Chairman of the Committee because he is a Government Member, 
<br/>he is an Assistant Minister and what he did in his presentation of the Report was to gloss and say 
<br/>these  entities  made  profits  and  then  comes  honourable  Aseri  Radrodro,  who  is  a  Member  of  the 
<br/>Committee and lays all the facts bare and how bad, how bad and how delayed the reports were.  He 
<br/>talked  about  examples  of  mismanagement,  tender  not  being  issued  properly  by  people  who  are 
<br/>chairing those boards and he stands up and says we cannot talk about this.

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>421 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It shows Mr. Speaker, how irrelevant the Chairman of the Committee has become in terms of 
<br/>scrutinising the OAG Report.  The OAG, Mr. Speaker, in any country, any government worth its salt, 
<br/>any government which has an iota of shame about good governance or bad governance will ensure 
<br/>that the OAG reports and office remains independent.  What honourable Aseri Radrodro pointed out, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, shows the sycophantic approach in the governance of this country. Many of these people 
<br/>who are chairing those boards are donors of FijiFirst and they are not responding to what they should 
<br/>be doing in terms of producing timely reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what we heard in Parliament today from a Member of the PAC, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>you know they should hang their heads in shame.  They have been gloating about good governance. 
<br/>They have been gloating about transparency and accountability, yet this is the Report which points 
<br/>out how these entities have been functioning and that is why, Mr. Speaker, the independence of the 
<br/>OAG and any  attempt,  you know  yesterday  we had both  honourable  Koya and the Acting Prime 
<br/>Minister again attacking the OAG and ability to do its job thoroughly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  NBF  scandal  happened  because  the  chairman  of  the  board  at  that  time 
<br/>ignored  the  advice  of  the  Auditor-General,  Ramesh  Dutt.    In  1992  and  1993,  the  then  Auditor-
<br/>General, Ramesh Dutt warned the chairman and the board of NBF that the loans that they were giving 
<br/></span><span>was  not  sustainable  and  that  it  was  going  to  lead  to  the  collapse  of  the  bank.    In  fact,  they  keep 
<br/></span><span>blaming Rabuka but to his credit when he found out, he actually removed the board.  He removed 
<br/>the board. He removed the board. You know he does not know, he does not know.  He should read 
<br/>this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  can  tell  you,  the  Acting  Prime  Minister  has  read  this.    I  know  he  knows 
<br/>everything about what happened in NBF and here is a man, you know the hypocrisy is incredible. 
<br/>Incredible! Incredible because he knows what happened and it was Mr. Speaker, the result of the 
<br/>board ignoring the warnings of the Auditor-General’s report and in fact the NFP Leader in 1994, he 
<br/>called for an inquiry into the NBF, so when they …

<br/></span><span>They will know what happened, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have serious questions, Mr. Speaker and I want the Acting 
<br/>Prime Minister to for once honestly read this report and think about the people that they are using in 
<br/>government now to do the work for them.  There is a theory, you know honourable Dr. Reddy would 
<br/>know this, it is called State Capture, Mr. Speaker.  When you have a group of sycophants, you know 
<br/>who work for the government, who sit on boards, who influence government policy for their own 
<br/>interest … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Then  you  know  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  nation  is  heading 
<br/>towards a collapse of its governance system and I think that is what we are heading towards because 
<br/>we are not respecting the independent institutions and those independent institutions whose heads 
<br/></span><span>are  saying  all  the  nice  things,  good  things  about  them,  they  are  fine  but  the  moment  they  say 
<br/></span><span>something which is unpalatable, which is not good, which does not look good for the Government, 
<br/>they go for them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would urge the Government to stop being vindictive because their time is over, soon they 
<br/>will be out of Government, they should leave a legacy.  They should try and leave a legacy of good 
<br/>governance and a good practice because we are all here temporarily in this position in power and 
<br/>what we must do is leave some kind of legacy. Thank you Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  will  very  briefly  touch  on  the 
<br/>statutory  authorities  especially  on  the  Fiji  Teachers  Registration  Authority  (FTRA)  and  the  Fiji 
<br/>Higher Education Commission.    I take this opportunity to  contribute to  the motion  on the Public 
<br/>Accounts  Standing  Committee  Report  on  the  Review  of  the  2018  Audit  Report  on  Statutory 
<br/>Authorities.  I will contribute on two entities that I have mentioned, the FTRA and the Fiji Higher 
<br/>Education Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we look at the Fiji Teachers Registration Authority, it was 
<br/>noted that the annual returns were not submitted to FTRA as per the FTRA Act 2008 which should 
<br/></span><span>be done before June of every year.  Therefore, the auditors were not able to ascertain the completeness 
<br/></span><span>of  the  registration  fee  of  $197,381  as  disclosed  in  note  1.2  (h)  of  the  financial  statements  in  the 
<br/>Report.  This issue could have been addressed if the Ministry of Education updated its registered 
<br/>teachers record and reconciled with FTRA in a timely manner.  And this goes on to say, Sir, that the 
<br/>FTRA and the  education officers in  the district  are not  working together  as far trying to  find the 
<br/>teachers that are needed in the districts and hence the consequence is that most of the schools either 
<br/>do not have enough teachers or some are overstaffed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was noted in the Report that due to the absence of the FTRA board  and 
<br/>the CEO, the Authority was unable to produce its annual report since 2016- 2017 financial year.  The 
<br/>Authority is yet to submit the 2016 - 2017 annual report to the Ministry contrary to Section 47 of the 
<br/>FTRA Act 2008 which states that the Authority is to submit an annual report to the Minister by 30</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>March the following year on its activities for the last financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Authority has lacked strategic direction and this may be caused by the 
<br/>unfilled  positions  in  the  executive  management  and  at  board  levels  to  be  the  frontline  in  FTRA 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>423 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations.  That brings into question the issue of OMRS because we need to have the right people 
<br/>at the right place so that they can carry out the work and to avoid all these discrepancies.  On the 
<br/>FHEC, the delays in the finalisation of its financial statements, the audit of the financial statements 
<br/>of the FHEC for the year ended, 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017 was finalised after the above deadline due to the 
<br/>Commission submitting its draft financial statements four times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Sir, the non-inclusion of audit adjustments for 2016 in the draft accounts of 2017 and the 
<br/>lack of relevant notes and discrepancies or disclosures in the draft financial statements of 2017 led 
<br/>to  resubmission  of  2017  financial  statements  and  that  was  a  double  job.    The  high  number  of 
<br/>resubmitted financial statements will eventually delay the finalisation of the audit.  This also implies 
<br/>that the Commission will be lacking in depth in financial reporting. Again, that comes to mind that 
<br/>the Government should take heed of these and that we should have the right person for the right job 
<br/>especially for the job that is in question here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the root cause of the issue raised in the Audit Report, we from this 
<br/>side of the House always raise that OMRS is a mess and this largely contributes to all the audit issues 
<br/>raised every year.  When we look at these issues raised by the OAG in all its audit reports, it is all 
<br/>related to the basic accounting reporting skills and knowledge. Internal control issues that can be 
<br/></span><span>easily addressed by experienced accountants and that is if we have right people to do the job, so when 
<br/></span><span>we lose experienced people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also lose knowledge and skills with them. Given 
<br/>the  issues  raised,  there  is  a  need  for  more  in-house  training  to  be  conducted  to  all  accounting 
<br/>personnel so that everyone understands the required reporting standards or IFRAS and have clean 
<br/>books in its annual financial reporting in moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommendations on the FHEC.  The Committee noted the 
<br/>issue that was raised and recommends that FHEC conducts an ongoing in-house training on financial 
<br/>reporting.  Not only that, there should be incentives given to the staff to ensure that they are well-
<br/>prepared in terms of having to carry out the work that is required, especially at the FHEC. On that 
<br/>note, thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to say my appreciation to the 
<br/>Public Accounts Committee.  They have done a good job in going through the Report and presenting 
<br/>to  us.    I  think  the  work  of  auditors  is  always  an  important  task  and  it  is  something  that  we  in 
<br/>Government always appreciate, because it is important for us to understand to have an independent 
<br/>third party to look at the books of an entity and give us reports.  For me, as the Minister responsible 
<br/>for infrastructure, it is always good to read these reports, to look at the audits that are done by the 
<br/></span><span>Office of the Auditor-General to see the kinds of recommendations that they have come up with and 
<br/></span><span>what they identify as things that need to be improved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there is a lot of good things, good learning that we can have from the reports that are 
<br/>given.  It gives us an opportunity to reflect because as I said earlier this morning, the current systems 
<br/>that  we  have  now  is  one  in  which  Government  does  the  policy  setting,  the  regulating  and  the 
<br/>monitoring, but we expect these entities to be able to deliver services on behalf of Government and 
<br/>for the people of Fiji.  That is why the boards are set up, there is a governance structure in place and 
<br/>is always good to have an independent third party to tell us what is working and what is not working.  
<br/>That is basically what this report is, and I think that is something we appreciate.  We appreciate the 
<br/>works that was done by the Committee and I think there are a lot of things to be learnt here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both the entities that we have in the Infrastructure Sector that are part of this, Water Authority 
<br/>of  Fiji  and  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority  were  initially  part  of  the  Ministry  itself.    When  they  were 
<br/>decoupled from the Ministry, there was quite a lot of turmoil that took place at that time to be able to 
<br/>move out from being a government department in order to become a statutory body on its own. I

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognise the efforts of my Ministers of Infrastructure who have gone before me that oversaw that 
<br/>particular process.  In that process, there were a lot of issues that had to be worked out.  When you 
<br/>give birth to a new entity out of an old entity, there are always things that you need to work out.  The 
<br/>processes have to be made right, the culture has to be put in place and I think that was still being 
<br/>reflected over this time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you give birth to a new entity, it takes time to get rid of the things that are not working 
<br/>well and to continuously improve upon it in terms of direction, systems and processes, importantly 
<br/>in terms of having the right people in the right position in those organisations.  That is something that 
<br/>continually happens.  You cannot just wave a magic wand and say, “abracadabra” and all of a sudden 
<br/>everything is hunky dory.  It takes time, we need to be able to improve it over time.  That is why, I, 
<br/>as Minister appreciate the fact that we have these audits, we have the Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>and the reports that are in front of us.  Thank you to the Committee and thank you for that too because 
<br/>I think it is  always  good feedback. We may not  always agree with  everything that  comes in,  but 
<br/>nevertheless, it is good to reflect so that we can continually improve on the work that we do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Report  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  upfront  initially  they  have  a  number  of  general 
<br/>recommendations.  I am talking here in particular about the Review of the 2017-2018 Audit Report 
<br/></span><span>on Statutory Authorities (</span><span>Parliamentary Paper No. 148 of 2020).</span><span>  In that paper upfront,  after the 
<br/></span><span>Chairperson’s Foreword, they have a number of general recommendations on page 5, we will just go 
<br/>through some of these recommendations, broad ones that I think generally reflect on all of the entities 
<br/>that are included in this assessment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first one is that the line Ministry should implement stringent measures to ensure timely 
<br/>submission of draft accounts to be audited by the Auditor-General and for timely preparation and 
<br/>submission of Annual Reports to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to say that when we set up an entity like the Water Authority of Fiji and Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority, the Ministry </span><span>per se</span><span> does not come in and look at the operational activities of each 
<br/>of these entities.  We agree on the Corporate Plan, we agree on what the organisation needs to do in 
<br/>exchange for the money that it receives from the Government, but we do not go and tell them when 
<br/>they should do their audits.  We expect, if there is a deadline that they will deliver on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  that  particular  recommendation,  I  have  a  bit  of  hesitancy  in  seeing  how  that  particular 
<br/>recommendation gels well with the responsibilities that are found in the Board of these two entities, 
<br/>where there is Water Authority of Fiji or Fiji Roads Authority.  Those are my personal thoughts on 
<br/></span><span>that particular recommendation.  It is a good recommendation.  Yes, there is an important need to 
<br/></span><span>make sure that if the audits have to take place, they takes place on time.  But remember also, the Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority and Water Authority of Fiji have guidelines on how many days should elapse by 
<br/>the end of the year by which they are ready to give their statements to the Auditor-General to audit.  
<br/>I think one of them is three months, probably Water Authority of Fiji and the other one is 40 days for 
<br/>Fiji Road Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I might have them switched around.  Sometimes the accounts are ready, they are ready to 
<br/>present but then the time in which the Office of the Auditor-General does its own assessment depends 
<br/>on their own time schedule. So there are instances when WAF is ready or FRA is ready but the audit 
<br/>cannot take place until the Office of the Auditor-General is ready. So when you are talking about the 
<br/>fact that the Annual Reports are not on time, remember that, it is not only dependent on what is done 
<br/>in these entities, it is also dependent on the work that is done by Office of the Auditor-General. If 
<br/>they have a lot of work, this can be delayed. So that can also be one of the reasons for the delays that 
<br/>we have here.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>425 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  notes  that  the  draft  accounts  submitted  were  incomplete  and  strongly 
<br/>recommends  that they should be tagged to CEO’s Key Performance Indicators, CEO’s to ensure that 
<br/>timely and complete draft accounts are submitted to the Auditor-General. Same thing that I have just 
<br/>shared.  Within these entities they have targets.  So it is the responsibility of the Board to make sure 
<br/>that those targets are met by the CEO and if he does not deliver, it is the Board’s responsibility to 
<br/>make sure he is either removed or is coached to make sure that he can improve.  I, as Minister expect 
<br/>the  Board  to  be  able  to  deliver  that  and  as  yet,  they  do  have  those  timelines.  It  is  a  good 
<br/>recommendation but there are other issues that impinge on that particular recommendation.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the third recommendation, the Committee notes that these entities are now dealing with 
<br/>large  amounts  of  money  through  Government  grants  and  strongly  recommends  there  are  suitably 
<br/>well-trained  personnel  to  be  recruited  to  manage  the  operational  and  financial  affairs  of  the 
<br/>organisation. Absolutely agree.  That is why we have OMRS.  We want the best people to get the job 
<br/>done, put them there.  I have always believed that in an entity, if you want it to be well-driven, the 
<br/>first thing that you do is put the right person in-charge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will see that some of the issues that we had in areas like WAF, when you change the 
<br/>people in-charge, when you change the head, chop off the head and put a new head, things begin to 
<br/></span><span>improve.  That is one of the most important things. Right people on the bus. Get the wrong people 
<br/></span><span>out of the bus.  You put the right people on the bus, the bus will move in the direction that you want 
<br/>it to go.  That is what something, I, as Minister expect of the Board when they are looking at the 
<br/>CEOs and the top management in all of these entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There is no hogwash bus, this is the right bus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth recommendation that the line Ministry should set up an Internal Audit Team to 
<br/>continuously review and report directly to the line Minister.  I think this one, there will be a difference 
<br/>between the Fiji Roads Authority Act and the Water Authority Act in this recommendation because 
<br/>Ministers and ministries do not get involved in these functions.  It is largely left to the entity itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Minister we have  oversight  to  make sure that  it is  done, but  we do not  go  and do it 
<br/>ourselves.  If we are doing that, we are getting into operational matters.  There is a distinct separation 
<br/>between direct operation and oversight. So that particular recommendation, I, as Minister have a lot 
<br/>of reservations and  I do not  think it is  something that we will look  at implementing in  these two 
<br/></span><span>entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The entities with significant audit matters highlighted should be addressed before the next 
<br/>audit; I agree 100 per cent.  Later on I will talk about how some of that has already been done in 
<br/>these two entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The sixth recommendation, the Committee notes that entities are late in  implementing the 
<br/>policies  and  the  Risk  Management  and  Disaster  Recovery  Plans,  therefore  the  Committee 
<br/>recommends the entities to develop and implement this at its earliest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  can  tell  the  forum  that  in  both  of  these  entities  they  have  come  up  with  their  Risk 
<br/>Management Frameworks that are in place and in both entities in terms of the disaster recovery and 
<br/>business continuity. I think in WAF they already have a draft framework which they are trying out 
<br/>now before they take it up to the Board to formalise it.  So, safely I  can say that in both of these 
<br/>entities these recommendations are being addressed by the Boards.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends that a performance audit be conducted of the entities highlighted 
<br/>in this audit report; I do not have any issue with that. I think performance audits are okay and in fact 
<br/>in FRA they had performance audit for 2015, I cannot remember what the other year was but they 
<br/>never got those reports.  That is the feedback that we have had from the Fiji Roads Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Report to the Fiji Roads Authority, once again, as the Minister, I 
<br/>really appreciate this Report.  It has allowed me to go through it, read it and understand some of the 
<br/>issues and also talk to the members of the Board and the executive of the organisation.  I look at some 
<br/>of the issues that have been highlighted here, if you look at page 20 of the Report, looking at one of 
<br/>the  recommendations  that  Fiji  Roads  Authority  should  strengthen  its  human  resource  policy  in 
<br/>regards to employment terms and conditions, including redundancy issues.  I think at that time in 
<br/>2017, you still had a lot of issues that were coming out of the time when the Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/>was separated from the Ministry. So there were still a lot of old issues in terms of redundancy and 
<br/>human resource.  Happily, those issues have been sorted out and I am looking at the restructures that 
<br/>has taken place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since that time, the Fiji Roads Authority has introduced individual employment contracts and 
<br/>human  resource  policy  which  addressed  the  terms  and  conditions  of  employment  and  specific 
<br/></span><span>matters,  such  as  redundancy  and  others  moving  forward.    These  policies  are  aligned  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Employment Relations Act and the laws of Fiji.  So, as a result of these audits, the Board takes action, 
<br/>the  management  takes  action,  they  begin  to  implement  and  they  continuously  improve  how  they 
<br/>manage the Fiji Roads Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  second  part  of  that,  same  on  page  30,  there  is  a  recommendation  that  Fiji  Roads 
<br/>Authority should adhere to proper accounting procedures as per the Fiji Financial Management Act.  
<br/>The response I can see here, FRA to-date has established and adopted proper financial procedures 
<br/>that will make reporting transparent and reliable.  Since the variance discrepancy have been inherited 
<br/>by the Fiji Roads Authority, discussions between various agencies, Ministry of Economy, Office of 
<br/>the Auditor-General and FRA are held to make sure to address all of these so we can avoid qualified 
<br/>audit reports into the future.  I, as Minister, I think all Ministers expect our ministries and agencies 
<br/>to give us unqualified audit reports.  Some of the issues have a lot of historical trends.  Sometimes it 
<br/>takes time to  deal  with  them, but  the expectation  of all Ministers is  to  make sure  for all of these 
<br/>entities that we get unqualified reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr. Speaker, Sir, into that particular Report on the Water Authority of Fiji, there 
<br/>has been a lot of talk on the issues relating to WAF.  It has had a challenging time from the time it 
<br/></span><span>came to inception, but since then, just reading through some of these recommendations, there is a lot 
<br/></span><span>of talk about unauthorised contractors engaged for hiring of vehicles and machines.  Yes, that was 
<br/>an issue at that particular time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I have noticed from the points that have been given by the FRA management that 
<br/>since that time and the work that they have undertaken, the Office of the Auditor-General noted that 
<br/>this issue has been resolved issue in their final management letter for WAF for the 2017 audit.  So in 
<br/>their discussions, WAF has been able to show that they have addressed the issues that led to this 
<br/>particular issue of unauthorised contractors being engaged in the hiring of vehicles and machines.  
<br/>That was a big issue, they worked on it and they have improved on it to eradicate that particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  that  we  have  from  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  is  in  relation  to  the  review  of 
<br/>payments for the hire of generators revealing a lot of different anomalies.  In response to that, from 
<br/>2018, Water Authority of Fiji has developed a new procurement policy in 2018 and reviewed it in 
<br/>2021.  So once again there is this idea of continual improvement. Things happen, change and evolves 
<br/>so you can address it better.  The procurement policy clearly outlines the procurement guidelines 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>embedded  in  the  procurement  Standing  Operating  Procedures  for  implementation  and  that  has 
<br/>addressed that particular issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  that  we  have  on  this  issue  is  on  page  34,  in  terms  of  the  engagement  of 
<br/>unapproved suppliers through the provision of tendered service.  When I first came into the Ministry, 
<br/>there were lot of stories about this happening.  Once again, that issue had to be addressed.  This has 
<br/>also been addressed by the development of a procurement policy which was revised in 2021.  So it 
<br/>has been strengthened to make sure that whoever that they utilise meets the requirements that have 
<br/>been set aside by Water Authority of Fiji.  So, each of these issues have been addressed over time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2018,  the  Board  approval  was  obtained  for  a  write-off  of  accounts  mostly  for  certain 
<br/>dispute  accounts  and  for  accounts  that  are  primarily  beneficiaries  of  Government  Social  Welfare 
<br/>Assistance.  So, that particular issue has been also addressed over time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, on Page 35, in terms of anomalies in engagement of internal audit services; in 2019, 
<br/>WAF  called  a  fresh  tender  on  internal  audit  service  under  the  procurement  policies  which  was 
<br/>competitively bid by all the big four chartered accountant firms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the Honourable Aseri Radrodro made a comment on this, that there was no tender 
<br/></span><span>process for the internal auditor.  I think he was trying to suggest that there was some fishy business 
<br/>that was going on there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to read this comment that was sent to me.  Mr. Speaker, KPMG was initially 
<br/>appointed as the internal auditor for WAF in 2013 via a tender process where all the three major 
<br/>firms had presented their proposal to the Board, and KPMG was awarded as the internal auditor for 
<br/>a period of three years.  Upon expiry of this appointment, the WAF Board extended the contract for 
<br/>a further three years based on the following reasons: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provision for extension of contract was allowed under the 2016 Procurement Policy.  
<br/>It was allowed for an extension. 
<br/>KPMG was aware and well versed with WAF processes and functions. 
<br/>The  review  and  conduct  of  audit  cycles  under  the  initial  audit  finding  and 
<br/>recommendations. 
<br/>The cost of the internal audit remained the same. 
<br/>Engagement of a new auditor would have resulted in a delay in the audit reports as they 
<br/>would take time to familiarise with WAF processes and functions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,  KPMG  highlighted significant  issues,  particularly in  procurement, plant hire 
<br/>and project management.  These are precisely some of the things that came up in this Report.  So, 
<br/>they  saw  the  quality  of  the  work  that  was  done  by  KPMG  in  making  these  deep  dives  in  those 
<br/>particular areas - procurement, plant hire and project management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on their good performance and familiarity of the issues, their contract was extended 
<br/>under the same conditions. In the second period, they undertook deep dives into the procurement, 
<br/>tender and plant hire, and uncovered significant issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whistleblowing from external complaints gave rise to further work that KPMG undertook, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and upon expiry of that contract, a new tender was advertised in 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, a lot of issues have been there.  There were a number of other statements that were made 
<br/>in the House here, I think the Honourable Aseri Radrodro asked, why is it that these entities are not 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following Government in terms of its revised financial year?  You know, we start now in August and 
<br/>we go to July. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well, I can confirm to the House that both FRA and WAF have now adopted Government’s 
<br/>financial year, so it in sync.  Whatever happens here in Government in terms of the budget, it is in 
<br/>sync.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I have noticed here and I think I have said it before in this Parliament, 
<br/>that FRA accounts are given to the Office of the Auditor-General 40 days after the term ends.  But 
<br/>then it depends on their own work, and WAF also within three months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an issue that was raised by honourable Aseri Radrodro about new meter installation 
<br/>delays. He said that the new meters are taking too long, but here are some of the main reasons why 
<br/>new meter installation are delayed:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land issue disputes where customers do not have proper title of the property.  If they do 
<br/>not own the land, we are not going to put the meters there. There are lots and lots of cases 
<br/>like that.  This is mostly happening in informal settlements and in properties where there 
<br/></span><span>are no clear owners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outstanding  arrears  on  communal  meters.    If  you  have  one  meter  for  a  big  group  of 
<br/>people, before you can put in individual meters, that bill has to be cleared.  The bill for 
<br/>that communal meter has to be cleared.  So, you get delays there that need to be cleared 
<br/>before WAF installs new individual meter connections within these communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>New meter installation costs are still pending from customers. We are waiting for them 
<br/>to pay so there is a delay in completing that particular exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an issue that he had raised in relation to Fiji Roads Authority’s (FRA) books not 
<br/>being in order and this led to the delay of the audit. When the FRA first started, they had their audits 
<br/>from years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The opening balances that FRA gave for the auditors to look 
<br/>at, they accepted those balances.  They accepted the opening balances for the audit for 2013, 2014, 
<br/>2015 and 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then in 2017- 2018, they rejected the opening balance that they had already approved.  So, 
<br/>that then delayed the whole process.  What I am trying to say, is FRA and WAF perfect?  No.  Is it 
<br/></span><span>improving?   Yes,  definitely  improving  by  the  revision  of  processes,  change  in  culture,  change  in 
<br/></span><span>leadership, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the thing that drives us?  It is the target that we have in our National Development 
<br/>Plan, provision of water to all, provision of wastewater, sanitation, et cetera.  The FRA and WAF are 
<br/>driven by those targets and I, as Minister, make sure that I can work with the Board to try to deliver 
<br/>those targets to the best for the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, once again, I want to thank the Committee and thank the Audit Reports.  It has given us 
<br/>insights, and it will be a tool for us to continually enhance and improve these entities for the benefit 
<br/>of the people of Fiji. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a concern to know from honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad that all the supporters of FijiFirst have disserted and left to join Mr. Rabuka.  I think I know 
<br/>the answer - no money, they have used up all the money, too many promises and they have all gone.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>429 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. S.R. GOVIND.- Sounds like a broken record. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- It is not a broken record, that is a fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Very soon, you will come to realise that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two items for debate 2(a) and 2(b).  My contribution will be limited 
<br/>to  2(a),  which  is  the  Review  of  the  2018  Audit  Report  on  Government  Commercial  Companies, 
<br/>Commercial Statutory Authorities and Other Entities, and  even more limited to FBC, especially on 
<br/>the practice by FBC since 2016 to  treat grants from Government as revenue.  I think that is totally 
<br/>wrong, it is unprofessional for it to do that.  It is against advice, and I will even go to the extent of 
<br/>asking FICAC to investigate because it has led to executives and workers in FBC obtaining bonuses, 
<br/>even to the extent of $21,000 as a result of that.  Totally wrong! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that last year, FBC took to the newspapers to shift blame to KPMG and inform the 
<br/>public that it did so as a result of advice of KPMG.  But I invite the Minister responsible for FBC to 
<br/></span><span>also look at the Annual Audit Report of FBC from 2016 to present, to matters of significance and it 
<br/></span><span>will show there that the auditor has noted time and time again or yearly, that it was wrong.  It was 
<br/>wrong because it contradicted IAS 20, I am not sure what that term means, the accountants will know.  
<br/>And what FBC did in 2016, I believe, it managed to convince Government to make a decision to 
<br/>allow it to use these grants as revenue, instead of deferred income, to align to IFRS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will see that there is a contradiction there.  Whilst FBC is blaming 
<br/>KPMG from that time even to the present, the Auditor-General has been reminding them time and 
<br/>time again that they are wrong, they need to resolve this issue that even though the Auditor-General 
<br/>and  KPMG  had  given  unqualified  reports,  but  they  have  noted  this  down  as  items  of  significant 
<br/>matters.  If I can go now to Page 1 of the Chairman’s Report, it says, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Committee thoroughly scrutinised the audit report and formulated questions 
<br/>for the nine entities (and that is including FBC) that were audited to provide their written 
<br/>responses on other significant matters and financial anomalies that were highlighted by 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor  
<br/> General.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then it goes on to say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Committee noted that some of the entities have resolved the audit queries 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while some are working towards resolving these controlled issues.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second paragraph is relevant to FBC because its Board has not resolved this question, 
<br/>and noted as a significant issue by the Auditor-General and also by the private Auditor from 2016 
<br/>until now, and it continues to use money that is being given by the Government as direct revenue 
<br/>instead of deferred income. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can now go on to the Auditor’s Report that is relevant to the point 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that I am raising.  At page 16, the Auditor General says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Auditor- General Act requires amongst other things that the Auditor General 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must report on other significant matters.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>430 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So it is telling us that even though they may give an unqualified report, he is also obliged to identify 
<br/>significant matters, and it goes further to define those significant matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It says here, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Other  significant  matters  in  this  report  include  controlled  weaknesses  which 
<br/>could  cause  or  is  causing  severe  disruption  to  the  process  or  inability  of  entities  to 
<br/>achieve process objectives and comply with relevant legislation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am saying here that FBC treating Government grant as income may be contradicting relevant 
<br/>legislation.  Therefore, that is the reason for I am asking for an investigation by FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Auditor-General  goes  further  to  say  in  relation  to  that  aspect,  if  you  go  down  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bottom of that page, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  financial  statements  states  that  grants  and/or  special  funding  from 
<br/>Government up to 7 March 2016 were treated as capital contribution in accordance with 
<br/>Cabinet’s decision in 2012, and from 8 March 2016 were treated as revenue based on the 
<br/></span><span>Cabinet’s decision in 2016 to align the accounting treatment to IFRS.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just note now that the comment from the Auditor-General there was not as harsh as 
<br/>you  would  have  expected,  because  in  previous  comments,  the  Auditor-General  stated  very 
<br/>succinctly to say that this is a contradiction of IAS 20.  I suspect it is because of intimidation from 
<br/>the Government, threatening the Auditor-General.  You can just see how they criticised the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General now and I feel that that is the reason why he had toned down his comment 
<br/>in relation to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the Chairman’s Report, they went further than the Auditor-
<br/>General to raise issue on IAS 20.  If I can just read that from page 20.  Here is the Committee’s 
<br/>report on FBC and titled, ‘Disclosure of Non-compliance with International Accounting Standard 
<br/>(IAS) 20.  So, I am saying here that the Committee has now raised that issue very directly, not so 
<br/>much as  the Auditor-General.   So,  I thank the Committee totally for revealing this and they  go 
<br/>further.  If you could allow me, Mr. Speaker, to quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Audit noted that Note 3(k) and 23(c) to the financial statements states that. Based 
<br/>on Cabinet’s decision in 2012 grants and/or special funding from the Government of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji be treated as capital contribution.  Any additional funding to be recognised as equity 
<br/></span><span>other than being treated as operating revenue of the company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effective from 8th March, 2016 and based on the Cabinet decision in 2016, grants 
<br/>and/or special funding from the Government of Fiji is treated as operating revenue to 
<br/>align itself to IFRS.  Then it goes further (this is the Committee) to say that while the 
<br/>matter was raised as an emphasis of the matter for attention of management, there has 
<br/>been no resolution to clarify the capital contributions prior to 2016 in consultation with 
<br/>the Ministry of Public Enterprises to comply with full requirements.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, total neglect.  Basically our Committee is saying here that despite reminders from 2016 and year 
<br/>after that, the board of FBCL has not sat down to resolve this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you can allow me to put some background to that to what is happening 
<br/>now.  Now, if you go back to before 2016. FBCL was incurring losses after losses after losses.  And 
<br/>I can tell you now, Mr. Speaker, in 2010 it incurred a loss of $517,000.  In 2011, it incurred a loss of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>431 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$1.1 million. In 2012, it incurred a loss of $7.1 million.  In 2013, $5.6 million loss. In 2014, $3.9 
<br/>million loss. In 2015, $3.6 million loss. Year after year after year, so the total then it comes to about 
<br/>$26 million.  I am not too sure but you can add that up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Government was giving money to FBCL year after year after year. So, if 
<br/>you compare the loss that it incurred in 2010, Government gave to it in 2010 the sum of $2.6 million 
<br/>grant.  In 2011, Government gave to it $2.5 million in grant. In 2012, $2.6 million grant. In 2013, 
<br/>$2.9 million. In 2014, $2.9 million. In 2015, $2.9 million.  But on top of that, FBCL had incurred a 
<br/>loan that is also guaranteed by Government.  So, in the six years from 2010 to 2015, it made a total 
<br/>loss of $21.6 million but it was receiving continuous cash grant from Government in the sum of $16.4 
<br/>million.  That is to keep it afloat.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if I can go back again now.  I explained earlier that last year in June, FBCL went 
<br/>public, went to the papers to shift the blame to KPMG.  And this is what it said, that FBCL auditors 
<br/>KPMG  from  about  2012 onwards advised FBCL that under the  International  Financial Reporting 
<br/>Standards, the money paid to FBC under public service broadcast contract for specific Public Service 
<br/>Programmes and transmission was essentially a fee and it should be treated as revenue.  So, there 
<br/>FBCL  was  saying  we  did  this  because  we  were  advised  by  KPMG.    But  now,  I  am  asking  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister responsible for FBCL to check the yearly annual reports after that which I think 
<br/></span><span>was also audited by KPMG and it has listed its reservation as significant matters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General yearly has been raising that as an issue.  
<br/>In 2016, the FBCL annual audit was conducted by the Auditor General, it was a qualified audit with 
<br/>the following explanation there, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  company  accounted  for  all  government  grants  received  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  January, 
<br/>2016 to March 2016 as capital contribution.  This is a departure from IAS 20.  Grants by 
<br/>the  Government  of  Fiji  received  after  8</span><span>th</span><span>  march,  2016,  have  been  recognised  in  the 
<br/>statement of profit and loss as operating revenue.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then again in 2017, FBCL annual audit was also conducted by the Auditor General.  It was 
<br/>an unqualified audit but containing the following matter in its heading ‘Emphasis of the Matter’ and 
<br/>I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I draw attention to note 3.1 of the Financial Statement which states that grants up 
<br/>to … the OAG Report … not complying with international accounting standards and note 
<br/></span><span>FBCL’s undertaking to comply with IAS.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So in 2017 this was raised to FBCL and FBCL undertook to look into it.  But then, in 2018, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, the Auditor General noted that from 8</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2016, grants were treated by FBCL as 
<br/>revenue to align to accounting treatment to IFRS.  In 2019, the Auditor General cited FBCL for a 
<br/>significant matter again concerning the 2016 Cabinet decision to align the revenue under the IFRS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, my point really is that in relation here, this is a matter that FBCL was asked 
<br/>a long time ago by the Auditor General as well as I feel also its own private auditors to look into but 
<br/>has not been resolved and I wish to end by saying that I suspect personally that this is also a reason 
<br/>for the Government now going to a review or a commission against the Auditor General’s Report 
<br/>because they are not happy with this.  Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will make brief intervention on four of the entities 
<br/>that are related to the Ministry of Agriculture namely Fiji Meat Industry Board, Fiji Rice Limited and

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>livestock, one of the most important  primary question that any farmer would  ask is,  where is  the 
<br/>market and that is one reason why farmers are stuck in the sugar industry because it is a guaranteed 
<br/>market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start with Fiji Meat Industry Board is providing market to livestock 
<br/>farmers in particular beef cattle farmers, sheep farmers, pork farmers (piggery).  At the moment with 
<br/>regard to beef we are 43 per cent self-sufficient.   It is a long way to  go in terms of reaching 100 
<br/>percent self-sufficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regard  to  pork  we  are  97  per  cent  but  there  are  seasons  like  at  the  moment  there  is 
<br/>shortage of pork meat in the market.  We are one percent self-sufficient with lamb meat and we have 
<br/>a massive way to go.  We are only producing 126 metric tonnes annually.  Pork, we are producing 
<br/>1232 metric tonnes and we are producing 2507 metric tonnes of beef.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For poultry, we are pretty much 100 per cent self- sufficient.  Even though there are some 
<br/>poultry products imported but we are also exporting poultry products to other countries, so netting 
<br/>up we are 100 percent self-sufficient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Meat Industry Board is providing an avenue so that we can get this 
<br/></span><span>livestock which was placed in Fiji, to the two Abbattoirs – one in Vuda and Nasinu so that we can 
<br/>get these products to the formal market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we do not have abattoirs then in the formal market, the supermarkets, the 
<br/>hotels, restaurants et cetera will have to import meat which is certified.  They cannot sell meat or 
<br/>they cannot use meat products which are not certified because of health risk.  It is for this reason that 
<br/>we need to have our abattoirs so that when we are promoting,  you know raising of livestock and 
<br/>promoting that, we need to be self-sufficient to the extent possible and two, with regards to those 
<br/>livestock where we have got a strategic advantage then we need to have an avenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIB, the two abattoirs provides market to all those who are willing to sell livestock 
<br/>whether is cattle, pig, sheep or goat to be purchased and they will slaughter it and they will get it to 
<br/>the market themselves. So, market is guaranteed.  With the guaranteeing of market we have seen 
<br/>substantial improvement in terms of production.  We have noted that, for example, the 2017 slaughter 
<br/>figure for goats was 800.  Now in 2021, last year from 800 it raised to 2,259.  This is with Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture investment into developing a centralised fattening farm which collects from feeder 
<br/>farms and then this fattening farm will supply the goat to the abattoir and from the abattoir it will 
<br/></span><span>enter the supermarkets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our strategy into promoting sheep farming is to reduce importation of sheep 
<br/>and lamb meat but also the other strategy of reducing the substantial importation of lamb and sheep 
<br/>meat is to promote goat raising because goat is seen as to some decree a kind of perfect substitute of 
<br/>lamb meat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  similarly  we  have  seen  the  number  of  pig  and  cattle  going  to  abattoirs 
<br/>increasing over time.  Abattoir also provides a number of by-products which is very important to be 
<br/>used as a core component of meals particularly in poultry industry, meat meal and fish meal, so the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Agriculture  last  year  provided  $100,000  grant  to  establish  and  repair  the  rendering 
<br/>machine which now we are using it to provide and manufacture fish meal and meat meal. Last year 
<br/>they produced 200 tonnes of fish meal and 150 tonnes of meat meal which they were supplying for 
<br/>us in meals for poultry.  Poultry meal requires this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>433 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  core  components  which  is  very  expensive  and  important,  the  poultry  sector  is 
<br/>importing soy meals to be used in the meals and if we are able to fulfil their demand then two things 
<br/>will happen.  It will reduce importation of the protein that goes to the manufacturing of the poultry 
<br/>meal and secondly we will be able to reduce the cost of poultry product in the market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Agriculture knowing that it is supporting our quest in 
<br/>terms of expanding production of livestock, we are seeing FMIB as a strategic partner. Over the last 
<br/>five years we have seen substantial changes in terms of efficiency, production and financial viability 
<br/>of FMIB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, linked to FMIB in the Yaqara Pastoral Farm.  Yaqara Pastoral Farm also 
<br/>has seen major improvements in production in terms of investment in strategic areas which is critical 
<br/>to Yaqara Pastoral Farm.  Yaqara Pastoral Farm now has a total herd of about 4,240.  This was the 
<br/>2018 figure and 2021 figure is close to 5,000 which is primarily consisting of cattle.  Yaqara Pastoral 
<br/>Farm,  its  primary  objective  is  to  be  the  prime  supplier  of  premium  quality  beef  to  our  markets 
<br/>particularly the hospitality sector and also the formal markets (supermarkets).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment annually about a thousand cattle ends up, most of them are 
<br/></span><span>from Yaqara but there are also other beef cattle farms that we have established over time and we are 
<br/></span><span>establishing now.  One of the primary pre-requisites of these commercial beef cattle farms now, they 
<br/>signed with the Ministry of Agriculture is that they must supply to the abattoir apart from what they 
<br/>will draw out for their own requirement or </span><span>magiti</span><span> but the rest must go to the abattoir. So, we are 
<br/>making it a condition for them to get grants from Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Yaqara  Pastoral  Farm  as  I  alluded  to  earlier  on  has  been  investing  in 
<br/>strategic  areas  for  example  pasture  development.  They  have  got  40  acres  of  high  yielding,  high 
<br/>protein  juncao  grass  which is  the largest  holding  of juncao grass  amongst  any of the commercial 
<br/>farms we have in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they were known at one point in time to hold superior high quality breeds.  
<br/>Some two or three decades ago the people were talking about it, “oh it is from Yaqara”. We want to 
<br/>go back and develop these breeds that they have; Santa Gertrudis, Limousin and Hereford breeds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  also  has  its  own  cattle  breeding  project.  So,  they  have  been 
<br/>affected by TB infections so that is an ongoing programme that they are cleaning it up and we are 
<br/>now separating them.  We also want to have another place where we could have our exotic breeds, 
<br/></span><span>beef cattle breeds which is Senepol so that in case one place is infected then there is another place 
<br/></span><span>where we will have this gene pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first time ever, we are also using Yaqara as a Horse Multiplication Centre 
<br/>to get good and improved genetic stock of horses which is still very critically used for transportation 
<br/>and also for additional power in farms.  Overall Yaqara Pastoral Company has done substantially 
<br/>well even though there is a lot of improvements that needs to be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be talking about Fiji Rice Limited.  Three years ago we were 16  
<br/>per cent self-sufficient in rice. Now, people have argued that we have dropped substantially from 
<br/>around 65 per cent some four decades to 16 per cent.  So, two years ago is 16 per cent.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, because the initially earlier model of rice production in Fiji was wrongly premised where the 
<br/>production and supply was driven by grants and subsidies.  That is out now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now raising rice production, from 16 per cent, now we are at 18 per cent over the last 
<br/>two-year  period  because  now  we  are  basically  promoting  rice  production  and  supply  through  a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demand driven strategy where we are saying that we will provide market to you.  The only way we 
<br/>are providing market is through the Fiji Rice Limited. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Rice Limited basically will buy all rice that is produced in Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is 
<br/>a very important strategic partner of the Ministry of Agriculture and we have got the main rice mill 
<br/>in Dreketi.  At the moment, we are constructing another rice mill which should be ready in a months’ 
<br/>time at the Ministry of Agriculture Station in Nailaga, Ba which will be handed over to Fiji Rice 
<br/>Limited so that the Western Division rice collected does not have to be taken across to Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  this,  we  are  quite  optimistic  given  that  there  is  a  surge  in  rice 
<br/>production particularly in the Rakiraki area and now in Ba, Lautoka and Nadi.  We are promoting 
<br/>short-term rainfed variety of rice and we can say that maybe in a decade’s time we could get to about 
<br/>45 per cent to 50 per cent self-sufficiency.  That is pretty reasonable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of 
<br/>food security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the food security’s point of view, if you are able to at least reach 45 per cent to 50 per 
<br/>cent self-sufficiency, that is pretty good. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rice Limited has done substantially 
<br/>well and is a strategic partner of the Ministry of Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last one, Copra Millers Limited.  As you all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>coconut and copra has been a very important commodity and industry in Fiji for a long period of time 
<br/>and it will be there. Initially, the Copra Millers Limited was manufacturing some coconut oil and 
<br/>copra meal. They now as any other entity responding to market demand have ventured into other 
<br/>products to remain viable in the market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Virgin coconut  oil, now  they  are establishing  a unit to  get  into coconut  water market and 
<br/>coconut  chips.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  copra  meal  is  very  critical  for  us  in  terms  of  promoting  poultry 
<br/>industry. So Copra Millers Limited is very critical for Fiji and for the agriculture sector.  We now are 
<br/>promoting  coconut  in  the  Western  Division  as  well.  Over  the  last  three  years  we  have  got  373 
<br/>households and farmers who have planted smaller number of coconuts seedlings. About 17,644 were 
<br/>planted in the Western Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to this, from last year, we have been actively promoting establishment of coconut 
<br/>farms (orchards) for a number of purposes - oil, coconut timber as well as to support coconut meals, 
<br/></span><span>bu</span><span> market.   In this endeavour we have 38 farmers who have planted a total of 124 acres of established 
<br/>orchards. So 38 orchards we have for coconuts in the Western Division.  Coconut was only known 
<br/></span><span>to be in Taveuni and Cakaudrove </span><span>in</span><span> the Northern Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coconut  furniture  is  also  coming  up  and  quite  widely  utilised  not  only  in  Fiji  but  in  the 
<br/>external market as well. In contrast to what the other Member said that we have and are replacing 
<br/>ageing trees. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to commend all these entities who are doing well but again 
<br/>there is a lot of room for improvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F. TUISAWAU- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion on the Auditor-
<br/>General’s Reports. In particular, I will just try to focus on the areas which have not been touched 
<br/>upon but which could be of interest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In reading through the Report, I note the various recommendations on the anomalies which 
<br/>have been raised and one of the key issues or problems has been the lack of human resources within 
<br/>entities. The Accounts Officers, et cetera in that which enables the organisation to have an effective 
<br/>and  efficient  accounting  section.  So  we  hope  that  that  will  be  addressed  through  proper  human 
<br/>resources planning and other means where we could plug that gap in human resources.

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>435 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Report itself, I note for Fiji Development Bank (FDB), an issue which we had raised 
<br/>about credit impairment, in particular, I note there on page 16, number two, the non-performing loans 
<br/>that  has  been  raised.  Two  major  accounts  –  Toa  Fiji  Limited,  Brighton  Holdings  and  credit 
<br/>impairment had been increased to $3.3 million and specific provision of around $1.8 million was 
<br/>created for these loan accounts and also taken under Reserve Bank of Fiji supervision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the issues which we had raised about FDB, the  loan impairment and what strategies 
<br/>have been made in order to address this, what kind of assessment was done, what issues arose which 
<br/>resulted in non-performance, what was recovered by the Bank in terms of its contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on that Report, FDB Nominees  Limited, again,  this  is  an entity which  we had  raised 
<br/>concern  about in terms of maybe its lack of activity, but if you look at that report, number five under 
<br/>that  they  have  mentioned  statements  shows  receivable  amounting  to  $373,750  which  relates  to 
<br/>management fees due from Fiji Investment Corporation Limited (FICL).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was advised that FICL is 100 per cent owned by a Government corporation 
<br/>which was previously managed by its own Board and in July 2011, the Ministry of Industry, Trade 
<br/>and Tourism (MITT) transferred the operations of FICL and its projects to FDB Nominees Limited 
<br/></span><span>under a management agreement.  This was for three years and expired in August 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A good question would be, what is the status of FICL? I recall that the General Manager or 
<br/>CEO position was advertised recently and it is supposed to be a State-owned enterprise but I did not 
<br/>notice  it  listed  in  some  of  the  Budget  documents.    I  understand  that  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy had stated that FICL will be revived, so an update on that would be helpful and interesting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Fiji Broadcasting Corporation Limited (FBCL) that has been discussed extensively by my 
<br/>colleague, honourable Nawaikula however, I raise the issue which he had raised in his contribution 
<br/>where  Government  or  taxpayers  have  been  putting  into  FBCL,  particularly  the  Public  Service 
<br/>Broadcasting Grant and this has now been …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Fees, fees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Yes that is what I was about to say.  This has now been re-termed 
<br/>as fees.  So the explanation there is, it is paying for public service provided by FBCL to the nation.  
<br/>What I would like to propose is that, because it is a public service fee and undertaken by FBCL, it 
<br/>should be tendered out so that other providers can also tender for these services including for TV.  
<br/></span><span>That  is  something  which  needs  to  be  explored,  so  that  what  is  paid  for  by  Government  is  cost-
<br/></span><span>effective and it is at the best deal for taxpayers funds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other comments I had was on Statutory Authorities.  I note on the Public Rental Board 
<br/>(PRB), there are some comments there regarding the anomalies in processing and allocation of PRB 
<br/>flats, provisions of forms for applicants et cetera, debt collection and review current collection and 
<br/>strategy and necessary arrangements with tenants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the PRB, I note in the National Development Plan that they had planned for PRB 
<br/>construction, renovation of units and from the period 2017 to 2022, we have a number of targets there 
<br/>- 2017-2018 – Kalabu, Savusavu.  I understand that has been completed and in 2018-2019, Simla – 
<br/>36.  I note an update by the honourable Minister in February 2021 that that was in progress.  The 
<br/>others there: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Suva 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>500 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure about the progress of that in terms of the targets which had been set for Public Rental 
<br/>Board.    There  was  also  another  issue  regarding  the  Review  of  Government’s  Subsidies  and 
<br/>Implement Strategies to graduate residents of low income HART and PRB Housing towards Housing 
<br/>Authority programmes.  Again the question is, what strategies are in place, what are those strategies, 
<br/>have they been implemented and what are the results?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other issues here, targets for Housing Authority which is also included in the Report 
<br/>and whether these targets in this National Development Plan have been achieved is another question 
<br/>which we would like to pursue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Water Authority of  Fiji  (WAF),  I would like to  thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>update which have been given to us. There has been a lot of public discussions about the so-called 
<br/>‘digger scam’ for $33 million.  Whether this is actual or not, I am not sure but this emanated from 
<br/>the KPMG Audit Report which he had identified as one of the Auditors and where it was stated that 
<br/>for 15 months period ending 31st March, 2017, the total cost of plant hire was $33,717,421.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were other issues raised there regarding the purchase of heavy machinery which was 
<br/>not  effective,  approved rates of hire of plant  equipment  but  higher  rates  were paid  to contractors 
<br/>without Board approval which he had mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  there  were  other  instances  there,  and  what  he  had  explained  was  that,  proper 
<br/>procurement policies have now been developed but the question is, what happened to these issues 
<br/>identified by the previous audit reports, including the KPMG Audit Report as reported in January 
<br/>2019?  It has been reported that it was given to FICAC.  What happened to the cases?  Were there 
<br/>any investigations, et cetera?  That is something which not only we, in the Opposition, would be 
<br/>grateful for an answer, but also the members of the public who are really interested in that case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are my contributions on the Auditor General’s Report. I would like to 
<br/>thank  the  Committee  on  some  of  the  clarifications.    I  thank  the  honourable  Ministers  from  the 
<br/>Government side for providing those clarifications.  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to thank you for allowing me to 
<br/>contribute to the Review of the 2018 Audit Report on Government Commercial Companies (GCCs), 
<br/>Commercial  Statutory  Authorities  (CSAs)  and  Other  Entities,  which  was  tabled  on  17th  August, 
<br/></span><span>2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the Board and the Executive Management of those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>GCCs and CSAs in completing their audits and submitting their annual reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are part of the National Fijian 
<br/>Made  Branding.    This  include;  PAFCO,  Fiji  Coconut  Millers  Pte  Limited,  Fiji  Rice  Limited  and 
<br/>Yaqara Pastoral Company Limited.  These companies have shown their commitment to grow revenue 
<br/>and give recognition to locally-manufactured goods and products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The growth of these local businesses is essential, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for job creation, income 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generation, rural development, for poverty alleviation and empowerment of all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be brief, I only wish to speak on one SOE, namely Fiji Development 
<br/>Bank  Nominees  Limited.    The  Fijian  Government  through  the  Ministry  had  entered  into  a 
<br/>management  agreement  with  FDB  Nominees  Limited,  to  provide  managerial  operations  for  Fiji 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>437 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment  Corporation  Limited  (FICL).    The  Report  states  there  are  some  of  $373,750  which 
<br/>remains outstanding from FICL to FDB Nominees Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is now incomplete information and I must set the record straight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that 
<br/>the outstanding amount has been settled and was settled in April 2019. Unfortunately, this was not 
<br/>reported but nonetheless, I am happy to say that this is no longer an issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  took  some  time.    Since  the  Ministry  has  FICL,  the  Secretariat  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>undertaking due diligence before the payments were actually made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to give you a quick update on FICL for the benefit of everyone. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know it has just been raised by honourable Tuisawau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the new Board in place, FICL has collected and recovered debts amounting to about 
<br/>$4.2 million, and they are basically addressing governance issues that they have, such as preparation 
<br/>of outstanding Financial Statements and advertising for a General Manager position, which is to be 
<br/>filled soon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the vision of enhancing FICL’s operation, it is evident that the Board is actually focused 
<br/></span><span>on its corporate governance structure to provide constructive solutions and unlock some investment 
<br/>opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the best interest of FICL, the Board Directors are actually dynamic professionals from the 
<br/>private sector associations, such as the Fiji Chamber of Commerce, Fiji Commerce and Employers 
<br/>Federation, Women in Business and Fiji Institute of Accountants, to provide more sound decisions 
<br/>in the overall operations and strategic direction on all investment projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is pretty much my submission for this particular motion.  I thank you, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of points I would like to raise 
<br/>very quickly but before I do talk about the entities themselves, unfortunately, honourable Nawaikula 
<br/>did not disclose to Parliament that he actually has a case against FBC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, he was told by the Court to pay a cost of $3,000, which he is yet to pay.  Perhaps, 
<br/>that is why he went on a diatribe against FBC.  Public statements have been made, he did not declare 
<br/></span><span>that.  He said he feels that the auditors said that it should not be treated as revenue.  You do not feel 
<br/></span><span>those things, you know those things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have got the statement here of FBC, prior to 2007.  They were also given 
<br/>grants,  and  they  also  treated  it  as  revenue  and  they  also  continuously  made  losses.  Honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau, you are obsessed with FBC, you go and look at the records.  I have got their accounts here, 
<br/>a loss of $1 million, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At one point in time, CFL was given the Public Service Broadcast Licence, they could only 
<br/>retain it for one year, it went back to FBC.  When you come to Parliament, you need to know the 
<br/>historical facts and the legacy issues, before you, sort of, go on this diatribe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  honourable  Usamate  very  aptly  summarised  issues  with  Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji (WAF), but I would like to point out to honourable Aseri Radrodro that some of 
<br/>those matters that he had raised, unfortunately, that are not here, in fact, took place with the former

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>CEO  who  became  the  SODELPA  candidate.    There  were  issues  there,  of  course,  we  need  to 
<br/>continuously approve it and I will get back as to why we do audits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audits are carried out so that we can improve the system.  Audits are carried out so that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can identify where the gaps are, where the loopholes are and let us fix it up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have here notes that were not prepared by me, but  given to me by the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary for Economy and his team leading Treasury.  They have highlighted to me the 
<br/>reasons why they have huge issues with the Auditor-General, and I would like to read that out, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“There  has  been  major  delays  in  the  finalisation  of  audit  reports  with  various 
<br/>Government Agencies and Statutory Bodies.  The Office of the Auditor-General has been 
<br/>blaming Agencies for the delays due to incomplete information.  But most Agencies we 
<br/>talked to have submitted reports on time, and yet there has been major delays from the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General.  There seems to be no intention to expedite things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To clear the backlog, why can’t the OAG get these outsourced where Agencies 
<br/></span><span>can  pay  the  external  auditor,  while  the  audit  opinion  is  issued  by  OAG?    These  are 
<br/></span><span>reputable  independent  firms  and  the  argument  by  OAG  on  lack  of  independence  is 
<br/>nonsense.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the OAG seems to be politically aligned, drinking grog with a number of Opposition 
<br/>Members.  Why couldn’t they do audit for two or three years together to clear the backlog?  Once 
<br/>the backlog is cleared, there could be timely audits and timely debate in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been surprised  that while there have been so many reports pending, the OAG is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>spending a lot of its efforts in doing audits in areas, such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Access to Persons with Disability;  
<br/>Progress on Sustainable Development Goals, of which they have no expertise, a year after 
<br/>the SDGs were put out;   
<br/>Food ration distribution, whilst it is being done;  
<br/>MSME concessional loans, whilst it is being given out and 
<br/>The unemployment assistance we gave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carrying out the performance audit on low priority areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, means that the 
<br/></span><span>OAG’s resources could have been better utilised in resourcing clearing audit backlogs.   Delays in 
<br/>reports have affected our relationship with development partners, this is unacceptable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have, in the past, been commenting on fiscal policy issues, commenting on debt, size of 
<br/>deficit,  expenditure  composition,  source  of  borrowing,  et  cetera.    The  OAG  does  not  have  the 
<br/>expertise on fiscal policy matters, nor is it allowed by law to do so.  Quite specifically, it says here, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, “Nothing in this Section entitles the Auditor-General to question the merit of policy 
<br/>objectives of the Government.  In this Section, policy objectives include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Government policy direction of a Minister; 
<br/>A policy statement and a budget paper; 
<br/>A Statement Objectives in a Corporate Plan approved by a Minister; and 
<br/>Any other document evidencing a policy decision of the Government or a Minister.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>439 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  went  on  to  say,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  the  OAG  gets  into  talking  about  the  policy, 
<br/>whether it is right or wrong. That is not their scope.   Parliament approves the Budget and Government 
<br/>policies, not OAG.  “No proper audit processes are followed. No proper entry and exit meetings.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even I know this work in the private sector.  Whenever you get an audit done, the Auditor-
<br/>General or person carrying out the audit will come and have what we call an entry interview with the 
<br/>people they are going to audit. Then you have an exit interview. That is always done, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  This Auditor-General, the one whose term has just finished, has refused to come to this meeting, 
<br/>hardly present in any of the meetings.  Management letters are changed and issued after exit meetings. 
<br/>No clear and proper criteria. They come with audits in the middle of programmes, like MSME Loans 
<br/>Scheme, COVID assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General is also auditing in certain areas without any real expertise. 
<br/>Nowhere in the world is an Office of the Auditor-General auditing the progress on SDGs.  They have 
<br/>no expertise. Yes, exactly, look at the quality of it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Almost  every  agency  will  tell  that  the  Auditor-General  as  the  Administrator,  Head  of  the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General hardly attended meetings.  The OAG is not interested to collaborate 
<br/></span><span>and resolve issues. They like to sensationalise issues, most of the time, for the wrong reasons.  Have 
<br/></span><span>they ever clarified all the misrepresentations in the media?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an independent body, that is their responsibility to do so. They have always allowed things 
<br/>to be politicised.  His wiping boy, Anish Chand and now Vijay Narain, all of these people are wiping 
<br/>people into a frenzy.  The OAG never comes and clarifies that.  The OAG has been more concerned 
<br/>with the quantity of audit issues raised in the management letter than with the quality.  This is from 
<br/>their technical people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight some of the issues that were raised by some of the 
<br/>Members on the other side.  Honourable Professor Prasad talked about the ADB Report and poverty. 
<br/>He did not mention about the Poverty Report prior to that.   What was the poverty rate in 2004 and 
<br/>2006?  He  did  not  talk  about  the  social  wages  that  is  actually  now  being  paid,  things  like  free 
<br/>education.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is, none of the honourable Members on the other 
<br/>side spoke about the actual financial performance on many of these entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>AFL has been giving dividends of about $40 million. No one talked about that. No one talked 
<br/>about the fact that Tropik Wood has now been giving on a year in year out bonuses to the landowners.  
<br/></span><span>That has never been done before.  No one talked about the clearing of their debts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited, Mr. Speaker, Sir, never made a profit until 2007-2008.  
<br/>Honourable Bulanauca knows this.  They had a debt stock of $24 million  and that debt is almost 
<br/>finished.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tropik Wood has paid up all of its previous debts outstanding since 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The FBCL has paid its debt three years before year end last year, a complete debt 
<br/>repayment, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  talked  about  Walesi.  The  Walesi  Chairperson  spoke  to  us.    They  have  given  their 
<br/>account to the OAG for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 Accounts. The OAG said, “I do not have the time 
<br/>to do it at the moment.”  So, Honourable Qereqeretabua goes in the media and says, “Oh, they have 
<br/>not given their audit report.” They have presented their accounts to them.  The OAG is the one who 
<br/>has not presented it.

<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can go on about that.  The other point is, no one talked about Fiji Ports 
<br/>Corporation Limited (FPCL).  How the Port turnaround times have been approved by 30 percent.  
<br/>Before the reforms to FPCL, shipping companies used to charge a levy on bringing containers to Fiji 
<br/>because the Port was so inefficient. They have to hang out in the Port because they had to burn their 
<br/>fuel so they usually charge a levy, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  These are the reforms that have taken place, 
<br/>these are the improvements in the state-owned entities but none of them mentioned that because it 
<br/>does not suit their narrative, you see.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau when I said to him at the lunch break, I said let us hurry along, let us 
<br/>get on to other subject matters, he goes well, it is election time, they can talk about it.  See, this is the 
<br/>whole posturing that is  taking place, the whole posture is  to try and create some kind  of disquiet 
<br/>amongst the public yet they have not been armed with facts … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nobody, nobody! Nobody has denied that of course there is 
<br/></span><span>some organisations there have been untoward behaviour.  There have been things that need to be 
<br/></span><span>improved.  We have never said that.  In fact this Government has always been, whenever they have 
<br/>identified any problem, someone has done something wrong, no hesitation in removing people, where 
<br/>it has the powers to do so.  No hesitation in doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We did the reforms in the legal fraternity.  Lawyers who were there for donkey’s years have 
<br/>been barred for life because of nicking other people’s money, poor people’s money.  We have no 
<br/>hesitation whatsoever Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, again, all of these issues are being raised without context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would like to mention, you know they went on as if 
<br/>you  know  now  honourable  Biman  Prasad  went  on  about  this  cabal  and  all  these  people,  the 
<br/>sycophants et cetera.  We know who is the real cabal or sycophant.  He did not mention the fact that 
<br/>Rabuka walked into the head office of NBF … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- </span><span>Areh!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, this is a fact.  NBF, got Makarava from the Samabula 
<br/>branch,  gunpoint  and  removed  him  and  made  him  a  National  Bank  of  Fiji  manager.    He  did  not 
<br/></span><span>mention that.  He did not mention that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Do not hold it up.  That is the fact.  You see unfortunately 
<br/>your political fortunes, honourable Gavoka make a note of this, that man is tied to the man you want 
<br/>to have a debate with.  His political fortunes are tied with him.  …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we let the men sort themselves out then 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come and debate with us.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We will see who is  the man.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a branch 
<br/>manager was made the National Bank of Fiji manager. We had ministers in that report you will know.  
<br/>We had ministers writing hand written notes to people saying give them a loan and we know who are 
<br/>the people who got the loans.  People of that cabal Mr. Speaker, Sir, you see he is obsessed with the 
<br/>chairman but what happened with the operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened with the operations of the National Bank of Fiji?  We lost our national bank.  
<br/>We have now gained a bank that is a 100 per cent Fijian-owned, Home Finance Company (HFC).  
<br/>That is the reality.  The Report does talk about how drum kit sets were given as security for $200,000 
<br/>- $300,000.  Honourable Lalabalavu, I do not know whether you were a beneficiary or somebody 
<br/>else’s beneficiary.  There are many beneficiaries such as that.  There were many people who benefited 
<br/>from it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Cheap shot! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a very good shot.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the fact of the matter is this.  We had board members who were appointed then because they were 
<br/>actual sycophants, handful of people, very few female representation on boards, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/>Very few female representation, honourable Radrodro make a note of this.  One of them of course 
<br/>had one of his companies sell a wall clock to Post Fiji and he was the Chairman.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Oh, I wonder who they are.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Beneficiary  in  Fiji  Times,  run  away  to  Australia  on  the 
<br/>second charge, never to come back because he has written notes.  I have seen it with my eyes Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to our honourable Prime Minister saying get those charges withdrawn … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I think the Acting Prime Minister is doing the same thing that 
<br/>he was accusing me.  He is actually attacking somebody who is not in Parliament.  I was saying the 
<br/>same thing.  I actually had the reports.  He may well be right in pointing that out.  I am not saying 
<br/>that you know the information that he is giving but I was exactly doing the same thing, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  because  it  is  in  the  interest  of  transparency  and  good  governance.    The  chairman  of  the 
<br/>commission of inquiry was responsible for the collapse of the NBF and he ignored the advice of the 
<br/>Auditor-General.  That is exactly what I was saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, thank you very much.  I was demonstrating the fact that 
<br/>these things actually took place then. They are trying to make it as if it is not.  It is a fact.   The person 
<br/>was charged, convicted and sent to prison. It is a fact and he has now absconded from the law and it 
<br/>is a fact that we have seen the letter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I would also like to make and the only reason, Sir, that 
<br/>I raised with honourable Prasad about the Commission of Inquiry because the law quite clearly says 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>442 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-2017-18 Audit Report on GCCs, CSA, &amp; SAs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, under section 16 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, it says any person who uses a threatening or 
<br/>insulting language to the commission or to a commissioner or to the secretary at any sitting of the 
<br/>commission or to a commissioner or to the secretary at any time or place in relation to or an account 
<br/>of his or her proceedings in the capacity of the commissioner or secretary is guilty of an offence and 
<br/>upon  conviction  shall  be  liable  to  a  fine  not  exceeding  $200.00,  this  needs  to  be  updated,  or  to 
<br/>imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.  I am actually helping you out honourable Prasad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, no, I am saying just in case you get all excited and say 
<br/>it outside Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact of the matter is this.  They are again saying that we 
<br/>have  this  cabal  of  people  et  cetera,  and  that  we  are  always  trying  to  victimise  people  who  speak 
<br/>against us.  Not true!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Women has farmed out work to the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre.  The head 
<br/>of the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre has been making all sorts of allegations against the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, myself, against Government, all types of gratuitous comments, yet we did not stop 
<br/>the work that she is getting, they are getting about $200,000 worth of work in budget.  It is approved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we were vindictive, we would have stopped it but we are not because they perform a good 
<br/>role in terms of managing the phone line.  That is the mandate.  It is nonsensical to say that.  We 
<br/>know  honourable  Prasad’s  affiliations  with  various  engineers.    They  are  probably  funding  his 
<br/>political party but they still get contracts with Government.  They go through a proper tender process, 
<br/>they  get  approved  but  we  do  not  actually  stop  them  from  getting  it  because  we  are  very  much 
<br/>transparent about it.  We are not politically motivated.  They always bring this issue about political 
<br/>motivation.  If that was the case, we would have stopped that.  You know who I am talking about, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact of the matter, again there were numerous instances that I can talk about.  Strategic 
<br/>Air Services Limited (SASL) set up before they split up Airports Fiji Limited (AFL).  That time it 
<br/>was Fiji Airports, split it up, SASL, guess what happened.  We lost vast tracts of the air space that 
<br/>we used to manage before.  We lost it to New Zealand and Australia because SASL was set up.  What 
<br/>happened after that?  It is gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ATH shares were sold at inflated price just to prop up Government revenue 
<br/>for that particular year.  Narube now claims that he did it. The fact of the matter is, it was sold at over 
<br/></span><span>exorbitant price just to make the Government look good.  It was a one-off surplus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again I would like to point out, the last comment I would like to make.  The 
<br/>salaries and work conditions of civil servants and other entities that Government is related to, the 
<br/>salaries  have  increased  significantly.    Someone  made  a  statement  about  nurses,  land  surveyors, 
<br/>doctors have all had huge pay rises compared to what they used to get. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The meal allowances, they used to get $9.00, we increased it to $20.00.  It has come down to 
<br/>$10.00 because of COVID-19 and they appreciate that because we did not give any pay cuts.  We 
<br/>did not do any pay cuts, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So, the point of the matter is honourable Nawaikula did 
<br/>not declare his interest.  This is the level of debate we are seeing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contributions.  
<br/>If we want to make some substantive contributions, let us be honest about it, intellectually be honest 
<br/>about it and let us know what happened in the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>8</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>443 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are many issues, for example.  Yes we agree.  We are on record for saying that the move from 
<br/>Public Works Department,  the Water and Sewerage Department  in  the Public Works Department 
<br/>could have been done better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) from Department of National Roads, metamorphosed into 
<br/>FRA was done a lot better than WAF.  There are legacy issues and they are being addressed as the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  had  highlighted.  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  accept  audit  reports  if  it  is  done 
<br/>objectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We accept criticism if people do not file the accounts on time, we accept that. But let us come 
<br/>to this Parliament with clean hands.  If you know that the accounts have been submitted but OAG is 
<br/>delaying it, do not say that it is the fault of the entities.  And we need to take audit reports on the 
<br/>value that it gives us and that is how do we identify the gaps, how do we fix it so next year it does 
<br/>not happen.  That should be really the role of the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The role of the Auditor-General is go to these ministries and say look guys we identified duh, 
<br/>duh, duh  because of these issues.  Let us work together with you to see that it does not happen again 
<br/>because it is taxpayers’ funds, not for it to be used for political purposes.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/></span><span>like to thank the Committee for the report. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. A. MAHARAJ.- Thank you, Sir.  I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note the content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying  with  the Standing 
<br/>Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to 
<br/>move a Suspension Motion.
