<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, each Member may speak for up to 10 minutes with 
<br/>a  10-  minute  response  by  the  Minister  or  Minister’s  responsible  for  the  subject  matter  of  the 
<br/>Member’s speech. No seconder is required and there will be no other debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we are now set for the first speaker and I now call on the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Professor Biman Prasad to deliver his End of Week Statement.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deduction of Bundle Insurance from Cane Payment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, this is about the earnest plea from cane growers 
<br/>for Government and sugar authorities to correct what they rightly belief is in justice done to them. 
<br/>That is the wrong deduction of funds for bundle insurance form their final cane payment for 2020 
<br/>season  in  October  2021  without  their  knowledge  and  authority.    We  all  know  the  importance  of 
<br/>insurance and we all want insurance be it life, medical crop, property, et cetera, but the manner in 
<br/>which the deduction was done is tantamount to fraud. It gets worse – this enforcement and deduction 
<br/>for  the  bundle  insurance  was  done  without  the  growers’  knowledge  nor  was  it  shown  on  their 
<br/>statements of payment which contained all other deductions but not this. The question is why.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last October, growers received only $12.05 cents per tonne as fourth payment 
<br/>when the actual payment should have been $14.99 per tonne. This means growers were short changed 
<br/>by $2.94 per tonne and  received only  $82.06 per tonne for the 2020 season,  despite Government 
<br/>boasting that it had guaranteed a price of $85 per tonne. Similar to the shortfall of $2.79 per tonne 
<br/>from the total proceeds paid for the 2019 season, growers were betrayed and have every right to feel 
<br/>that they were cheated by the stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What makes this fraudulent, Mr. Speaker, is the fact that the scheme is voluntary. It also does 
<br/>not cover growers who are over the age of 65 years and at least that is what one learns from reading 
<br/>the material about the scheme put out by Fiji Care.  This is not an authorised deduction permitted by 
<br/>the  Master  Award  as  well.  Consent  has  to  be  obtained  from  growers.    The  Sugar  Cane  Growers 
<br/>Council, Chief Executive Officer since his appointment last year has never defended the rights of 
<br/>growers instead, vociferously promoting anti-grower measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the annual premium for the $10,000 cover is $52 for $1 per week, but all 
<br/></span><span>growers  who  harvested  over  141tonnes  of  cane  in  2020  had  more  than  $52  deducted  from  their 
<br/></span><span>proceeds and 30 per cent of growers who are above average producers have collectively lost several 
<br/>thousands of dollars.  For example, Mr. Speaker, Sur, if a grower harvested 500 tonnes, he or she had 
<br/>$185 deducted from the proceeds. If the grower harvested 1,000 tonnes, he or she lost $370.  In total, 
<br/>more than $600,000 was deducted from all cane growers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is sickening, Mr. Speaker. Sir.  How many growers signed up for the scheme in the last 
<br/>three years?  No one knows and we have not been told.  Who authorised the Fiji Sugar Corporation 
<br/>to make the deductions?  Was it the Council?  If it was, what powers has an unelected council’s CEO 
<br/>have to heap financial misery on all growers, a vast majority of whom have not opted for the scheme. 
<br/>And worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why  was not  the deduction reflected on the statements provided to 
<br/>growers?  Why was this deliberately hidden from growers?  Similarly, why were deductions from 
<br/>industry  costs  and  Sugar  Research  Institute  not  shown  on  the  statement  provided  to  growers?  
<br/>Irrespective of whether it was deducted at source from growers’ share of proceeds, it should have 
<br/>reflected in the statements. This is the norm.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 747 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, this is fraudulent.  It is a racket where unsuspecting growers 
<br/>without their knowledge and agreement, have actually been overpaid for something they do not know 
<br/>about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An act of fraud committed by unelected Council and its CEO, who do not seem to give a 
<br/>damn  to  growers.    Yet  the  unelected  CEO  thought  the  deduction  was  reasonably  fair  because 
<br/>Government topped-up cane payments by what he claimed was $156.5 million since 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a case of trying to use one’s good deeds or assistance in the past to 
<br/>justify an illegal act.  His warped logic simply means, Government’s assistance to growers in terms 
<br/>of cane payment top-ups or subsidies provides the basis to fleece growers of their hard-earned money 
<br/>and it is almost like a sick joke.  In normal times, it would be a matter of great bewilderment to see 
<br/>the CEO of an organisation representing the largest and most important stakeholders of the sugar 
<br/>industry, shirking his or her primary role of protecting growers’ rights and interests.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  know  that  these  are  not  normal  times.    An  elected  Sugar  Cane 
<br/>Growers  Council,  which  used  to  be  the  umbrella  representative  body  of  growers,  has  been 
<br/>demolished by the previous Bainimarama-led Government and now the FijiFirst Government.  The 
<br/>CEO is no longer appointed by a legitimately constituted and democratically elected Council’s Board 
<br/>of Directors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The latest instalment of a decision that has siphoned hard-earned money of growers is  yet 
<br/>another example of how complete lack of transparency and accountability has gutted the industry 
<br/>that was Fiji’s economic lifeblood for more than a century. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  say  again,  this  was  not  an  authorised  deduction  permitted  under  the 
<br/>provisions of the Sugar Master Award.  It, therefore,  requires the consent of growers.   It is not a 
<br/>special project, as claimed by the Government controlled Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Cane Growers Council, after being exposed, started singing a different tune.  They 
<br/>said growers are covered.  For argument’s sake, let us assume he is right or the Council is right, but 
<br/>what is not right at all and the CEO and the Council know, is the manner in which the deductions 
<br/>were made.  It is beyond justification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happens to deductions in access of the annual premium of $52?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $185, 
<br/>for example, covers more than three-yearly premiums and $370 covers more than seven premiums.  
<br/>Does it mean that the coverage amount will increase beyond $10,000?  I do not think so, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why is there silence from the Fijian Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) on this 
<br/>fleecing  of  growers  in  terms  of  deduction?    The  FCCC’s  CEO  is  extremely  quick  to  defend  the 
<br/>exorbitant increase in the price of sugar manufactured by FSC and he has, time and again, ventured 
<br/>into attacking politicians and waded into politics.  But when it comes to doing the job required of 
<br/>FCCC, the CEO has actually zipped his mouth in terms of protecting growers from this fraudulent 
<br/>act.  What a shame, Mr. Speaker, Sir! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Sugar Industry Tribunal certifies cane payments and we all know that, 
<br/>but suddenly the role of the Tribunal for the sugar industry has now really become a secondary issue.  
<br/>Previously, it was a full time role.  The Sugar Industry Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would know, is a 
<br/>product of negotiation between the late Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and the former leader of the NFP, 
<br/>Sidiq Moidin Koya, in 1984.  It was an Act of bipartisanship.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  was  established  as  a  quasi-government,  meaning  the  sugar  industry  had  its  own 
<br/>mechanisms, independent of government influence.  But not anymore, the industry is now micro-
<br/>managed by the current Government and being run to the ground.  This brings me to the use of legacy 
<br/>that Government has harped about throughout the week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, no amount of squeaking like a rat and calling me and the NFP anything and 
<br/>everything will change one irrefutable fact of an industry that has slid into life support under this 
<br/>Government.  Here, I am referring to the remarks made by honourable Koya on Wednesday.  He 
<br/>invoked the names of NFP founders - A.D. Patel and S.M. Koya, saying they would be turning in 
<br/>their graves because I was supporting someone who destroyed the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  me  tell  honourable  Koya,  the  late  Siddiq  Moidin  Koya  may  be  turning  in  his  grave 
<br/>because the Minister’s wholesome support for a Government that has actually destroyed the sugar 
<br/>industry.  This fraudulent deduction of proceeds for bundle insurance is an example of this, and I am 
<br/>talking about the late S.M. Koya’s vision of the Sugar Cane Growers Council of which he was the 
<br/>first  Chairman,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  umbrella  democratic  body  of  growers  abolished  by  the  same 
<br/>Government that honourable Koya now supports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  their  leadership,  poverty  amongst  growers  and  their  families  have  been  increased 
<br/>because from a crop size of 3.2 million tonnes and 300 tonnes of sugar in 2006, Mr. Speaker, the 
<br/>industry’s last season produced only 1.4 million of tonnes of cane and less than 135,000 tonnes of 
<br/>sugar.  Even the Acting Prime Minister knows this and he has commented twice about the meagre 
<br/>incomes of growers in the last seven months, and we agree with it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if honourable Minister Koya wants justice for cane growers, he should tell his 
<br/>leaders to do the right thing,  immediately correct the injustice heaped on growers by refunding those 
<br/>growers who had more than $52 premium deducted from their proceeds.  This would be in conformity 
<br/>to the vision and principles of two of the finest Statesmen, whose names the honourable Minister 
<br/>invoked in vain.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the Honourable Member for his End of the Week Statement. I now 
<br/>call on the Acting Prime Minister and Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, Civil Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development for his response.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will not get into the areas, nor respond to 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad other meanderings but I will get to the facts.   Under  section  52(1)  of 
<br/>the Sugar Industry Act 1984states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Council shall have power to raise a special levy from time to time to meet the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cost of any capital project of the Council or for any other special purpose.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Council exercised its powers bestowed in section 52 of the 
<br/>Sugar industry Act 1984, and made the decision to set up a dedicated platform to raise the total levy 
<br/>of approximately $600,000 which is annually $52 per grower or $1 per week for all active registered 
<br/>growers and the deduction to be made from the growers’ share proceeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Council  made  a  submission  for  insurance  deduction  to  the  Sugar 
<br/>Industry Tribunal, who has the authority to approve and issue certifications under its powers vested 
<br/>in  section 53 of the Sugar  Industry  Act  1984. So the  Tribunal actually  gave the  authority  for the 
<br/>Council to make this deduction, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>749  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to-date claims of $1.8 million have been made by the farmers and, indeed, 
<br/>has been paid.  Sir, 912 sugarcane farmers or their families have received benefits for death, funeral, 
<br/>fire and personnel accident claims.  The insurance cover is: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Funeral   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Death 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fire  
<br/>Personal Accident  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$1,000; 
<br/>$3,000; 
<br/>$3,000;  and 
<br/>$3,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  similar  bundle  insurance  is  also  offered  to  dairy  farmers,  copra  farmers  and  one  other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>category of farmers and I think it is also the rice farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad claims that it is a fraud, if he believes it is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fraud and he has got evidence of a fraud, please, report it to the Police or report it to FICAC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is honourable Professor Prasad’s election year, so he has 
<br/>gone about and this is precisely the point I was trying to make the other day, Sir, when you have a 
<br/>lot of farmers - 43 per cent cutting less than 100 tonnes of cane a year, they have meagre earnings, 
<br/>despite the fact that we have guaranteed price of $85. A lot of them are carrying on because of the 
<br/>lease issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  people  are  the  most  vulnerable  when  unscrupulous  politicians  like  honourable 
<br/>Professor Prasad, go and make all these disquiet amongst them, saying, “You are being exploited. 
<br/>This Government is doing x, y and z, therefore, you are in this position.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  want  to  response  to  every  single  line  he  has  mentioned.  He,  again,  has  misled 
<br/>Parliament in respect of the payments that were made. He is saying, “Despite the $85 a tonne”, he 
<br/>does not talk about all the other assistance that is also being given to farmers on top of the $85 a 
<br/>tonne.  He does not mention that at all. He does not mention at all that this would lead to stability and 
<br/>confidence to the farmers that at the end of the day, they will get $85 a tonne.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of the farmers are actually happy about the sugar price increase, in the sense that there 
<br/>is a guarantee and an increased income for them.  As we have mentioned yesterday, Sir, with the 
<br/>increase in price with the 70:30 split of the sugarcane price increase, Sir, this frees up more money 
<br/>for Government to be able to then give further assistance.  In fact, a number of farmers have said to 
<br/>us, “Can you please bring back or increase the new cane funding that you gave us”, which we had 
<br/>cut down a bit last year because of COVID-19.  We said, “As soon as the economy picks up, we will 
<br/></span><span>be able to do so”, as I have also mentioned  yesterday, Sir, but he just failed to address that.  We 
<br/></span><span>would  have  thought  that,  that  is  what  he  would  address.    The  challenge  is  because  of  the  global 
<br/>situation we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have mentioned, 90 per cent of the fertilizers in the world is made by China and some 
<br/>of it by Russia.   A bag  of fertilizer, Sir, is  currently costing  about  $44 or $45  a bag because the 
<br/>farmers only pay $20 which the Government subsidises, is likely to go up to $80 to $90 a bag.  He is 
<br/>not mentioning that, he is not talking about that, the impact on the farmers and how Government 
<br/>perhaps, needs to step into that space. We already had discussions with the Chairman of FSC, with 
<br/>the Cane Growers Fund and the Council too, to be able to see what we can do because otherwise, it 
<br/>will affect the next season, it will affect their bottom line.  These are the critical fundamental issues 
<br/>affecting farmers, not playing politics like he is doing Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he also goes on about the democratically elected Council.  Sir, there used 
<br/>to be 38 councillors.  All those councillors used to be elected and we saw the shenanigans that went 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on when we actually had the amendments, he knows that.  At one time, some members of the Council 
<br/>were invited for an overseas trip and because some were elected under the Labour ticket, NFP ticket, 
<br/>some other ticket, that was what used to happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the sugarcane fields, people were flying different political party flags and just to get elected 
<br/>to a Council.  When they went to the Council, because they could not agree as to who should go 
<br/>overseas or represent the Council, all 36 of them went overseas. Guess who funded it?  The cane 
<br/>growers funded it themselves because they have money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Professor B.C. Prasad interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, the Council in  terms  of their 
<br/>representation, it is appointed by the Minister and it consists of nine members - one member from 
<br/>Government, Commissioner Western and Commissioner Northern, and six growers - two from each 
<br/>cane producer association.  The six growers are members of the Cane Producers Association. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Cane Producer Association members are elected by the growers from 
<br/>their  own  local  district.    So,  the  people  who  actually  come  to  the  Council,  come  from  the  Cane 
<br/>Producers Association who, in turn, are actually elected by the cane farmers themselves.  He does 
<br/>not tell us that, he is not being upfront about that. He deliberately misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, in the representation, of course, we have the Commissioner Northern 
<br/>and  Commissioner  Western  involved  in  that.    As  honourable  Seruiratu  highlighted,  thanks  to 
<br/>honourable Nawaikula who had met Mr. Qarikau in those days, we saw vast areas of land leases not 
<br/>being renewed purely for political reasons.  Those vast areas of land are still left vacant.  In order to 
<br/>be able to instil and engender and get landowners to understand that this is good for the economy if 
<br/>they were to lease it, if they do not want use the land themselves, they have worked very closely with 
<br/>the Commissioner Western and Commissioner Northern to get leases renewed and a lot of farmers 
<br/>are actually grateful for it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government actually pays 4 per cent on top of the 6 per cent UCV to iTLTB directly for 
<br/>it to go the landowners for renewal of cane farmer leases.  All of these is being done.  This narrative 
<br/>about, “We brought the sugarcane industry to their knees.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also more internal issues, for example, if you go to most of the 
<br/></span><span>cane farms today, the historical basis of cane farms has been that if your father, your great grandfather 
<br/></span><span>is a farmer, you continue to be a cane farmer.  One or two of your brothers and sisters may go out 
<br/>and become a teacher or professor, et cetera, but they continued with the farming.  Nowadays, most 
<br/>of them do not want to do cane farming at all, very few young people want to get into cane farms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had highlighted the other day, we also now have the issue of cane cutters.  Many people 
<br/>gladly from Tailevu, et cetera, used to go and cut cane in the Western Division.  A lot of people do 
<br/>not want to do that now.  A few from the Yasawas’ and Mamanucas’ used to come and cut cane on 
<br/>Viti Levu.  They do not want to do that, the hotel industry is there now, they want to work there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the critical logistical issues within the sugarcane industry itself, which he 
<br/>fails to pick up on.  He is talking about a $52 a year, $1 a week insurance premium Sir.  Never before 
<br/>have cane farmers had this type of assistance given to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>751  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also mentioned, Sir, that those over the age of 65 years do not get cover.  They do get 
<br/>cover, the only cover that those over 65 years do not get is the death cover because the risk becomes 
<br/>higher.  If the risk becomes higher, then the premium will go higher. So, in order to mitigate against 
<br/>the risk, Sir, anyone over the age of 65 years, their family gets $1,000 for funeral, they will get it for 
<br/>fire, they will get it for personal accident, they do not  just get it for death.   Anyone below the age 
<br/>of 65 years gets all of the four benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many people, many families and spouses have thanked this Scheme because they have now 
<br/>benefitted from it.  Imagine if you are earning about $3,000 a year, Sir, and your house burns down 
<br/>tomorrow, you actually get, at least, $3,000.  If your husband has been working, it is mainly men 
<br/>who work in the sugarcane fields and if he passes on below the age of 65 years, at least, you will get 
<br/>$3,000, something to live on and it is only for $1 a week, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  think  this  is  all  the  sort  of  political  posturing,  trying  to  create 
<br/>disquiet amongst the farmers.  We are doing all we can in respect of assisting the farmers and, of 
<br/>course, we need to look at the holistic picture in terms of the way forward, not just for those who 
<br/>actually want to continue with sugarcane farming, but those who, indeed, want to be able to look for 
<br/>other alternative source of livelihood and get security of tenure for land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contact Teaching – Readiness of Schools 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Cabinet,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable 
<br/>colleagues</span><span>, ni sa bula vinaka saka. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My End of Week Statement is on the state of readiness of our schools for contact teaching 
<br/>with early childhood and primary school students joining their high school counterparts this week in 
<br/>returning  to  face-to-face  classes.    We,  parents,  grandparents,  Government,  teachers  and  students 
<br/>know that there are risks but we have to learn how to manage the risks to achieve our common goal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our schools shut down in April 2020 as the second wave crashed onto our shores, reopened 
<br/>in January and then closed as Omicron reached our shores, and reopened again this week, despite the 
<br/>worsening wave of the pandemic.  According to the honourable Minister for Education, most schools 
<br/>are  in  compliance  with  the  COVID-19  safety  protocols  and  they  have  introduced  COVID-19 
<br/>monitors in schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the key issue here is monitoring, compliance with safety protocols being 
<br/></span><span>observed by teachers and students.  I ask the honourable Minister, is the Ministry working closely 
<br/></span><span>with the Divisional Education Officers around the country to ensure this is being carried out?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the concern is that, children are effective spreaders of COVID-19 to vulnerable family 
<br/>members as according to the reports that we received.  In addition, those below the age of 12 years 
<br/>are  not  vaccinated  and  parents  have  raised  concerns  about  the  schools’  ability  to  enforce  social 
<br/>distancing for smaller classrooms or those that are crowded and they lack proper ventilation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is because of those reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that some parents refuse to send their children 
<br/>to school.  Moreover, the sudden lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on Monday this week came after 
<br/>health authorities stated on Tuesday, 25</span><span>th</span><span> January, just a mere two weeks ago that they will not advise 
<br/>the Government  to  lift  COVID-19  restrictions out  of fear of a resurgence of the pandemic.  This 
<br/>comes  amid,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  16  deaths  and  close  to  about  350  new  cases  as  reported  in  the 
<br/>community on that same week.  The Permanent Secretary for Health, Dr. James Fong, says the spike 
<br/>in cases was experienced after health restrictions were relaxed in November last year.

<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some parents and guardians take comfort in the Minister’s reassurance that 
<br/>teachers  are  trained  to  handle  any  child  who  is  not  feeling  well.    This  training  was  provided  to 
<br/>teachers by the Ministry of Health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, students, especially those with vulnerable family members at 
<br/>home  will  monitor  other  students.    Schools  that  have  good  protections  in  place  including  masks, 
<br/>teacher vaccinations, some sort of symptoms screening and good ventilation have been able to open 
<br/>successfully with very little disruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite these assurances, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the mindset of the new norm that COVID-19 
<br/>has brought about, many parents do not trust the authorities and prefer to see for themselves the data 
<br/>and  statistics  to  back  up  the  Minister’s  reassurances.    It  is  unfortunate,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  as 
<br/>Government  used  its  authority  and  various  measures  to  get  eye  vaccination  rates,  the  lack  of 
<br/>information  and  severe  controls  on  movements  and  unnecessary  curfews  for  almost  two  years 
<br/>decreased  the  people’s  trust  in  the  Government.    However,  I  acknowledge  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister has answered a few questions on the school reopening today, the more that she answers 
<br/>questions and informs parents and all stakeholders, the better.  But still, the Government has a long 
<br/>way to go to restore the people’s trust, even a new government to be elected this year will have to 
<br/>earn public trust in the government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Attorney-General said that hospitalisations were falling and 
<br/>the number of Fijians getting booster shots was rising every day and that it is time for a new direction, 
<br/>one that is guided by the same principles that our honourable Prime Minister set out and one that 
<br/>considers the lessons we have learnt, and one that recognises that while the pandemic is not over, it 
<br/>has entered a totally new face.  As much as we get to enjoy gatherings, sports and lifting of curfews, 
<br/>we have to question our safety and that of our children who are now going back to school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that regard Mr. Speaker, Sir, public health and cautionary principle must be the key word 
<br/>rather than rash, bullish decision making by leaders in particular those at the helm of Government.  
<br/>Much talk has been said about manning the school curriculum to suit the children who are returning 
<br/>to  school  after  staying  home  for  about  eight  months  and  this,  I  have  to  say,  as  alluded  to  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Education  this  morning,  when  she  said  that  the  Opposition  and  teacher 
<br/>unions are creating fear amongst our parents that it is not safe to send their children to school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we are concerned about is the safety of our students and in addition, 
<br/>also  the  curriculum  that  has  lost  its  plot.    A  basic  tenet  of  education  like  education  in  the  heart, 
<br/>education of the mind, education of the hand and importantly moral education are now not seen in 
<br/></span><span>our curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Teachers Association prior to the opening of schools for the ECE 
<br/>and Year 7 have been pushing for the restructure of the syllabus with the Ministry of Education to 
<br/>suit the circumstances that the students are currently faced with especially at this time.  It is also 
<br/>critical that those students who are left behind during the lockdown when schools were closed, and 
<br/>simply do not have the gadgets, laptops and tablets to participate in zoom classes, these students have 
<br/>to be considered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not need yet more disenfranchised children and youth.  The Ministry must make every 
<br/>effort to help them catch up.  Proper valuations must take place so they are given the assistance they 
<br/>need to catch up with the school work.  After all, Government always says that they leave no on 
<br/>behind, but it failed to answer how these students were assisted during the pandemic.  I do know of 
<br/>heroic teachers hiked mountains, crossed rivers and the seas to get their worksheets to the students.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>753  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the heart of teachers to reach the students, but this Government must prove it has also the 
<br/>heart to reach those who are left behind during the lockdown. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic not only caused deaths but also tested people’s trust in the 
<br/>medical  profession  and  modern  vaccines  in  order  to  protect  themselves  from  Coronavirus.    Civil 
<br/>servants, Sir, who refused to get vaccinated due to their personal beliefs were terminated from their 
<br/>employment based on the Government’s No Jab, No Job policy.  According to the President of the 
<br/>Fiji  College  of  General  Practitioners,  Dr.  Ram  Raju,  even  thrice  boosted  patients  are  dying  from 
<br/>COVID-19 and he is calling for the lifting of this policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He claimed that no medical research or data at international level had fully proved whether a 
<br/>partially vaccinated or fully vaccinated person had full immunity to any variant over the virus as the 
<br/>research was ongoing, the policy only served to deny Fijians the ability to provide for their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 344 teachers have been terminated because of the Government’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No Jab, No Job policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, just a Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  matter is  before the courts, he knows that very well  and he is  now talking  about  the 
<br/>merits and the demerits of the case. The matter is currently before the High Court, just to bring it to 
<br/>your attention and he is going about that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, take note of that.  It is before the courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Talking about separation of powers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.R.  LEAWERE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  total  of  344  teachers  have  been  terminated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because of Government’s No jab, No job policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE- That is the reality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.  WAQANIKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  may,    I  understand  where  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General is coming from. But this is a …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Under what order are you standing up on?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T. WAQANIKA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is not a </span><span>sub judice</span><span> matter, his 
<br/>only highlighting what the media is highlighting, so he can proceed on that.  The separation of powers 
<br/>is quite clear, he is just talking what is recorded in the media and we do not see any problem with 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir,  I disagree  with  that.  Come on, come on, have some

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, it is before the courts and you are reminded that it is 
<br/>before the courts, so do not touch it.  If you are touching being the thing and then you reminded that 
<br/>it is before the courts, leave it. Go on to something else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The same will also apply to students who 
<br/>have been double vaccinated although the latest variant appears to be mild for young people.  The 
<br/>cautionary principal and the public health must be the primary consideration.  My view, Sir, is that 
<br/>the Ministry to tread cautiously despite the loud voices in Cabinet to normalise everything, the health 
<br/>and safety of our students, the teachers and their families must be the paramount consideration in this 
<br/>reopening.  I thank you, Mr,. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to make this end of the week statement. 
<br/>To our teachers and students, remain vigilant, enjoy the resumption of school but remain cautious 
<br/>and watchful for each other and the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to honourable Leawere’s statement, 
<br/>let me first thank the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, my staff at the Ministry of Education, 
<br/>Heritage  and  Arts,  our  advisors  WHO  and  UNICEF  and  the  teams  who  have  tirelessly  worked 
<br/>towards the reopening of schools at all levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  closure  of  schools  in  April  2021,  the  Ministry  of  Education 
<br/>together  with  Heads  of  Schools,  teachers  and  school  management  committees  have  worked 
<br/>persistently towards maintaining continuity of learning and teaching remotely and putting in place 
<br/>COVID safe measures for face to face teaching.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  severity  of  the  Delta  variant  followed  by  Omicron  posed  extreme  challenges  to  all 
<br/>stakeholders  and  we  had  to  come  up  with  smart  solutions.  Despite  these  challenges  coupled  by 
<br/>negativity and misinformation as you have heard from honourable Leawere and there are many other 
<br/>politicians that we have, critics and teacher unions who were rampant on social media, the Ministry, 
<br/>Head of Schools and teachers remained steadfast in their preparation with innovative learning and 
<br/>teaching methods for the benefit of the students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  thing  I  just  cannot  understand  regarding  the  statement  made  by 
<br/>honourable Leawere, he is saying that many parents do not wish to send their children to school. I 
<br/>have just shared the survey that was carried out by UNICEF where 60 per cent of the parents are 
<br/>willing to send their children to school and also the data we have gathered on the attendance which I 
<br/>shared  with  House  this  morning  indicates  that  there  are  a  lot  of  parents  sending  their  children  to 
<br/>school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have given option to parents who are not willing to send their children, they can keep the 
<br/></span><span>children at home because perhaps they are willing to engage in home schooling, we have given that 
<br/>option to the parents. But what I do not understand, just because of handful of parents and union and 
<br/>the likes of honourable Leawere, these are the people who are trying to create that fear in our parents. 
<br/>I think you should just leave the decision to the parents.  I mean, who are you and I to tell what the 
<br/>parents should do?  The Government has made it clear that our schools are open, the doors are open, 
<br/>it is up to the parents whether they want to send their children or not.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government’s strategy for vaccine rollout ensured that our preparation 
<br/>for reopening of schools was possible.  We achieved the target rate of vaccination last year, which 
<br/>enabled us to make final preparation for reopening of schools.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were happy to 
<br/>note  that  our  decision  to  reopen  school  was  supported  by  the  majority  of  parents,  guardians  and 
<br/>teachers.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>755  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  honourable  Leawere  is  talking  about  is  an  old  story.    There  is  no 
<br/>rampant community transmission at this point in time.  The infection and hospitalisation rate is much 
<br/>lower, and the recovery rate is faster as well.  The active cases in our community today stands at 253.  
<br/>Community  transmission  is  not  rampant.    In  fact,  hospitalisation  numbers  were  falling  and  the 
<br/>number of Fijians getting booster shot was rising everyday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the data, the honourable Acting Prime Minister announced the 
<br/>lifting of a number of COVID-19 restrictions.  We need to get our economy going.  Dealing with this 
<br/>crisis  is  everyone’s business  but  we have some irresponsible people who do not  understand their 
<br/>responsibility in making sure that our children go back to school.  We are all in it together.  The effort 
<br/>will have to come from you, me and every Fijian.  My Ministry has made the Free Education Grant 
<br/>available to schools in a timely manner, which helped Heads of Schools and the school management 
<br/>committees to prepare schools based on COVID-Safe School Reopening Guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we need to understand is the fact that children are much safer in schools, not only in 
<br/>terms  of  COVID-19,  but  from  a  number  of  other  adversities  that  plague  them.    These  include, 
<br/>domestic  violence,  gender-based  violence,  violence  against  children,  child  labour,  teenage 
<br/>pregnancies, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two years, teenage pregnancy has increased in number. What is 
<br/>not addressed by the Members like honourable Leawere is, there are other threats that children face 
<br/>when they are away from school.  This is widely published with statistics and evidence from WHO, 
<br/>UNICEF and UNESCO.  The sad reality is that, we are divided on this critical matter, while the safety 
<br/>and future of our children is at stake.  How can we even think about keeping children home endlessly, 
<br/>just because COVID-19 is not going away?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to share with this House an email which I received from a mother, 
<br/>who argued why the school should reopen.  Let me read out this email to everyone, and I think the 
<br/>mother understands better than some of these critics: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“On behalf of the parents who are low income earners, especially, garment factory 
<br/>workers, the salesgirls, market vendors and many unclassified jobs, the school has been 
<br/>closed for more than 10 months and we are waiting for the school to open normally.  We 
<br/>want the school to open from kindergarten right up to Form Seven.  We are uneducated 
<br/>and teaching children at home is very hard.  We are unable to teach our children because 
<br/>we have studied up to Class six and eight only.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While some of our schools are taking online classes, it has been very hard to buy 
<br/></span><span>data and we have connection issues and when we receive hard copies, as we parents do 
<br/>not know what to teach because we ourselves are uneducated.  If the tourism is open, then 
<br/>why are you not opening the schools?  Parents are taking children to parks, shopping, and 
<br/>in  big  events,  such  as  weddings,  parties,  then  why  cannot  they  send  their  children  to 
<br/>school?  If parents do not want to send their children to school, then it is their right, but 
<br/>please think about us parents who are low income earners.  Also think about the canteen 
<br/>operators in school.  They are all at home, bus drivers, carrier drivers, taxis.  There must 
<br/>have been language teachers, support staff, handyman who might have been terminated 
<br/>due to school closure.  Think about them.  Also they are transporting children to and from 
<br/>schools, and some might have been earning a living through selling in school canteen.  
<br/>Madam, we depend on our teachers and respect them and we want them to teach them 
<br/>face to face.  Please, understand this.  COVID-19 virus is not leaving us, we have to get 
<br/>along with it.  Please, think about everyone, especially us.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Now, this mother understood the importance of sending the child to school and I just do not 
<br/>understand why honourable Leawere is not able to understand the basic logic of sending children to 
<br/>school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me reassure Parliament and the people of Fiji that we have prepared the 
<br/>schools well for reopening.  Exams will be completed and the catch-up that is required to be done 
<br/>before the 2022 academic year starts in April has actually begun. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the comments made by honourable Leawere, again, he is stuck on social 
<br/>distancing as I had highlighted in my response earlier on. And we have made it very clear that there 
<br/>has to be a number of measures that needs to be put into place, and we talked about multiple layers 
<br/>of measures that needs to be put into place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also found it interesting, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that honourable Leawere read only Dr. Raju’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>article in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>, and chose not to read Dr. Fong’s reply.  This is what he does in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on  the honourable Viam Pillay to deliver his Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour Standards in Various Employment Sectors in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity to deliver 
<br/>my  Statement  on  Labour  Standards  in  Various  Employment  Sectors  in  Fiji.    Labour  standards 
<br/>encompasses the minimum terms and conditions of employment stipulated under the Employment 
<br/>Relations Act 2007, which is enforced by the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial 
<br/>Relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Section  10  of  our  Constitution  under  the  Bill  of  Rights  guarantees  the 
<br/>freedom  from  slavery,  servitude,  forced  labour  and  human  trafficking.  In  promoting  fair  labour 
<br/>standards  to  various  sectors,  the  Health  and  Safety  at  Work  Act  1996  provides  clear  objectives, 
<br/>obligations and functions which cover every workplace in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 20 of our Constitution, further stipulates that every person has the 
<br/>right  to  fair  employment,  practices  including  humane  treatment  and  proper  working  conditions.  
<br/>Workers have the right to form or join a trade union and participate in activities and programmes, 
<br/>while  employers  have  the  right  to  form  or  join  an  employers’  organisation  to  participate  in  the 
<br/>activities and programmes. Trade unions and employers have the right to bargain collectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fijian  Government  has  ratified  the  international  Labour  Law  (ILO), 
<br/></span><span>fundamental and governance  conventions and technical conventions to ensure we meet proper labour 
<br/>standards  through  these  international  ratifications.    The  labour  reforms  implemented  by  our 
<br/>Government  has  given  us  the  right  platform  to  provide  fair  labour  standards  to  all  workers  and 
<br/>employers and ensures a good and fair discussions with the parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the labour inspection process within the two legislations of the Employment 
<br/>Relations Act 2007 and the Health and Safety at Work Act 1996, provides a modern approach in 
<br/>ensuring that labour standards are met in all workplaces through constant inspection and setting up 
<br/>of workplace committees, such as the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Committee and the 
<br/>Labour Management Consultation and Cooperation Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  ensures  that  workers  and  employers  get  together  for  a  roundtable 
<br/>discussion in improving employment conditions, safety issues and productivity at the workplace that 
<br/>will help the workers and employers better their performance and provide quality service delivery.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, minimum terms and conditions stipulated within the Employment Relations 
<br/>Act 2007 ensures that every employer in Fiji must provide their workers with minimum terms and 
<br/>conditions,  including  payment  of  annual  holiday,  sick  leave,  bereavement  leave,  maternity  leave, 
<br/>paternity leave and family care leave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these conditions are enforced by the Labour Inspectors through robust and 
<br/>targeted  labour  inspections  conducted  at  the  workplace,  to  ensure  fair  labour  practices  and  also 
<br/>encourage good faith employment relations between workers and their employers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, any breach of the Employment Relations Act 2007 are taken through the 
<br/>process stipulated within the legislations and if employers fail to ratify the breach within the given 
<br/>timeframe, then the matter is taken to the Employment Relations Tribunal for adjudication. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  effective  enforcement  and  compliance  of  the  minimum  terms  and 
<br/>conditions of employment under the Employment Relations Act 2007 is fundamental in ensuring that 
<br/>workers and employers understand their responsibility in dealing with employment matters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  various  industries  covered  through  the  enforcement  of  the  labour 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>standards are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Security services; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Building and civil; 
<br/>3.</span><span>

<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Wholesale and retail trades; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Road transport;

<br/>12.</span><span> </span><span>National minimum wages 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sawmilling and logging industry; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Health and Safety as Work Act 1996, the Occupational Health 
<br/>and Safety  Inspectors promote and maintain a working environment  which is  healthy  and safe to 
<br/>both, workers and employers, and directly contributes to the improved productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  through  a  robust  complaint  investigation  process,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Employment,  Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations,  through its labour standards services, ensures 
<br/>that workers whose complaints are lodged with the Ministry are investigated and workers are paid 
<br/>their rightful dues accordingly through compliance investigation process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the compliance mechanism in dealing with matters from the sectoral wages 
<br/>sector is important, and I note that the Labour Standard Services of the Ministry of Employment, 
<br/>Productivity  and  Industrial  Relations  is  working  towards  a  smarter  and  better  compliance  and 
<br/>enforcement plans, in  particular for the security industries, to  ensure issues related  are dealt with 
<br/>accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures put in by this Government through reform legislations has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provided a much needed boost in the employment relations arena, in ensuring that the labour 
<br/>standards across the industries in Fiji are benchmark to international standards and best practices.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a robust labour standard process will ensure that we secure social justice for 
<br/>all Fijians, and also provide a vibrant labour market, the best and level playing field for the employers 
<br/>and the workers to enter into negotiations, and continue to bargain in good faith for the best possible

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Minister  for  Employment,  Productivity,  Industrial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relations, Youth and Sports for his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the statement that has been made 
<br/>by honourable Viam Pillay in regards to the labour standards in various employment sectors in Fiji.  
<br/>Labour standards are key to employment growth, productivity and overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, returns 
<br/>to the economy and thus, the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the labour standard aims for equality among all 
<br/>sectors of the workforce in relation to the workplace and the rights, entitlements, and recourse to just 
<br/>practice.  These are key elements in ensuring a level playing field to all the stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the labour standard practice in Fiji have very much improved after the labour 
<br/>reform with the introduction of the Employment Relations Act 2007 with full implementation on 2</span><span>nd</span><span>
<br/>April, 2008, introduced under the Bainimarama-led Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  international  forefront,  the  Fijian  Government  has  ratified  39 
<br/>International Labour Organisation Conventions.  These ratifications has ensured that we are in par 
<br/>with our international obligations in meeting fair labour standards in Fiji, as we continue to advocate 
<br/>for better employment relations for all workers in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to achieve fair labour standards, Fiji became the second country 
<br/>in the world on 25th June, 2020 and the first in the Asia Pacific to ratify the ILO Convention 190 on 
<br/>Violence and Harassment in the Workplace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Convention is a powerful statement of human rights and one that will 
<br/>underpin  all  its  work  towards  equality  in  all  workplaces  with  a  harmonious  and  productive 
<br/>environment, free of violence and harassment. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Health and Safety at Work Act 
<br/>1996 also provides clear objectives, obligations and functions which covers every workplace with 
<br/>the aim to have a safe, secure and healthy workplace for everyone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the completion of the Ministry’s labour reform programme, we have 
<br/></span><span>taken the lead in ensuring that baselines are set for social protection and labour standards are accorded 
<br/>to  all  our  workers  and  this  fits  well  with  our  social  and  economic  needs.  In  addition,  it  has  also 
<br/>promoted good faith employment relations and ensure that best business and management practice 
<br/>are implemented in workplaces practice to improve the productivity in  a sustainable manner. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, this has been possible through the participation and goodwill of stakeholders with the 
<br/>nation and its progress at heart.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the Ministry and the other stakeholders continue to work on issues in good faith 
<br/>and  with  socio-economic  interest  of  workers,  employers,  industries  and  Fiji  as  a  whole  at  the 
<br/>forefront. Those who do not front up and stay away from these important consultations and processes 
<br/>are doing a disservice to their positions and the workers they claim to serve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the completion of the reforms of the employment relation laws and labour 
<br/>standards procedures in various sectors in Fiji has led to a significant improvement in employment 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relations and labour management discussions. This is evident in all areas of employment including 
<br/>discussion on productivity through the labour management consultation and co-operation framework.  
<br/>Having this in place is an important step in having the baseline security for all stakeholders so they 
<br/>can concentrate on productivity and growing their respective industries. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the labour 
<br/>standards  and  employment  relations  machinery  in  Fiji  works  in  line  with  our  policies  and 
<br/>programmes within the Employment Relations Act 2007.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In upholding the central principles of the Fijian Constitution to fairness and justice for all, 
<br/>this  has resulted in  improved employment relations with  a fair and just work environment  for all 
<br/>workers and employers that assist in job creation and economic growth. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new 
<br/>employment laws has seen a shift in the way we manage and resolve our conflicts in workplaces.  
<br/>This  is  through  the  enforcement  of  labour  standards  and  ensuring  that  the  employers  meet  the 
<br/>minimum terms and conditions of employment to be met by the employees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  all  in  all,  the  laws  of  labour  standard  were  gradually  modified  on  a 
<br/>piecemeal basis. The Government like those under Mr. Rabuka, Mr .Chaudhary and even Mr. Qarase 
<br/>failed to meet the challenges of the labour market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- It remained a mine field  to be used for political gains. However, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it was through this Government and the determination it had under the leadership of our 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister that the labour market, labour laws were reformed in Fiji.  Let there be 
<br/>no mistake, honourable Gavoka or mis-information about this.  The employment sector reform had 
<br/>been only possible with the vision and determination of this FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.P.K.BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the day before yesterday the honourable Acting Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  honourable  Minister  Koya  talked  about  </span><span>Business  Process  Outsourcing</span><span>  (BPO).  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the expansion at the BPO sector will also further enhance our labour standards. The 
<br/>employment legislation promotes good faith employment relation and productivity in the workplaces 
<br/>and social justice to all Fijians and encourages employers to enter into good faith discussions for the 
<br/></span><span>betterment of employer and its workers.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share some of the operational insight into the operation of the 
<br/>Labour Standard Services at the Ministry.  The Labour Standard Services ensures that all employment 
<br/>terms and conditions are met by workers and employers through a proactive labour inspection process 
<br/>which covers employers from the 10 minimum wage sectors and the national minimum wage sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Labour Standard Services  of the Ministry is  also  responsible for the 
<br/>promotion of social justice in workplace through the provision of awareness, training and advisory 
<br/>service  to  employers  and  workers  on  the  provision  of  the  Employment  Relations  Act  2007.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, for the last financial year, 1st August, 2020 to 31st July, 2021 through the proactive 
<br/>labour  inspections  and  investigations  of  labour  complaints,  the  Labour  Standard  Services  of  the 
<br/>Ministry has conducted 2,785 labour inspections and has resolved 1,394 labour complaints.

<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through these proactive measures, the Ministry has recovered a total sum 
<br/>of $2.76 million in the last financial year which was then paid out to the workers. This payment of 
<br/>$2.76 million was possible through the enforcement and compliance of the Employment Relations 
<br/>Act 2007 and the Wages Regulation and National Minimum Wage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me also highlight some of the issues in relation to the labour complaints 
<br/>received by the Labour Standard Services at the Ministry. The highest number of complaints received 
<br/>by our Ministry in the last financial year is from the security industry.  These complaints are mostly 
<br/>for non-payment of wages, annual holiday, sick leave and non-payment of minimum rate per hour of 
<br/>work under the Wages Security Services (Amendment) Regulation 2017.  While this does not reflect 
<br/>the industry at large, Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed there are many security companies in compliance but 
<br/>these bad eggs give a rotten image to this sector in general.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  proactive  labour  inspection,  our  Ministry  has  taken  11  security 
<br/>companies  to  the Employment  Relations Tribunal  for breaches of the Employment Relations Act 
<br/>2007.  These matters are currently before the Tribunal where we are claiming over $3 million  as 
<br/>entitlements  to  almost  4,800  workers.  The  Ministry  will  continue  to  work  for  the  benefit  of  all 
<br/>stakeholders and as is evident from this matter, we ensure that workers are always given their due 
<br/>and bad players in the industry are made to comply and pay their dues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to advocate and promote social justice and good 
<br/>faith employment relation to all workers and employers in Fiji.  We have always asked that workers 
<br/>or  employers  visit  the  nearest  Ministry  of  Employment  office  should  they  need  any  advice  or 
<br/>assistance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please give me five minutes. I am coming to a very important area. Sir, I 
<br/>would like to also update this august House following the recent announcement by the Australian 
<br/>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You people are shouting, every break you people come to me, “Please 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two people from my province.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Australian  Government  to  restructure  the  two  labour  mobility 
<br/>programmes namely the Seasonal Work Programme and the Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS) under a 
<br/>single consolidated Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Don’t come next time to me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Fiji- Australia </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership, Fiji joined the PLS on 5</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April, 2019 following the signing of the MOU in Canberra.  The PLS enables low and semi-skilled 
<br/>Fijians and other Pacific Island workers  to work for up to three years in the agriculture, forestry, 
<br/>meat works, fishing and aged-care industries. At the closure of the borders in April 2021, following 
<br/>the second wave of the pandemic, a total of 178 Fijians continued working in Australia under the 
<br/>Seasonal Work Programme while 847 Fijians were deployed under the PLS on three years contracts 
<br/>since Fiji’s participation in this Scheme in 2019. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first stage of the reforms to Australia’s Labour Mobility Programme, 
<br/>the  seasonal  work  programme  and  the  Pacific  Labour  Scheme  was  announced  through  a  joint

<div><span>statement  by  the  Australia’s  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade,  Minister  for  Employment, 
<br/>Workforce,  Skills  and  Small  and  Family  Business  together  with  the  Minister  for  International 
<br/>Development and Pacific on 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The initial reform was the alignment of the two Australian Labour Mobility Programmes in 
<br/>response to public consultation on the programme on 14</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2021.  The Fijian Government 
<br/>also contributed to this consultation with the submission to the Australian Government.  The reforms 
<br/>announced in November 2021 are expected to be effective from 4</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022 where the existing 
<br/>Pacific  Labour  Mobility  Programme  will  be  replaced  by  a  new  single  Pacific  Australian  Labour 
<br/>Mobility  (PALM)  Scheme.    The  PALM  is  expected  to  streamline  the  administration  and  reduce 
<br/>duplication of work with a lot of benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  PALM  is  expected  to  deliver  new  flexibilities  including  certain 
<br/>advantage to our country.  May I also say that this programme is generating a lot of public interest.  
<br/>I would like to acknowledge the leadership of our honourable Prime Minister in making the bold 
<br/>decision of No Jab, No Job almost a year ago, not only to safeguard our citizens but also to ensure 
<br/>that we overcome the pandemic quickly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the pandemic starting to affect our other Pacific Island countries that 
<br/>are  also  part  of  this  Labour  Mobility  Programme  resulting  in  some  of  the  borders  closing,  new 
<br/>employers are now turning to Fiji to engage our Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been briefed by my team that we are expecting over 1,000 workers 
<br/>to be departing our shores for Australia within the next three months.  These opportunities will not 
<br/>only benefit these workers, their families and communities, but also our economic recovery too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clean and Safe Drinking Water for Fijians 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Acting Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Minister and honourable Members of Parliament.  Sir, water 
<br/>is  a very precious  commodity  and a basic need of life.  Although mostly  unpriced, it is  the most 
<br/>valuable limited resource in the world.  The survival of human life is dependent on water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to Water, Sanitation and Hygiene UNICEF Report in 2021, 2.2 billion people still 
<br/>lack access to clean and safe drinking water.  More than half of the global population does not have 
<br/>access to safe sanitation, 3 billion people do not have access to hand washing facilities and still 673 
<br/>million people practise open defecation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Constitution provides every Fijian with socio-economic and environmental rights.  The 
<br/>realisation  of  these  rights  is  critical  for  inclusive  and  sustainable  development.  These  empowers 
<br/>every Fijian through the provision of essential social service and other public goods. Access to water 
<br/>is the top priority for the Fijian Government.  Section 36 of the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji guarantees the right of every person to clean and safe water in adequate quantities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, water is and will continue to be the critical resource for Fijians more than 
<br/>ever.  In prioritising the critical resource, the Fijian Government has been investing in millions in 
<br/>every  financial  year  to  Water  Authority  of  Fiji’s  capital  project  to  help  achieve  its  goal  of  24/7 
<br/>delivery of water to all Fijians and expand its sewerage network. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  year  2010,  only  126,794  households  in  Fiji  were  connected  to  Water  Authority 
<br/>Reticulation  System  and  by  December  2021  the  number  have  risen  to  140,773  households.    The 
<br/>Namau Water Project in Tailevu was commissioned in June 2020.  The project has a five mega litre

<div><span>reservoir,  21  kilometres  of  new  pipelines  and  accompanying  electrical  infrastructure  costing  $20 
<br/>million benefitting 12 villages, 6 settlements, 7 schools and 2 farming communities in Waidalice and 
<br/>Vulagi.  The plant has saved $50,000 annually in water carting costs to affected villages that were 
<br/>not connected to the water system before, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Waste Water Extension Project completed around Fiji in the past four years had benefited 
<br/>many  household  with  new  water  and  waste  water  connections.  This  project,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>includes the Kaba Peninsula Water Supply Project includes laying of 16.8 kilometres of new pipeline 
<br/>costing $4.3 million and benefiting five villages with over 1,960 population.  The village of Waicoka, 
<br/>Vatani  and  Dromuna  since  their  establishment  have  taken  dip  and  drank  from  the  same  river  for 
<br/>decades but in 2020 was the first time ever for the villages to receive clean drinking water.  The 
<br/>Denaru Extension Project and Denaru Bypass in Nadi costing $0.48 million benefiting the Denarau 
<br/>tourist spots and over 3,100 population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Kawakawavesi to Colovi new pipe extension in Seaqaqa, Vanua Levu costing $212,897 
<br/>benefiting over 230 Fijians. The Black Rock Sewer rising main project in support with the Black 
<br/>Rock Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Camp costing $1.2 million is 
<br/>nearing completion.  This 2.2 kilometre sewer project will provide sanitation service to the Black 
<br/>Rock site and has the provision for sewer extension for other surrounding communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  the  hydro  link  improvement  main  projects  in  the  past  four  years  has  enhanced 
<br/>water service to benefit a population of 65,279 people from 50 projects in all our urban areas costing 
<br/>around $24.89 million. The projects include main upgrade in Suva’s CBD areas like Waimanu Road, 
<br/>Toorak area and McGregor Road.  The Western upgrade on Vio Island, Sonaisali Island and Vuda 
<br/>Back Road while the Northern saw Benau  to Volanau  main and Nasealevu head works/upgrades to 
<br/>name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other  key  water  improvement  projects  include  the  Lal  Singh  Road  to  Rewa  Bridge  new 
<br/>pipelines in Nausori costing $3.2 million which will benefit the greater Suva/Nausori corridor water 
<br/>supply scheme. This project is part of the preparation works anticipating the new Rewa River Water 
<br/>supply scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Nakaibula Steel Tank installation in Lautoka costing $1.5 million was to stabilise and 
<br/>improve hydraulic capacity to meet customer demands living within the peripheries of Lautoka City, 
<br/>eliminating  intermittent  supply  areas.  The  recommissioning  of  the  DMO  Reservoir  in  Saweni, 
<br/>Lautoka in July 2020 around 800 Fijians living in the elevated parts of Balawa and Saweni Beach 
<br/>Road in Lautoka now have consistent water supply after the recommissioning of the DMO reservoir 
<br/></span><span>at a cost of around $22,447.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Tauvegavega  one  mega  litre  steel  tank  installation  in  Ba  costing  $1.4  million  was  to 
<br/>stabilise  and  improve  hydraulic  capacity  to  meet  the  customer  demands  living  within  these 
<br/>intermittent supply areas benefiting over 2,500 population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF continues to invest in rural water scheme to see that families have access to water.  
<br/>From  2016  to  2020  WAF  has  carried  out  344  rural  water  projects  which  have  benefitted  17,929 
<br/>households.  Villages who used to fetch water from creeks and rivers now can access water at their 
<br/>homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  WAF  provides  23,000  litres  of  free  water  to  its  customers  who  have  a 
<br/>household income of $30,000 or less under this scheme.  A total of 35,201 applications were received 
<br/>and 34,385 were approved in 2021. This programme has benefited a population of approximately

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>171,925. The total annual water supplied under this scheme is valued at approximately $484,003 and 
<br/>based on 23 units at $0.15 cents per quarterly bill per household.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To assist every Fiji the Government of Fiji announced in April 2020 during the first wave of 
<br/>COVID-19 the disconnection of meters to seize and customers be given time to pay their bills. Sir, 
<br/>WAF seized disconnection from April 2020, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Also when customers faced difficulty 
<br/>in paying their accounts, they were advised to visit the nearest WAF office and make arrangements 
<br/>to clear their bills by 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  reiterate  the  importance  of  using  water  wisely  during  this 
<br/>challenging times we are going through with the current third wave of COVID-19 and the impacts 
<br/>of climate change that is affecting our water level production and damages to our water infrastructure.  
<br/>Both dry and rainy weather affects the water supply.  During drought, it becomes difficult to fill the 
<br/>reservoir while in rainy season a lot of pipes get washed away which supplies water from the main 
<br/>source to the treatment plant.  This is affecting Water Authority of Fiji’s service delivery and every 
<br/>Fijian has the responsibility to conserve water and use it wisely.  Every water drop is precious, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  Fijians should adhere to Water Authority of Fiji’s advisories on saving and storing 
<br/>water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  infrastructure  and  assets  were  laid  a  couple  of  decades  ago.  
<br/>When it was done, it was not anticipated that there would be such a huge rural to urban drift.  A few 
<br/>decades  ago  from  Lami  to  Nausori,  the  population  was  below  100,000  and  today,  it  sits  above 
<br/>300,000.  With such a drift, Water Authority of Fiji’s infrastructure operates under pressure and its 
<br/>service is greatly affected to supply citizens with continuous 24/7 drinking water.  While water is 
<br/>essential,  urban  drift  and  ageing  infrastructure  becomes  the  biggest  hindrance.    Regardless  of  all 
<br/>these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all should appreciate the work carried out by Water Authority of Fiji.  A 
<br/>lot of reforms have taken place and lot needs to be done.  Therefore. I would like to welcome the new 
<br/>CEO of Water Authority of Fiji and we anticipate that the water situation will further improve in 
<br/>densely populated areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to invest millions to build a climate resilient 
<br/>water  and  waste  water  infrastructure  and  ensure  we  improve  access  to  clean  drinking  water  and 
<br/>sanitation to better the lives of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Leader of   Opposition  and honourable Members of Parliament,  getting enough  water of the  right 
<br/>quality has been one of the most important issues in all of human history.  Our target in Fiji is to 
<br/></span><span>make sure that all our people have access to clean and safe water in urban areas by 2021, that was 
<br/></span><span>the target in the National Development Plan and also in rural areas by the year 2030.  We are just 
<br/>about hitting that first target.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Getting water to Fijians is done by Water Authority of Fiji which provides surface and ground 
<br/>water by the rural and maritime development, as you heard yesterday from the honourable Minister, 
<br/>by NGOs, by communities working on their own and also by the Department of Mineral Resources 
<br/>which just does ground water.  Last December, I commissioned the Department’s ground water bore 
<br/>holes in Yaro Village on Kia Island in Macuata, Sese Village in Saqani  Cakaudrove, Navukebuli 
<br/>Village in Namuka Macuata, Naqumu and Nasea Villages in Macuata, Volivoli Primary School in 
<br/>Saqani and Qumusea Primary School in Macuata.  These are just an indication of some of the projects 
<br/>that are done by the Department, but WAF is the major player.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One great challenge it has is old infrastructure.  Some of them are now more than 50 years 
<br/>old and these old infrastructures struggle and needs upgrading, and the upgrading work is being done 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> 11</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>progressively.  But when we do upgrade to make improvements on some parts of the network, we 
<br/>put a large strain on the older assets that are in the same network which cannot handle the water 
<br/>pressure.  This leads to pipe breaks and critical failure which affects the delivery of services, leading 
<br/>again to increase in repairs and maintenance cost.  This old infrastructure is a major cause of the 48 
<br/>per cent of non-revenue water recorded in the third quarter of 2021.  We have also now 83 areas that 
<br/>have intermittent supply of water affecting slightly over 37,000 Fijians connected to Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji’s network.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the past few months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been water disruptions in the Central 
<br/>Division.    I  get  complaints  from  Rewa,  Tailevu,  Naitasiti,  from  places  such  as  Naila,  Waikete, 
<br/>Cautata, Lakena, Ovea, Vuci South, Burebasaga, Nakaile, Visama, Tacirua, Sakoca and so forth.  The 
<br/>question is, what is causing these sorts of issues?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Well first of all, over the past decades, as the honourable Maharaj has said, there has been 
<br/>more  and  more  people  moving  into  the  Korovou  to  Lami  corridor.    It  is  very  heavily  densely 
<br/>population now.  The population has shot up and the demand for water has also sky rocketed.  The 
<br/>demand is outstripping supply in this area.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second major reason, we have had so much rain which causes flooding and high turbidly 
<br/>of very muddy water and all that dirt in the raw water leads to pump breakdowns and dam blockages. 
<br/>This reduces the amount of water going into our treatment plants and it takes time then to get the 
<br/>water treated to an acceptable quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, the water sources are places that we source water in the Nausori to Lami area need to be 
<br/>pumped up to  where it is needed because the  rivers at a lower  elevation, they always need to  be 
<br/>pumped up. When we have no power, we cannot pump.  So, we cannot move the water through the 
<br/>pipes to the reservoirs where it then flows to customers. When there is no power, the reservoirs empty 
<br/>out.  It then takes time for the water to start flowing again, to fill the reservoir and all the pipes along 
<br/>the reticulation network.  It takes time for water pressures across the whole system to normalise.  And 
<br/>all these needs to  reduce production to  no supply or intermittent  supply  which leads of course to 
<br/>frustration. The good thing is that WAF is addressing all these issues progressively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, you may have now heard that WAF is currently in the middle of constructing a new 
<br/>$266 million Water Treatment Plant in Viria, Naitasiri that will initially provide an additional 40 
<br/>million litres per day to the greater Suva and Nausori areas. This should be ready by mid-2023 and 
<br/>it will benefit over 300,000 people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, with the new 40 million litres of treated water coming online in the future, some may 
<br/></span><span>ask where we are going to store this large volume of water.  While Viria is being constructed, WAF 
<br/>is already putting in place the new reservoirs in the Central Division to increase clean treated water 
<br/>storage capacity.  This includes a three mega litre or three million litre reservoir in Tacirua East new 
<br/>subdivision.  A two mega litre reservoir in Toorak and two five mega litre reservoirs in Raralevu 
<br/>which I expect to be commissioned by the end this year and it will service the Tailevu South and the 
<br/>Rewa Delta areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, to mitigate the power outage problem. Sir, WAF hires backup gensets for the critical 
<br/>water and wash water pump stations to ensure that water continues to flow where it is needed.  Sir, 
<br/>WAF is progressively buying and installing tailor-made standby gensets for all its water and waste 
<br/>water pump stations in all critical sites within the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourth,  if  necessary,  WAF  is  continuing  to  do  water  carting  with  priority  given  to  filling 
<br/>community tanks. There is a number that customers can call to address this issue.  On top of all these,

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>765  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have the impact of natural disasters.  Natural disasters have a huge impact. Sir, TD03F and </span><span>TC 
<br/>Cody</span><span> this year cost $1.65 million worth of damages to WAF’s infrastructure. So, that $1.65 million 
<br/>takes money out of existing projects in order to fix the damage that is being done by these natural 
<br/>disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How  are  these  things  being  handled  systematically?    Major  investments.  Sir,  WAF  is 
<br/>investing in major projects around the country. Apart from the new Rewa River Water Supply or the 
<br/>Viria Project, Water Package Treatment Plants in Namau that is now operational, Savusavu about to 
<br/>go online, Viria coming on line as I have mentioned before and Nabouwalu where the earthworks 
<br/>have been done, civil works have been done and the land is secured, the package plant is ready and 
<br/>work is about to commence there.  Nagado, Vunidawa, Deuba and Waiwai are being constructed to 
<br/>fill in the reticulation gaps in these regions.  New reservoirs are being constructed in the Western and 
<br/>Central Regions to ease the intermittent water supply issues namely Toorak, Raralevu, Tacirua East, 
<br/>Lautoka Hospital and Nadi Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Back Up Gensets - $8.75 million has been invested to buy new tailor-made backup generators 
<br/>from  critical  sites  across  all  three  regions.    These  critical  sites  rely  on  EFL  power  supply  so  the 
<br/>backup gensets will ensure that water will still flow to reservoirs even if EFL has power blackouts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF is a upgrading treatment plants at PALM stations switchboards with a power factor 
<br/>correction for various stations to correct the higher power usage and the cost that goes with it when 
<br/>power surges.  When power fails, WAF has to foot the bill for water cutting and waste water bailing. 
<br/>Once again, this money has to be taken out of other projects. This is extra expense.  The new gensets 
<br/>and electrical update will get rid of this additional operational cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Automation  of  major  sites  -  WAF  is  now  looking  to  implement  a  five-year  automation 
<br/>programme that automates key valves to maintain service delivery levels.  Automates reservoir flow 
<br/>metres and valves and lastly to automate treatment plants.  This will be piloted in the Suva-Nausori 
<br/>system and will result in annual cost savings of around $670,000.  It will also free up manpower and 
<br/>machinery to  address  other important  issues.   This  pilot  automation programme will benefit over 
<br/>300,000 people in the greater Suva area, the area that has been continuously facing water disruptions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF is now introducing a Central Event Management Solution, this will assist in the 
<br/>reduction of leakage, service interruption and will improve WAF’s network efficiency.  Through this 
<br/>system, leakages will be identified quickly and resolved.  The project will target the Suva-Nausori 
<br/>Water Supply network and the pilot project for the first year will begin in the Wainibuku Zone 1 area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of 10 to 20-Year Master Plan - Master plans have been drawn out for all of 
<br/></span><span>our major urban areas. These plans are roadmaps for future investment in each of these areas.  The 
<br/>master plans are then used by WAF to make yearly PSIP request to Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the problems that we have is unpaid bills.  It costs $1.01 
<br/>to produce one unit of water, one unit of water is equivalent to 1,000 litres of water ($1.01 to produce 
<br/>1 unit).  Residential  customers in  Fiji are charged $0.15 per unit for the first 50 units, so it costs 
<br/>$1.01, they get charged $0.15 cents and then they are charged $0.43 cents for the next 51 units to 100 
<br/>units and $0.83 cents for usage above that.  Commercial customers pay $1.06 per unit.  Now, WAF 
<br/>has had major issues getting people to pay their water bills despite constant reminders and awareness.  
<br/>The total unpaid bills as of 31st January, 2022 is $32 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Residential  customers  owe  $30.13  million,  commercial  customers  owe  $830,000  and 
<br/>institutional  ones  owe  $390,000.    WAF  is  now addressing  this  much  more  vigorously  with  more 
<br/>awareness on social media, reminders sent through emails and SMS directly to the account holder.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community awareness is being carried out and payment arrangements for customers with financial 
<br/>difficulties are assessed and approved on a case by case basis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, WAF has resumed disconnection since October 2021 in an effort to collect unpaid bills.  
<br/>WAF has also carried out arrears waiver for customers who are social welfare recipients or FNPF 
<br/>pensioners and a total of more than a thousand customers who owed $1.8 million were assisted by 
<br/>this waiver. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More Fijian people now have access to clean water and proper sanitation than a decade ago 
<br/>and almost 100 per cent of all Fijians living in urban areas now have access to treated water in 2021 
<br/>compared to around 5 per cent prior to the year 2010.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Benchmarking  of  our  Service  -  Fiji  is  one  of  the  few  countries  that  offer  free  water 
<br/>allowances, 250 litres of water per household connection per day for households with a combined 
<br/>household income of less than $30,000.  Fiji tap water is safe to drink and I drink it all the time.  Sir, 
<br/>WAF’s  national  water  quality  laboratory  was  awarded  the  ISO1725  Accreditation  so  we  test  our 
<br/>water at the level on par with international best practice.  We still have some way to go to deliver 
<br/>especially in our rural and maritime areas, where we still have mainly untreated water but we have 
<br/>national  plans in  place which set  our target,  a vibrant  WAF complimented by Mineral  Resources 
<br/>Department and Rural and Maritime Development and a network of other NGOs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have put in place the Rural Water and Sanitation Policy with practical guidelines for rural 
<br/>water supply management to ensure quality in rural areas.  All these moves us closer to achieving 
<br/>our 2030 target of 100 per cent access to clean water in rural and maritime areas by 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  a  number  of  water  related  issues  that  were  brought  up  by 
<br/>Members of the Opposition, I would like to address them very quickly so that I can give them some 
<br/>relief on the issues that they brought to the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Ro Teimumu  Kepa had raised issues on the Rewa  water issue in  villages 
<br/>including Vutia, Nukui and Tavuya.  I would just like to say that in March 2021 WAF undertook 
<br/>extensive works in the Rewa Delta which included the replacement of old water infrastructure in the 
<br/>area.    The  result  of  these  works  allowed  sufficient  water  pressure  at  Naililili  to  re-activate  the 
<br/>Lomanikoro header tank that was not in service for many years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the old water pipeline that used to supply the Rewa Delta has been replaced with 
<br/>a new pipeline.  She also mentioned the issue of delays in sending water bills to customers leading 
<br/></span><span>to disconnections.  For the benefit of the House, most of these delays are possibly caused by unpaid 
<br/></span><span>postal boxes and invalid postal addresses.  Sir, WAF has been receiving around 1,000 plus unclaimed 
<br/>water bills every month from the post office.  To address this, WAF has now introduced an electronic 
<br/>bill delivery system.  Another reason that we have had is accumulated bill arrears during the COVID-
<br/>19 period.  With the COVID-19 situation, the no disconnection period of over 18 months had resulted 
<br/>in many customers not paying their water bills every quarter when they fall due.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address this, as I said, WAF is looking at electronic bill registration drive.  The honourable 
<br/>Gavoka had raised the issue about the trench in Silana.  The WAF people had visited that place. They 
<br/>have only managed to find, a new connection was provided to one of the residents in another village 
<br/>called Naevuevu Village. Sir, WAF has checked this with the </span><span>turaga ni koro and</span><span> they have been 
<br/>looking at things that they need to do to top up the road crossing with proper backfill materials and 
<br/>arrange for the contractor to carry out permanent reinstatement works.

<div><span> 767 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Anare Jale had talked about Narocivo and Namalata not getting water.  I would 
<br/>just like to state here for the benefit of the House that Namalata and Narocivo Borehole Scheme was 
<br/>implemented by the MRD and is all currently operational and connected directly to the existing WAF 
<br/>main. The Namalata and Narocivo villages are yet to formally register their water committee with 
<br/>the Department of Water and Sewerage and once they do this, the assets will be given over to them 
<br/>so that the water committee looks after that particular issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Mitieli Bulanauca talked about the need to review the WAF Act. The WAF Act 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>came into place in 2010 and the board will review it when it is necessary to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Salote Radrodro raised the issue of Nabouwalu. When it rains, there is problems 
<br/>in the water there. The great thing is, the package plant is ready. It is here. The land has been secured 
<br/>and very soon WAF will be looking at putting their package plant in place to deal with that issue 
<br/>once and for all. She has also mentioned the issue of Yacata Island, water supply issues with a solar 
<br/>pump. That particular borehole was drilled by the MRD but the reticulation, the distribution system 
<br/>and the solar pump was done by an NGO, so we will need to be able to look at it together. I just 
<br/>would like to add that it was not done by MRD and WAF but we will still, in the interest of looking 
<br/>after all of our people, we will look at what we can do about that issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ratu Tevita Navurelevu talked about water supply to rural and maritime schools 
<br/>and  I  will  mention  here  that  from  the  period  of  2010  to  2021,  WAF  has  constructed  rural  water 
<br/>schemes to 44 schools in rural and maritime areas.  As I added recently, the MRD also does boreholes 
<br/>for these schools where this is necessary.  I think those are the comments that I have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, I want to thank the teams at WAF who often work under severe pressure, long 
<br/>hours and difficult conditions. I want to thank all of them, to the people right at the top, to the people 
<br/>on the ground because I have walked the lines where they have worked and I have seen what they go 
<br/>through. Also the people at MRD who work on groundwater, the NGOs who assist rural communities 
<br/>and  the  staff  at  the  Rural  and  Maritime  Development.  My  appreciation  also  to  the  people  at  the 
<br/>Department of Water and Sewerage at the Ministry of Infrastructure. This Government will keep on 
<br/>moving to making sure that we can supply clean and safe water to all of the people of this country as 
<br/>soon as possible. All of these people are working together to bring clean and safe water to all Fijians.
