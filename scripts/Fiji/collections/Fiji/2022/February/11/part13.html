<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I give the floor to the Leader of the House, I 
<br/>have  been  asked  if  he  could  update  Parliament  on  a  response  that  he  made  on  Monday  so  that 
<br/></span><span>Parliament is aware. You have the floor, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Fiji’s Humanitarian Work in Tonga  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you 
<br/>for  the  opportunity.  Just  for  the  information  of  your  good  self,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  this  august 
<br/>House, on Monday I responded to the question on the humanitarian work to Tonga and I did state 
<br/>that our troops are still in Australia, but I am happy to report again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have 
<br/>had approval from the Kingdom of Tonga.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, 30 of our troops have left Amberley Air Base in Brisbane on Wednesday 10</span><span>th</span><span> and they 
<br/>are currently in Tonga.  Their main responsibility are the islands of Ata’a and Mango Island just off 
<br/>Tongatapu and for the remaining 18, they will be air lifted again from Enoggera Camp where they 
<br/>are in now, back to Sydney and then they will sail when </span><span>HMAS Canberra</span><span> sets sail again for Tonga
