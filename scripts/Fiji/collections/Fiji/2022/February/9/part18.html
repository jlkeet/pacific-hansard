<h3>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- FDB.</h3>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Not FDB but ADB Report which confirms what we have been 
<br/>saying on debt and all those issues which we have been emphasising.  So that is the reason why we 
<br/>are raising the concerns about further guarantees for FDB or any other institution.  We support the 
<br/>existence of these institutions, FDB and Fiji Airways, but to be managed in a prudent way and that 
<br/>is why we have been raising some of the financials from the reports, including the purchase of the 
<br/>Fiji Airways aircraft.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the FIU Report, it is very interesting if some of you have the opportunity to read through 
<br/></span><span>it, please I encourage you to.  I do commend the FIU and the management about the thoroughness of 
<br/></span><span>their reports and activities.  One of the interesting parts of it is the Electronic Funds Transfer Reports 
<br/>and this is related to the inward remittance.  Let me highlight that on page 65.  We received 1.86 
<br/>million transactions, Electronic Funds Transfer Reports in 2019, 74 per cent was from the money 
<br/>remittance service providers and 85 per cent of that is inward remittance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, let me just say this for your interest and also for the listeners, on page 76, in terms of 
<br/>inward - the international remittance transactions, were conducted from the following 10 countries: 
<br/>Australia, United States of America,  New  Zealand, United Kingdom,  Canada, Vanuatu,  Solomon 
<br/>Islands, Tonga, Cook Islands and Tuvalu.  If you look at the graph or pie chart there, 36 per cent is 
<br/>from Australia followed by 23 per cent from the United States of America, followed by New Zealand, 
<br/>United Kingdom, Canada Vanuatu, Solomon Islands, et cetera. So, it is quite interesting when you 
<br/>look at the inward remittances dominated by Australia, United States of America and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the ADB Report, again they emphasised that.  Let me read it out ‘personal remittance 
<br/>inflows have been stable averaging 5.1 per cent of GDP during 2014-2019.  Such inflows surged by 
<br/>11  per  cent  in  2020  driven  by  higher  than  usual  payments  from  Fijians  living  abroad  to  family 
<br/>members in the country struggling with the economic downturn’. And in the latest Reserve Bank of 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Economic Review January 2022, they also emphasised that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the external sector inward personal remittances grew by 14.6 per cent in 2021 to reach a 
<br/>new record of $842.2 million, which is very substantial.  Of the total cash transfers received, $498.5 
<br/>million were remitted via money transfer operations, $187.2 million through mobile money platforms 
<br/>and $156.5 million through commercial banks.  Again, I emphasise it is a major income for the nation 
<br/>in terms of our economy, which we are happy about but the question which I raise is, what are some 
<br/>of the reasons for the increase in this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, more of our people are sending money and that also  indicates that a lot  of our 
<br/>people are moving out for better opportunities.  I ask the question, why are they moving out?  Are 
<br/>they seeking a better opportunity, of course?  The other question is, are the local conditions under 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government conducive for our people to remain in Fiji?  That is the fundamental question 
<br/>we  have  be  asking  when  we  are  looking  at  this  kind  of  data  and,  of  course,  this  also  indicates 
<br/>significant brain drain since the coup of 2006 up to now.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–FFIU 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And that is, Sir, one of the fundamental questions we need to ask ourselves and I am trying 
<br/>to emphasise here whether the FijiFirst Government since 2006 </span><span>coup</span><span> up to now whether they have 
<br/>properly analysed our human resources whether we have a proper human resource plan in terms of 
<br/>the overall needs of our nation taking into account this kind of figures and the brain drain and the 
<br/>outward movement on migration of our mainly qualified people. This includes our various technical 
<br/>professions. What kind of study has been done to determine the outward movement and what actions 
<br/>have been taken to address this by the FijiFirst Government or are they ignorant of it?  For example, 
<br/>let me take the cases of the nurses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The nursing association have raised this issue about the resignation of nurses claiming stress, 
<br/>fatigue, lack of compensation et cetera. The President of the Fiji Nursing Association claims most of 
<br/>the nurses were sick and tired, others were leaving …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just stick to the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, stick to the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  I  am  trying  to  explain,  Sir,  the  inward  remittances  and 
<br/></span><span>linking  it  to  outward  labour  movement  which  is  linked  to  exactly  what  I  am  saying.    The 
<br/></span><span>dissatisfaction of our local labour force.  Sir, I had raised this as a motion in terms of an enquiry into 
<br/>the health sector workforce regarding the issues which they have raised.   Not only that but still on 
<br/>FRCS  on  the  monitoring  of  income  or  financial  transactions.    I  had  noted  in  terms  of  foreign 
<br/>investors, that is also raised in the Report and under the foreign investment regulations, there are 
<br/>reserved activities and restricted activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under that I am questioning how, does FIU monitor those foreigners who are coming in on 
<br/>various types of visas engaging in the various activities under these categories and the movement of 
<br/>their funds.  This needs to be clearly looked into because some of them coming under those various 
<br/>visas and they end up a citizens as we note with a lot of new businesses which are been set up now.  
<br/>So, they have become citizens but we need to be clear on how they came in.  Those are some the 
<br/>issues I thought I had to raise on the FIU. Again, I thank the Committee on the Report before us and 
<br/>I commend it to the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Sir. I will really brief, Sir.  Just to note that FIU 
<br/>does play a very critical role. They do a lot of coordination behind the scenes with the organisations 
<br/>like the FRCS. There is lot of intelligence gathering and in fact there is a lot tax evasion that does 
<br/></span><span>take place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I would like to also make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly, the FIU in fact 
<br/>has been meeting with the Real Estate Agencies Licencing Board too together with the law society 
<br/>members.  There is compliance under the FTRA Act, Transaction Reporting Act.  In fact, a number 
<br/>of members of the law society’s trust account, it is just that they are not aware that this money is not 
<br/>clean, some of them actually are aware of it and there is certain obligations that they need to fulfil.  
<br/>One important issue that is also emerging Sir which is a matter on interest is cryptocurrency. I mean, 
<br/>these are the kind of things that are actually creeping into the system and the FIU can also help us 
<br/>with that type of information.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  you  would  have  seen,  Sir,  it  was  advertised,  I  think  it  is  on  social  media  that 
<br/>Nananu-i-Cake was being set up as a cryptocurrency haven which is, of course, false and as we all 
<br/>know that crypto currency, in fact, is utilised by a lot of people who engage in illegal activities, for 
<br/>example, proceeds from drugs, prostitution and various other transnational crimes.  The former Whip 
<br/>of  SODELPA  in  fact  was  promoting  crypto  currency  and  said  that  Fiji  should  actually  move 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–FFIU 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>567 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completely into crypto currency.  Unfortunately, obviously these are the sort of things that are coming 
<br/>into the system, the law needs to stay ahead of the game and FIU can help us in that respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would also like to just very quickly inform honourable Tuisawau that the biggest brain 
<br/>drain that this country actually saw was in 1987; two </span><span>coups</span><span> in 1987.  There was no assessment done 
<br/>then, in fact, that was a biggest brain drain; in 2000 a very violent removals of government. A lot of 
<br/>violence based on ethnicity, outright ethnicity was carried out and of course Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji at 
<br/>that time post 1987 for a couple of years had the dual citizenship before that.  That was also revoked.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bainimarama Government actually brought back multiple citizenship holding for former 
<br/>Fijians and that is where we have seen a number of Fijians actually come back, some of them have 
<br/>set up businesses, they brought in money too.  Where they are talking about Pullman, these are people 
<br/>who brought money from offshore and they are former Fijians, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reason why we are getting a bit more money being sent home, Sir, is honourable Minister 
<br/>Bala’s Ministry under the Pacific Labour Scheme.  We are seeing nearly every month or every two 
<br/>months a lot of Fijians are going across to work in places like Australia where they have now opened 
<br/>up their market in terms of the labour force market not only for fruit picking which is traditionally 
<br/></span><span>the only thing they used to do.  New Zealand, at one stage, used to hire people from Fiji to work in 
<br/></span><span>slaughter  houses  for  export  to  the  Middle-East  but  now,  Australia  is  opening  up  in  various  other 
<br/>areas, so we see a lot of Fijians who are going across and working.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  Fijians  who  are  working  as  security  personnel  in  countries  like  well  just  until 
<br/>recently Afghanistan of course the Middle-East, some are working as nurses.  This is why you will 
<br/>see that money is coming back.  Those in the British Army, they are sending money back through 
<br/>this money wallets which is a lot easier for them.  It does not necessarily indicate a brain drain per se 
<br/>because on the other flip-side we are getting a lot of people who are also coming back, Sir.  So, I just 
<br/>wanted to clarify that with the honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FIU of course is housed in the Reserve Bank of Fiji and we would like 
<br/>to acknowledge the assistance that the RBF actually does provide to FIU.  They fully fund FIU and 
<br/>FIU is part of the Anti-Money Laundering Council which is made up of various agencies, including 
<br/>the Ministry of Justice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee on Economic Affairs to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  might  remember  when  honourable  Gavoka  was 
<br/>member of this Committee, I can be corrected on that, we did rope in Real Estate Agents Licensing 
<br/>Board (REALB) for presentation but this time while writing the Report, due to COVID-19 and we 
<br/>were doing virtually so we could not get all these agencies again.  It is a valid point.  We did have 
<br/>discussions with REALB and definitely FIU in the near future will put them together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have no further comments to make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
