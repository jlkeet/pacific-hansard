<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Transport  is 
<br/>responsible for policy formulation, planning, design, regulatory coordination and implementation of 
<br/>programmes  and  projects  and  services  relating  to  public  works,  meteorology,  transportation  and 
<br/>utilities which are part of the Government infrastructure sector in Fiji.  In addition, the then Ministry 
<br/>of  Infrastructure  and  Transport  is  also  responsible  for  policy  and  legislative  oversight  as  well  as 
<br/>administrative and regulatory functions of various Government  Commercial Statutory Authorities 
<br/>and Government Commercial Companies under the portfolio of the Minister for Infrastructure and 
<br/>Transport.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee upon being referred the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport 2015 and 
<br/>January  2016  to  July  2017  Annual  Reports  requested  for  written  responses  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Infrastructure  and  Meteorological  Services  and  the  Department  of  Transport  within  Ministry  of 
<br/>Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport.  Upon receipt of the written responses, the Committee 
<br/>was enlightened on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>How  the  Department  of  Transport  under  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  Trade  Tourism  and 
<br/>Transport monitor and evaluate the performance and the implementation of policies of the 
<br/>various statutory authorities under its ambit; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services’ future plans and initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  of  Transport  monitors  and  evaluates  the  performance  of  the  statutory 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>authorities through the Operational Level Agreement and also the Services Level Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to performance excellence and service delivery, the Department for the first time 
<br/>applied  and  was  recognized  with  the  Achievement  in  Excellence  Award  during  the  Fiji  Business 
<br/>Excellence Awards in 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the Ministry has been consistent in the achievement of its outputs as articulated 
<br/>in its Annual Corporate Plan for the past three years, recording an average overall achievement of 80 
<br/>per cent per annum. This is a commendable benchmark for the 2016 and 2017 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We commend the team of committed and motivated staff at the Ministry and anticipate further 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improvements to its operations over the coming years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this opportunity to contribute 
<br/>on the motion that is before the House on the Consolidated Report for the Ministry of Infrastructure 
<br/>for the years 2016 and 2017 and also the Annual Report for 2015.  In this instance, I would like to 
<br/>thank the Committee for their deliberations as noted to the House this afternoon by the honourable 
<br/>Chairperson. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make a few remarks about the Report itself, I just want to take this 
<br/></span><span>opportunity to make a few comments.  I want to comment first on the remarks that was made before 
<br/></span><span>lunch by the honourable Minister for Infrastructure.  One he made before lunch today and the other 
<br/>one, he made yesterday.  I know I was not here because I was watching him on television. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  his  interjection  earlier  on  today,  he  said  that  the  honourable  Professor  Prasad  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition had contracted a new disease of losing their marbles.  I just want to remind my friend, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>540 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Minister for Infrastructure that the deteriorating quality of infrastructure under his 
<br/>charge is making people lose their marbles.  After trying to negotiate through the pothole hill roads 
<br/>or  when  the  vehicle  falls  into  these  craters,  these  potholes  resemble  moon  craters,  that  really  is 
<br/>causing people to lose their marbles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also people lose their marbles by carting heavy loads of water or spending hours looking for 
<br/>clean and safe water due to the Minister’s failure to keep a check and balance on Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji, whose Chair lives mostly in Australia and lectures us about science.  This is the state of decay 
<br/>being endured by the people and yet he feels fit to remark that we are losing our marbles when in 
<br/>fact, the people are losing their marbles because of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  want  to  comment  on  the  honourable  Minister’s  comment  yesterday  when  he  spoke 
<br/>about  the  Boards;  the  Boards  belonging  to  Government.    Boards  of  Government  Commercial 
<br/>Companies and Commercial Statutory Authorities where he has told the House that these Boards do 
<br/>not get influenced by political interventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just remind my friend (he is not here, he is gone) just to ask honourable Bala, he will 
<br/>give him the whole episode because what I am going to say to the honourable Minister, we have just 
<br/>come off together from a funeral from one of our common relative from Nasaqalau and there they 
<br/>say “</span><span>kakua ni ko dai</span><span>” - do not lie, </span><span>bahut jhooth yaar,</span><span> honourable Minister. </span><span>Kua ni lasu</span><span>, do not lie. 
<br/>That is the reality.  You know, the honourable Attorney-General knows, honourable Bala knows, 
<br/>political  interference  occurs  all  the  time  in  the  leadership  of  Boards  that  govern  Government 
<br/>Commercial Authorities. Look at what happened to MWH as part of FRA when they were given 
<br/></span><span>persona non grata</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- So, that is what I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.-… to tell the House that he does not get or the Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>does not get influenced by political leadership when his Ministry…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- It is a whole lot of hogwash, completely hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- No, no, definitely I am telling you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Maybe you did it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is the reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>541 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just going to go very briefly on the report because the Committee, and I want to thank 
<br/>them.  All they did was that they asked us to note the report, obviously it is the years from 2015, 
<br/>2016 and 2017.  They commented mostly on the Auditor-General’s Report of the Ministry throughout 
<br/>those years.  As reflected in the statement, the independent auditors reports for those years done by 
<br/>the Auditor-General for the Ministry.  I just want to highlight are few things that the Committee noted 
<br/>and I want to share that with you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The very first one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the issue about the Trade and Manufacturing Account 
<br/>commonly known as “TMA”.  I know the honourable Minister will know this, it has been a historic 
<br/>issue and it continues to be raised.  In the report it says that the Ministry of Infrastructure has 17 
<br/>TMA accounts. They have been struggling through this and unfortunately up until 2019 the same 
<br/>issues continued throughout.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am thinking and I am saying also that not much has been done about that so it is pointless 
<br/>trying to pull up public servants to manage these accounts all the time when a decision really should 
<br/>have been reached to make it better.  So, I am calling on the Ministry today to look at that, to manage 
<br/>the  TMA  accounts  because,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  talking  about  millions  of  dollars  on  many 
<br/>occasions that have not been accounted for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is talking about transparency, good governance and all that but all of these 
<br/>still do exist and they need to change. It is capacity building, I think the way things are set up right 
<br/>now gives a lot of flexibility to the Minister and the Ministry to look within their own establishments 
<br/>and find capacity to deal with things like this because you are talking about taxpayers’ funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the honourable Minister will consider that, so that when 
<br/>reports of 2020 and beyond, particularly from now going forward, TMAs will not be featured as areas 
<br/>of concerns by the Auditor-General when they audit these accounts.  That is the first issue from the 
<br/>report that I would like to talk about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the other recommendations, and I think this is actually quite a very 
<br/>good recommendation from the Committee. The Committee noted that there was within the Ministry 
<br/>of Infrastructure an appointment of the Principal Engineer Regulatory position which, according to 
<br/>this Report, the Ministry has been told to drop this appointment by the Ministry of Economy.  That 
<br/>is what the Report says.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  do  not  quite  follow  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  we  have  been  told  that  under  the 
<br/></span><span>restructure of the Public Service, the Ministers have these powers, they are given their budget for 
<br/>personal emoluments and resources, so they get to decide the establishment of their own Ministries.  
<br/>The Report also says that some of the portfolios within the Ministry get to do this responsibility but 
<br/>they are not dedicated engineers to look after it.  These same engineers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, get to do a 
<br/>lot of important work for the Ministry, particularly in coordinating tasks and activities with regards 
<br/>to roads and also to water. Those are the two main ones, and also rural electrification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  made  this  reference,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because,  in  the  same  Report,  one  of  the  last 
<br/>recommendations or things that was noted by the Committee and I refer you to page 18 of the Report, 
<br/></span><span>Recommendation 3.6:  “The Committee notes that schools in remote and maritime areas are without 
<br/></span><span>access to running water.”  We note that a total of 35 schools in Lau, Lomaiviti, Tailevu, Macuata, 
<br/>Bua, Cakaudrove, Ba and Nadroga Provinces do not have access to running water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Job Description of these engineers that I was talking about, these 
<br/></span><span>would be the kind of things that an engineer would be doing.  I recognise that FRA continues to be 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reformed, the Water Authority of Fiji has a long way to go about reforming itself, so you need this 
<br/>guide at the Ministry to be able to coordinate this, even though these other two institutions are looking 
<br/>after it themselves.  It is kind of surprising that you continue to hear about this because, obviously 
<br/>water is an essential need and our children do not get clean water.  Because this Report was in 2019, 
<br/>I hope that something had already been done about it.  So, I would like to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/>if he has actually done something about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one of the few issues noted by the Committee and they have made 
<br/>their recommendations on what  needs to  be done.  I know other speakers are going to  talk about 
<br/>others, but I want to end my intervention today on a very, very important observation that was made 
<br/>by the Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  page  16,  paragraph  3.4,  the  title  being  “The  implementation  of  key  policies  by  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Meteorological  Services”.    Then  it  goes  on  to  say,  “Liquid  Trade 
<br/>Wastewater Policy.  The Water Authority of Fiji is responsible for the implementation of this policy.  
<br/>Below is the update from the Water Authority of Fiji for trade waste.”  Then it goes on to further say, 
<br/>“Total permits issued - 660 businesses. Commercial customers’ compliance - 25.5 per cent.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also notes that the biggest offenders in this are the restaurants, who dump waste 
<br/>into drains and then that go into the system and they go out into the sea, polluting the environment.  
<br/>This to me is essential to note, because once you go on about climate change and looking after our 
<br/>environment, these are essential things to do.  Very essential.  Then to say that only 25.5 per cent of 
<br/>these business comply, meaning 75 per cent do not.  So, some greater commitment needs to be done 
<br/>to make sure that these companies actually do comply, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industrial customers’ compliance slightly better - 64.5 per cent, but still that is a shortfall of 
<br/>almost 40 per cent.  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Reddy is here so he is looking after waterways. 
<br/>There  are  many  waterways  around  our  industrial  areas  and  around  these  commercial  centres  that 
<br/>definitely need a lot of work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I am asking the honourable Minister for Infrastructure and the Ministers concerned that I 
<br/>have raised these issues which the Committee had raised, and are going to look into this. Those are 
<br/>matters  that  affect  our  people.    You  will  never  hear  people  stop  winching  about  roads  and  water 
<br/>because these are two essential services that people used everyday and with the commitments that 
<br/>have been made through the reforms (and I know that well) but up until now, people just do not quite 
<br/></span><span>seem to understand that this amount of money that was given is not translating.  Perhaps, something 
<br/></span><span>is wrong - the establishment, the attitude that needs to be changed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We keep hearing about the change with management of boards, Chief Executive Officers and 
<br/>everything else, but bottom line we are still driving over craters and water is not coming to our taps 
<br/>and in the rural areas, communities still have no water.  And I would just like to ask this afternoon 
<br/>the Government, particularly to the honourable Minister concerned to look at these issues and resolve 
<br/>them so that they do not come up again and, of course, our people do not have to suffer through all 
<br/>these issues that I have noted here today.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank the honourable Member for his contribution to the debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect 
<br/>to sitting times, I now call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a Suspension 
<br/></span><span>Motion.
