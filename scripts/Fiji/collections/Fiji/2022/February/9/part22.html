<div><span>LIQUOR (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I 
<br/>move that the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Liquor  (Amendment)  Bill  2022  (Bill  No.  01/2022)  be  considered  by  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament ; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament tomorrow, Thursday 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 
<br/>2022 but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me 
<br/>as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the interest of time, I will not be very 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>long because we will be debating this Bill tomorrow. Essentially, what this Bill seeks to do is to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="105">Page 105</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tobacco Control (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>595 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>firstly, extend the ability of the licence to be issued to up to five years as we have done with some of 
<br/>the other laws, like we did with the hotels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were also some hotel operators who had a liquor licence in 2020, but they did not use 
<br/>it, or because there was no one staying at their hotel, or last year they did not apply for hotel liquor 
<br/>licence because there was no one coming to the hotel. So this year when they have come to renew 
<br/>their liquor licence, the law actually says, “you must now make a fresh application” because once 
<br/>you have not  renewed  your licence,  you have to go through the entire process  of making  a fresh 
<br/>application.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to obviously assist, in particular the smaller, locally owned businesses that may have 
<br/>a couple of </span><span>bure </span><span>in the Yasawa or wherever else.  We do not expect them to go and pay for liquor 
<br/>license for the past couple of years just for them to now actually get a renewal of that licence because 
<br/>that is how the law is limited at the moment.  So that is what we are trying to do.  In simple terms, 
<br/>that is what this particular amendment seeks to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate, we will have the Right of Reply from the mover.  Anyone wishing to take the 
<br/></span><span>floor?  There being no one wishing to take the floor, I call on the honourable Acting Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
