<h3>COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to  Standing  Order 51,  I  move 
<br/>that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>The Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 04/2022) be considered by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill must not be referred to a standing committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>The Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 10th February 2022, 
<br/>but that 1 hour be given to debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member 
<br/>moving the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  you  know  that  the  Commission  of 
<br/>Inquiry in recent times has been used, this is the second time it has been used.  The first time it was 
<br/>done was round about in 2007 when the then former President His Excellency, Ratu Josefa Uluivuda 
<br/>had appointed a Commission of Inquiry into the magistracy where there were enormous allegations 
<br/>of corruption in the magistracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  one  magistrate  actually  who  was  proven,  had  an  agent  in  Nadi  Market  where  he 
<br/>would charge particular rates, dangerous driving, careless driving, rape et cetera, you had to  pay a 
<br/>particular fee then you could get various leniencies that were built into it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Act however is quite old (1946), the Act has not been amended except 
<br/>for in 1961, 1982 and 1997 which dealt however with the provisions relating to the appointment of 
<br/>fresh Commissioners and Oath of Commissioners.

<div><span> Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  offence  provision,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact  are  fairly  archaic.    What  this  particular 
<br/>provision does is seeks to in fact bring the offence provisions, the actual offence itself is not being 
<br/>changed but in fact the penalties  have been increased to bring it into modern day times and that is 
<br/>what this particular provision is about, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate, we will have a right of reply from the mover.  Anyone wishing to take the 
<br/>floor?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is disgraceful, truly disgraceful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Here we are after 9pm, after a long day we are given these Bills to 
<br/>be debated tomorrow for one hour.  I do not have any problems with the Tobacco and the other Bills 
<br/>but this one here, you would need lawyers to look into this.  Who on this side of the House would 
<br/>understand the implications of what is here.  This is a disgrace!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are talking about a law that has been there since 1946.  What were we doing the whole of 
<br/></span><span>this week?  This is disgraceful.  If this is the way we treat our Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a 
<br/>sorry state of affairs, the attitude that FijiFirst brings to this Parliament.  This is totally unacceptable.  
<br/>That is the only word I can use - disgraceful. As I have said in the past, in other governments - there 
<br/>was this Legislative Committee in the Party to bring the Bills to Parliament. When did the Acting 
<br/>Prime Minister decide to bring all of these - we are not a kindergarten here. We are a Parliament of 
<br/>Fiji. You are treating us like kindergartens here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R.GAVOKA.-  It is disgraceful. Shame on you for treating your Parliament like this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that you do not have the numbers but shame on you if this is the way you treat a Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just as honourable Gavoka has said, it is 
<br/>nearly  half  past  nine  in  the  evening.    When  we  broke  for  the  15-minute  break,  I  recall  that  you 
<br/>apologised and said that you erred and did not tell us in the morning that there were Bills. I would 
<br/>like to ask why it took you so long to tell us about these Bills and I agree with honourable Gavoka - 
<br/>this is unreasonable and I would like to say, Mr. Speaker,  that if Government paid its bills as fast as 
<br/></span><span>they introduced Bills in this House, maybe we would have working angiograms at CWM.  And if the 
<br/></span><span>Government worked as fast as they introduced Bills in giving out services to the people, we would 
<br/>have services being given to the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is going on in this Parliament? This is the people’s Parliament 
<br/>and it is being ambushed for the umpteenth time by the Attorney-General who time and time again 
<br/>is  treating  democracy  like  a  façade  riding  roughshod  over  our  Parliament  processes.  So,  as 
<br/>honourable Gavoka said that we do not have any problems with the Bills </span><span>per se</span><span> but the manner in 
<br/>which they have been brought in, expected for us to go and have a read of them tonight and be ready 
<br/>for four debates tomorrow - bringing Standing Order 51 as a reason to pass these Bills this quickly, 
<br/>I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, this is just an abuse of Parliamentary process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- I just wanted to join my colleagues in raising our concerns and 
<br/>objections to the continuous abuse of process by using Standing Order 51.  I mean, to be given these 
<br/>four Bills at this time of the night to be debated tomorrow morning, I am sure majority of the members 
<br/>of the Government side of the side do not even know the contents of these Bills. The reality will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="109">Page 109</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this, tomorrow, they will not be contributing to this Bill. That is the reality because they do not know 
<br/>the contents of these Bills. So we need time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already alluded to in the 
<br/>previous sessions regarding the continuous abuse of Standing Order 51.  At least, we have always 
<br/>requested for Government to give us advanced notice; three or at least 5 days for us to have a view 
<br/>and have a consultation regarding the contents of this Bill. These Bills are not simple adjustments or 
<br/>amendments. We have all known what happened to the Bills that have been presented under Standing 
<br/>Order 51 in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The False Information Act was presented under Standing Order 51 and what happened! When 
<br/>it was passed here, the implementation of the Bill was bizarre. Then we had Bill No. 17, after it was 
<br/>passed in this House, then the relevant ministries and departments went about to all the villages for 
<br/>consultation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- This is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to raise the need for 
<br/></span><span>the Government to have respect for this House; give us enough time to have a read through these 
<br/></span><span>Bill.    As  an  indication,  Sir,  as  I  have  already  alluded  to,  majority  of  these  Members  on  the 
<br/>Government side will not even know how to debate on this Bill tomorrow. Given this time, I strongly 
<br/>object and am concerned regarding the use of Standing Order 51 on these four Bills.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, I will be very brief Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Just to correct what 
<br/>honourable Radrodro said, yes we are aware of what is in the Bills, so please do not assume that we 
<br/>are not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Sir, honourable Gavoka pointed out that he has no issue with the first three Bills, 
<br/>it is only the fourth one which is the one about the Commission of Inquiry.  In reality Sir, you can 
<br/>read this in five minutes and digest it and make submissions on it.  It is nothing except …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It’s a disgrace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not a disgrace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is really just amending the punishment and that is it.  It is as simple as that.  It does not 
<br/></span><span>require 10 lawyers to decipher it.  You got two lawyers on the other side of the House that could do 
<br/></span><span>this in ten minutes.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is nothing disgraceful about it at all and we are totally 
<br/>within the law to actually do this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Opposition  loves  bending  the  term 
<br/>around “abuse of process”.  Abuse of process means that when you actually have a process and you 
<br/>do not follow it.  There is a process under SO51, clearly laid out, so no one is abusing the process.  
<br/>They need to understand the fundamental wordings of these processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Orders  are  the  processes  of  the  House.    Honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua has got it wrong again, honourable Gavoka said he did not have problems with the 
<br/>first three Bills, he only had problems with the fourth Bill.  So, obviously, he recognises the fact that 
<br/>the first three Bills in fact, are urgent.  In particular, the first two Bills (Tobacco and Liquor Licence), 
<br/>they want us to send this to the Committee, that will take another month.  In the meantime, the </span><span>suki 
<br/></span><span>seller, the hotel who wants to operate and wants to start having his liquor licence will not be able to 
<br/>do so.  That is the problem.  It is not sitting on it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not sitting on it.  There are numerous 
<br/>laws, this pandemic has actually thrown a real curler at us. We never had this before.  Like we are 
<br/>saying, that this is probably now, if  you look  at the glass half full, this is the opportunity now to 
<br/>change these laws.  Why should we get the </span><span>suki </span><span>seller or that person selling cigarettes to come year 
<br/>in year out to change this?  He is shaking his head, he does not care about the people in Lautoka 
<br/>Market.  This is the problem, they want to go on about process but they do not care about ordinary 
<br/>Fijians; that is your problem.  You are too infatuated by your own self, your own self-importance, 
<br/>that is what you are infatuated about; your own self-importance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- And you have not been able to manage your time.  You are 
<br/></span><span>saying, “oh it is so late”, who are the people who have been standing up on the other side on all these 
<br/></span><span>reports waffling on the same subject matter for hours on hand?  Your Whip has been useless in respect 
<br/>of not being able to manage your time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F. TUISAWAU.- Can I raise a Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- What specifically he has said, “your Whip has been useless” and 
<br/>I object to that, that is unparliamentary language and very offensive and a slur on my character.  From 
<br/>Monday to today, I have been organising things and helping them, is that they repay me?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, they have brought this at the last minute, I was not even notified of it until tonight and 
<br/>we could not organise it, so how can he say that I have been useless, when I have been helping them 
<br/>from my first day as Whip up to this moment, but they are ones who are useless.  They are inefficient 
<br/>because they have just brought this in now and we need to fix that.  Secondly, this is why we must 
<br/>remove this Government because of the uselessness of the Standing Order.  This Standing Order have 
<br/>been abused and useless and they need to be removed for us to fix it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do not think you have been useless, honourable Whip.  The thing is, what 
<br/>you got to do, you got to organise your side for tomorrow.  The four Bills will be debated tomorrow.  
<br/>So I expect organisation from this side and the other side, that is all I expect.  If you have to burn the 
<br/>midnight oil tonight, you have to burn the midnight oil tonight.  We have all burnt the midnight oil 
<br/>in our times, many times.  This calls for burning of the midnight oil.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  the  reason  I  made  that,  I  did  not  say  he  himself 
<br/>personally was but in his ability to organise, that was useless. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point I was trying 
<br/>to make, earlier on when honourable Ro Tuisawau I had mentioned to him yesterday I think it was 
<br/>and I said “look why not rationalise the number of speakers, you need to organise yourselves.” He 
<br/>said, “no, no its election time, they can speak as much as they like.” This was the reaction, he knows 
<br/>he said that, that is what I am talking about, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>601 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point I would like to point out …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he misunderstood what I said.  What I meant was when we debate we need 
<br/>to  debate clearly so that the public knows everything because if  we cut  it  short especially on the 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report, the public will not know the truth. They are hiding the truth that is why 
<br/>they want to shorten the debates.  But we did not know about this one until now. If we had known 
<br/>then we would have organised better. So, please withdraw the term “useless” change it to “useful”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Sir,  he  did  mention  it  is  election  time,  you  accept  that,  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>know you cannot deny that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  for  honourable  Gavoka’s  point  he  said,  “We  need  lawyers.”  As  I 
<br/>mentioned in my introduction, nothing in this amendment regarding the Commissions of Inquiry has 
<br/>changed,  no  new  offence  has  been  introduced,  no  new  wording  has  been  introduced  except  the 
<br/>penalties.  So the penalties in fact have increased, that is all. So you do not need a lawyer to tell you 
<br/>whether something is gone up from $200 to $1,000 because the wording and the offence remains 
<br/>exactly the same.  There is no amendment to the provision itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Aseri Radrodro who is trying salvage his reputation now just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mislead Parliament… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- He said that ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, it is not come on, it is a fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He said that we did consultations after, Bill No. 17 is no longer in existence, my friend, it is 
<br/>Act No. 22.  There was no consultations done afterwards.  It was because the Ministry went out to 
<br/>clear up the misinformation that all of you spread.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, no, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM- All of you spread.

<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That misinformation was led by the former Whip who is no 
<br/>longer  in  SODELPA  but  that  is  the  misinformation  that  they  had  to  go  and  correct.    Honourable 
<br/>Minister for Rural Maritime, Development will also verify that, that is what was done and if it was 
<br/>so terrible as you made it out to be, tell me who has lost their land, that is what you are saying. Since 
<br/>the implementation  of the law which  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>landowning unit has lost their land? Which  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>landowning unit has leased land without any consent? No one, that is what you are saying and nothing 
<br/>like that has happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Stop campaigning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not campaigning,  it is factual.  He is 
<br/>campaigning. Sir, I would urge all honourable Members to please look at it with their fresh minds so 
<br/>that we can debate this Bill tomorrow.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-. Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we have had a long day, but our start tomorrow is 
<br/>the same, there is no extension of starting time, so I expect everyone here tomorrow to debate these 
<br/>Bills and complete the Agenda items for tomorrow.  I thank you for your cooperation, forbearance 
<br/>and your humour.  We adjourn till tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 9.36 p.m.
