<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - 
<br/>FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 2019 &amp; 2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report of the Fiji Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit 2019 and 2020 Annual Reports which was tabled on 21</span><span>st</span><span> September, 
<br/>2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  Committee tabled its findings on the Fiji Intelligence 
<br/>Unit (FIU)  2019 and 2020 Annual report in September 2021.  While 2019 had been business as usual 
<br/>for the Unit, 2020 was  a unique year for FIU as it was for the rest of us – as this was when Fiji was 
<br/></span><span>crippled by the first wave of  COVID-19.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we are aware, FIU is one of the leading agencies in Fiji that is responsible for preventing 
<br/>and detecting money laundering and terrorists financing activities. The Committee commends the 
<br/>team of FIU for continuing its work, despite the challenges presented by COVID-19 pandemic since 
<br/>2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  the  substantial  increase  in  Financial  Transaction  Reports  from 
<br/>1,741,473 in 2016 to 2,487,186 in 2020.  Due to the impact of COVID-19 on travel, Border Control 
<br/>Reports reduced by 77 per cent in 2020 from 2019.  During its deliberation, it was noted that FIU 
<br/>launched its first Case Management System, an online central database for all suspicious transaction 
<br/>reports and analysis in 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was pleased to note that FIU continued to strengthen its engagement with 
<br/>designated  non-financial  businesses  and  professions,  as  well  as  other  industry  stakeholders  and 
<br/>enforcement authorities. Further to this, the Committee was made aware that FIU was currently in

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–FFIU 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>563 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the process of designing tailor-made guidelines for the various stakeholders they work with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  believes  that  FIU  need  to  explore  further  options  to  forge  a  stronger 
<br/>commitment with law enforcement agencies in terms of receiving regular feedbacks on cases referred 
<br/>by FIU, as regular feedbacks would enable FIU to continuously enhance its service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee commended the FIU for finalising its 2020-2024 Strategic Plan, 
<br/>which  focuses  on  Financial  Intelligence,  Preventative  Measures,  Technology  Driven  Processes, 
<br/>Partnership and People, as this strengthens its commitment towards SDGs 16 and 17. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19 alone also bought cyber threat as more people were turning towards virtual world.  
<br/>The Committee recommended the FIU to engage in vigorous awareness through online platforms, 
<br/>such  as  hosting  webinars  and  virtual  talk  shows  to  educate  and  inform  the  general  public  on  the 
<br/>various threats, possible fraudulent activities and scams.  Thank you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short.  I was always fascinated by 
<br/>the  work  of  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  (FIU).    I  served  in  the  Economic  Affairs  Standing 
<br/>Committee for some years and I always look forward to their reports to get to understand what they 
<br/></span><span>do.  They carry out some very important, mostly surveillance on transactions that can lead to crime 
<br/></span><span>across the borders, especially in financial areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just noticed here in Recommendation No. 2 that the Fiji Law Society (FLS) has encouraged 
<br/>42 of their employees to attend training with FIU to understand the implications of the transactions 
<br/>that are handled by the lawyers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Essentially, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you need to track the movement of huge sums of money into 
<br/>Fiji, to understand where it is coming from, that it is not drug-related or crime-related and the lawyers, 
<br/>because of their Trust Accounts, are normally recipients of this.  Some of them do not always realise 
<br/>that the money is dirty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was in the Committee, I noticed that the lawyers were not fully conversant with the 
<br/>requirements of the FIU, so I am happy to see that happening now, that there is training.  The FLS is 
<br/>encouraging its people to understand what FIU is and what is required of them so that the lawyers do 
<br/>not have dirty monies sitting in their Trust Account, which is good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I do not see here anything with the Real Estate because we also spoke about the 
<br/></span><span>real estate people.  They are also conduit for dirty money.  Someone can buy a property in Fiji and it 
<br/></span><span>is the real estate to bring in that money and it could be dirty money.  The real estate people also have 
<br/>to be trained to understand the roles relating to FIU.  I hope if that could be included and added to 
<br/>the recommendation that what the lawyers have undertaken to understand FIU should also be with 
<br/>the real estate community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, is my contribution, but otherwise it is an agency of Government that we 
<br/>can all be proud of.  They are doing a very good job, they hire some very highly qualified people.  
<br/>The  police  who  are  seconded  there  are  experts  in  forensic  accounting  and  all  that,  and  is  always 
<br/>delightful listening to them when we scrutinise their report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the real estate issue, I just wish that they would take note of that, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>otherwise I thank the Committee for this Report on the FIU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.K. BHATNAGAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a member of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs, I rise to make a short contribution to the motion on the floor.  Definitely, I agree 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>564 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–FFIU 2019 &amp; 2020 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the honourable Gavoka that it is always a pleasure to have Mr. Buksh and his presentations are 
<br/>just amazing and very informative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the core role of the FIU as an intelligence agency is to receive, analyse and 
<br/>disseminate financial intelligence to relevant law enforcement agencies and I must say, this is because 
<br/>of the dynamic leadership of Director, Mr. Razim Buksh, the Unit has grown from strength to strength 
<br/>in carrying out its mandate with utmost robustness and passion and I applaud the Unit for the great 
<br/>work they carry out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FIU  administers  data  mining  and  data  monitoring  systems  to  generate 
<br/>meaningful  intelligence  that  is  shared  with  its  law  enforcement  partners  both  in  Fiji  and 
<br/>internationally. The FIU currently has over 20 million financial transaction records in its database.  
<br/>This information is extremely useful in profiling suspects, identifying and monitoring flow of funds, 
<br/>tracing syndicates and conducting related financial surveillance.  Through this enhanced network of 
<br/>information  and  information  sharing,  the  Unit  has  helped  enforcement  agencies  to  successfully 
<br/>convict perpetrators.  The profiling and targeting of key individuals in complex criminal activities 
<br/>through the collaboration and partnership of law enforcement agencies shows how we can disrupt 
<br/>international criminal networks in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FIU is empowered under the FTR Act to enter into bilateral MOUs with 
<br/>foreign counterparts and foreign law enforcement agencies to exchange information, relevant to the 
<br/>prevention, investigation and prosecution of offences related to money laundering and other serious 
<br/>criminal activities and this has led to bilateral MOUs with the 163 FIUs internationally including 
<br/>their Chinese counterparts, China Anti-Money Laundering, Monitoring and Analysis Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FIU has also engaged in local MOUs with agencies such as Post Fiji and as stated by 
<br/>Director Buksh, these are important steps in protecting Fiji from money laundering.  The MOU with 
<br/>Post Fiji will assist the FIU to assess what are the excess, additional information such as money order 
<br/>transactions and postal service data when conducting intelligence analysis on case by case basis to 
<br/>ensure the safety and security of all Fiji residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand the FIU has signed similar MOUs with 12 other agencies and stakeholders.  I 
<br/>hope we will see more local MOUs with FIU to ensure the core aim of the FIU to collate financial 
<br/>intelligence and provide this to law enforcement agencies for their investigation and prosecution of 
<br/>financial crimes and the tracing and for future of proceeds of these crimes is fulfilled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker, Sir, 2020 brought its own unique challenges to the organisation as we were hit 
<br/></span><span>by the COVID-19 pandemic.  As most people started working from home and perhaps spending more 
<br/>time on the internet, there is a great shift in our everyday lives as we now, more than ever before rely 
<br/>on internet even to purchase food.   The online scams are harsh reality of this new era of technology 
<br/>and it is rather unfortunate that hardworking individuals are being scam almost every day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  recommended  by  our  Committee,  we  encourage  FIU  to  continue  to 
<br/>engage in vigorous awareness sessions through social media platforms, webinars, virtual talk shows 
<br/>and awareness campaigns to  ensure that people do not fall victims to horrible online scams and that 
<br/>all Fijians understand the risk and the scope of fraudulent rate activities and scams.  The FIU also 
<br/>contributes to the Sustainable Development Goal No. 16 – peace, justice and strong institutions. In 
<br/>particular  target  number  16.4  which  aims  to  significantly  reduce  illicit  financial  and  arms  law, 
<br/>strengthening the recovery and return of stolen assets and combat all forms of organised crimes by 
<br/>2030.  With these words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again commend FIU for the great work they carry 
<br/>out and I wish them well for the year ahead. Thank you.

<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I rise to contribute to the motion on FIU.  I thank the Chairman 
<br/>and the Committee for the Report before us.  Before I go onto that, I would like to emphasise and 
<br/>stress the assertion made by the other side of the House on FDB that we threaten its existence, no we 
<br/>do not.  That was the kind of reasoning also they expressed on Fiji Airways when we debated the 
<br/>guarantee for them.  So, what we are concerned about is the prudent financial management of this 
<br/>nation, debt management and proper economic management and that has been provided in various 
<br/>reports including the ADB Report.
