<div><span>2020 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>Assessing the Office of the Auditor-General - SAI Performance Measurement Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  outset,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the 
<br/>Committee review report on the 2020 Annual Report of the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) 
<br/>and  Assessing  the  office  of  the  Auditor-General  -  Supreme  Audit  Institution  (SAI)  performance 
<br/>management framework (PMF). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee reviewed and consolidated the two above-mentioned reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This consolidated report provides the details of the review that was carried out by the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG is established under the Section 151 of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and 
<br/>the Audit  Act  1969 further specifies the powers of the Auditor-General  to  audit the whole of the 
<br/>Government financial statements and the report of all entities of the Government.  It also empowers 
<br/>the Auditor-General to conduct performance audit of Government entities to assure the Parliament 
<br/>that the entities are achieving their objectives effectively, economically and in compliance with all

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevant legislations. However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Auditor-General does not have the 
<br/>mandate to scrutinise or question the policies of the Government as per the Audit Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Auditor-General  is  responsible  on  behalf  of  Parliament  to  audit  the  accounts  of  all 
<br/>Government  agencies,  State  Owned  Entities,  Statutory  Authorities,  Municipal  and  Provincial 
<br/>Councils, except for their own Office and those entities that may be exempted by law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Auditor-General carried out the audit in accordance with the relevant provisions of the 
<br/>standards  on  auditing  issued  by  the  Fiji  Institute  of  Accountants  or  other  relevant  standards 
<br/>considered appropriate.  Moreover, Section 152 of the Constitution of the Republic of Fiji states and 
<br/>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At least once in every year, the Auditor-General shall inspect, audit and report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament on –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the public accounts of the State;  
<br/>the control of public money and public property of the State; and  
<br/>all transactions with or concerning the public money or public property of the State.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, SAI plays a critical role in strengthening governance, accountability and   
<br/>transparency. As such, the Office of the Auditor-General is expected to promote transparency and 
<br/>accountability through good governance of its own affairs in an ethical manner in order to fulfil its 
<br/>mandate. To assist in this crucial role, it is important that OAG led by example and be are a model 
<br/>organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision to undergo the SAI PMF assessment was made by the Auditor-General in order 
<br/>to provide an independent assessment of the current operations and audit practises of Fiji’s OAG 
<br/>against  the  international  standards,  specifically    the  International  Standards  for  Supreme  Audit 
<br/>Institutions (ISSAI) and other established international good practises for public auditing. For the 
<br/>OAG’s  independence  and  legal  framework,  the  work  to  update  and  modernise  Fiji’s  audit 
<br/>legislations- the Audit Act 1969 commenced before the SAI PMF assessment, was initiated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  was  carried  out  by  a  legal  consultant  and  funded  by  SAI  and  it  had  already 
<br/>considered three key issues for improvement identified from the assessment. The OAG has submitted 
<br/>the result of the reviewed Audit  Act  1969 to  Ministry of Economy for submission to  Cabinet. In 
<br/>terms of financial independence, the office now receives a one-line budget, a separate bank account 
<br/></span><span>and accounting/payroll providing the Auditor-General some financial independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For information, the OAG now prepares its annual financial statements using </span><span>International 
<br/>Financial Reporting Standards</span><span> (IFRS) for Small and Medium sized Entities as financial reporting 
<br/>framework.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  OAG  is  funded  through  an  annual  appropriation  by 
<br/>Parliament. This enables the OAG to fulfil its audit mandate on public sector entities that includes 
<br/>financial  audit,  performance  audit  and  follow-up  audit.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee,  after 
<br/>carrying out a thorough review of the OAG 2020 - Annual Report and the Supreme Audit Institution 
<br/>Performance  Management  Framework,  the  Committee  in  bipartisan  approach  agreed  on  the 
<br/>following recommendations:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The OAG to amend their strategic plan to ensure that its audit mandate is not disrupted due 
<br/>to unforeseen circumstances and events like COVID-19 pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Proper training plan to be developed to be in line with the audit training needs of the staff 
<br/>so that they are able to better improve their performance and productivity.
