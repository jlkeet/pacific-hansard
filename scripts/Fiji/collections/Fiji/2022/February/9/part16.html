<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – 
<br/>MINISTRY OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSPORT 2015-2017 ANNUAL REPORTS</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  start,  let  me  just  ask  the  honourable 
<br/>Premilar Kumar to look into a petition here from the market vendors in regards to the Suva Market.  
<br/>It will be coming your way soon, honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, if I can just touch on the situation in Wailotua.  We know that dialogue 
<br/>has occurred a number of times on what needs to be done because every time it floods, Wailotua is 
<br/>the first village to suffer in that part of Wainibuka.  But what struck was that, water comes in very 
<br/>quickly to drown out the village and they have to run to the hills - to the higher grounds.  I just ask if 
<br/>they could be provided with a boat to help them move around when the water level rises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that every time it rains, Wailotua is flooded.  I believe a boat with the outboard 
<br/>motor will help them, as we know that climate change is going to bring a lot more flooding.  Speaking 
<br/></span><span>with my colleague from Ba, honourable Viam Pillay, Ba has been flooded three times over the last 
<br/></span><span>couple of days.  So, it is climate change, I just need to have the equipment to help our people move 
<br/>around during the flooding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we all saw a case in Rakiraki where the firefighters and the police were transporting a 
<br/>dead body over a half-sawn water tank.  They were wading into the flooded water and there was no 
<br/>boat.  It was a water tank that they cut in half to transport someone to hospital, a pregnant woman 
<br/>and also a dead body. Where you are going to have flood, Wailotua is one, so a boat would be suitable 
<br/>as the equipment during the flooding.  Also the evacuation centre if it can be … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, just stick to what is out there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It is all part of infrastructure, Mr. Speaker.  On infrastructure, we all 
<br/>know that it is in a deplorable state, we all know that and let me just focus on the roads.  The 80 per 
<br/>cent of the vehicles on the roads in Fiji are low.  Cars - sedans, they are not SUVs, they are not trucks 
<br/>and they suffer very badly from the conditions of the road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two items that I would like to see improved immediately are the road humps, they are not 
<br/>suitable for low cars, they are of various sizes, we should try and create humps in uniformed manner.  
<br/>We have all been overseas, we know the humps are not what we have in Fiji. If you hit the humps in 
<br/>the  wrong  angle,  it  can  virtually  remove  the  axel  or  whatever  of  your  car.    I  would  ask  that  we 
<br/>immediately focus on the humps.  A good example is in Korovisilou right in front of Ratu Latianara 
<br/>Memorial School.  There is a hump there that is very gentle, that should be the standard throughout 
<br/>Fiji and I tell you what, for SODELPA that will be our first focus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not going to build all these massive kind of infrastructure while we miss out on items 
<br/>like humps.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can say today is that 90 per cent of the humps in Fiji are not painted.  
<br/>I believe everyone agrees with me. If you are driving at night, it is just too bad, the bottom part of 
<br/>your car. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order!

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>545 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about infrastructure here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Nowhere in this Report does it talk 
<br/>about humps.  Secondly, the honourable Member mentioned the figure of 90 per cent, does he have 
<br/>an actual survey to attest to that kind of figure that you are saying here in our national Parliament.  
<br/>Those two issues are my points of order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I am a motorist, I drive a lot and I can tell you, out of 
<br/>every  ten,  you  come  across  one  will  be  painted  and  badly  painted.    That  is  contributing  to  the 
<br/>deplorable state of the infrastructure and  I am  talking today and  I know  that the vast  majority of 
<br/>motorists in this country agree with me because not everyone drives a truck or SUV.  They all drive 
<br/>low cars like mine unlike the honourable Ministers, you drive around in your SUVs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  they  should  immediately  improve  on  the  humps.    Let  us  be  proud  of  our 
<br/>standard, please some humps you hit it at any angle, some humps you can hit it straight, because if 
<br/></span><span>you hit it straight it takes your whatever under your car.  It should not have that, we have all been to 
<br/></span><span>Australia and New Zealand and we know how they build their humps, so please do them quickly. If 
<br/>not, we know that change is coming but our first year in office, we will focus on the humps all over 
<br/>Fiji and I tell you what, as I said the motorists today agree with me with what I am saying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the potholes, I just drove back from Sigatoka over the weekend and at the 
<br/>Outrigger Hotel, it was alright when I came down, one day later it had broken up into many areas.  I 
<br/>can guarantee you this, when we come into office there will be no pothole… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- …that is left unattended for one day, one day, one day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Somebody dug a hole across my village, seven or eight months ago, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no one has buried it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who dug it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- That is immaterial. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Somebody connected the water… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-… Mr. Speaker, are they saying go to Navuevu, it is adjacent to my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Who dug the hole? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Somebody connected the water from this side to that side and it has 
<br/>been eight months, no one has done anything about it.  The honourable Acting Prime Minister is now 
<br/>telling us… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- …reminds us the attitude of FijiFirst.  If there is a hole in the road, it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is too bad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I mean the Prime Minister is saying that.  It has been eight months.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, this is a worry if the Deputy Prime Minister believes in that.  If you have the hole too 
<br/>bad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, we are now in 2021 and I see our road people using 
<br/>crowbars  on  the  road,  surely  there  must  machinery  that  can  be  used  to  fix  the  potholes,  not  the 
<br/>crowbars.  Crowbars are 1940 and 1950, I mean this is 2021. What we will do in SODELPA, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is re-equate FRA and have trucks patrolling up and down so that whenever there is hole, 
<br/>there is   a temporary fix right  away and then to  be confirmed  with  the permanent  paste.  That  is 
<br/>SODELPA policy.  No hole will be left… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-…uncovered at night.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- There you are.  The people of Fiji are watching, complaining about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the potholes and it is hilarious to the FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The people of Fiji are watching FijiFirst laughing at the potholes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>situation in this country.  You are laughing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- We are laughing at you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I am talking about potholes, the safety and the comfort of our people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Fiji and FijiFirst led by the honourable Acting Prime Minister…

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>547 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-… is laughing at this issue. I am sure what they are saying today, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, is shame on you FijiFirst. Shame on you.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  little  things  like  road  signage.  You  get  lost  in  this 
<br/>country,  simple  things  like  road  signage,  you  do  not  even  have  it.    When  the  Minister  for 
<br/>Infrastructure, when he gets going with his MBA speech like everything is so perfect in this world.  
<br/>You do not even have road signage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, SODELPA is right, it is time for change, you guys you need to go.  Yesterday 
<br/></span><span>we were all here and then I got this text from the village of Malomalo, “Please, ask the Minister for 
<br/></span><span>Infrastructure, we have been asking for water since 2015, nothing has happened’.  What happened 
<br/>here, Mr. Speaker, is that, the water to Natadola passes through Malomalo Village, it passes through 
<br/>their land but it only goes to the hotel, it does not go to the village.  So, we ask the question, if you 
<br/>build a business or a complex or something like that in the rural areas and you connect it to the water 
<br/>and all those stuff, do you deny the villagers that service?  Is that a FijiFirst policy?  Similar case in 
<br/>Momi, water to Marriot, people of Bavu said can we have a bit of that water and they were told no, 
<br/>do not spoil the water to the hotel, you might affect the water to the hotel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Who paid for that infrastructure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  it  will  be  the  policy  of  SODELPA  that  when  we 
<br/>develop something in the rural areas, the local villages will also benefit.  Here they are, the villagers, 
<br/>going to the well and they see this pipe running through and this is the area where they spent $45 
<br/>million for the rich and famous to come and play golf and yet people are throwing their buckets in 
<br/>the well to pull out their water.  This is the reality of life in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are so full of themselves that they do not see this, Mr. Speaker.  I always remember 
<br/>when  I  talk  about  tourism  and  the  development  and  the  connections  to  the  local  communities,  a 
<br/>conference  I  attended in Kuala  Lumpur, tourism  –  big one and Prime Minister Mahathir  was the 
<br/>keynote speaker.  He said we will do all these for tourism, bring up your comforts and appointment 
<br/>and all that stuff but at the same time, you do not want the Malays to be swatting mosquitoes while 
<br/>everyone is  enjoying the air-conditioned  rooms.  Well, this  is  what  is  happening in Fiji.   You are 
<br/>building for the tourist people, we are neglecting our very own people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just ask the Government to redirect its effort, do the small things 
<br/>properly. The finishing in this country on infrastructure is quite shocking.  If you go onto any road 
<br/>in Fiji and you see where the bridge joins with the road, where the road ends and there is a bridge, it 
<br/>is a hump, you got to be careful, you got to hit it slowly.  The finishing is very poor.  We are spending 
<br/>so much money, they hype about the infrastructure spending they have done but the quality of the 
<br/>work, the finishing is very poor.  This is my plea to the FijiFirst Government, do it properly, finishing 
<br/>properly  and  when  you  develop  an  area  in  the  rural  areas,  be  inclusive,  include  the  villages  and 
<br/>settlements in whatever you bring into the area - water, electricity and what not.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  T.V.  KEPA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.  You  know  when  the  previous  speaker 
<br/>before me talked about  Wailotua, the flooding,   the boat,  the engine,  Korovisilou and potholes,  I 
<br/>looked over at honourable Attorney-General, he was like half asleep but then when the honourable 
<br/>Member spoke about his village, I saw him suddenly jump up.  I was thinking maybe he has some 
<br/>vested  interest  in  that  particular  part  of  the  country  and  then  when  you  started  talking  about  the 
<br/>crowbar and then I saw him laughing his head off, so, I am wondering if there is a crowbar under his 
<br/>table over there, Mr. Speaker.  I know you have an interest there, honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this Report, I am just looking also at the report that was formulated by 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social and I thank them for this Report, Mr. Speaker.  I am going to be 
<br/>just dealing very briefly on some of the issues that were brought up by honourable Tikoduadua and 
<br/>this is to do with page 14 of the Report which states with some concern, the removal of the Principal 
<br/>Engineer Regulatory position from the Ministry of Infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  position,  Mr.  Speaker,  was  removed  not  by  the  relevant  line  Minister  or  Ministry  of 
<br/>Infrastructure  but  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  in  2020-2021  financial  year.    This  post  is  a 
<br/>professional  post  in  the  Department  and  the  importance  of  this  post  was  also  highlighted  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Minister of Economy during their budget discussions and they were asked to please reinstate that 
<br/></span><span>particular position but I believe to this day it is still vacant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this particular Report, Mr. Speaker, it says on page No.15 some of the core responsibilities 
<br/>of this Principal Engineer Regulatory.  Some of it, Mr. Speaker, includes the following that he should: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Actively manage, monitor and assess staff performance to enable business continuity, and 
<br/>delivery of quality outcomes aligned with individual and business objectives. 
<br/>Research,  develop,  implement  and  monitor  policies,  regulations  and  guidelines  aligned 
<br/>with national and strategic plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Assessment  of  Water  Supply  Management  Plans  for  approval  and  monitoring  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation of rural water and sanitation projects. 
<br/>Performance Monitoring  of WAF’s  capital projects, expenditure  and inspection WAF’s 
<br/>water and sewerage facilities. 
<br/>Coordinate  stakeholders’  consultation  and  forums  on  water  and  sanitation  policies  and 
<br/>guidelines and provide technical advice to stakeholders on water and sanitation issues. 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Actively  contribute  to  the  Ministry  and  corporate  requirements,  including  planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budgeting and human resource activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there was a whole range of things that this particular engineer has to do, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Report  further  notes  that  the  Director  for  Water  and  Sewerage  has  managed  the 
<br/>responsibilities of the role with the assistance of the technical staff. However, without the Principal 
<br/>Engineer Regulatory post being vacant, it becomes very difficult besides trying to do their jobs, this 
<br/>one  is  vacant.    So,  this  a  professional  post,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  requires  degree  qualification  and 
<br/>experience at the level of Deputy Director.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of the responsibilities are now carried out  by other staff members but we know that 
<br/>when other staff members whose core function is elsewhere and their job description says something 
<br/>else, then there is no one directly responsible so big cracks, Mr. Speaker start happening  and big 
<br/>things fall through those cracks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The removal of the post has affected work on the coordination of research on low cost and 
<br/>user  friendly  water  treatment  technologies  and  development  of  pilot  project  proposals  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implementation,  development  of  policy  guidelines,  code  of  practice  and  monitoring  compliance, 
<br/>donors and stakeholders contributions and coordination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the major roles of the post is the monitoring of the Annual Work Programmes of WAF.  
<br/>Budget and expenditure, as well as the inspection of the capital projects. The senior officers are able 
<br/>to analyse but they fall short on the inspection of urban capital projects.  Sir, if they falling short on 
<br/>the urban can we imagine the inspection of the rural.  So, in this regard, Mr. Speaker, they are unable 
<br/>to  carry  out  inspection  of  rural  water  and  sanitation  capital  projects  under  WAF  and  other 
<br/>implementing agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendation, Mr. Speaker, is that they recognise the Ministry’s need for the position 
<br/>of Principal Engineer Regulatory to be filled and recommend that further discussions be undertaken 
<br/>with the Ministry of Economy to ensure that this position is filled at all times.  In this regard, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, because that position is vacant, we have been having water cuts in Rewa and ongoing low 
<br/>pressure  and  no  water  in  taps,  </span><span>vakaturuturu</span><span>  they  call  it  in  the  village.    Honourable  Minister 
<br/></span><span>vakaturuturu </span><span>until morning affecting workers and school children and this has lasted between the 
<br/>three to four months.  This is the real story in the village, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Rewa there is an old line they call it the </span><span>laini makawa</span><span> and this </span><span>laini makawa</span><span> comes from 
<br/>Kalabu to Naililili and to some other villages.  The new line with the key near the Josaia Church 
<br/>affects villages downstream and these villages, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are the ones that I am addressing 
<br/>here.  They are the villages of Lomanikoro, Nasigatoka, Nabua, Nasilai, Drekena, Nadoi, Vunuku, 
<br/>Tavuya,  Narocivo,  Nukui  and  villages  in  Vutia  which  are  Muana-i-cake  and  Muana-i-ra.    Also 
<br/>affected are villages in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Burebasaga, Noco, Dreketi and Toga and because we are all in 
<br/>the same delta area Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the areas of Tokatoka would be affected as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue that we have Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the water meter disconnections.  They are 
<br/>saying that there is no prior warning, just a sudden disconnection. So, please honourable Minister 
<br/>can you have a look at that also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, this is on water bills, living in Suva and other urban areas, our water 
<br/>bills arrive regularly so we do not have any problems with water bills but it is in the villages that your 
<br/>water bill could arrive maybe six months or one or two years later and in that regard the bill is quite 
<br/>high, maybe $3,000 or $4,000.  And trying to pay it off in instalments and you do not get a receipt 
<br/>for it, there is no update, it becomes very difficult.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the villagers used to talk about this in the </span><span>Bose Vakoro,</span><span> I could not believe that anyone 
<br/>would get a water bill for $3,000 or $4,000 because water bills in Suva are not that much but then 
<br/>when I started getting my water bill and it was very  high, I would just bring it to the attention of the 
<br/>honourable Minister if they could find a better way of informing the villagers as to what state their 
<br/>water bill is in so that they do not get these cuts and then it becomes very difficult.  They have water 
<br/>in the river, rain is falling regularly now but when there is no water in the tap and then you have this 
<br/>huge bill, some of them do not know how to cope with that because it comes all of a sudden.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I would just ask the honourable Minister if he could have a look at that and see how they 
<br/>could work with the Provincial Office because that is where most of the water bills are sent and work 
<br/>more closely with the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro.  </span><span> We know that these bills have to be paid but just that they 
<br/>are paid on time then they do not have a disconnection and our people do not go and starting cutting 
<br/>the pipes because they need water which is a basic need.  I will just ask the Minister if he could look 
<br/>into that.  I stand in support of the motion.

<div><span>HON. A. JALE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution is going to be very short.  I would like to 
<br/>thank the Committee for this Report on the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.   I do understand 
<br/>there has been a change of assignments of Ministers and the roles have changed.

<div><span>I  acknowledge  the  big  work  that  you  Ministers  are  doing,  sometimes  you  cop  a  lot  of 
<br/>complaints, sometimes very less ‘thank you’.  I am sure that you do not get much ‘thank you’ but 
<br/>there are a lot of problems, a lot of complaints about the roads.   I remember the time I was appointed 
<br/>the Secretary for Public Service, and I met a former Secretary for Public Service, Winston Thompson, 
<br/>in town.  He told me, “Anare, do you know that the role of Secretary of Public Service is just like 
<br/>one sitting at the end of a sewer line?”  I came to know about it later. It is like someone sitting at the 
<br/>end of the sewer line and I am sure that you Ministers are feeling the same way now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will now talk about Report that talks about the audit that was undertaken but I will be talking 
<br/>about water. I think it is so essential for living. I must commend the Agriculture Census Report. I 
<br/>think some of us had had a read of that report. Very interesting statistics have come through about 
<br/>the availability of water around Fiji. There are some who are very fortunate because they have natural 
<br/>sources, some depend on rain. When they do not have rain, they do not have water. So I think that 
<br/></span><span>report need to be looked at because it is a very good platform for us to plan things for the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Water Authority pipeline in Vanuabalavu is connecting a lot villages but for years, two 
<br/>villages  that  are  connected  to  that  pipeline  have  not  been  getting  water-  Narociva  and  Namalata. 
<br/>When they were not getting water, what the villagers of Narociva did, they came to the Department 
<br/>of the Mineral Resources. They came to ask them if they could dig or drill a borehole at the village. 
<br/>They managed to find a source of water there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So what happened, they wanted to connect the water from the borehole to the pipeline that 
<br/>had already been laid by WAF. Then the commotion came about.  These two did not agree. WAF did 
<br/>not allow them to use to the line. These two departments, as you know, are under the same Ministry. 
<br/>I am asking the Government, these are the things that the people need in terms services. It is you and 
<br/>us. Try to help the people and see that proper service is given to the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The hurdles  as  I  have already communicated to you,  I am just putting this across because 
<br/>some of you have more role. There are a lot of roles and departments that come under your side. I 
<br/>am pointing this out to the Minister responsible.  I took up this problem with the Minister responsible, 
<br/>I am not too sure where the situation is right now. I am asking and I am pleading to you - see that the 
<br/>people are not made to run around for services. Our problem is something that you need to sort out - 
<br/>it is not the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be short too. Thank you for allowing me 
<br/>this time to contribute to this Committee report on Infrastructure and Transport, in particular, the 
<br/>recommendations on the Acts that are now with Solicitor-General. The WAF Act needs to be dealt 
<br/>with quickly so that the people within the water department can be more efficient and effective in the 
<br/>way that they do their processes and systems in dealing with the water supply to the population of 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that legal people do their work quickly. I think it has been there for a long time. 
<br/>I  do not  know what is  holding up the delay.    It  has  been drafted properly,  amendments  made,  et 
<br/>cetera, but  I want to emphasise here that it is important to get the amendments ready and come to 
<br/>Parliament for whatever Regulations that is required to be improved and approved.  It is important 
<br/>that  the  Water  Supply  Development  Plan  is  there  because  water  is  essential  to  everyone.    Land 
<br/>development is also ongoing and as people want to build their houses, they need water, so it is very 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>551 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>essential.  At  the  moment,  we  are  experiencing  stoppages,  low  pressure,  et  cetera.    It  is  probably 
<br/>because of lack of sources or supply to the reservoir.  So, it is important to plan well ahead before 
<br/>the developers come in as developments need to be approved with the provision of water sources 
<br/>upfront. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  recommendation  to  review  the  Maritime  Act  and  34 
<br/>Regulations, again, the delay is with the Solicitor General’s Office.  It is important to get this Act 
<br/>and  Regulations  approved  so  that  professionals  within  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji can do their work more efficiently and effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While still on that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to look at the jetty in Vanuabalavu, 
<br/>which still needs repair.  Also, the shifting of the jetty from Tubou to Wainiyabia is important as it 
<br/>will also improve the facilities out there at the Natovi and Nabouwalu waiting area.  Why can we not 
<br/>enlarge three or four lane in Nabouwalu and have two boat berthing places because of the density of 
<br/>traffic of boats going to Nabouwalu and Natovi?  It is important to improve all those as we go along. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just touching on the roads, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate that the roads have been improved 
<br/></span><span>in some places, better gravelled, better drainage, some are even tarsealed with roads that have been 
<br/></span><span>established there by previous governments and I thank the improvements that have been made. That 
<br/>is what the Government should do to continue improving whatever is there and build new ones as 
<br/>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot more roads need to be improved also both, in the urban and rural areas.  I wish to bring 
<br/>into focus the road at Navakasiga, Bua.  The honourable Minister knows these roads very well - the 
<br/>road to Wainunu in Bua and also Kubulau.   I am stating this now and I would withdraw my written 
<br/>question that is later to be asked, and I will just follow up with the letter to the honourable Minister 
<br/>with regards to those roads in Navakasiga, Wainunu and Kubulau Road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  bridges,  the  bridge  on  that  road  which  is  over  water,  it  is  important  to  build  bridges 
<br/>particularly in Wainimala, Sawanikula to Nakorovou.  There are two or three villages and settlements 
<br/>up  there  with  a  school  and  nursing  station.    Also,  the  Nabilodra  Bridge  in  Namuavoivoi  to  the 
<br/>Wainunu side, so I will follow it up with a letter later on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to build those bridges in particular a bridge in Nanivuda and 
<br/>Nakavika in Seaqaqa.  There was a clip in the radio yesterday about some girls crossing a flooded 
<br/>river which is very risky.  We need a bridge there from Nanivuda to Nakavika.  You must make sure 
<br/>that you build bridges so that we do not forget some Fijians and it is important that no one is left 
<br/>behind. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a need to widen roads, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  There are lots of queues and congestion in 
<br/>between Suva, Nausori and Lami.  Why can you not build another road between Princes Road and 
<br/>Ratu Mara Road?  The plan is already there, so you can do it slowly every year.  Why can we not 
<br/>open up Viti Levu and Vanua Levu with roads?  If you open up land for sugarcane and agriculture.  
<br/>You will find a lot of water resources there to help the people all along, Mr. Speaker.  It is important 
<br/>to open the up the road from Nadi, Lautoka to Suva and link all the other towns around Viti Levu to 
<br/>provide the necessary infrastructure, not only for roads but for tourism as well, water, agriculture, 
<br/>forestry, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  I already mentioned, I withdraw my Written Question No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31/2022, as I will write direct to the honourable Minister. Thank you, Sir.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief since most of the issues have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been covered by previous speakers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My contribution will just like to highlight that in regards to the Ministry of Infrastructure and 
<br/>Transport which FRA comes under, I believe FRA is one of those that gets the bulk of our national 
<br/>budget.  They are always looking at about over $600 million in a budgetary year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also heard a robust debate in the House in regards to economic growth, particularly 
<br/>when  we  raise  the  issue  on  the  report  by  ADB  in  regards  to  (maybe  I  can  say)  deteriorating  the 
<br/>economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ordinary citizens in regards to economic growth, their greatest measure or 
<br/>maybe their only measure is equated to public service delivery.  The level of public service delivery, 
<br/>that equates or tells any ordinary citizen about economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as mentioned by my previous colleagues in regards to our roads, the only issue 
<br/>I would like to highlight to raise here is the increase in accidents and the increased death rate.  The 
<br/></span><span>other speakers have highlighted on pot holes, et cetera  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Road accidents may be recent but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good that the Government takes note 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of that because the conditions of our roads could be a contributing factor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue is on road congestion, the traffic jam as highlighted by honourable Bulanauca.  
<br/>These are the important issues which according to ordinary citizens on the streets, they are concerned 
<br/>about this and that the level of Government service  delivery in that regard tells them simply that is 
<br/>the economic growth that we are faced with right now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on water supply, we know that the greater Suva area and even beyond, are 
<br/>continuously faced with intermittent water cuts and also out there in the rural area. For example, in 
<br/>Nabouwalu whenever it rains, there are water cuts but interestingly   enough, that does not reflect in 
<br/>the rate that we pay for our water bills.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to acknowledge the Bula  ko Lau Group that have reached out and supplied 
<br/>drinking water bottles to all our maritime islands, particularly to the schools, as we endeavour the 
<br/>opening of schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on rural water supply, I know I have brought this up in the House before in regards to 
<br/>the Yacata Island water supply. Everything is connected.  There is a borehole, the pipes are being 
<br/>laid but the problem is the solar pump that has not been working for a quite number of years now, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. I kindly request the honourable Minister if that could be looked into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to jetties, I know the Lomaloma Jetty has been mentioned but I 
<br/>would like to enlighten us that this Jetty was damaged way back in 2015, I had brought this up in the 
<br/>House and that resulted in a temporary repair.  At that time, there was a different Minister then, the 
<br/>honourable  Tikoduadua.    After  that  it  was  promised  in  the  House  that  it  will  be  looked  into  for 
<br/>permanent  repair,  unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  up  until  now,  nothing  has  been  done.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services visited Vanuabalavu recently, so can attest to 
<br/>that, and the dangers that  is  involved, particularly  in  regards to  the berthing of big boats  like the 
<br/></span><span>Lomaiviti Princess.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On passenger shelters, I know I have been bringing this up but until now, there is still not 
<br/>much improvement, even though honourable Usamate has always said in the House that this will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>553 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>looked into.  Until now, nothing much has really moved in regards to the provision of the passenger 
<br/>shelters and jetties, particularly in rural maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  kept  on  saying  this  morning  that  we  should  hang  our  head  in  shame 
<br/>because of whatever we said but,  honourable Usamate as the Minister responsible, should hang his 
<br/>head in shame for not measuring up to his commitment and to the promises he had made in regards 
<br/>to  providing  those  services  to  the  people,  because  no  matter  what  you  say  that  tantamounts  to 
<br/>economic  growth  that  you  said    has  grown,  but  according  to  the  service  delivery,  you  have  not 
<br/>measured up to that and that is how ordinary people are going to look at your economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  T.  NAVURELEVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Social Affairs for the completion of this Report.  Before I continue, my contribution will be very 
<br/>short due to  the fact  that the Report has been outstanding since 2015, and that we have so many 
<br/>agenda in the Order Paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I continue, I think we have requested continuously in this House to the Government, 
<br/>to the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Attorney-General, if he can give directive to 
<br/></span><span>Departments and Ministries to provide their annual report on time so that we can deliberate on the 
<br/></span><span>report a year after.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  note  that  one  of  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  is  to  work  in  strengthening  the 
<br/>internal control and ensure that proper monitoring process is put in place.  This was highlighted via 
<br/>the qualified opinion by the Office of the Auditor-General, only audited Financial Statement of the 
<br/>Ministry for the financial year ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, internal controls are the mechanisms, rules and the procedures implemented 
<br/>by  the  organisation  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  finance  and  accounting  information  promote 
<br/>accountability and prevents fraud.  Internal controls are intended to prevent errors and irregularities, 
<br/>identify  problems  and  ensure  that  corrective  action  is  taken.    So  the  need  to  strengthen  internal 
<br/>controls in an organisation is very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other recommendation that I wish to highlight is the need for Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji (WAF) (as alluded to by previous speakers) and the Ministry of Infrastructure to 
<br/>ensure that water tanks are installed in all remote maritime schools, rainwater harvesting and storage 
<br/>whilst awaiting alternative arrangement by WAF and donors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Noting the information in the Report, as has been alluded to in this House before me, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that a total of 35 schools in Lau, Lomaiviti, Tailevu, Macuata, Bua, Cakaudrove, Ba 
<br/>and Nadroga province do not have access to running water.  Data collection verification in schools 
<br/>will  be  carried  out  and  relevant  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  implementing  agencies 
<br/>including Water Authority of Fiji, donors and NGOs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been after five years since we are debating on this Report and I hope 
<br/>the Ministry had delivered on this recommendation and all 35 schools now have access to running 
<br/>water whether through tanks, taps or other feasible means of drinking water.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish 
<br/>to speak on a few issues I think is relevant to be brought up, it is relevant with this Report and I think 
<br/>it has to be highlighted in this House because it needs immediate action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The roads. I travelled from Namuka to Labasa on Monday and noticed that the road was in a 
<br/>very poor condition with poor drainage and a lot of potholes.  The portion of the road at Qelemumumu 
<br/>which was recently upgraded last  year has started deteriorating because it was in the last stage of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>554 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been tarsealed and was left in that condition.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I raised this issue in this House during 
<br/>the  last  sitting  for  the  honourable  Minister  to  follow  up  and  give  directive  for  tarsealing.    When 
<br/>coming across Labasa Town, there are potholes here and there.  I think the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General will agree with me because he was in the Northern Division last week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the road to Nadogo, Vagani and Valovoni which I have highlighted in this 
<br/>House needs to be upgraded to provide road access to farmers to transport their produce to the market.  
<br/>One can understand that by having good access road, it will contribute dearly to the growth of our 
<br/>economy.  More than 100 farmers in that interior of Vanua Levu desperately need good access roads.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Water Supply - in the last several years villages are still waiting for the Vuci section 
<br/>for survey. There is a need for improvement for water system starting from the water catchment and 
<br/>to the village.  The pipe system was installed 20 to 30 years ago.  It needs to be improved to provide 
<br/>clean drinking water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  electrification.    The  electricity  grid  line  now  installed  from 
<br/>Wainikoro  along  Lagalaga,  Nakelikoso  and  Nubu  village  and  to  Navukebuli  village.    Today  the 
<br/></span><span>villages are waiting for contractors to do wiring and install power to their homes.  Since the grid is 
<br/></span><span>only 10 to 15 kilometres away from the </span><span>tikina</span><span> of Namuka and Dogotuki, I request if it can be extended 
<br/>to those two </span><span>tikina</span><span>.  Though we are provided with solar power, the solar power has been installed by 
<br/>the Ministry of Energy and has not been maintained for several years now and most are not working.  
<br/>I  request  the  honourable  Minister  to  consider  these  issues  which  are  the  needs  of  the  vulnerable 
<br/>people in the rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly to conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would rather say no matter how fancy and how clever 
<br/>the honourable Attorney-General and speakers from the other side, trying to lecture us in this august 
<br/>House, the reality of our economy, its status is outside and that is what our people see, the poor road 
<br/>condition, unhealthy condition of our health facilities, very poor conditions of government quarters 
<br/>and the huge staff turnover.  With all those words, Mr. Speaker, I recommend the Report before this 
<br/>august House.</span><span> Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all I just want to say ‘thank you’ to  honourable 
<br/>Gavoka for lightening the mood this afternoon with the potholes and the humps, Sir.  I got a text 
<br/>message that said, “Bill’s got the hump over humps.”  I could not stop laughing but it was unjust, 
<br/>honourable Gavoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate on this particular Report and I 
<br/>thank the Standing Committee for the Report.  Tthe Standing Committee is thanked for reviewing 
<br/>the Report for the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and my contribution today is specifically 
<br/>the Department of Transport and Government Shipping Services who, in April 2020, as part of the 
<br/>Government’s reform became part of the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know transport is critical to providing essential services, improving 
<br/>trade, tourism and access to domestic and international markets and the Department of Transport as 
<br/>stated in the Report is essential in these services and it provides policy and planning and advice for 
<br/>both the land and maritime transport sectors.  So, with this responsibility  the Department actually 
<br/>coordinates and monitors the Land Transport Authority and the Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  role  has  also  included  being  a  policy  and  a  planning  advisor  of 
<br/>Government Shipping Services.  So, one important aspect of the Report and its recommendations 
<br/>focus on the plans to protect the interest of consumers as beneficiaries of shipping services and it was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>555 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>citing the review of the Maritime Transport Act and its 34 regulations and basically ask that it be 
<br/>expeditiously completed in consultation with the relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can reassure this House that this process has already begun.  First, in 
<br/>consultation with MSAF and some amendments have already been tabled before this House such as 
<br/>moving the administrative decision making powers in relation to maritime licences from the Ministry 
<br/>to  MSAF  and  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  will  actually  minimise  waiting  time  for  all  applications  for 
<br/>maritime licenses and it will also improve organisation in terms of agility and support, in employee 
<br/>growth and development for personnel involved in the process and give way for technical expertise 
<br/>deliberations,  resulting in better services delivered by MSAF to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have  also  increased  the duration of the coastal  trade licensing  and sea route licensing 
<br/>terms from 5years to 20 years.  This allows consistency with respect to the level of shipping services 
<br/>in Fiji and provides more security to licensed ship operators who have heavily invested in providing 
<br/>these  important  services.    This  can  also  be  used  as  collateral  to  investment.    These  reforms  will 
<br/>continue, Mr. Speaker, and coordination with the relevant agencies and the industry stakeholders will 
<br/>continue for the betterment of the shipping industry and maritime islands that we serve.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Report  alluded  to  whether  there  were  plans  to  protect  the  interest  of 
<br/>consumers as beneficiaries of shipping services.   Last night I spoke on the services that were being 
<br/>delivered  by  the  Government  Shipping  Franchise  Scheme  and  GSS  measures  to  ensuring  the 
<br/>passengers and cargo are moved efficiently to our maritime islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot overemphasise that the safety of passengers and cargo is actually paramount at all 
<br/>times.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in protecting the interest of consumers in the industry, it is only thorough 
<br/>that  this  Government  and  the  consumer  interest  have  been  prioritised  and  it  is  being  prioritised 
<br/>through the maritime travellers rights.  The development of the Maritime Travellers Rights builds on 
<br/>Section 34(1) of the 2013 Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has established a technical working group consisting of MSAF, the 
<br/>Consumer Council of Fiji, FCCC, Fiji Navy, Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, Fiji Ports 
<br/>Corporation Limited and Office of the Solicitor-General and MCTTT and we have conducted and 
<br/>will continue to conduct nationwide consultations on maritime travellers’ rights.  It is an ongoing 
<br/>process Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have actually completed consultations in the Western Division and I have 
<br/>received comprehensive feedbacks from our stakeholders including government officials who travel 
<br/>a lot to the maritime islands to address their grievances and also incorporate their rights in Maritime 
<br/>Travellers  Rights  Policy  and  Regulations.    COVID-19,  of  course,  has  put  a  stop  to  us  travelling 
<br/>around the country and we will resume as soon as we can.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report had alluded to the protection of seafarers and amendments of the 
<br/>Maritime Transport Act.   It  is  only through the  FijiFirst  Government  that  we are  able to  conduct 
<br/>nationwide consultations for the incorporation of the Maritime Labour Conventions into our domestic 
<br/>laws.  MCTTT and Ministry of Employment are working closely to ensure the adoption of this very 
<br/>important Convention to ensuring that all seafarer’s rights are protected.  With those few words, I 
<br/>thank you for the opportunity and I support the recommendations of the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker and thank you for the opportunity to talk to 
<br/>this  particular  paper.    I  commend  the  motion  to  the  House  for  the  Report  on  the  Review  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport 2016 – 2017 Consolidated and 2015 Annual Report.  Before

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I talk to the Report proper, I think of all the comments that have been made today from the other side, 
<br/>only the first comment referred to the Report.  All of the other comments were responding to things 
<br/>that are related to FRA or Water Authority of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  report  is  about  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  what  happens  in  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Infrastructure.  There is a distinct difference between Ministry of Infrastructure, Water Authority and 
<br/>FRA.  The Minister gives policy oversight on these entities, so the kinds of issues that have been 
<br/>brought up here ideally would have been discussed when we talked about FRA and Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji.  It is very important for you to realise that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this Parliament, we need to focus our attention on the thing at hand.  When there is an 
<br/>opportunity to talk about Water Authority of Fiji then give it, let us discuss it there.  Only the first 
<br/>speaker talked the things that are in this Report and every person, they just talked about roads and 
<br/>water, they only talked about issues in their area.   I do not know why you are doing, is it because 
<br/>everyone is listening. These issues are important, let me address, I need to make that distinction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I think one of the incompetence that I see from the other side, is that 
<br/>when we are supposed discuss this Report, you do not talk about this Report, you talk about things 
<br/>that are of interest to you only in your so-called constituency.  We need to learn as leaders to focus 
<br/>on the issue at hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issues in this Report are about the issues in the Ministry.  A lot of very important things 
<br/>were discussed in this Report about the Ministry and only the former Minister there, honourable Pio 
<br/>Tikoduadua talked about those issues.  All of you talked about operational issues for the things that 
<br/>matter to you. We need to be able to focus our attention on these things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- This is not a debate on the Water Authority of Fiji Annual Report, nor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is it a debate on Fiji Roads Authority.  It is important to make the distinction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka made his assertion about 90 per cent of the roads are not up to par or the 
<br/>humps are not painted and that is based on his driving from Sigatoka to Suva and back to Sigatoka.  
<br/>So, driving along that route, according to him 90 per cent of the humps are not painted.  I just want 
<br/>to  say  that  the  humps  that  we  have  in  Fiji,  they  are  normally  painted  along  with  the  routine 
<br/>maintenance.  When you have the routine maintenance of that road then the humps are painted.  They 
<br/>are not painted all the time.  We have thousands of kilometres of roads, FRA cannot come to your 
<br/>hump every now and then and make sure that it is painted.   It needs to establish a routine maintenance 
<br/>programme and implement that program over time because we have thousands of kilometres, 6,000 
<br/>kilometres of roads so do  not expect FRA every time, your particular hump is not paid for them to 
<br/>just come and paint your hump. They have to have a routine maintenance programme to make sure 
<br/>they cover all 6,000 kilometres throughout the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- You  do not have the system that works.

<div><span>557 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There is a system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not talking only about the roads from Sigatoka to Suva; 6,000 kilometres.  Sorry, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do not carry out a conservation between you two.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Secondly, honourable Gavoka talked about a road, a hole that was dug 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the road in his village. The question that we ask is, who dug the hole? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And we know that it was not WAF or FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The honourable Member also raised the issue of water in Malomalo. 
<br/>There is actually water that goes by Malomalo towards InterContinental Hotel. This is the same sort 
<br/>of issue that exists at Momi where the infrastructure was done by FNPF to bring water to the hotels.  
<br/>I agree with that particular issue, there were some plans initially to divert some of that water back in 
<br/>2016  to  2017.    Now,  WAF  is  looking  into  completing  that  particular  exercise,  in  particular  for 
<br/>Malomalo.  But at the same time, in the space that we have from Deuba to Sigatoka, WAF has plans 
<br/>to try to address the water situation all along that area.  Some of it will require the transfer of assets 
<br/>from FNPF to WAF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once you have transferred the existing assets to make sure that you can reticulate the water 
<br/>with  sufficient  pressure  to  all  the  settlements  and  villages,  they  have  to  build  some  tanks,  some 
<br/>reservoirs to push the water in to have adequate pressure so that it can push out to all of these areas.  
<br/>So it is not just a matter of plugging the pipeline there and fixing all the pipes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are other things that the water engineers have to do; they put in the valves, they put in 
<br/>all other stuff and then you need to put in tanks. The honourable Member is shaking his head but that 
<br/>is the reality.  Obviously, these hotels are a bit worried about pulling the water out. So that is the 
<br/>issue for Malomalo and that is also the same issue that the honourable Members has brought up for 
<br/>the Momi area.  The same sort of thing is in play and that is what WAF is working on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a lot of talk here about water and electricity. I must just remind this House that 
<br/>when we  are talking  about  electricity, poles and  et  cetera, just remember something, there is  one 
<br/>government that has made sure it is not left the rural people behind.  Remember, Monasavu electricity 
<br/>was done in the 1970s.  Everyone here was born in the 1970s? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, most of them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Sir, 1970s it was done and the people that supplied the source of that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>electricity, none of them got electricity until this Government came in.

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Remember that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a fact, it is not supposition, it is not hypothetical, it is a fact. If there 
<br/>is one government under one leader who has made sure that he can provide infrastructure to all the 
<br/>people in the rural areas it has been this Prime Minister and the Bainimarama Government and in the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also complaints made about the Sigatoka Bridge. Those bridges were not done by 
<br/>us but we have spent a lot of effort in fixing those bridges up.  Whether you are talking about Sigatoka 
<br/>Bridge, Rewa Bridge, Moto Bridge, all of these, there has been a lot of work done by FRA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We built the Moto Bridge, we rebuilt it because it was washed away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R. GAVOKA.- Unbelievable! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I do not know whether I misheard the honourable Ro Teimumu Kepa 
<br/>but  I  think  when  she  was  talking  about  water  in  the  Rewa  area,  it  seemed  to  me  that  she  was 
<br/>suggesting because we do not have that Principal Regulatory Engineer, that was the reason that we 
<br/>did not have water into the Rewa Delta.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me say this again, the provision of water into the Rewa Delta is not a function of the 
<br/>Ministry of Infrastructure.  It is the role carried out by the Water Authority of Fiji. Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji is the implementation arm of the Ministry to make sure that water gets to you.  Let me also 
<br/>tell the honourable Member, I have walked down that pipeline from Narere to make sure where it 
<br/>terminates in the Rewa Delta.  I have gone also across the creek to make sure that that was done, I 
<br/>have walked along and I made sure that the water came back on at that particular time.  But remember 
<br/>this, the Ministry of  Infrastructure has policy,  regulation  oversight.  Actual  doing  anything about 
<br/>water, it is Water Authority of Fiji.  We tell them what to do, they have to do it.  If that engineer 
<br/>position was there or not, we expect Water Authority of Fiji to do it.  I, as the Minister would give 
<br/>them that particular instruction.  So I think it is important to make that particular distinction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  issues  about  rural  water.    Water  Authority  of  Fiji  has  some  responsibilities  for 
<br/>making sure that we get water into our rural areas.  Also some of the work is done by the Ministry of 
<br/>Rural  and  Maritime  Development,  and  where  necessary,  boreholes  is  also  looked  at  by  the 
<br/>Department of Mineral Resources.  I noticed my senior old boy has started reading all if his written 
<br/>questions about the things that he had asked.  Lomaloma Jetty, which he is talking about, I can assure 
<br/>this House at the moment it is under design stage.  The Jetty is being designed and hopefully with 
<br/>the financial situation allowing, we should be able to put it into the budget in the very near future.  
<br/>Also the roads that he is talking about, for Naivaka Road, Naivaka Road, there is already a pilot.  I 
<br/>have driven along that road and I have reached Naivaka Village, early last year or the year before.  I 
<br/>cannot remember, but soon that road will be designed so it can become an all-weather type of road.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other ones that he talked about, the re-building of Nabilodra Bridge - FRA has already 
<br/>got it planned for doing that.  Waisa, Natokalau and Kubulau Roads, all of those roads are actually 
<br/>part of the Fiji Pine Logging Access Roads and we are not part of the FRA maintenance programme.  
<br/>However, FRA is working with the Commissioner Northern, land owning units and Fiji Pine to make 
<br/>sure  that  this  road  gets  vested  to  Government,  and  once  FRA  has  it,  then  they  can  look  into  the

<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>559 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maintenance.  Sir, FRA, of course will need 60 per cent written consent from the land owning units, 
<br/>so perhaps the honourable Member can help in trying to get that consent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, now to get to the issues that we were supposed to cover which are the things 
<br/>that are in  this particular Report.   I  appreciate the work of this particular Committee because the 
<br/>issues that are here, and as I am sitting here, I am not the only person who has served in this Ministry, 
<br/>honourable Bala has served and honourable Pio Tikoduadua.  If you look at the 2015 Report, you 
<br/>will see that honourable Tikoduadua was Minister there at that time.  But this issue of TMAs and the 
<br/>variances is something that a number of Ministers have tried to address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have had a big problem back in 2009 where there was a bit of funny business that went 
<br/>on in the Ministry, and in fact, there is still a court case going on where people were fraudulent in 
<br/>terms of ordering materials. Some people are now in the prison because of that but the case is still 
<br/>ongoing.  As a result of that, it still has this issue about the TMAs.  So it is a legacy issue.  It is 12 
<br/>years, our finance people at the Ministry are telling us that they have measures in place and they are 
<br/>working together with  the Ministry of Economy.   Perhaps some of these issues might  have to  be 
<br/>written off because the records are no longer there in some particular cases, especially for the TMAs.  
<br/></span><span>Some of the issues such as VAT receivable balances, I think that particular issue has been sorted out.  
<br/></span><span>And all of these things have arisen from the FICAC cases that came at that particular point in time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rather than deal with each of the individual issues that are here, if I just go 
<br/>straight to the recommendations of this Report.  The first one, to prevent the recurrence of such audit 
<br/>issues, the Committee recommends that the Ministry continue to strengthen its internal controls and 
<br/>ensure proper monitoring processes are put in place.  I agree entirely with this recommendation.  This 
<br/>is something that ever since we walked into the Ministry we have been pushing.  Internal controls 
<br/>have to be continuously strengthened.  I am glad to see the changes that have been put in place since 
<br/>that particular time.  All the Ministers, when we walk into a Ministry, I think one of the things we 
<br/>require from them is no qualified opinions. The audit should be unqualified and this is the challenge 
<br/>for us especially for these TMA accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been looking at strengthening the compliance. We have changed out some of the 
<br/>authorities in the past.  The financial system, the storeman and individual people could get into that 
<br/>system.  Now, we have changed - who has the authority to do what on the computer system.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You know you always have a challenge in any organisation. If you want to do things fast, you 
<br/>delegate responsibility and authority down. You get speed out of that. The problem with that is when 
<br/>you delegate, you also have a higher risk of people doing the wrong thing, which is what happened 
<br/>in this case.  So what we have done since then, we have had to centralise some of the authorities to 
<br/>make sure that some of the funny business that went on, that we can put a stop to that kind of funny 
<br/>business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation that we have, in  relation to  the issue that the honourable Ro 
<br/>Teimumu Kepa talked about the position of the Principal Engineer Regulatory.  Yes, the position is 
<br/>no longer there but the responsibilities of that position are still being implemented.  When you have 
<br/>a function that needs to be done, you can do it by having a person in that position or you can find 
<br/>other ways of getting that function done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the Ministry has done over time, the responsibilities that the honourable Ro Teimumu 
<br/>Kepa talked about, those responsibilities are being done by the team in coordination with the Director 
<br/>for  Water  and  Sewerage  and  with  the  technical  people  that  he  has.    That  also  gives  them  an 
<br/>opportunity to upskill their own competencies and their abilities.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report–Ministry of Infrastructure  
<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other recommendation that we have here is that that the Ministry vigorously pursue with 
<br/>WAF to ensure that the relevant clauses of the Water Authority of Fiji Act and bylaws are provided 
<br/>to the Solicitor-General’s Office for amendment. This is to strengthen some of the things that were 
<br/>happening in the area of water and sanitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can inform the House that Water Authority of Fiji has been working on this. They have been 
<br/>prepared the relevant amendments to the Act and Water Supply Bylaws and these are being submitted 
<br/>to the Solicitor-General.  So work is progressing on changing the laws, changing the regulations so 
<br/>we can have better control on some of the issues that were brought up in this particular audit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next recommendation was that the Ministry ensure that the National Water Resources 
<br/>Management and Sanitation Policy is complete.  The Department of Water and Sewerage has been 
<br/>working with an ADB Consultant and we have finalised this National Water Resources Management 
<br/>and  Sanitation  Policy  with  the  assistance  of  a  technical  working  group.  It  is  with  the  Solicitor-
<br/>General’s Office. The work is progressing on completing that policy and taking it to Cabinet so that 
<br/>it becomes formalised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next recommendation, that the Ministry assist the Department of Water and Sewerage in 
<br/></span><span>updating and upgrading its IT system in order to redevelop its current National Water and Sanitation 
<br/>database.  That work has been working. We have been updating the database and working with ITC. 
<br/>The Ministry has also written to Digital Fiji for assistance on the re-development of the database and 
<br/>the data collection tool to be used in the field.  Digital Fiji has met with the Department and has 
<br/>informed us that they will assist with the re-development in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the issue of water to the schools, this is something that the Ministry has been working 
<br/>together with WAF, Ministry of Education and NGOs. So, we work with the school committees, we 
<br/>help  them  out,  we  send  the  technical  teams  from  WAF  and  where  necessary,  the  Department  of 
<br/>Mineral Resources will also go and provide boreholes where they do not have access to surface water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again I thank the Committee for its Report. It has given us a good 
<br/>report and focus to continue look at improving what we are doing.  As the honourable Acting Prime 
<br/>Ministers said, audits are good because they remind us about things that we need to improve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our focus is always continual improvement for water to make sure that we can give 100 per 
<br/>cent access to all Fijians of safe and clean water, address our issues on safe wastewater and sanitation 
<br/>and also our plans for enhancing the roads that we have across Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A lot of talk about potholes.  When you have a pothole situation, we have a plan with the Fiji 
<br/>Roads of Authority to try to fix all the roads within a passage of four to six years. I am talking about 
<br/>6,000 kilometres of road.  When you want to rebuild and remake roads, it is very expensive. So, you 
<br/>will have some money set aside for rebuilding and remaking certain numbers of kilometres of roads 
<br/>but at the same time when potholes do happen, you have to fix the potholes on a temporary measure. 
<br/>At the same time you are focussing on rebuilding the whole road and that is what FRA will continue 
<br/>to do in the interest of providing service to all the people of our country.    Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Just very quickly from policy perspective, the honourable 
<br/>Minister has very aptly highlighted the challenges faced by, for example, FRA’s 6,000 kilometres, et 
<br/>cetera, even though the Report was on the Ministry as he highlighted.  But the point I would like to 
<br/>make, Sir, is that, there are number of legal issues involved so it is a policy with constraint 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>and Transport 2015-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>561 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Gavoka  highlighted  the  issue  about  someone  digging  up  a  hole  on  the  road.  
<br/>There is actually a trench across the road.  People are doing that wilfully at a very negligent basis.  
<br/>So, someone has got a house on this side, the brother has built a house in the other side of the road, 
<br/>they just decide to connect their water, they will just dig the road up, that is what they do. That is 
<br/>precisely what happened in Sila and Nayevuyevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, in  Siga too there is  a hole, in  Nayevuyevu too.   The 
<br/>same thing exactly happened in Nayevuyevu.  The point is, if you were going to say, “well go and 
<br/>fill up the hole, FRA’s job”, that means you are encouraging this people to destroy and damage public 
<br/>infrastructure.  In the same way, if someone has got a power pole, we can say, “well they will just go 
<br/>and connect to the electricity, let us allow it to happen”.  We cannot and, in fact, we have talked about 
<br/>how  we  need  to  bring  about  laws  to  ensure  that  people  do  not  go  and  wilfully  damage  public 
<br/>infrastructure.  There is a particular process to be followed and that will actually add additional cost 
<br/>to Government and, of course, the public itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  that  I  would  like  to  also  raise,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  from  a  budget 
<br/></span><span>perspective, if we drive around the Kings Road, you will see so on the highway all these bridges 
<br/>being replaced.  All the way from Tavua up to Tailevu North, and also Moto.  In Moto, the road used 
<br/>to be up here, you go all the way down to the crossing, then you go back up.  Today, the bridge is at 
<br/>the same level as the road.  But we were in Maranitawa with honourable Bala and honourable Viam 
<br/>Pillay.  Maranitawa area is actually like an island and they said, “We asked the Alliance Government, 
<br/>we asked the SVT Government, we asked the Labour Government, the SDL Government and all the 
<br/>other Governments, to please just give us a few culverts because the culvert is this narrow but the 
<br/>actual small river is this wide.  So, every time it rains it actually floods.   The very fundamental issues 
<br/>like that need to be addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before COVID-19, they identified about 400 bridges, crossings, et cetera, that needed to be 
<br/>redone or replaced completely.  We were in the Northern Division, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Wailevu 
<br/>West Coast Road - Dawara, St. Paul’s Primary School and Wailevu East Primary School we went to, 
<br/>Sir, I remember quite specifically in St. Paul’s Primary School, they were saying, “Thank you very 
<br/>much for actually replacing the crossing altogether.  It is a lot higher, it is better and now the trucks 
<br/>can come to us.  We can go quite easily to Savusavu.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were in Baulevu where they had the break-in at the temple.  One complaint was about 
<br/>roads but the reason why the machinery could not get to that part of Baulevu was because there was 
<br/>a very old bridge built probably in the colonial times.  Now, that entire bridge is being replaced - a 
<br/>new concrete bridge altogether, so the machinery also will be able to get across. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Bulanauca  said,  “Let  us  build  a  new  road  from  Nausori  to  Suva”  to  stop  the 
<br/>traffic.  You see, this is such a simple term approach to things.  We talked about how we are going 
<br/>to now have suburban bus terminals, to allow people who live in Davuilevu, for example, to be able 
<br/>to come across very easily to the main road and catch buses.  Public transportation is the way to go, 
<br/>that is why we have got four-lane roads.  That is the solution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also wants us to build a road from Suva to Nadi across Viti Levu which is going to be an 
<br/>enormous cost, yet the same time they talk about debt.  That will actually cost literally billions of 
<br/>dollars.  There was an initial study done.  Admittedly, Sir,   they reckon the travelling time will take 
<br/>about an hour and half if you go through ACS area all the way down through to Nadi.  But, Sir, it is 
<br/>going to cost billions of dollars because you have to cut through mountains and hills.  So, you see,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have to put these things into perspective.  There is no point standing here and saying it, when you 
<br/>do not actually have the financial capacity to be able to deal with that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to put that into perspective about the fact that we have all these issues that we 
<br/>need to address upon policy and financial perspective.  Road signages, before we used to have all 
<br/>these villages. You would have some company that will have their big signage and then at the bottom 
<br/>will be the name of the village. Today, every single village on the Coral Coast, along Kings Road 
<br/>had got a big sign that tells you what the name of the village is. So I do not what honourable Gavoka 
<br/>is raising about road signage.  Thank you, Sir.
