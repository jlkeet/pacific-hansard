<div><span>TOBACCO CONTROL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022

<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  51,  I 
<br/>move that the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Tobacco  Control  (Amendment)  Bill  2022  (Bill  No.  02/2022)  be  considered  by 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>(c)   Bill  must  not  be  referred  to  a  Standing  Committee  or  other  Committee  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)   Bill  must  be  debated  and  voted  upon  by  Parliament  tomorrow,  Thursday  10th

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  similar  situation  with  this  amendment, 
<br/>there are people, for example, who did not apply for the  </span><span>suki</span><span> licence that they used to sell in the 
<br/>market for years and other tobacco products.  This is essentially to assist them.  It is also being able 
<br/>to now give them licence of up to five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  had  a  situation  where  a  particular  company  was  given  the  licence  to  start 
<br/>manufacturing tobacco in Fiji as a competition to the only manufacturer at the moment.  They paid a 
<br/>fee of $250,000. Obviously because of COVID, they were not able to commence manufacturing and

<div><span> Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there  are  other  people,  for  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  a  yearly  basis  they  come  and  get  their 
<br/>renewal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every January there is a mad rush. So, this is to assist all those people who are small time 
<br/>business operators and depend on this on their livelihoods to provide assistance to them and these are 
<br/>the amendments being made to make their life a lot easier, to be able to put in place the Minister 
<br/>responsible for this is the Minister for Health the regulations in place so those who actually may have 
<br/>paid their fees but not in fact used those fees because they did not operate to provide them some form 
<br/>of relief.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member, the floor is now open for debate on the 
<br/>motion. At the end of the debate we will have the right of reply from the mover. Anyone wishing to 
<br/>take the floor?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I call on the Acting Prime Minister and Attorney-General to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Thank you, Sir, I have no further comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
