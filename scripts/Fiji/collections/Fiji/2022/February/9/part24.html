<h3>FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022</h3>
<div><span>FIJI NATIONAL UNIVERSITY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move 
<br/>that the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Fiji National University (Amendment) Bill, 2022 (Bill No. 03/2022) be considered by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage as a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committee of Parliament; 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament tomorrow, Thursday 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 
<br/>2022, but that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me 
<br/>as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Acting  Prime  Minister  and  Attorney-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General to speak on his motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, essentially this Bill seeks to remove the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Permanent Secretary of Education from the FNU Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently the Permanent Secretary for Education is the ex-officio member.  We have, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in terms of good governance as we will find as we are talking about Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji, there is no one from the Ministry of Infrastructure that sits on the board because we need to 
<br/>have the boards accountable and also there could enormous conflicts as we have seen in the past.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  there  are  financial  decisions  being  made  by  the  Council  of  which  the  line  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary is also a Council member or a board member and there is going to be an inquiry then how 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commissions of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>597 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>could we expect the Permanent Secretary of that line Ministry to be independent when that Permanent 
<br/>Secretary has to do the work for the Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  we  will  see,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  all  of  the  boards  wherever  possible  we  have  always 
<br/>removed the Government officials from the boards and, of course, there are some that are still there 
<br/>but  in  particular  for  this  academic  institution,  we  need  to  ensure  that  there  is  independence.  The 
<br/>policy decision as highlighted is made by the Ministry regarding the education sector overall. FNU 
<br/>should play a facilitating role and of course FNU needs to be independent in order to ensure that there 
<br/>is academic excellence that needs to prevail in our national university.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate we will have the Right of Reply from the mover.  Anyone wishing to take the 
<br/>floor?  There being no one wishing to take the floor, I call on the honourable Acting Prime Minister 
<br/>if he has anything further to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
