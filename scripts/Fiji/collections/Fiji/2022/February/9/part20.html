<br/>ALLEVIATION 2017–2018 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alleviation 2017 - 2018 Annual Report which was tabled on 21</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Thank  you  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation is the government agency that administers services and programmes which are 
<br/>aligned to the care and  protection of children, provision  of income support to  families  to  address 
<br/>poverty, provide policy intervention for older persons, provide policy intervention for persons with 
<br/>disabilities and ensure gender equality and empowerment of women.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  legislated  under  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare,  the  Ministry  is  responsible  for  the 
<br/>safeguard and protection of children in Fiji and has been working in partnership with Faith-Based 
<br/>Organisations and Civil Society Organisations over the years to provide a network of services and 
<br/>safe homes for women and children who have been victims of violence and abuse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  new  approach  adopted  by  the  Ministry  in  addressing  violence  against 
<br/>women and children is the development of the Fiji National Action Plan to Prevent Violence against 
<br/>Women and Girls. The Ministry has taken a whole of Government, whole of population, evidence-
<br/>based, measurable inclusive and funded five-year plan with an emphasis on stopping violence before 
<br/>it starts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Action Plan is envisioned to include key settings for prevention, an explanation 
<br/>on why violence against women happened in Fiji, key strategies to prevent violence against women, 
<br/>stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities, costed implementation plan and the national communication 
<br/>strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  within  the  period  under  review,  the  Ministry  successfully  undertook 
<br/>development projects that benefitted eligible individuals. One such initiative was the Formal Sector 
<br/>Employment and Livelihood project where a number of interventions were undertaken for income 
<br/>generation, such as, bee keeping, sewing skills and fuel projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the Disability Unit within the Ministry was established in 2017 with the aim to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>address disability in Fiji and develop a more inclusive society, create advocacy on the needs of

<div><span>575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>persons  living  with  disabilities,  provide  assistance  to  the  National  Council  for  Persons  with 
<br/>Disabilities,  and  link  the  disability  provider  organisations  to  relevant  service  providers  such  as 
<br/>Government and NGOs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is satisfied with the performance of the Ministry of Women, Children and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poverty Alleviation in the 2017-2018 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  make  a  contribution  on  the  Annual 
<br/>Report  by  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  of  2017–2018  and  I 
<br/>acknowledge the efforts by the Ministry in all its Social Welfare programmes particularly during this 
<br/>hardship period brought about by COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, one of the nagging issues that we still have is the increasing of beggars in the 
<br/>streets  and  I  know  it  is  an  ongoing  issue  and  particularly  this  time  when  we  are  faced  by  more 
<br/>hardship on how the Ministry is addressing this problem.  I am happy that the honourable Minister 
<br/>is now back in the Ministry because she was there from previous term of Parliament.  Also, whether 
<br/>the house that was being put up by the Ministry (I am not too sure whether it also includes beggars 
<br/></span><span>or just the homeless people).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That was a good initiative but how it has been used to its full potential in having to look after 
<br/>the homeless that we see continue to improve particularly if you finish from here and just take drive 
<br/>around the main CBD,  you will see the numbers of our people that are taken into the streets  and 
<br/>actually spending the night there. Having said that, I acknowledge the different faith groups that do 
<br/>reach out to this sector of our population in having to feed them and also reach out in regards to 
<br/>counselling services, Mr. Speaker. Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  knowledge  the  Barefoot  College,  it  has  been  one  of  the  projects  that  I  continue  to 
<br/>vigorously pursue.  Like I said, I am happy that the honourable Minister for Women is back because 
<br/>it has been one of those projects. I recently caught on the mainstream media that maybe it is almost 
<br/>80 per cent to completion and we look forward to the completion of Barefoot College, particularly in 
<br/>regards  to  the  development  and  empowerment  of  our  women  who  will  be  trained  to  be  solar 
<br/>engineers.   We really look forward to that as I would perceive that there would be more solar lighting 
<br/>in our rural areas and the maritime now that we have this specific facility that is going to be training 
<br/>women solar engineers, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said in this House that it is a national crisis on the violence against 
<br/>women and girls or women and children.  We recognise that as we have heard from the honourable 
<br/>Chairman of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs that there is a National Action Plan to prevent 
<br/>violence against women and children that is being developed and I know that this was supposed to 
<br/>be  completed  I  think  in  2020  but  I  am  sure  the  honourable  Minister  will  also  be  contributing.    I 
<br/>request that if she could give us a progress report of where we are in regards to this National Action 
<br/>Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say that because previously with the previous Minister, when this paper was brought into 
<br/>the House in one of the Ministerial Statements that was given, it was sounding like this is the panacea 
<br/>to eliminating violence against women and children.  And I had always said and requested that the 
<br/>plan must always go in line or together with the resources so that the plans could be implemented 
<br/>effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue to note increasing of violence against women and children.  I 
<br/>know there was this recent case of a young woman that was killed in the toilet facility in the botanical 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>garden area and we continue to hear about missing children. So it is very concerning and, again, I 
<br/>look forward to the contribution from the honourable Minister responsible in regards to this National 
<br/>Action Plan to prevent Violence Against Women and Children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Particularly,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  would  like  to  hear  the  kind  of  resources  that  is  going  to  be 
<br/>pumped into the Ministry to be able to implement this National Action Plan.  Otherwise as I have 
<br/>always said that plans will always remain on the shelves if they are not resourced adequately to be 
<br/>able to be implemented and make that impact in the prevention of Violence Against Women and 
<br/>Children.  And again I will end with request,  a plea from this side of the House that now we have a 
<br/>new  Minister  even  though  this  is  her  second  time  around  that  the  Government  do  consider  a 
<br/>Commission of Inquiry into the elimination of Violence Against Women and Children, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/>Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Sir, I wish to speak on the noteworthy 
<br/>achievements  of  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  in  the  2017-2018 
<br/>financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, one of the widely successful programmes implemented by the Ministry is the Zero 
<br/></span><span>Tolerance Violence Free Community National Programme.  Through this Programme communities 
<br/>that were in remote locations or difficult to reach were visited by Ministry staff and communities 
<br/>were made aware of the need to become actively involved in ending Violence Against Women and 
<br/>Girls (Children) in reporting incidents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  stakeholders  were  able  to  reach  rural  communities  with  the  message  and 
<br/>communities  were  able  access  the  health  and  social  services  and  information  provided  by 
<br/>stakeholders  due  to  the  socio-economic  nature  of  the  Zero  Tolerance  Violence  Free  Community 
<br/>Implementation  Plan.    This  includes  access  to  information  on  gender-based  violence,  access  to 
<br/>justice, information to empower people to report cases of gender-based violence to relevant authority 
<br/>and share information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in relation to advancing gender equality, I note that the various programmes 
<br/>of  the  Ministry  through  its  Department  of  Social  Welfare,  Department  of  Women  and  Poverty 
<br/>Monitoring  Unit  are  administered  equally  to  both  and  women  and  men.  These  programmes  are 
<br/>available to all those who meet the necessary requirements and there is no discrimination based on 
<br/>the gender of the recipients.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  made  several  advancements  in    eliminating 
<br/>violence against women and children in particular in respect of progressing the implementation of 
<br/>the Fiji National Gender Policy in coordination with relevant ministries including the elimination of 
<br/>violence against women and children.  As part of this initiative in the course of the year, identified 
<br/>focal  points  officers  attended  training  on  gender-based  violence  with  the  objective  of  having  and 
<br/>understanding the issues and mapping way forward for implementation on various departments.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on the motion. Thank you.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.S.  AKBAR.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs Review of the Ministry of the Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 
<br/>Annual Report 2017-2018. Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go on, let me answer some of the issues brought 
<br/>by honourable Radrodro.  One was in terms of the beggars, the Beggars Taskforce and what are we 
<br/>doing to ensure that we try to assist them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty  
<br/>Alleviation 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>577 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beggars have been on the streets of the capital, cities and towns for as long as we know and 
<br/>every effort has been made to assist them in terms of trying to engage them in livelihood projects 
<br/>because that is one of the reasons given by the profiled beggars and we gave those who are regular 
<br/>beggars and those that turn up once a while.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  also  found  out  that  most  of  these  beggars  have  serious  mental  issues  who  have  been 
<br/>neglected by their families.  Some are disabled, early in the morning the family members would bring 
<br/>them and put them on the streets on wheel chairs or on the ground in front of shops and some of them 
<br/>are able-bodied but they find it easy to live off the streets.  There are a lot of reasons there but at this 
<br/>Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation we look at them through very sympathetic and 
<br/>very empathetic eyes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  profiled  beggars  and,  yes,  honourable  Radrodro  you  are  right,  we  had  a  Good 
<br/>Samaritan Inn, that is what we called it that was established in 2016 or 2017 and this was looked after 
<br/>by  a  church.    We  used  to  provide  a  grant  to  the  church  and  then  we  used  to  provide  monthly 
<br/>allowances to the beggars for the church to keep them in the Inn that we had built.  Unfortunately, 
<br/>due to audit issues that has been closed and I have asked my Director Social Welfare to see how best 
<br/></span><span>we can sort that out so that, that home is functional again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had a very interesting project but I think when there were audit issues, the Department of 
<br/>Social Welfare or the Ministry simply gave up the place.  But we have closed to 100-plus beggars on 
<br/>our roads, some sleep on the streets, very well known to us, and one of the areas where they continue 
<br/>is Flagstaff.  We have some in the West, that is Lautoka, Lautoka has more and a few in Labasa.  The 
<br/>efforts are still underway to ensure that we sort out a life for those that are suffering from mental 
<br/>illness.  Our teams take them for medical but unfortunately when they come out from there, there is 
<br/>no family member who wants to take them up, so it is a challenge for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, three recommendations were made by the Committee.  One was in terms of 
<br/>the implementation of Zero Tolerance Violence Free Community National Programme.  If you recall, 
<br/>when you drive by certain communities there is a board there.  Unfortunately, some of the boards 
<br/>have been neglected but there used to be a seal of approval from the Ministry with the Police and the 
<br/>community put up on that board which said ‘This Community is Violence Free Community’.  These 
<br/>communities would go through a rigorous programme of awareness, what to do, how to handle things 
<br/>within the community and then the board would be there.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, some of the issues we had was, some of the men from the village will actually 
<br/>take the women to  the board and bash them up there.  Total  resistant to  the programme.  That  is 
<br/>something that we need to accept.  Fiji is known to have the highest rates of domestic violence in the 
<br/>Pacific and this sort of is attributed to the deep patriarchal views that men are stronger than women 
<br/>or men have a right to beat the women because the women belongs to them.  We are trying to break 
<br/>that culture and it is not easy to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of us while growing up we have seen violence in our homes.  We cannot deny that fact.  
<br/>Violence exists everywhere, so it takes the whole of community approach.  It takes whole of national 
<br/>approach to  curb or cut down on violence.  We will continue to engage with communities, faith-
<br/>based organisations, the Police Department and other NGOs to ensure that we find a solution to that.  
<br/>In that line, the Ministry in the last four  years has worked to strengthen its partnership with civil 
<br/>society organisations, NGOs, faith-based organisations and this is in line with our work to strengthen 
<br/>our coordination and advocacy role.  Ours is the advocacy role and Government’s policy advisor on 
<br/>gender equality and women’s empowerment.  This also includes working in close partnership with 
<br/>development partners whose core deliverables are in the area of gender-based violence.

<div><span> Review Report – Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty  
<br/>Alleviation 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9</span><span>th</span><span> Feb., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we should understand that gender-based violence, the greatest impact 
<br/>is on children.  We must work on this to ensure that our children do not grow up knowing that violence 
<br/>is okay.  It is not okay.  I will give you one example of the resistance we receive.  Recently, there 
<br/>was a case and when my welfare officers went to address that case, the man turned around and said 
<br/>to them, ‘do you want this case to be another one like Volivoli case’ and we all know what happened 
<br/>in Volivoli.  The man hacked his family watched by the 11-year-old child, who was hiding under the 
<br/>bed.  Sir, that is the attitude that we have, we need to change the attitude.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Countering domestic violence will need a whole change in mindset, equality as long as there 
<br/>is gender imparity, as long as we are fighting for gender equality, it is going to be there but it should 
<br/>not be there.  Somehow we have it in our mindset that is alright, men are up here, women are there, 
<br/>there is always going to be gender gaps but it is not alight and that is why we have embarked on a 
<br/>National Action Plan and this National Action Plan will actually try to find out solutions to domestic 
<br/>violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is a whole of Government and whole of community consultations. We are currently 
<br/>engaged in that to develop the national action plan to prevent violence against all women and girls.  
<br/></span><span>We  are  expected  to  have  a  finalised  plan  by  June  this  year  and  of  course  when  you  talk  about 
<br/></span><span>resources this will be effected in the next financial budget. So, these consultations are carried out in 
<br/>13 sectors and settings and this is to gather first-hand information about what these people think is 
<br/>the cause of violence and how we can resolve that.  So, the settings include faith-based organisations, 
<br/>sports sector, education, traditional institutions in the four divisions around the country and we also 
<br/>have  the  media  with  us  as  well  and  our  partners  the  police  and  the  judiciary  and  everybody  and 
<br/>anybody who can give us solution to fighting domestic violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of September, 2021, 23 consultations have occurred, 20 in person and 3 virtually and of 
<br/>course we have 721 females and we have also talked with male partners because there is no solution 
<br/>to domestic violence without having men on the table.  It is not a women’s issue, men have to come 
<br/>on board and we have done that and of course 47 per cent of the target population has been consulted, 
<br/>804 individuals have participated and also we have the National Online Survey going on, so people 
<br/>are free to go online do the survey and give their feedback. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the second phase of the roll out of the National Service Delivery Protocol for responding 
<br/>to cases of gender-based violence, the Ministry will work with stakeholders to conduct awareness 
<br/>and key agencies that area signatories to our protocol.  These agencies proceed to conduct capacity 
<br/>building  and  awareness  programmes  for  various  communities  nationwide  in  addition  to 
<br/>implementing their roles as the service delivery protocol.  In addition, the development of referral 
<br/>pathways  from  national  to  sub-national  level  provides  a  platform  for  extensive  dialogue  and 
<br/>validation of community entry points for access.  So, we are trying to encourage as many groups and 
<br/>individuals to participate in our national consultations before we draft the National Action Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The important roles that are part of these service delivery protocols include the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services, the Fiji Police Force, iTaukei Affairs Board amongst the others.  Also 
<br/>under the coordination mechanism of the Ministry, various working groups such as gender-based 
<br/>violence and emergency working group, service delivery protocol working group and the National 
<br/>Action Plan secretariat continues their network to consult, strategise and carry out activities.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, that is the attitude we have when we talk about gender violence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a country,  we want  to stop  violence but  here we have men who have no respect.   Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  has  also  recommended  that  the  Fiji  National  Action  Plan  to  prevent 
<br/>violence against women and girls be developed and implemented urgently.  The smooth and timely 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Alleviation 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>579 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>progress of the finalisation of the National Action Plan against all women and girls is not an exception 
<br/>in the light of the impact of COVID-19. There is a critical need to feed the development of National 
<br/>Action  Plan  from  the  findings  of  the  whole  of  Government,  whole  of  population  consultations 
<br/>targeting 2,500 diverse men, women and youth in the four Divisions in the 13 settings.  This has not 
<br/>been possible, as the nation moved into restrictions of movements and other protocols.  Consultations 
<br/>that were scheduled to be completed in October 2021 covering the 13 settings was not achievable 
<br/>given  the  circumstance.    To  address  this,  the  Ministry  with  the  NEC  Secretariat  and  Technical 
<br/>Working Group came up with virtual consultations and an online mode of survey. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to work with the stakeholders and ensure that the National 
<br/>Action Plan (now the new date for that is around June) and it will be a thorough plan, realistic and 
<br/>achievable as we work to recognise Fiji as a second in the world after Australia to have such a plan, 
<br/>also bearing in mind the timelines.  We note that the Committee’s recommendation the needs for the 
<br/>development  of  a  database  of  sex  workers  in  Fiji  and  the  recommendation  that  the  Ministry 
<br/>strengthens  its  partnership  with  various  NGOs  and  CSOs  and  Government  agencies  to  provide 
<br/>information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  currently  undertaking  the  Fiji  Country  Gender  Assessment  that  aims  to 
<br/></span><span>provide a comprehensive overview of gender issues in various sectors and critical areas including 
<br/>health,  economy,  violence  against  women  and  girls,  gender  and  environment  and  women  in 
<br/>leadership  with  decision-making.    It  is  intended  that  the  Fiji  Gender  and  our  Country  Gender 
<br/>Assessment will also highlight achievements as well as identify the remaining challenge to deepen 
<br/>our collective efforts to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all our women and girls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Country Gender Assessment is another project of the Ministry that is being developed 
<br/>and  implemented  on  a  strong  partnership  with  NGOs  and  CSOs  in  collaboration  with  the  lead 
<br/>Government Ministry.  The Country Gender Assessment also enables the Ministry to identify data 
<br/>sources on the status of key issues and its impact on various specifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last recommendation by the Committee was on Barefoot College.  As a 
<br/>way of background, Barefoot College is being constructed by the Fiji Government.  Initially, it was 
<br/>meant to be a regional project, but the project fell out with the other Pacific region and it is totally 
<br/>funded by the Fijian Government.  The main aim is to improve on the socio-economic empowerment 
<br/>of women, where we will train women who will be known as “solar grandmothers” and these women 
<br/>have gone to India and have trained at the Barefoot College there, however, we need to continue with 
<br/>the training. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I visited the construction site last week and I am pleased to advise the House with the $4.6 
<br/>million that the Government has invested, and the project is currently underway.  We hope for it to 
<br/>be completed in  the later part of this  year and then we will equip  it and  of course  we will invite 
<br/>women to come.  It includes the training facility, accommodation and of course the houses for the 
<br/>course coordinator. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to lead this Ministry and I would like to thank all our donor 
<br/>partners, our NGOs, CSOs and everyone else who has contributed to the success of the Ministry.  I 
<br/>know there is work to be done and hopefully we are able to complete our capital projects this year. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
