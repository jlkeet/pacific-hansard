<h3>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>SUSPENSION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pursuant to Standing Order 6, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That so much of the following Standing Orders be suspended - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Standing  Order  68(1),  to  exempt  the  2021-2022  Revised  Budget  Address  by  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy, including the response from 
<br/>the Shadow Minister for Economy and the right of reply from the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General and Minister for Economy, from the ordinary speaking time limitations; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Standing Orders 102, 104 and 108, to expedite the 2021-2022 Revised Budget process 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through Parliament; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Standing Orders 23(1)  and 34, to allow the 2021-2022 Revised Budget process to take 
<br/>place today and tomorrow, to allow Parliament to sit beyond ordinary sitting times and 
<br/>to limit refreshments, lunch and dinner breaks today and tomorrow, to be determined by 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, so as not to unduly interrupt the business of the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>773   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I move the suspension motion so as to allow the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for 
<br/>Economy to table the 2021-2022 Revised Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you had alluded to earlier, yes, the Government had informed the House 
<br/>through the 2021-2022 Budget Address on 16th July, 2021, that the Budget will be reviewed after 
<br/>six months.  As all honourable Members are aware, it is critical for us to take urgent and decisive 
<br/>action with respect to our economic recovery, so as to continue to address the very issues that have 
<br/>emanated as a result of the effects of the pandemic.  Fiji is not alone on this and other countries are 
<br/>grappling with the same issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  already  outlined  the  particular  Standing  Orders  that  need  to  be 
<br/>suspended.  The suspension of Standing Order 68(1), again, is to exempt the Revised Budget Address, 
<br/>the  response  by  the  shadow  Minister  for  Economy  and  the  Right  of  Reply  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and Minister for Economy from the ordinary speaking time limitations.  It is now 
<br/>established practice, Sir, that the shadow Minister for Economy is  allowed to  speak for the same 
<br/>amount of time that is taken by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 102,104 to 108 is to expedite the 2021-2022 Revised Budget 
<br/></span><span>process through Parliament.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to, this is necessary and essential so 
<br/>that our economy can continue to positively address and mitigate the effects of the pandemic.  This 
<br/>is the august body that can take decisions to make a difference in the Fijian people’s lives and we 
<br/>need to expedite this process so that the necessary immediate actions can then be implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to do this for the Fijian people who are at 
<br/>most  need.    I  know  that  this  august  House  and  the  Fijian  people  watching  tonight,  that  the 
<br/>Government will continue to do all necessary and within the avenues available to it to address the 
<br/>issues that the most vulnerable Fijians are facing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Suspension of Standing Orders 23(1) and 34 is to allow the 
<br/>2021-2022  Revised  Budget  process  to  take  place  today  and  tomorrow  to  allow  Parliament  to  sit 
<br/>beyond  ordinary  sitting  times  and  to  limit  the  refreshments,  lunch  and  dinner  breaks  today  and 
<br/>tomorrow as determined by Mr. Speaker, Sir, so as to not unduly interrupt the business of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, I thank you for this opportunity and I seek support from all honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  at  hand 
<br/>regarding Standing Order 6.  At the outset, I would like to express our opinion on this side of the 
<br/>House regarding the way  the topic of the  Revised Budget has  been managed.  But,  before that,  I 
<br/>would like to welcome the honourable Prime Minister back into Parliament in terms of the health 
<br/>issues he had gone through and we welcome him today.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very concerned about the way this has been managed and the way it 
<br/>has been handled in terms of the Business Committee, et cetera.  We, in the Opposition, express our 
<br/>view that we only have a few hours to review the whole Budget Estimates and Supplements to prepare 
<br/>the responses tomorrow.  We are of the view that this debate will be severely truncated and shortened.  
<br/>The underhand style of governing is not new where the Opposition is ambushed at every opportunity 
<br/>and  this  is  another  example,  in  rules  set  by  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  it  is  in  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>774   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>perspective undemocratic and tantamount to treating Parliament like a rubberstamp at the whims of 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was really upsetting was that all preparations had been done in terms 
<br/>of our questions and motions for the session from 7</span><span>th</span><span> March to 11</span><span>th</span><span> March.  We had gone through 
<br/>Tables, et cetera, prepared our motions and questions and were preparing for Business Committee 
<br/>when the flying minute came.  Again, this is already in the approved Parliament calendar.  If this had 
<br/>been foreseen six months before, then why was this not planned ahead instead of what we term as, 
<br/>the last minute change?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  indicates  the  lack  of  professionalism  and  arrogance  and  just  plain  incompetence  in  the 
<br/>management of such issues, not only that, but also in financial planning.  Let me remind Parliament 
<br/>that we were advised by a flying minute on 25</span><span>th</span><span> February at 3.31 p.m., and the deadline given for 
<br/>comments was on Monday, 28</span><span>th</span><span> February at 11 a.m.   That 25</span><span>th</span><span> February was a Friday and anything 
<br/>of such critical importance should be discussed by our Members, our caucus.  This was impossible 
<br/>because this was sent on Friday and we were expected to respond by 11.00 a.m. on 28</span><span>th</span><span> February. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  was  approved  on  28th  February  at  11.56  a.m.  We  did  not  respond,  Sir,  because  in 
<br/></span><span>principle, we do not agree with this process which, in our view, hijacked the parliamentary process. 
<br/></span><span>What was very insulting was that on 25th February at 9.36 a.m., the honourable Minister of  Economy 
<br/>issued a public statement on FBC, stating that the honourable Minister of Economy confirmed that 
<br/>the Revised Budget will be announced on 24</span><span>th</span><span> March.  This was even before 25</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2022 at 
<br/>9.36 a.m.  On that same day, the flying minute was issued at 3.31 p.m., even before that, he had made 
<br/>a public statement that the Revised Budget will be discussed tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we consider this as undermining the process of the Business Committee and an insult.  
<br/>This is why we, on this side of the House, have repeatedly said that this parliamentary process has 
<br/>been hijacked and we are asking ourselves why bother because he has already made the decision 
<br/>even before the Business Committee made the decision.  We state that Parliament should serve its 
<br/>functions that should really be and  there needs to be a drastic change in the Standing Orders and 
<br/>Operation in Practice.  This can only be achieved with the change of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the flying minute for today, there was again a revised Standing Order which we 
<br/>received through a flying minute today, 24</span><span>th</span><span> March at 10.26 a.m. to respond by midday to include 
<br/>what has been included here - Standing Order 6 and Standing Order 51. The final Order Paper was 
<br/>sent at 2.46 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Sir, to us, it just shows the lack of management and undermining the parliamentary 
<br/>process, not only that but just a total lack of respect for Parliament as an institution and also for the 
<br/>Opposition side of the House.  I remind Government that we were elected.  We did not come here by 
<br/>invitation, we were elected and we represent nearly 50 per cent of the population and that should be 
<br/>respected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Standing Orders, Sir, in terms of the motion at hand, again if you look at Standing 
<br/>Order 68, the speaking times and putting in of questions.  This is a Revised Budget and it is very, 
<br/>very critical that we discuss it fully, but again, this is restricted in terms of what we will be doing 
<br/>tomorrow because we are suspending Standing Order 58.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing  Order  102,  again,  that  has  been  suggested  to  be  suspended,  the  Supplementary 
<br/>Estimates.  If you read that to provide for expenditure not already provided for the Bill to be known 
<br/>as  Supplementary  Appropriation  Bill  must  be  accompanied  by  a  document  to  be  known  as 
<br/>Supplementary Estimates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>775   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I believe that from what I have heard, this is to be suspended, the whole thing.   I mean if 
<br/>you  suspend  Standing  Order  102(1)  to  (5),  it  looks  to  me  like  the  whole  detailed  supplementary 
<br/>budget will not be coming before the House, I do not know, I could be wrong.  But if we suspend 
<br/>that, then that does not give us the empowerment to discuss those issues in detail.  That is what I 
<br/>wanted to raise in terms of Standing Orders 104 and 108, that is on the amendments and Standing 
<br/>Order  108  on  withdrawal  of  amendments.    Again,  this  restricts  what  we  can  do  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>discussions on this Supplementary Budget and I reiterate that we are totally unhappy and insulted by 
<br/>the acts of we in the Business and we, on this side of the House before even the Business Committee 
<br/>approves,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Economy  had  already  announced  it  on  Fijian  Broadcasting 
<br/>Corporation (FBC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to contribute to 
<br/>the debate.  As stated by our Whip, we are opposing this motion.  The motion is asking the House 
<br/>for  leave  to  suspend  a  number  of  Standing  Orders,  to  allow  the  Government  to  put  through  the 
<br/>Revised or Mini-Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we ask the question, is it necessary to suspend these Standing Orders?  We 
<br/>answer that by looking at what is the purpose of the Standing Orders?  What is the purpose of the 
<br/></span><span>motion or this mini-budget that is being tabled tonight? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my view, we should all agree allows for the decorum 
<br/>of the House and it also allows for a very important aspect which is to inform the public totally and 
<br/>the public are no longer part of us.  A lot of them are listening tonight and they will be tomorrow 
<br/>which is their right to be fully informed of what is happening here, especially in relation to what we 
<br/>have today and tomorrow of what is called a “Mini-Budget”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Mini-Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  not  just  an  ordinary thing, it is  an exception, it is  an 
<br/>extraordinary matter for the government and for the public to know and if we look at the authorisation 
<br/>for a Mini-Budget it says, in relation to finances, the fiscal strategy and by that is a reference to the 
<br/>Budget in the previous year, may be amended only under three scenarios and this is how the Mini-
<br/>Budget is coming in - where an economic shock occurs.  So what we have is that, there is now an 
<br/>economic shock, big economic problem and because of that, the finances or what we had planned 
<br/>before or approved in the Budget last year cannot take us to the end of the year.  That is the only 
<br/>reason why we need a supplementary or mini-budget.  So, the public needs to know if that is in fact 
<br/>the case, or is it a lie because a lot of us suspect that is not the case and the reason for this mini-
<br/>budget is to fund their freebies for the election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One important reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the funds that were allocated to the 
<br/>Government  last  year  through  Grants  and  Loans,  Aid-in-Kind  totalling  $1.8  billion  and  we  ask 
<br/>ourselves, do you need further re-adjustments to take us through?  So, the public is entitled to know 
<br/>what is the reason for this Mini-Budget and they will only know that if they are given or what they 
<br/>are guaranteed under the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.  NAWAIKULA.-  Well,  what  they  are  trying  to  do  is  to  suspend  and  when  they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suspend, they are trying to deny the public information in relation to this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. NAWAIKULA.- Let us take for example, they are asking here the suspension of 
<br/>Standing Order 68.  Now what does that Standing Order 68 say?  Standing Order 68 allows the time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>776   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>limit to be 20 minutes, but that is not going to happen.   What they are trying to do is the minimum 
<br/>time so that they can push this through and the whole of Fiji at the end of it does not really understand 
<br/>what  is  wrong  with  our  economy.    So,  that  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  they  are  trying  to  suspend 
<br/>Standing Order 68.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, let us look at another one which is Standing Order 23(1).  It says that in all sittings of 
<br/>Parliament, you start at 9.00 a.m. and end by 4.30 p.m.  Now, when you suspend that, the kind of 
<br/>problem we will have is the one we have tonight.  We were supposed to start at 7.30 p.m. and we are 
<br/>starting at 8.30 p.m. and that is the reason.  So, we need these guarantees for the public to know fully 
<br/>what is happening, and that is one of the reasons why we are opposing this motion because we know 
<br/>that the public is entitled to full information.  We know that they are entitled to know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other suspended motion that they are looking for, Mr. Speaker, if you look at Standing 
<br/>Order 108, we will not  have committee, so it is to  exempt or to  deny the right  to  go through the 
<br/>committee.  The committee stage allows us to examine in detail every aspect, so that we should know 
<br/>whether we are now looking for money or readjusting money or they will be giving away money and 
<br/>that is the reason why we are opposing this basically because we know that the public is entitled to 
<br/>the full information or what shock there is and we really feel there is no shock and they are going to 
<br/></span><span>allocate this and allocate that, which we will see after this.  So, for those reasons, Mr. Speaker, we 
<br/></span><span>oppose this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.V.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  oppose  the  motion  on  the  floor, 
<br/>particularly  in  regards  to  Standing  Order  102.    With  the  suspension  of  the  Standing  Orders  as 
<br/>highlighted  by  the  Government  side,  it  reflects  that  there  is  selective  application  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Orders to suit the agenda of the Government side in regards to the Revised Budget.  As we know in 
<br/>the previous weeks, the honourable Minister of Economy had gone to great lengths consulting the 
<br/>members  of  the  public  on  this  Revised  Budget  and  therefore,  this  is  an  opportune  time  for  the 
<br/>Members of the House, particularly from the Opposition to raise the concerns of the members of the 
<br/>public on issues that they have highlighted with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, it is important to note that the suspension of Standing Order 102 on the Supplementary 
<br/>Estimates, it takes away or shall I say what the honourable Minister for Economy always says that 
<br/>the reality of the matter in regards to the consultations that he had taken to the people will be reflected 
<br/>in the Supplementary Estimates. Mr. Speaker, as I have always highlighted in the House, the priority 
<br/>of the Government will be highlighted in the Supplementary Estimates in this case and whether the 
<br/>Supplementary  Estimates  really  reflect  what  the  honourable  Attorney-General  or  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister of Economy had been taking out to the people remains to be seen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  to  suspend  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  does  not  give  us  the  opportunity  to  really  tie  in  the 
<br/>consultation and the actual budgetary allocation that will be in the Supplementary Estimates.  It also 
<br/>denies the opportunity for the people to be well-informed in regards to the purpose and the various 
<br/>sectors that will benefit from these revised estimates.  The people, without that information will not 
<br/>really be in a position to see the authenticity or the genuineness of this Revised Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had already mentioned, it is a selective application of the Standing Orders, again denying 
<br/>the people the opportunity to be informed on what the Government intends to be doing in regards to 
<br/>the  budgetary  allocation.    It  is  important  that  the  opportunity  be  given  to  Members  of  the  House 
<br/>particularly in the Opposition to engage in debate particularly because the election may be coming 
<br/>up very soon and this may be the budget that would take us to the  election; we do not know, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>777   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why it is important that we have a robust and healthy debate inside the House, so that 
<br/>the people are well-informed in regards to allocations that are going to be given to the various sectors.  
<br/>For  example,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Infrastructure  had  previously  just  mentioned  in  the 
<br/>mainstream media that the Government does not have money for, is it water supply and up until now, 
<br/>we continuously are faced with these water cuts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important, for the benefit of the voters, as we lead up to 
<br/>the election  that we have this opportunity to engage in a healthy debate inside the House rather than 
<br/>the Government side choosing to have a selective application of the Standing Orders to suit their own 
<br/>personal agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.  BULANAUCA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  similar  to  what  honourable  Tuisawau  has 
<br/>mentioned, I welcome the honourable Prime Minister back to this Parliament because we were unsure 
<br/>of where was he, in New Zealand or Sydney in Australia.  Now, we know that he was in Melbourne, 
<br/>he is back here well and we are thankful that he is back here with us.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important that we, the people of Fiji, are informed of his whereabouts and also for the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  to  know  that  when  he  is  out  of  his  Office,  no  one  cared  about  him, 
<br/></span><span>particularly in this Parliament.  So we should have a Ministerial Statement of where our honourable 
<br/></span><span>Prime Minister is, but no one cared about him in this Parliament, particularly on his side to announce 
<br/>in Parliament of his whereabouts and condition was. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honouarable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- The point is about the Revised Budget and the honourable Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister is setting the Government for the Revised Budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I stand to  oppose the motion  as  well particularly  as it is  coming from  a 
<br/>dictatorial government - no democracy.  I cannot see any democracy in this Revised Budget and the 
<br/>way or process in which we are doing it but we should give time to the Opposition and to the public 
<br/>as well to hear what is going on, to give us the opportunity for us in the Opposition to deliver or say 
<br/>things that need to be improved particularly in the Estimates and Expenditures; what has gone past 
<br/>and what is going into the future.  It is very important because particularly the primary industries’ 
<br/>contribution to GDP has been going down since 2014.  The figures show that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- No, no, no. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- We will show you the figures tomorrow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So it is important Mr. Speaker, Sir, to  be democratic, you must give the time for us to say 
<br/>what we need to say, to improve performances of the whole of government, the Government of the 
<br/>FijiFirst and the Opposition.  It is important that we must be given ample time. For annual budgets, 
<br/>we are given one week to prepare ourselves and debate over it. For this one, we should be given at 
<br/>least the weekend and debate it by Monday and approve it by Tuesday. Why the rush and not give  
<br/>us the opportunity to each talk for 20 minutes? We are restricted to only three or four minutes, that 
<br/>is not democracy, it is dictatorial, it is communism in this House and it is coming from the evil spirits. 
<br/>It is very bad, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is from a bad heart.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You need to give time and opportunity to have a good discussion about the Revised Budget 
<br/>particularly when the economy is not good, you need to make improvements for the future until the 
<br/>next budget in June or July. So it is important to be democratic about the process of this Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>778   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here and give time and opportunity for the Opposition to deliver for certain improvements that are 
<br/>required to be done particularly in the Revised Budget.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I oppose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to rise to oppose 
<br/>this motion. But before that, I just want to take this opportunity, on behalf of the people of Vusu to 
<br/>thank the honourable Prime Minister for coming down and attending the funeral. We acknowledge 
<br/>and thank you so much for your care and love for the Turaga na Tui Vusu and your presence that day 
<br/>was a highlight of the occasion of farewelling the chief the Turaga na Tui Vusu.  Thank you so much, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  to  be  honest  in  here. This  Parliament,  we  all understand  is  the 
<br/>cornerstone of democracy, guided by the Standing Orders to ensure there is genuine democracy.  And 
<br/>I just want to read out one of the functions or the purpose of Standing Order 1(2) which states and I 
<br/>quote: “To avoid doubt, they are not intended to diminish or restrict Parliament’s rights, privileges, 
<br/>immunities and powers.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the motion to suspend the Standing Orders, I believe it affects 
<br/>and diminishes this democracy. We are here to represent the people. We are here to raise the views 
<br/></span><span>and the concerns of the people and the suspension of these motions, stops us from raising the views 
<br/></span><span>and  the  concerns  of  the  people  that  we  represent  here.  I  agreed  with  my  colleague,  honourable 
<br/>Naiwakula for the reason of having this Revised Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  understanding  is  that  the  Revised  Budget  only  comes  when  our 
<br/>economy is in disaster, just like what we faced during COVID-19, that is fine. Another reason is 
<br/>when a new Parliament comes into power to readjust strategy do we need a Revised Budget. But in 
<br/>here, I do not understand why there is a Revised Budget and I agree with honourable Naiwaikula as 
<br/>he stated that the amount of funds we received as assistance (direct Budget funding) – more than $2  
<br/>billion which is enough to take us through to the next financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at the Budget from the previous years by this Government - Expenses, Estimate 
<br/>and the Actual - there is a big margin of variance (funds that are not being used). Look at the records 
<br/>for 2018 and 2019, it is one billion dollars. These are funds that are not being used by the ministries 
<br/>that could have been used to take us through if we ran out of funds as already stated by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Infrastructure that they do not have the money but where is all this money.  If there are 
<br/>real money, then that should be sufficient to take us through to the next financial year.  So it seems 
<br/>that all this money, all these figures are being cooked, fried, to look nice, to smell nice for the people 
<br/></span><span>but they have been deceiving the people all this time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that there is no reason to have this mini-budget or revised budget 
<br/>for the reasons I have stated.  We have enough funds to take us through and to conclude that this 
<br/>Revised Budget is just to legalise the effort or the strategy to provide funds for the election.  We have 
<br/>already seen it happening.  They even go as far as funding boats, freezers and water seal lavatories.  
<br/>Are  they  desperate  to  remain  in  power?    Are  they  afraid  of  the  consequences  of  their  actions  of 
<br/>mismanaging this economy for the last 16 years?  They seem to be afraid.  This is a reflection of the 
<br/>desperation, they are afraid.

<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Cartoon, cartoon! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  He  is  the  one  -  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture  is  not 
<br/>performing, he is sleeping on his job.  He is unable to provide annual reports since 2016 so how can 
<br/>we be guaranteed that all these funds will be used according to its intended purpose.  Look at the last 
<br/>Auditor-General’s Report relating to the COVID-19 Response.  Overall it said, there is lack ….

<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>779   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, we are talking about a procedural.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Yes, Sir.  This is why …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, we are not talking about content.  You have the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  Thank  you,  Sir.    That  is  what  I  am  saying,  because  of  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mismanagement of the economy …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  KURIDRANI.-  The  motion  is  about  the  mini-budget,  because  of  their 
<br/>mismanagement of the economy, they are having this but what I am trying to say is, the purpose of 
<br/>having the mini-budget is just to help them in their campaign because we have enough funds to take 
<br/>us through.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- They do not even understand simple basic economics.  They do not 
<br/></span><span>even  understand  how  much  money  they  have  here  and  whether  it  is  still  there  or  no  is  another 
<br/>question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- I do not support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  give  the  floor  to  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Government  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not 
<br/>about ambushing the Opposition at every opportunity, it is not  about undermining the Parliament 
<br/>process, it is about the priorities and the need, particularly under the trying times and conditions that 
<br/>we are going through.  Let us be realistic, let us use common sense.  I did state that Fiji is not the 
<br/>only country that is grappling with this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, in the 16</span><span>th</span><span> July Budget Address by the honourable Attorney-General and Minister of 
<br/></span><span>Economy,  it  has  been  made  known  to  every  Fijian  and  every  honourable  Member  of  this  august 
<br/></span><span>House that the Budget for 2021-2022 period will be reviewed and this is exactly what is happening 
<br/>today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We should have anticipated this, as I have stated, it is not about ambushing 
<br/>the Opposition, it is not about undermining the Parliament process but there is a need to do this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me assure the other honourable Members on the other side that of course 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this is part of the democratic process and that flexibility is allowed in the Standing Orders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Let me say that again, this 
<br/>is the democratic process that is taking place, it is allowed for in the Standing Orders - Suspension 
<br/>of Standing Order 6.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>780   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Exactly!  Standing Order 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6(5) states, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“To  avoid  doubt,  the  suspension  of  any  Standing  Order  does  not  permit  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transaction of any business in breach of the Constitution or any other law.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the democratic process allows for that but this is legal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are not breaching the 2013 Constitution, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Let me read from Standing 
<br/>Order  34,  as  well,  because  this  is  about  Government  business  and  Government  business  takes 
<br/>precedence  over  any  other  Members’  business.    It  says  in  Standing  Order  34,  and  I  quote:  
<br/>“Government business is set down on the Order Paper in the order determined by the Government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and 
<br/></span><span>Government business takes precedence over any other Members’ business.  As I have stated, this is 
<br/></span><span>the Parliamentary process, but they are worried about elections.  Budgets are estimates; estimates 
<br/>about our revenues and estimates about our expenditures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Can you provide the Supplementary Estimates? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Things have changed over 
<br/>the last six months and that is why it is necessary for us to review our revenue and our expenditure, 
<br/>full stop.  Common sense, basics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LEADER  OF  THE  GOVERNMENT  IN  PARLIAMENT.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/></span><span>problem is they are worried about elections.  Let serve the people of Fiji first.  That is what we have 
<br/>been doing from day one.  This is about the Fijian people, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- I have nothing further to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>add and I fully support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
