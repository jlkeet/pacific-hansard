<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr.  Speaker, Sir, I would like to, of course, acknowledge 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and welcome him back to Parliament, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and, of course, all Fijians who are watching us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to,  of  course,  apologise  to  them  for  the  delay  that  has  been  caused  by  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition because we know they have been waiting to hear what we have in store, given the fact

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the economy is now opened up since the borders opened  since 1</span><span>st</span><span> December. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the National Budget announcement on 
<br/>16</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2021, there was a great deal we sought for Fiji’s future amid a greater deal of uncertainty, 
<br/>so we committed to reassess that budget in the context of our recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are proud to report that recovery is underway.  All preliminary 
<br/>data and partial indicators show that the economy is on track to record the highest growth rate in 
<br/>Fiji’s history.  Sir, VAT collections, imports of consumption goods, sales for both new and second-
<br/>hand vehicles, retail sales and overall consumption spending and business activities are roaring back 
<br/>to life and have recorded strong growth for the last three months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sectoral  performance  is  positive  as  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  supported  by  agriculture, 
<br/>mahogany, forestry and manufacturing.  The Reserve Bank of Fiji’s job advertisement survey shows 
<br/>that employment has been on an upward trend for the past six months.  Almost 25,000 jobs were 
<br/>added in the formal sector and a similar number in the informal sector.  This is supported by total 
<br/></span><span>salaries and wages, FNPF contributions and PAYE.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  visitor  arrivals  for  the  first  three  months  since  the  border  opened  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December, 2021 are approximately 50,000 – more than a thousand per cent more than the comparable 
<br/>period one year ago.  The numbers ahead look even better. Forward-looking indicators, such as airline 
<br/>and hotel bookings from April this year show strong numbers approaching pre-COVID-19 levels of 
<br/>tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That all means that tonight, we have an opportunity to announce a special revised budget that 
<br/>builds on this momentum and uses our recovery to meet new and extraordinary challenges, including 
<br/>the crisis of affordable living faced by our people.  But before we announce that budget, we have to 
<br/>remember what it took to get here because we cannot take this progress for granted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 16</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2021, when we announced the budget for this year, our progress 
<br/>to recovery could be measured in single digits.  Less than 9 per cent of the Fijian population or adult 
<br/>population had received both doses of vaccine, including the overall population, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Our borders were shut, more businesses were closed and our economy was in a recession.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the midst of that crisis, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we laid out two profoundly different futures that 
<br/></span><span>Fiji could face.  In one, we would fail at vaccinating our people and waste the millions of doses we 
<br/>secured for Fiji.  Lives that could have been saved would have been lost.  Our children would not be 
<br/>in school.  Most businesses would not be open, nor would our borders.  Our streets would have been 
<br/>lonely and quiet, our hotels empty of tourists and our restaurants shuttered.  If we had chosen that 
<br/>future, tonight Fiji would be a dark and despondent country and tonight, we would have no choice 
<br/>but to announce painful and difficult measures of austerity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will not happen because we chose better, not through some single 
<br/>sweeping  decision  but  day  by  day,  step  by  step  and  hand  in  hand  with  every  Fijian.  Under  the 
<br/>leadership of our honourable Prime Minister, we kept to the vision of a Fiji that would control the 
<br/>pandemic.  We saw well beyond a single day’s headlines.  We saw beyond the likes and views and 
<br/>attention  on  social  media  that  became  the  obsession  of  our  detractors.    We  used  our  God-given 
<br/>intellect to follow the science and best medical knowledge.  We navigated commercial realities that 
<br/>kept our economy functioning.  We called on every willing partner and institution in the world to 
<br/>make tough decision after tough decision which time has proved were the right decisions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was the first country in the region to introduce a No Jab No Job Policy.  Australia followed 
<br/>suit.  New Zealand followed suit.  Many cities and states in the USA did as well but Fiji was the first 
<br/>among those nations to take that bold step down the most direct path out of the pandemic and we 
<br/>succeeded.  support  us  and  we  earned  their  confidence  through  our  prudent  and  practical  policy 
<br/>responses.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we vaccinated virtually every adult in Fiji 
<br/>and we are boosting more everyday.  We resisted calls to keep our schools and businesses closed.  
<br/>We dismissed demands to keep our borders shut.  We kept the bones of our economy strong and 
<br/>ready for a revival.  We made our recovery our reality and our record speaks for itself.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see it with every take-off of a Fiji 
<br/>Airways plane at Nadi International Airport.  You can see it in the smiles of our children in schools.  
<br/>You can hear it in the hum of markets we have built around the country.  You can see it in the shops, 
<br/></span><span>restaurants,  hair  salons  and  other  businesses  that  are  filled  with  customers,  on  the  buses  that  are 
<br/></span><span>carrying our people to and from their places of work and in the parks and stadiums while people 
<br/>exercise and compete in sports.  Wherever we look, wherever we are, we can see it and we can feel 
<br/>it - Fiji is back.  We are moving past the worst of the pandemic and we thank God for every Fijian 
<br/>who is back at work earning a living for themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have held budget consultations across Fiji; in rural communities, urban 
<br/>centres and online and we have received written submissions from the public.  We thank all those 
<br/>who have participated, including those who invited us to hold consultations in places we did not plan 
<br/>to go.  We have listened carefully to  your concerns and we have considered your ideas about our 
<br/>recovery.  It is our duty to each of you and every Fijian to answer the burning question on the mind 
<br/>of the nation and that question is, what is next? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is what the special revised budget is all about.  It is about what is next 
<br/>for Fiji.  It is about what we can do together to set the nation back on the track we were on before the 
<br/>brutal  blow  of  the  pandemic.    It  is  about  protecting  our  hard-fought  recovery  by  sticking  with 
<br/>consistent and confidence-building policies, the same policies, Sir, and philosophy that produced the 
<br/>longest streak of growth in Fijian history.  It is about restoring the unprecedented pace of our march 
<br/></span><span>towards  a  modern  nation  state.    It  is  about  moving  forward  to  confront  a  new  slate  of  global 
<br/></span><span>challenges, because steering away from this course, can only mean falling backwards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a major issue in all of the conversations we have had across the country has 
<br/>been the rising price of food and other essentials.  We all feel it - at the fuel pump, at the market, in 
<br/>the supermarket, at the bakery, prices are not just rising, they are sky-rocketing.  We wish to explain 
<br/>in simple terms why this is happening and later tonight, how we plan to protect affordable living in 
<br/>Fiji.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this price-increase crisis  and it is a crisis is affecting every country in the 
<br/>world as a result of a volatile cocktail of global developments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, there was a worldwide explosion in consumption coming out of the pandemic.  Months 
<br/>of lockdown paired with  trillions of dollars injected into economies  by  wealthy nations produced 
<br/>consumer demands of historic proportions.  People in rich countries left their homes and went straight 
<br/>to the malls and markets to spend, spend and spend some more.  But supply chains could not keep 
<br/>up with all that pent-up demand.  They had been disrupted seriously during the pandemic.  They were 
<br/>facing labour shortages.  They were facing shipping disruptions.  And they were overburdened just 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>785  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as they were beginning to recover.  That made food, fuel, freight and other goods like fertilizer more 
<br/>expensive.  We have been feeling the trends since the end of last  year.  It  was tough, but we are 
<br/>managing, thanks to a promising start for our recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  things  got  worse,  much  worse  as  a  direct  result  of  two  earth- 
<br/>shaking events; a fresh COVID-19 outbreak in China forced hard lockdowns that shutdown major 
<br/>industrial hubs and decimated the country’s globally vital production capacity and the Russian war 
<br/>in Ukraine initiated humanitarian and economic disaster that rages as we speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  opposed  Russia’s  invasion  because  it  was  a  serious  breach  of 
<br/>international  law  and  because  we  knew  there  is  no  such  thing  as  someone  else’s  war  in  the  21</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>century.  We operate in an integrated economy where conflict anywhere is felt everywhere.  Even far 
<br/>removed in Fiji, we pay the price of war because as we feared, the invasion’s economic shockwaves 
<br/>have landed as tidal waves at the shores of small island states.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The combined food production of Russia and Ukraine accounts for 12 per cent of all calories 
<br/>traded by humanity and 30 per cent of the global wheat exports.  That capacity is now either cut-off 
<br/>by conflict or sanctions.  Russia’s once busy Black Sea ports have become parking lots, adding to 
<br/></span><span>mounting freight costs.  Oil and gas prices broke records last week and remain volatile.  Costs like 
<br/></span><span>insurance are rising due to the risks of the current conflict and the serious potential, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>to spark a wider war. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us think about </span><span>TC Winston.  </span><span> The storm destroyed massive tracks of Fiji’s 
<br/></span><span>yaqona </span><span>plantations, for example, and the price of a kilogramme of </span><span>yaqona </span><span>rose from $85 to $185 
<br/>soon after.  Russia’s invasion created a super storm of conflict that has decimated the world’s energy, 
<br/>metal and agricultural output and prices of oil, gas, metals and grains are now rising as a result.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  oil  sold  for  as  high  as  US$140  a  barrel  this  month,  up  from  as  low  as 
<br/>US$22.50 during COVID.  Freight costs on some routes are up to 800 per cent higher than before the 
<br/>pandemic.  Wheat is selling in some places for nearly US$12 a bushel - up from around $5 in 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A shortage of metals has made modern essentials like microchips harder to come by.  This, 
<br/>of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is not the 1950s.  Cars, trucks, ships, planes and mobile phones all rely 
<br/>on this sort of technology and now, they are all becoming more expensive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  here  in  our  region,  Australia  is  facing  the  worst  shortage  of  building 
<br/></span><span>materials in nearly half a century, including steel, timber, cement, paint and kitchen materials.  New 
<br/></span><span>Zealand’s Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern has dubbed this crisis “a wicked perfect storm” and she is 
<br/>right.    Small  Pacific  nations  are  even  more  exposed  because  we  are  the  most  import-dependent 
<br/>nations in the world.  On average, SIDS have a 90 per cent dependency on imported petroleum fuels 
<br/>and import 60 per cent or more of their food needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is less exposed on the energy front than others because half of our electricity comes from 
<br/>renewables.  We also do not have domestic inflationary pressures at the moment.  Our dollar is strong 
<br/>and our foreign reserves are high because of our steady and strategic policy-making.  But we are a 
<br/>major  importer  and  that  means  we  import  inflationary  pressures  from  overseas.    So  when  costs 
<br/>increase internationally, these costs are passed onto us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Like  all  other  islanders,  virtually  all  of  us  eat  imported  food  items  everyday  -  bread,  roti, 
<br/></span><span>panikeke, purini, babakau</span><span> are all made of flour which, of course, comes from wheat.  Wheat does 
<br/>not grow in Fiji.  Even though flour is price-controlled at the wholesale and retail levels, Fiji can only 
<br/>purchase wheat at the world market price.  There is no oil in Fiji either.  We drive in imported cars 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that run on imported fuel.  Let there be no illusion about this, seemingly distant events on foreign 
<br/>soil have direct and immediate impacts on us.  This is the interconnected reality of the world and the 
<br/>geographic hand we are dealt as an island nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But as tough as things are for us, we should carry some perspective. Women and children are 
<br/>being bombed, shot and killed on a nearly-daily basis in Ukraine. There are countries like Yemen 
<br/>that depend almost entirely on food aid to feed their people and there will be massive starvation due 
<br/>to rising food prices and shortages. Our conversation in Fiji is about maintaining standards of living, 
<br/>the conversation in those countries is about starving off mass death due to starvation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this conflict is Europe’s largest since 1945 and the most serious foreign war 
<br/>in Fiji’s history as a nation. The conflict could all too easily get worse before it even begins to get 
<br/>better.  Cold War anxieties are flaring up across the Western world.  In some parts of Europe, bread 
<br/>is becoming a luxury item and supermarket shelves resemble the aftermath of panic-buying during 
<br/>COVID.  This is the brutal reality of war.  As a nation that has contributed to peacekeeping for almost 
<br/>its entire history since Independence, Fiji will continue to urge peace in Ukraine, as well as all other 
<br/>conflict areas in the world, because it is right and because people everywhere on earth unjustly bear 
<br/>the burden.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here at home, we face two choices: we can point fingers at each other (as we have seen the 
<br/>Opposition do) or we can lock hands in solidarity. We chose and we choose the latter.  Together, we 
<br/>will get through this superstorm of global events and we will do it by building on the recovery we 
<br/>are delivering for Fiji. We will grow our economy, we will create the jobs and opportunities that 
<br/>every Fijian deserves to have in their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But imagine for a minute, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where would we be if we had failed or faltered 
<br/>in bringing our recovery about?  There are countries and societies that are living under lockdown 
<br/>right now.  Imagine if that were still Fiji.  Imagine if we had to bear today’s price-increase crisis with 
<br/>our economy still crippled by COVID.  Imagine if we had made short-sighted and fearful economic 
<br/>decisions instead of showing the wisdom and foresight to ready ourselves for recovery.  Imagine that 
<br/>timidity and stupidity had caused us to  keep our  borders closed and our  people out  of their jobs. 
<br/>Imagine that Government was operating today on the meagre revenues of last year, including a low 
<br/>of $77 million in May 2021.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we had given in to the demands and lock-up the 
<br/>country and wait in the dark for the pandemic to pass, that is the situation we could surely face at this 
<br/>moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can assure everyone here in this Parliament that the $360 in assistance 
<br/></span><span>that Fijians  received would not go nearly as far as today as it did then.  We would have had to give 
<br/>more assistance from a dwindling treasury and make many more sacrifices.  Instead, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we can create solutions, derived from our prosperity because the most important way we build 
<br/>resilience to these external shocks is by building the momentum of our recovery and doing so as one 
<br/>united nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we return to the fundamental question that hundreds have asked of 
<br/>us and thousands have on their minds - what lies ahead, what is next.  The answer lies in the promise 
<br/>of this Revised Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and its support for a bold, sustained and a broad economic 
<br/>recovery.  As always, Sir, we will start with the context of our current fiscal outlook.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together we recorded the longest period of economic expansion in Fijian 
<br/>history prior to the pandemic, nine straight years of growth, as a result per capita income level rose 
<br/>to over $13,000, and unemployment fell to a 20-year low of 4.5 per cent.  Socio-economic conditions 
<br/>improved  and  Fijians  have  better  and  more  equitable  access  to  education,  healthcare,  roads, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>787  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transportation, electricity, safe and clean water, legal services and digital connectivity.  This period 
<br/>of  sustained  growth  was  underpinned  by  rising  productivity  and  investment,  socio-economic  and 
<br/>political stability, improved private sector confidence and an important programme of reform led by 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiscal policy played an important role in this journey, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with Government 
<br/>maintaining  a  low  and  attractive  tax  regime  to  support  private  sector  investment,  while  also 
<br/>channelling  private  spending  towards  massive  infrastructure  development  and  improving  public 
<br/>service delivery for all Fijians, that is where we were.  Then of course, Sir, the pandemic cleaved off 
<br/>20 per cent of our GDP, creating the worst economic crisis in our history, bar none. We lost $4 billion 
<br/>in tourism earnings and $3 billion in tax revenues over two brutally tough years.  We implemented 
<br/>the one policy response that could keep our economy afloat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, John Maynard Keynes was a legendary economist, whose ideas have guided 
<br/>government economic policy for decades after his death.  He maintained that to create jobs and boost 
<br/>consumer buying power during a recession, governments should increase spending, even if it means 
<br/>going  to  debt.  Every  nation  heeded  that  message  during  COVID-19.    They  heeded  that  message 
<br/>during the great economic depression, they did more than borrow money - they injected trillions of 
<br/></span><span>dollars to keep their economies plodding along, despite the COVID-driven recession.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is a major driver of our economic growth in Fiji and we 
<br/>maintained the expenditures in order to fuel economic activity.  As the nation’s largest employer, we 
<br/>maintained civil service salaries and we paid out millions to the approximately 400,000 Fijians whose 
<br/>employment  or  livelihood  was  affected  by  COVID  -  building  a  $500  million  safety  net  that  kept 
<br/>thousands of families from falling into life-threating destitution.  We were able to negotiate low cost 
<br/>debt to do that.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the right call, not only because the cost of that debt was 
<br/>extremely low but because the alternative was a socio-economic catastrophe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Creditable  lenders  like  the  ADB,  World  Bank,  JICA  and 
<br/>AIIB lent to us at five times the pace they did in the past and they did so because they were confident 
<br/>in the plan we had to revive the economy. They did so because they knew that our debt burden was 
<br/>sustainable, they understood what we understood, that we needed a balance between avoiding a deep 
<br/>crisis  now  and  ensuring  long  term  sustainability.    If  we  had  not  been  extremely  prudent  in  our 
<br/>borrowing and our policies, those multilateral institutions would not have lent to us at all and that is 
<br/></span><span>the fact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s experience stands up well in the context of the global experience.  The International 
<br/>Monetary Fund reports that total global debt rose by an astonishing 28 per cent in 2020 to 256 per 
<br/>cent of GDP.  This was the largest single-year increase since at least 1970 and the weighted average 
<br/>interest  rate  of  Fiji’s  debt  portfolio  dropped  sharply  from  6.2  per  cent  in  2020  to  4.6  per  cent  in 
<br/>January  2022.    We  secured  almost  $900  million  in  highly  concessional  finance  tagged  to  policy 
<br/>reforms from multilateral and bilateral development partners. These saw terms of 40-year repayment 
<br/>period, inclusive of a 10-year grace period, and an interest rate of 0.01 per cent, which is practically 
<br/>no interest at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- In terms of concessionality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this equates to 
<br/>a 60 per cent to 70 per cent  grant element on some of those loans.  A direct  consequence of this 
<br/>borrowing was a reduction in the cost of borrowing in the domestic market for both, the Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>788  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the private sector.  This is in sharp contrast to previous crises where the cost of borrowing rose 
<br/>substantially.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also attracted support from our multilateral and bilateral partners.  Countries like New 
<br/>Zealand, Australia and Japan provided us grants and concessional financing at the expense of the 
<br/>taxpayers to whom their governments are accountable - and they did so because they were confident 
<br/>in our ability to manage those funds responsibly in the economic plans and strategies put in place by 
<br/>the  Government.    Because  we  borrowed  prudently  and  because  we  earned  the  confidence  of  our 
<br/>development partners, we rode out the worst the world could throw at us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mentioned, we are expecting the economy to grow by 11.3 per cent in 
<br/>2022  driven  by  the  vaccination  of  our  population  and  the  reopening  of  our  borders.    Other 
<br/>independent economic analysts put the figure even higher.  It is estimated to take three years until 
<br/>our economy is restored to pre-pandemic levels, but we have started that journey back on sure footing 
<br/>because  of  our  overall  macroeconomic  fundamentals  which  remain  strong.    Foreign  reserves 
<br/>currently stand at around $3.2 billion, sufficient to cover 8.8 months of imports, well above the IMF 
<br/>benchmark of three months.  With our largest earn of foreign reserves, tourism shut down, we faced 
<br/>a real threat of devaluation, but the proactive and robust policies by Government and the Reserve 
<br/></span><span>Bank of Fiji helped avoid a devaluation of the Fijian dollar.  Had we been forced to devalue, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, which seems to be loss on many people, Fijians would be paying much higher prices 
<br/>today for everything.  The increased prices we are seeing because of the global supply chain problems 
<br/>and increases in commodity prices would be compounded by a Fijian dollar that would have simply 
<br/>been worthless than today.  Everything we import will be much more costly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liquidity levels in the financial system stand around $2 billion and that supported the low- 
<br/>interest  environment.  With  improved  confidence  levels  and  reduced  uncertainty  surrounding  the 
<br/>virus, investment prospects are trending upward.  Inflation, on the other hand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has 
<br/>been increasing recently with a rise in international prices and freight costs, as it is worldwide, putting 
<br/>additional pressure on the price of goods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic pushed Fiji’s debt level to over 80 per cent of GDP.  To put 
<br/>this in historical context, the debt to GDP ratio rose from 53.3 per cent in 2006 to 56.2 per cent in 
<br/>2010, before beginning a steady decline towards 43.5 per cent in the 2016 and 2017 financial year.  
<br/>That was a drop of nearly 13 percentage points in just over six years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  and  the  many  other  natural  disasters  we  suffered,  Government 
<br/></span><span>increased its borrowings out of the necessity to build back better, pushing the debt to GDP ratio to 
<br/></span><span>48.4 per cent in the financial year 2018 and 2019, still well below the 50 per cent benchmark.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We spent  over $200 billion just in  building schools.   Although the  nominal  value  of debt 
<br/>increased from $2.8 billion in 2006 to $5.7 billion at the end of the financial year 2018 and 2019, the 
<br/>debt to GDP ratio declined from 53 per cent of GDP to around 48 per cent in that period.  That means 
<br/>that Fiji’s nominal GDP, which rose from $5.3 billion to $11.8 billion grew much faster than our debt 
<br/>levels over the same period.  To maintain public expenditures around $3.7 billion, which includes 
<br/>over $500 million in unemployment support and other relief measures, Government had to borrow 
<br/>around $2 billion over the last two financial years, the COVID years.  As a result, the debt to GDP, 
<br/>ratio now sits at over 80 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The alternative of not borrowing to support the economy during the last 20 months would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been catastrophic, and the consequences would have been especially hard on average Fijians.   
<br/>It is crystal clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government’s counter-cyclical stance to take on additional 
<br/>debt to support the economy, particularly external debt from multilateral partners was economically

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>789  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sound and absolutely necessary and it has allowed us to announce a mini-budget this evening that 
<br/>takes  on  the  affordable-living  challenge,  continues  our  recovery’s  momentum  and  creates 
<br/>opportunities for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Around  the  world,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  countries  are  finding  ways  to  live  with  COVID  and 
<br/>manage risks as we are in Fiji.  They are loosening COVID-based restrictions as vaccination rates 
<br/>have risen and hospitalisations have declined.   Masking requirements are being narrowed or dropped. 
<br/>People are returning to the workplace.  New variants emerge but they have been less virulent and 
<br/>more manageable. Unlike some countries who were currently crippled by lockdowns, Fiji has done 
<br/>enough for our people to be included in the pack of nations that is actually moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonight,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  be  speaking  on  new  policies  and  expenditures.  The 
<br/>measures  we  funded  in  the  last  budget  year  will  continue;  initiatives  like  free  education,  social 
<br/>welfare payments, infrastructure development and other incentives for economic growth.  Because 
<br/>our recovery is succeeding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, tonight is not only about maintaining the support we 
<br/>have assured the Fijian people, it is about what more we can do to empower students, job seekers, 
<br/>farmers, developers, home owners and all other Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  this  Revised  Budget,  Sir,  the  total  revenue  is  estimated  at  $2.25  billion  while  total 
<br/></span><span>expenditure is $3.72 billion. This results in a net deficit of $1.46 billion equivalent to 14.2 per cent 
<br/>of GDP.  Debt is projected to reach 88.6 per cent by the end of this fiscal  year  and based on the 
<br/>projected economic recovery and planned deficit reduction, the debt to GDP ratio is expected to come 
<br/>down to below 80 per cent in the next three years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a budget is always about more than figures and dollars.  It is about how a 
<br/>government sets its priorities and drives change.  We will certainly talk tonight, Sir, about budget 
<br/>allocations as usual, but even more importantly, we will also talk about reforms that we need; reforms 
<br/>that consider that what we have learned through the pandemic and seize on new opportunities for 
<br/>growth because while Government must fund its priorities, it also must set the proper conditions for 
<br/>the  people  to  thrive.    It  must  change  laws,  regulations  and  administrative  procedures  to  meet  the 
<br/>demands of a changing society.  It must embrace new knowledge and technology.  It must have the 
<br/>discipline and the wisdom to do what Government does best and to let the private sector do what it 
<br/>does best.   Most important of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it must know when to get out of the way, when 
<br/>to alleviate the burden of cumbersome and regulations and let people work and produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will talk about several big picture reforms that will create more vitality 
<br/></span><span>in  healthcare,  urban  development,  housing,  land  leasing,  human  development,  transportation  and 
<br/></span><span>agriculture. They will do that by loosening or removing structures that have become too bogged with 
<br/>bureaucracy, that favoured a privileged few or that no longer serve a purpose.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think everyone in this Parliament will find some of these current practices 
<br/>shocking and others simply not appropriate for our time - if indeed they ever were appropriate.  Others 
<br/>have simply outlived their usefulness and need to go.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, a modern country like Fiji 
<br/>simply needs greater flexibility. We owe it to the Fijian people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I will speak on the tourism sector as it returns as an engine of economic 
<br/>growth. We have built a springboard to propel the recovery of our tourism sector to a new level and 
<br/>it is now time to spring forward.  We have already opened the border and removed the curfew, here 
<br/>is what is next.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After weeks of establishing private testing facilities nationwide, we are ready to remove the 
<br/>three-night stay requirement upon entry into Fiji.   From 7</span><span>th</span><span> April, fully vaccinated visitors, residents 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and citizens will only need to conduct a rapid antigen COVID-19 test within 24 hours of arrival in 
<br/>the country at an approved testing facility. A full list of the locations will be published on line. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Bringing in more private sector test providers brings in competition that lowers prices and 
<br/>saves costs for visitors - especially tourists and those visiting friends and family or returning citizens 
<br/>- making Fiji a more attractive destination.   So, instead of visitors being beholden to a hotel, they 
<br/>will get their rapid tests done at an approved provider.  Hotels are not going to be the providers and 
<br/>only remote ones can be a provider and only if they obtain approval from the Ministry of Commerce, 
<br/>Trade, Tourism and Transport (MCTTT).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All visitors to Fiji will play by the same rules because from 7th April, we will also do away 
<br/>with the Travel Partner system. In other words, anyone from anywhere in the world, as long as they 
<br/>are vaccinated, can come to Fiji. Mr Speaker Sir, the most important thing as we have highlighted is 
<br/>that the visitors must be vaccinated. If they are, and if they test upon arrival, their country of origin 
<br/>is of course, far less important.  And our Blue Lanes initiative which was a smashing success through 
<br/>COVID is now giving way to normalised maritime travel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  announcing  these  changes  with  confidence  because  we  have  developed  a  careful 
<br/></span><span>framework for COVID safety that can be reactivated if and when we need them. But cases at the 
<br/></span><span>moment are low, so there is no need for the most stringent public health measures to remain in force.  
<br/>That is why Mr. Speaker, Sir, from tomorrow the wearing of masks will become optional, and all 
<br/>venues may operate at full capacity.  Churches can operate at full capacity, stadiums can operate at 
<br/>full capacity, social distancing requirements will no longer be enforced either.  It is up to the people 
<br/>to apply the more than two years of experience we have with COVID-19 to do what makes them feel 
<br/>comfortable and safe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  rollbacks  will  continue  ramping  our  economy  upwards.  As  that  happens,  we  are 
<br/>committed to keeping taxes low on our tourism sector to keep costs down and encourage more visitors 
<br/>to  come  to  Fiji.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  now  head  into  peak  season,  we  expect  to  step  up  our 
<br/>marketing which requires additional resources.  Turn on a television or go to the internet in the USA 
<br/>or  Australia  and  you  will  see  promotions  for  competing  destinations  -  Mexico,  Jamaica,  Bali, 
<br/>Seychelles, Tahiti and Hawaii.   We need to be there as well, fighting for the tourist dollar.  So the 
<br/>marketing grant to Tourism Fiji will increase by $893,000, to a total of $20.9 million.  In the revised 
<br/>budget, we are also allocating an increase of $700,000 for Tourism Fiji’s operational expenses. This 
<br/>will primarily be to bring back staff to five days a week and hire additional marketing staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji received 50,742 visitors from December 2021, when we opened our 
<br/></span><span>borders  until  February  2022.  The  first  flights  to  land  in  Fiji  were  flown  by  Fiji  Airways  and  our 
<br/>national carrier continues to bring in the bulk of tourists. Those dollars are flying into Fiji and staying 
<br/>in Fiji because Government support ensured that our national carrier has survived and it is here to 
<br/>stay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall our network total bookings held for all markets is growing by 9 per cent week on 
<br/>week, and total bookings held of 226,889 are only 22 per cent lower than the 2019 levels. This 22 
<br/>per cent Mr. Speaker, Sir, will disappear in the coming weeks as New Zealand ramps up.  On the 
<br/>other  hand  Australia  bookings  held  to  151,186  which  is  5.5  per  cent  higher  than  2019.  North 
<br/>American bookings are  growing by 10 per cent  week on week and New Zealand by 34 per cent.  
<br/>People want to come to Fiji, and they need to know that we want them to come back and we are open 
<br/>for business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  long-term,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  want  tourism’s  revival  to  reach  beyond  its 
<br/>traditional hubs and the traditional ways to which we have become accustomed. We will be reforming

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the management structure of Fiji Airports to tap synergies that drive more of its revenues towards 
<br/>investments that improve our airports, especially in the outer islands.  As we extend ocean and climate 
<br/>commitments  nationwide,  like  protected  forests  and  marine  protected  areas,  our  recovery,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, gives us a chance for a reset that opens Fiji to more sustainable blue and green tourism 
<br/>opportunities.   And it is important that we have robust airport infrastructure nationwide that helps 
<br/>create these opportunities for Fijian communities everywhere in Fiji, including in remote locations. 
<br/>Tourism aside, that matters a great deal to all of us who want to visit our friends and family in these 
<br/>parts of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we would not be in this position today without the extraordinary effort of 
<br/>our healthcare professionals who managed the COVID pandemic and we do not forget a single one 
<br/>of them tonight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- We have been working hard over the last several years to 
<br/>modernize and improve our healthcare system, and the improvement shows in new urban facilities, 
<br/>greater  coverage  in  rural  areas,  hospital  in  Navosa,  more  treatments  and  specialties  offered,  and 
<br/></span><span>generally better care.  The pandemic put our entire system under enormous strain. But we think, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker,  Sir,  it  also  crystallized  the  thinking  of  many  people  about  how  we  could  deliver  better 
<br/>medical care to our citizens by doing things differently - by outsourcing services, by encouraging 
<br/>more private medicine and by giving our citizens greater choice in medical care.  We must continue 
<br/>to invest in our health systems but some of the most useful changes do not involve much expenditure, 
<br/>they mostly require changes in policy or regulation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the height of the Delta-wave of COVID-19 in Fiji, we announced that the Government 
<br/>would directly fund access to private Government Practitioners (GPs) for Fijians who used to depend 
<br/>entirely on the public health system.  Since last year’s announcement, Government has spent more 
<br/>than  $1.4  million  to  cater  for  the  cost  of  general  outpatient  services  under  the  Public-Private 
<br/>Partnership (PPP) with GPs. These services include consultations, reviews, referrals, some injections, 
<br/>some dressings and other minor services for more than 52,000 Fijians.  This has eased the strain on 
<br/>the public health centres and enabled GPs to grow their patient-base - a win-win for the health of 
<br/>Fijians and the development of the medical profession.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is next for the health of our people?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Number one, we are building on that game-changing initiative.  Imagine a Fijian in Fiji where 
<br/></span><span>every person can have their own private doctor if they chose.  If they could visit a doctor who knows 
<br/>them  and  their  family,  who  has  treated  them  before  and  knows  their  lifestyle  and  their  personal 
<br/>circumstances.  We have fine doctors and they give good care in our clinics and hospitals but there 
<br/>is no substitute on a day-to-day basis for a personal relationship with their own family physician.  
<br/>That is the future we want to build for Fiji and that is where we are headed.  We are also making 
<br/>more government-funded services available at these clinics, in the private clinics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beginning in April, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians who qualify for the free GP Programme will be 
<br/>able to access a range of blood tests, multi-urine dipstick tests, ECG, nebuliser treatment, oxygen 
<br/>supply and ultrasound scans, all at no cost.  The GPs will prescribe medicine and even provide the 
<br/>medicine to patients after hours if needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With FijiCare, we will soon launch a dedicated website for the initiative that contains Online 
<br/>Patient Information System to streamline the administration of the initiative.  Through this online 
<br/>platform, GPs will have access to all those patients seen under the PPP scheme.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also want to end the restrictive practices that have made it unduly difficult for doctors to 
<br/>enter private practice.  These practices have been used by some doctors to restrict the market  by 
<br/>keeping the number of private practitioners artificially low and they are unacceptable in a modern 
<br/>economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  physician  in  the  public  sector,  works  for  government,  who 
<br/>wishes to establish a private practice must find another private practitioner who is on the approved 
<br/>list of mentors and the list of mentors in the private sector is very small.  This is a very small list 
<br/>established by the Fiji College of General Practitioners.  He or she then must work under that mentor 
<br/>for two years before being licenced to set up a private practice and that can be extended for six months 
<br/>at the recommendation of the mentor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has led to some truly bizarre situations and some appalling examples 
<br/>of the GP guild protecting its turf.  For example, a physician with 15 or 20 years of experience in the 
<br/>government  health  system  will  still  have  to  work  under  a  mentor  and  at  a  significant  financial 
<br/>sacrifice and we know of cases where mentors have coerced doctors under their supervision to sign 
<br/>agreements  not  to  establish  their  practices  within  20  kilometres  of  their  mentors’  clinic.    This  is 
<br/>outrageous cartelling and must be stopped.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to harness the experience of our physicians from the public health system and not 
<br/>force them to waste their time in what amounts to meaningless </span><span>pro forma</span><span> internships.  It is an insult 
<br/>to people who have studied and practiced their professions honourably and well, and it wastes time 
<br/>that could be spent seeing people who need a doctor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our reform will begin by allowing any physician who has been practicing in the public sector 
<br/>for more than seven years post-internship to enter private practice immediately as long as he or she 
<br/>receives  a  certificate  of  good  standing  from  the  Fiji  Medical  Council  and  is  admitted  to  the  Fiji 
<br/>College of General Practitioners and holds a post-graduate qualification in General Practice that is 
<br/>approved by the College.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Physicians  with  three  to  five  years’  experience  would  still  have  to  work  under  a  private 
<br/>mentor for two years, while physicians with five to seven years’ experience will only have to work 
<br/>under a private mentor for six months.  The specific details on this reform will be prescribed under 
<br/>an amendment to the Medical and Dental Practitioner (General Practice) Regulations 2010.  From 
<br/>tomorrow,  General  Practitioners  under  this  PPP  scheme  will  not  be  restricted  from  procuring 
<br/>medicine from the Government pharmacy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, another $200,000 has been allocated to incentivise private GPs to 
<br/>open up new surgeries or clinics in rural areas such as Nawaicoba, Malolo, Naidovi, Drasa, Sabeto, 
<br/>Seaqaqa, Dreketi and Nasarawaqa.  We can have private doctors set up clinics.  We will incentivise 
<br/>them to go there.  We will pay them some up-front fees and they can be based in those rural areas.  
<br/>People  have  to  travel  hours  to  reach  their  nearest  health  centre  facility  to  get  medical  attention.  
<br/>Through this, we are trying to bring the doctors and the medical services closer to the people so they 
<br/>have quick access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will further support these doctors and the people they serve by engaging private medical 
<br/>laboratories to analyse blood samples referred by  GPs engaged under this programme.  Our rural 
<br/>inhabitants have the right to high-quality laboratory results, an essential component for the successful 
<br/>prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illnesses.  This is funded at half a million dollars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as advertised last week, we would like to extend the service by adding more 
<br/>GPs in the areas not currently being serviced.  This will increase the number of GP clinics available 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>793  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to rural and low income Fijians that have been relying and who have been relying fully on the public 
<br/>health system; the general outpatient services and are not currently patients of a private GP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Free  GP  Scheme  will  also  now  include  free  dental  access  to  dental 
<br/>practitioners as we will now be engaging the private Dental Practitioners (DPs) to improve the oral 
<br/>health of all Fijians including school and children.  People who once depended fully on the public 
<br/>health  system  for  dental  services  and  are  not  existing  paying  clients  or  private  DPs  will  have 
<br/>government-funded access to private dental care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, oral care is healthcare.  Poor dental health is a major burden on society and 
<br/>a major source of other health problems.  The more Fijians who can access regular dental check-ups, 
<br/>the more we will save in future costs to treat illnesses like diabetes, kidney disease and heart disease, 
<br/>all of which are linked to poor oral hygiene.  The cost of these private dental services would be borne 
<br/>by the Fijian Government at an agreed price with individual DPs and private medical dental centres 
<br/>and hospitals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  will  offer  services  like  consultation,  oral  examination,  extractions  and  temporary  and 
<br/>permanent fillings.  Patients will be served faster and dentists will be able to expand their services to 
<br/></span><span>more patients through the same model as the Free GP programme.  A half million dollars have been 
<br/></span><span>allocated for this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  also  be  outsourcing  biomedical  services  like  x-ray  machines, 
<br/>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machines, ultrasound machines and CT scanners. Public health 
<br/>system  laboratories  will  also  be  maintained  and  operated  24/7  by  the  private  sector  in  public 
<br/>hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Outsourcing has become popular as a method to streamline operations and control operating 
<br/>costs. This is especially true for hospitals and other healthcare facilities.  Due to all the technological 
<br/>advances  in  biomedical  equipment,  keeping  up  with  regulatory  compliance  has  become  a 
<br/>monumental, time-consuming task; one that can overwhelm both the staff and the budget. To improve 
<br/>the quality of care at our public hospitals, we will be outsourcing biomedical services.  This will 
<br/>reduce operating expenses at our public hospitals, allow us to focus on our core responsibilities and 
<br/>maximise equipment performance and longevity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By outsourcing the maintenance of medical equipment also, we will have immediate access 
<br/>to  the highest-level  technician for even the most sophisticated devices. The provider will have to 
<br/></span><span>ensure that qualified technicians are always available and there will be a requirement to have a certain 
<br/></span><span>percentage of up time. A half million dollars is allocated for this in the Revised 2021-2022 Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  as  announced  in  the  2021-2022  National  Budget,  we  are  taking  a  two-
<br/>pronged approach to ensuring affordable and equitable access to dialysis treatment in Fiji.  First, we 
<br/>increased the subsidy from $75 to $150 per dialysis treatment for low-income patients; and second, 
<br/>we brought in Private Service Providers under the Kidney Dialysis Treatment Subsidy programme.  
<br/>Since the announcement of these changes to the Programme through the 2021-2022 National Budget, 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  have  engaged  five  Private  Service  Providers  to 
<br/>supplement the Government-operated facilities in Labasa, Suva, Lautoka and Nadera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, to date, a total of 135 registered patients are receiving their subsidised kidney 
<br/>treatment under the Programme at six facilities across Fiji, with each patient receiving on average 
<br/>eight treatments per month. That support will continue in this revised budget with a funding of $1.2 
<br/>million.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, medicine in Fiji was not free until we made it so in 2015, a move that has 
<br/>created  an  invaluable  benefit  to  thousands  of  Fijians.  The  initial  list  covered  72  drugs  that  were 
<br/>available to low-income patients who could not otherwise afford them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since its launch, the list of free medicines has expanded to cover 140 items, comprising 136 
<br/>medicinal products and four consumable items, mainly wound dressing materials. To qualify for free 
<br/>medicine,  individuals  have  had  to  apply  through  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  or 
<br/>simply show they qualify  for any of our many other social welfare schemes, such as the Poverty 
<br/>Benefit Scheme, Child Protection Allowance and Social Pension Scheme. As announced in the 2021-
<br/>2022 National Budget, this initiative was extended to include patients served through the PPP General 
<br/>Practitioners Scheme.  So, what is next, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Pharmaceutical  and  Biomedical  Services  Centre  will  launch  an  improved 
<br/>implementation model for the Programme in April of this year. Under the new model, participating 
<br/>private pharmacies will dispense listed medications from their own inventory and will be reimbursed 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services.  This  will  improve  efficiency  and  service.  The 
<br/>transition from the old implementation model to new model will be done in phases, and will only be 
<br/>implemented with the consent of participating pharmacies. The Free Medicine Programme is funded 
<br/></span><span>at $8 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the newly upgraded Lautoka Hospital will hand over to Health Care (Fiji) 
<br/>Pte Ltd on midnight 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2022. Over a nine month transition period, additional staff will be 
<br/>recruited  and  trained.    In  addition,  new  systems  and  procedures  will  be  implemented  across  all 
<br/>departments.  From  early  May,  open-heart  surgeries  will  be  available  at  the  Lautoka  Hospital  –– 
<br/>marking the first time in history that this procedure will be available all days of the year in Fiji. Other 
<br/>benefits  will be added in the coming months including  cardiac catheterisation, chemotherapy  and 
<br/>renal dialysis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Concurrently, work is being undertaken to build a new Lautoka Hospital or new wing at the 
<br/>current site with no interruption to services.  Ba Hospital will move from Ba Mission Hospital on 9</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April.    All  current  services  delivered  at  the  Ba  Mission  Hospital  will  be  provided  at  the  newly 
<br/>upgraded Ba Hospital facility. But this is more than just a move, it is a wholesale upgrade of hospital 
<br/>services in the West. Two operating theatres will come online in the coming months, and the hospital 
<br/>will offer 24-hour cardiovascular surgeries, chemotherapy and other critical services.  It  will also 
<br/>give local doctors exposure and valuable training in these expert medical fields, where we want Fiji 
<br/>to excel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir we wish to give special thanks to the Australian Infrastructure Investment 
<br/>Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIIFP), which is willing to provide financing for this PPP and is 
<br/>also exploring the possibility of directly financing the project. Government is allocating $13 million 
<br/>to operationalise the PPP arrangement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the pandemic was also defining for digitisation. This Government has always 
<br/>seen connectivity as a key to economic growth and opportunities for our people. As a Pacific island 
<br/>nation separated from  our neighbouring countries and even from our own fellow citizens by vast 
<br/>expanses  of  open  ocean,  we  saw  connectivity  as  a  unifying  force  for  society,  government  and 
<br/>business,  and  we  have  embraced  it.  We  had  already  achieved  nationwide  connectivity  which  we 
<br/>relied on, during the pandemic to digitally pay out unemployment assistance through M-PAiSA and 
<br/>MyCash and to relay life-saving public health information. What is next is a national embrace of the 
<br/>rest of the digital revolution.

<div><span> Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>795  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our commitment is to provide equitable access –– meaning high and reliable speeds to digital 
<br/>services  everywhere  in  Fiji  and  to  provide  a  digital  payment  option  to  all  government  services 
<br/>delivered to the public, all wages paid to civil servants and all assistance paid to the vulnerable. So 
<br/>civil  servants  who  live  in  remote  areas  or  who  wish  to  have  their  salaries  paid  by  M-PAiSA  or 
<br/>MyCash, they can choose to do so.  People on welfare - if they want their welfare payments to be 
<br/>paid on M-PAiSA or MyCash, they can choose to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more Fijians are becoming comfortable in online spaces everywhere. We 
<br/>have been personally to some of Vanua Levu’s most isolated communities where we have established 
<br/>connectivity. We want to give a special thanks to those Fijians we met at Lutukina District School, 
<br/>Koroinasolo  Village  School,  Qalitu  District  School,  Dawara  District  School,  St.  Pauls  Primary 
<br/>School, Wailevu East Primary School, Vunisalusalu Primary School, Volivoli Primary School, Lagi 
<br/>Health Centre and Dogotuki Nursing Centre who are able to stream this session of Parliament today 
<br/>as we speak. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of now, 95 per cent of our people have access to high speed and low-cost internet across 
<br/>3G,  4G  and  4G+  networks.  Now  we  are  focused  on  connecting  the  remaining  5  per  cent  of 
<br/>unconnected Fijians. Mr. Speaker, Sir, last November, we connected 26 schools and 14 health centres 
<br/></span><span>in the Northern Division. Of these 40 sites, 26 have Wi-Fi hotspots that provide connectivity for the 
<br/></span><span>surrounding community. We have further identified 59 unconnected and poorly connected schools 
<br/>nationwide. We have allocated a budget to connect 10 sites in this financial year and undertake site 
<br/>assessments for the remaining sites to determine the appropriate solutions for each school and the 
<br/>surrounding community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also working closely with the telecom companies to pinpoint the coordinates of the 
<br/>317 unconnected or poorly connected sites we have identified, we can properly design innovative, 
<br/>cost-effective  and  sustainable  solutions.  In  fact,  this  number  has  decreased  because  the  telcos’ 
<br/>infrastructure upgrades have increased connectivity in some areas. Under the infrastructure sharing 
<br/>model, 15 possible tower sites have been identified to connect at least 96 locations. The Universal 
<br/>Service Fund will then be used to install networks, provide services and cover operating costs in the 
<br/>universal  service  area,  as  provided  under  the  law.  We  have  allocated  $570,000  to  undertake  site 
<br/>assessments and identify the exact locations that have recently been connected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have been consistent in our efforts to connect everyone to the digital 
<br/>television platform so that a person living in Southern Lau can watch the same programme on his or 
<br/>her television as the person living in Suva. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, we had fully transitioned to the digital television platform by November 2021 for 
<br/>the areas from Pacific Harbour to Korovou and Nadi to Lautoka connecting over 130,000 households. 
<br/>We are now focussing on the areas from Pacific Harbour to Nadi and Lautoka to Korovou which will 
<br/>connect about 42,059 households by May 2022. Once completed, we can say that all of Viti Levu 
<br/>has migrated onto the digital television platform. We will commence with the digital switch-over 
<br/>activities for the Fijians living in Vanua Levu and other parts of Fiji in July of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the recent global surge in COVID cases and as part of future-proofing 
<br/>our COVID-19 response efforts, we intend to roll out the Fijian Vaccine Pass (FVP) in the next few 
<br/>months. The first phase will be focussed on citizens and permit holders who have been vaccinated in 
<br/>Fiji and who need to travel overseas because overseas countries require proof of your vaccination.  
<br/>We have allocated a budget for the operational and technical components, including the set-up of 
<br/>FVP personalisation and issuance centres in the Central, Western and Northern Divisions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fijian Vaccine Pass will be in both digital and paper format and contain an individual’s 
<br/>profile picture for easier identification. It will be free of charge, safe and secure,  and the vaccine 
<br/>certificates of all family members  can be stored  on one smartphone.  It will  also  display  negative 
<br/>COVID test results and issue a verifiable, secure and interoperable QR code that can be scanned and 
<br/>ingested by the Fijian Vaccine Pass app. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  most  economists  and  policy  makers  view  unemployment  assistance  as  a 
<br/>temporary measure, part of the social safety net that sustains people in hard times. That changed last 
<br/>year, when it became a vital economic, social and humanitarian tool.  The assistance helped keep 
<br/>families afloat and injected cash into the economy. We know many people were grateful for it, and 
<br/>so were we.  Every Fijian benefited directly or indirectly from unemployment assistance. The amount 
<br/>was less important than the fact that Government could be depended upon to maintain social stability 
<br/>and ensure that people did not become destitute and hopeless.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  in  2021  provided  $430  million  through  its  unemployment  assistance 
<br/>programme directly to more than 400,000 people in the formal and informal sectors. This programme 
<br/>was targeted at the population in Viti Levu because of the prolonged lockdowns and restrictions on 
<br/>the island.  What is next, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  While we can count on our recovery to deliver prosperity 
<br/></span><span>for Fijians, there is more we can do and we will do to heal the wounds of the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although many areas in the Northern Division were not under strict lockdowns for long, many 
<br/>people suffered economic losses because of their direct connection to the Viti Levu economy. Not 
<br/>forgetting  those  affected  in  the  informal  sector,  this  budget  has  allocated  $13  million  towards 
<br/>unemployment assistance for people in Vanua Levu. These Fijians will have the opportunity to apply 
<br/>for a one-off assistance of $100. The specifics of this plan will be announced soon as to when it will 
<br/>open up. This programme also includes a one-off assistance of $50 to all social welfare recipients in 
<br/>Fiji. The bus fare subsidy for the elderly and disabled will be increased from the current $10 per 
<br/>month to $25 per month at a total cost of $6 million dollars benefitting close to 40,000 Fijians.  This 
<br/>was a major request because as we know the borders have opened up, people are now travelling more 
<br/>to get to markets or visit friends and relatives.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, housing is a basic need and a right of every person. Government seeks to 
<br/>create the proper economic conditions and regulatory framework to ensure an adequate supply of 
<br/>housing, and it steps in to help people at the bottom of the economic ladder to secure decent housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the First Home Ownership Programme was launched in 2014 to provide 
<br/></span><span>affordable  and  quality  housing  for  low  and  middle-income  earners.  Since  its  inception,  the 
<br/></span><span>Programme has assisted approximately 3,400 Fijian households with a total funding of $36 million.  
<br/>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an enormous amount and we can say about the nature of this Programme 
<br/>and how it functions, but the simple mission of this initiative is to give Fijians faith that owning a 
<br/>house is possible. Home ownership gives people something worthwhile and rewarding to work for 
<br/>and  save  for.  For  most  people,  a  home  is  a  single  largest  investment  they  will  ever  make.  It  is 
<br/>something  they  can  pass  on  to  their  children  because  for  all  the  growth  that  we  create  for  the 
<br/>economy, what makes that prosperity count is the faith it instils in young Fijians –– the faith that they 
<br/>can benefit and build on our success.  We are not  just talking about  that promise, we are actually 
<br/>funding it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Payments for the First Home Programme are in excess of $5 million for the current financial 
<br/>year alone. In the 2021-2022 Budge,t a total of $4 million was allocated, and the total allocation was 
<br/>paid out within the first few months only, assisting 211 families.  In other words, the uptake was 
<br/>enormous. So, what is next? More homes and more hope for the first-time home buyers and builders.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>797  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  meet  mounting  demand  in  the  Revised  2021-2022  Budget,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and 
<br/>Community Development is provided an additional $5.9 million in funding this particular support.</span><span> </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  is  committed  to 
<br/>review the Social Housing Assistance Policy to introduce a more sustainable and climate resilient 
<br/>housing  assistance  programme.  The  2017  Census  had  revealed  that  46  per  cent  of  rural  housing 
<br/>structures are of poor quality, with 42 per cent of houses made with tin and corrugated iron. We have 
<br/>all seen the aftermath of the new breed of super storms that are striking Fiji with terrifying regularity 
<br/>and the intensity is quite amazing and shocking.  The shocking sight of metal sheets strewn about 
<br/>communities. They are a serious hazard, as storm winds rip them from roofs at killer speeds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only moral  answer to the question of “what  is  next” for these communities is  greater 
<br/>resilience. The revised policy will support the construction of cyclone certified homes. It will also 
<br/>move away from the old one-third and two-third contribution model. Instead, successful applicants 
<br/>will  receive  $10,000  grant  assistance  for  the  purchase  and  transportation  of  building  materials 
<br/>(building  materials  for  an  approved  housing  model.)  The  Social  Housing  Programme  has  been 
<br/>allocated $600,000 in the Revised 2021-2022 Budget to implement the revised policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2009,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Urban  Development  and 
<br/></span><span>Housing  together  with  the  People’s  Community  Network  (PCN)  Charitable  Trust  signed  a 
<br/>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the Lagilagi Housing Project in Jittu Estate, Suva, for 
<br/>the construction of 153 affordable housing units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first phase was the construction of 33 units, completed at a total value of $2.9 million. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to date, 117 units have been fully completed at the total cost of $15.6 million. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, PCN has acted shamelessly in what amounted to a fleecing of people who had put their 
<br/>hopes in this project and handed over their hard-earned savings in deposit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2019,  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  conducted  an 
<br/>investigation  on  the  Lagilagi  Housing  Project  after  receiving  numerous  complaints.  The  FCCC’s 
<br/>investigation  revealed  significant  problems  in  governance  and  risk  management  and  substantial 
<br/>financial irregularities. The PCN kept the deposits of eligible people and then sold units to people 
<br/>who were not eligible, some who were in fact also wealthy business people. Other money that was 
<br/>collected had simply vanished. The whole thing reeked of corruption and fraud, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and  the  matter  will  now  be  referred  to  appropriate  authorities  for  further  investigation  and  legal 
<br/>action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we, as a Government, we feel that we have a moral obligation to repay the 
<br/>hardworking Fijians who worked hard and saved for homes they were promised. With the assistance 
<br/>of FCCC, the Ministry of Housing and Community Development has identified 3,367 complainants, 
<br/>whose deposits amount to some $2.2 million which till to date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you go to certain 
<br/>restaurants waiters and waitresses will come up to you and say “I gave $10,000, I have got nothing 
<br/>in return.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Revised  2021-2022  Budget,  the  Ministry  is  allocated  $2.27  million  for  the 
<br/>reimbursement of the victims of PCN’s scams</span><span>.</span><span>  In addition, the Ministry is in consultation with the 
<br/>Solicitor General’s Office to ensure that the lease titles are transferred from PCN to the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources because it was Government’s land after all.  In good faith we gave it 
<br/>to PCN, they have abused it, the Ministry of Lands has now moved in and will get back the title of 
<br/>the land.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  $4  million  was  allocated  towards  the  iTaukei  Land  Development 
<br/>Programme,  which  helps  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  landowners  develop  their  land  for  residential  and  commercial 
<br/>purposes or subdivide their land. Currently, there are nine projects being carried out under iTaukei 
<br/>Land  Development  Programme.  We  have  completed  construction  works  in  Saweni,  Wairabetia, 
<br/>Nasoqela, Vuda 1 and Yadua Subdivisions.   Once all the projects are completed, there will be a total 
<br/>of 308 lots available for leasing - 270 residential lots, 14 non-residential lots and 24 industrial lots 
<br/>with a total land area of 61.02 hectares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Yadua  and  Nasoqela  Subdivision  in  Namata  are  climate  resilient,  with  underground 
<br/>cabling by EFL and climate resilience upgrade and progress for the other two subdivisions in Saweni 
<br/>and  Wairebetia,  which  will  incorporate  climate  resilient  designs.    These  lots  are  now  already 
<br/>available and people have expressed interest to invest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, earlier this month, the Vuda Phase II and Tubalevu Subdivision in Tavua projects 
<br/>were awarded for construction.  The construction works at these subdivisions will soon commence.  
<br/>These subdivisions will be climate resilient compliant also.  The Saravi and Viseisei Subdivisions 
<br/>are now under consultancy phase, with the design scheme being completed and necessary approvals 
<br/>are being obtained from the relevant regulatory authorities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, improving the nation’s infrastructure has been a priority of this Government 
<br/>from the beginning.  We have been busily rebuilding Fiji’s network of roads and jetties and we have 
<br/>ambitious goals to provide electricity to every household by 2026, and clean water to every household 
<br/>by 2030.  We think every Fijian can look back to the condition of our roads 15 years ago and be 
<br/>pleased  with  the  vast  improvements.    We  are  simply  better  connected  physically  today  than  ever 
<br/>before, and that is good for families and businesses.  Roads everywhere suffer damage from storms 
<br/>and heavy traffic, but today our roads are well maintained and quickly repaired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Continued investment in Fiji’s transport infrastructure has been a priority of the Government, 
<br/>precisely  because  it  is  necessary  for  economic  growth  and  the  general  welfare  of  the  country.  
<br/>Sustained investments  into  roads, bridges and jetties give people access to  services,  facilities and 
<br/>markets.  So, what is next for our roads?  In the 2021-2022 Revised Budget, a sum of $338.2 million 
<br/>is provided to the Authority, and $13.1 million will enable FRA to carry out its daily operations and 
<br/>$325.1 million will finance important capital programmes.  A sum of $72.9 million is allocated for 
<br/>the  maintenance  of  Fiji’s  transport  network  and  road  assets  such  as  drainage,  footpaths,  railings, 
<br/>signage, lights and signals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Changes  to  our  climate,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course  contribute  to  the  increasing  costs  of 
<br/></span><span>maintaining  our  transport  infrastructure,  and  $21.8  million  is  allocated  for  emergency  restoration 
<br/>works to key infrastructure that suffered damaged due to </span><span>TC Cody</span><span> and other severe weather events.   
<br/>Due to the damages to non-FRA roads since January 2022, due to </span><span>TC Cody</span><span> and heavy rain fall, as 
<br/>we saw that received such heavy rainfall that parts of our highway between Sigatoka and Nadi had 
<br/>been washed away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA also has been receiving requests for the repair of non-FRA roads and 
<br/>other assets, mainly  repair of community roads, crossings,  culverts  and  clearing of drainage.  An 
<br/>amount  of  $5  million  is  allocated  for  the  rehabilitation  for  non-FRA  roads  as  a  one-off  funding.  
<br/>Under this allocation, priority will be given to those roads that provide access to hospitals, health 
<br/>centres,  schools,  settlements,  communities,  villages  and  markets.    Our  programme  to  replace 
<br/>dilapidated jetties in our maritime islands will continue so that we can further improve accessibility 
<br/>and the delivery of services to these islands.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, $60 million is allocated to FRA for 
<br/>the renewal and replacement of severely deteriorated roads, particularly, under the “Rip and Remake” 
<br/>programme which has markedly improved the conditions of the sealed road network.  Mr. Speaker,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, $34.02 million is provided for maintenance and repair bridges, $14.5 million will fund ongoing 
<br/>contracts under the Rural Roads Programme which aims to enhance transport connectivity for our 
<br/>rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  sum  of  $102.1  million  is  provided  for  the  ongoing  Transport  Infrastructure  Investment 
<br/>Sector  Programme  (TIISP)  to  rehabilitate  major  roads  along  Queen’s  and  King’s  Roads,  and 
<br/>complete the designs for the 40 critical bridges and three jetties in Natovi, Savusavu and Nabouwalu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nadi River Flood Alleviation Project is pressing ahead, with physical 
<br/>works to begin on a drainage system in Nadi Town proper and design works for the widening of the 
<br/>Nadi River to reduce flooding that has long devastated communities along the river.  The project has 
<br/>been delayed due to COVID-19, but all efforts are now put into place to expedite the works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are funding that effort through a renewed mix of commitments from grant funding from 
<br/>the Japanese and Australian governments along with $3million in government funding.  Discussions 
<br/>will also be held with the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to gauge their 
<br/>interest for the project funding for Project B or Part B, which included river widening, river deepening 
<br/>and construction of a dike and desilting of the river. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a water problem in Fiji, there is no doubt about that.  A massive 
<br/>rural-to-urban drift and the increase in informal settlements in between Lami to Nausori corridor has 
<br/>placed a massive strain on ageing water infrastructure that we are urgently addressing.  Some 310,000 
<br/>Fijians now reside in the Lami-to-Nausori corridor (one third of our population), which is one of the 
<br/>many  reasons  that  has  caused  intermittent  water  supply.    Adverse  weather  conditions  such  as 
<br/>cyclones and heavy rainfall also cause flooding and high turbidity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the ageing infrastructure that makes up the reticulation system was built during 
<br/>our Colonial times and currently presents major challenges for both capacity and maintenance. There 
<br/>was no replacement or preventive maintenance programme for the ageing infrastructure, of course, 
<br/>some of which has been said was put in place during Colonial times or even indeed in the early years 
<br/>of our Independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Revised 2021-2022 Budget for the Water Authority of Fiji is $195.2 million of which 
<br/>$80.7 million is for operating expenditure and $114.5 million is for capital investment</span><span> </span><span>in our water 
<br/>and wastewater network. Some of the projects include emergency water tanks in communities where 
<br/>water supply is unreliable. Because while urgent work must be undertaken, communities cannot wait 
<br/></span><span>it out with an intermittent supply of water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An allocation of $6.3 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is provided to address the water disruption 
<br/>issues in the Suva-Nausori corridor, Nadi, Lautoka and Labasa.  To date, 34,385 households have 
<br/>benefited from Government’s free water initiative at a cost of $475,000. This will continue to expand 
<br/>in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government will be now bringing back, given the economy bouncing back the Rainwater 
<br/>Harvesting Programme whereby we provide a subsidy of 70 per cent for rainwater harvesting systems 
<br/>in rural areas. Applicants are required to construct the base for the water tank and gutter system. An 
<br/>amount of $1 million is allocated in the Revised Budget to cover those applications pending at Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji since 2019 and delayed due to the COVID pandemic.

<div><span>The Viria Project will reduce the number and extent of water disruptions and other woes in 
<br/>the greater Suva-Nausori corridor, and an amount of $40.9 million is allocated for it in the Revised 
<br/>2021-2022  Budget.  Despite  delays  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  construction  is  well  underway  and

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expected to be completed by the first quarter of next year (2023). The total cost of the project, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is around a whopping $270 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  one  of  the  largest  water  infrastructure  projects  ever  undertaken  in  Fiji.  Once 
<br/>completed, the project will increase the capacity of the Water Authority of Fiji in the Suva-Nausori 
<br/>area by 40 million litres per day with the plant designed for an additional capacity of 40 million litres 
<br/>per day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has funded to the tune of more than $187 million since 
<br/>2012 to carry electricity to homes in our peri-urban and rural areas. This can only improve standards 
<br/>of living and increase economic opportunities and the investment reflects Government’s commitment 
<br/>to provide affordable, reliable, modern and sustainable energy services for all Fijians with over 100 
<br/>per cent national coverage by 2026.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A total budget of $9.7 million has been allocated for the Housewiring and Grid Extension 
<br/>Programme; $3.65 million of that total is</span><span> </span><span>for the complete installation of proper wiring in homes that 
<br/>will connect to the EFL grid system which will benefit 42,486 Fijians; </span><span>$</span><span>6.1 million</span><span> </span><span>has been allocated 
<br/>to extend the grid to communities that are not currently served.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The extension of EFL grid networks will benefit the rural areas that do not currently have 
<br/>access to electricity. A total of 48 schemes will be implemented with more than 5,000 Fijians who 
<br/>will benefit from the programme - 13 in the Central Division, 29 in the Western Division and 6 in 
<br/>the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  the  next  three  financial  years,  the  Fijian  Government  will  be 
<br/>allocating a sum of around $20 million to fund a total of 177 schemes for which survey and quotations 
<br/>have been completed by EFL.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have got a long list here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I mean in the interest of time I will not read out 
<br/>all of them but this will actually benefit more than 10,000 Fijians living in all parts of Fiji and this 
<br/>list can be published later on, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  but  not  the least,  the Government  will also  ensure that the households in  the Central 
<br/>Division that do not have access to electricity in areas such as Korovou, Tailevu, Namosi, Naitasiri, 
<br/>and Serua will also be connected to the grid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agriculture  was  one  of  our  most  consistent  drivers  of  growth  through 
<br/></span><span>COVID. Some obscurantists deny the investment we have made but they sound silly when you see 
<br/>our  record.  With  the  full  support  of  their  Government,  Fiji’s  farmers  set  a  record  in  agricultural 
<br/>exports in the year 2020. Our objective is for that trend to keep rising exponentially if possible. That 
<br/>starts with recognising where consumer demand is headed and harnessing technology to step-up our 
<br/>scale, particularly in opportunity-rich niches.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  order  for  our  agriculture  sector  to  develop,  grow  and  adapt  to  new 
<br/>markets, social and climate conditions will need to adopt new technology.   Government is supporting 
<br/>the  Farm  Mechanisation  Programme</span><span> </span><span>with  funding  of  $500,000</span><span> </span><span>and  the  Commercial  Agriculture 
<br/>Development Programme (CADP) through procurement of small farming equipment, irrigation kits, 
<br/>and other agricultural machinery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Many large scale livestock farmers essentially have been on their SELF.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>SELF which is a new initiative called Successful Entrepreneurs in Livestock Farming is about those 
<br/>who are already big but have hardly received any or no assistance at all but we want to assist them 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>801  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to grow now even bigger and get more cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. With some assistance, they will 
<br/>be able to increase the number of animals under their production and care and build larger livestock 
<br/>businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have farmers up in Keiyasi, across the river on the Kavanagasau side, they can only access 
<br/>through the West Bank but there are farmers there with 300 herd of cattle, 200 goats, 100 sheep with 
<br/>no assistance but they have done it on their own.  These are the people we must actually carry forward 
<br/>because they will increase the food capacity of this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by providing some assistance to them we will be able to increase the number 
<br/>of animals under the production and care and build larger livestock businesses.  This will expand the 
<br/>market for meats, eggs and other animal products, introduce more competition in the market, and 
<br/>lead to higher quality and lower prices in the long term.  By helping the “big boys” and “big girls”, 
<br/>now we can empower them to become even bigger producers - $350,000 will be allocated to get this 
<br/>Programme off the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far, despite huge price increases for fertiliser and almost all food, the 
<br/>price  of  sugar  has  remained  remarkably  and  stubbornly  stagnant,  globally  speaking.    We  have 
<br/></span><span>committed to pay growers $85 per tonne, and we will honour that commitment, Sir.  We understand 
<br/></span><span>that many cane growers want to plant different crops that have greater upside potential, especially 
<br/>small-scale growers.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many people would not tell you this,  43 per cent of 
<br/>sugarcane growers cut less than 100 tonnes per year but these growers are rightly concerned that if 
<br/>they plant other crops, they will lose their leases.  They are simply holding on to their sugarcane 
<br/>leases because if they do not grow sugarcane, they will lose their leases, lose their homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, should not allow this to happen.  We have people who are 
<br/>unproductive farmers who are still continuing with the sugarcane industry simply because they will 
<br/>become landless or they will become squatters if they no longer have their sugarcane lease.  We, as 
<br/>a  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Prime  Minister  as  the  Chairman  of  iTLTB  do  not  want  this  to 
<br/>happen.  So, Government is allocating $500,000 to support cane farmers who seek to convert their 
<br/>sugarcane leases to agriculture leases to plant other crops or even just have a residential area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The average age of a cane farmer is 59 years old. There are some older farmers who also 
<br/>want to give up farming and retire or move away from sugarcane farming into other more lucrative 
<br/>crops.  They also will have the option to use a portion of their land and apply for a residential lease.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will facilitate and work with the landowners through iTLTB and the farmers to 
<br/></span><span>help  them obtain new leases and other assistance to  have lucrative livelihoods and have peace of 
<br/></span><span>mind through residential leases.  They will no longer be hostage to a system that keeps them chained 
<br/>to the cane industry even though they do not want to be part of the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, still on sugar, the global spike in prices is not affecting food and fuel.  It is 
<br/>also affecting the price of fertiliser which is a global commodity with a price that can be influenced 
<br/>by  multiple  market  factors  beyond  the  control  of  producers.    Some  44  per  cent  of  all  fertiliser 
<br/>materials  are exported,  which makes it highly sensitive to  events  and  conditions  anywhere in  the 
<br/>world as well as transportation costs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 15th October, 2021, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Chinese Government imposed restrictions on 
<br/>the  export  of  nitrogen  and  phosphorus-based  fertiliser  until  June  2022.    The  ban  on  phosphorus 
<br/>fertilisers has caused chaos on the international market, since China is the world’s largest exporter 
<br/>of  DAP  fertiliser,  the  world's  most  widely  used  phosphorus  fertilizer.    International  sanctions  on 
<br/>Belarus propelled spot prices of GMOP fertiliser, or muriate of potash, to almost double.  And, of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, shipping rates have risen exponentially. Pre-COVID fertiliser was about 
<br/>$45 per bag, now it is more than $80 per bag.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It would crush our cane farmers to bear this burden without their Government’s support.  So 
<br/>we are stepping in to cover that entire price increase.  That means, despite all this volatility, farmers 
<br/>will still pay $20 per bag of fertiliser and the Government will pay the remaining $60 through an 
<br/>additional  $9.7  million  provided  to  the  Ministry  of  Sugar  Industry  under  the  Fertiliser  Subsidy 
<br/>Programme to support the procurement of fertiliser by South Pacific Fertiliser Limited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  has  long  been  this  Government’s 
<br/>philosophy to create an environment that allows people and communities to use their land in ways 
<br/>that best benefit them.  Land is an asset that should be cherished and used wisely.  Where possible 
<br/>that asset should become a cash-generating vehicle for our communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure that international  benchmarks are  respected  and best  practices  followed in  land 
<br/>valuations, both the Ministry of Lands and the iTLTB shall outsource valuations to ensure that the 
<br/></span><span>landowners and the lessees get the true market value of the land.  This will result in efficient and 
<br/></span><span>impartial valuations by sector experts and ensure that landowners get the appropriate valuations on 
<br/>their land.  So many times we have seen that so much of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land has been leased out without 
<br/>proper valuation.  We have seen the discrepancy with the iTaukei land with developing Yadua.  We 
<br/>valued it – two-acre lots at $750,000.  Just 20 metres away, five acres of land has been leased out, 
<br/>99-year lease at $350,000.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, so getting independent valuers will help the landowners 
<br/>and also help the lessees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lengthy delays that people have experienced in the survey process before 
<br/>leases  can  be  finalised  is  unacceptable  and  the  economy  has  suffered  needlessly  for  these 
<br/>inefficiencies.  We have set up a working group with the iTLTB, the Ministry of Lands, Department 
<br/>of Town and Country Planning and the Ministry of Economy to address the backlog of surveys and 
<br/>streamline processes moving forward.  A Memorandum of Understanding among these entities was 
<br/>signed today to establish a common purpose and commit the four agencies to cooperate fully and 
<br/>share information.  These key agencies will be connected to the iTLTB’s Land Development Vetting 
<br/>(LDVC)  portal,  allowing  surveyors  and  the  development  authorities  to  connect  through  a  digital 
<br/>platform to check the status of each survey.  We will be allocating $50,000 for the  Facilitation of 
<br/>Resolutions  to  Lease  Complaints by the  Working  Group.  They  will send teams  to  go out  on the 
<br/></span><span>ground to attend to your complaints on lease matters and ensure we solve lease issues efficiently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an additional $100,000 is being provided to the Plan Assessment Unit of 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands and the Department of Town and Country Planning respectively to provide 
<br/>additional staff solely focused on assisting the working group to clear the backlog of surveys and 
<br/>address all complaints.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, iTLTB has recognised that some of its subdivisions were not carried out 
<br/>professionally in the past.  In a number of cases, lots sold became landlocked since they had no access 
<br/>to roads in the subdivision.  There are tenants with agreements who have been languishing for years 
<br/>as a  result.   To ensure landowners  get  proper lease returns  and  get the full value and tenants  get 
<br/>proper lease documents and tenants get proper leases, we will be providing an allocation of $1 million 
<br/>to iTLTB for the development of access roads and to connect more than 200 tenants to public roads.  
<br/>This will possibly affect subdivisions such as Batiki and Wailase in Naitasiri, Vunivetau and Nailago 
<br/>in  Dravo,  Navitilevu  in  Korovou,  Natokia  and  Vatia  in  the  North  and  in  places  like  Sabeto,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and many others.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>803  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  is  a  sign  of  things  to  come.  Sir,  iTLTB  will  now  be  moving  into  pre-packaging 
<br/>comprehensively-schemed subdivision lots.  This will again increase the value of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land.  
<br/>The  development  of  comprehensively-schemed  divisions  and  access  roads  will  fully  involve 
<br/>outsourcing  of  services  by  iTLTB  for  civil  work  contractors,  engineers,  surveying,  valuation  and 
<br/>planning for selected subdivisions and working closely with the Town and Country Planning Office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a further $1 million</span><span> </span><span>is being provided to people with disabilities and low 
<br/>income families facing financial hardships to pay for residential and agricultural arrears.  This will 
<br/>allow those in need to clear arrears and be in a better position with iTLTB and the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>where lease renewals are considered.  Sir, iTLTB will also provide those individuals facing financial 
<br/>difficulties the option of a payment plan for lease renewals and lease offers.  To further assist those 
<br/>in the agriculture sector, in this budget we are allocating $500,000 to fund the cost of surveying of 
<br/>agricultural leases.  We have not forgotten those facing financial difficulties with residential leases 
<br/>also and will also provide $500,000 for the surveying of residential leases.  This was all through the 
<br/>joint cooperation of iTLTB and the Ministry of Lands to ensure that we unlock land, provide more 
<br/>returns to landowners and expedite much needed economic recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have spoken of some of the reforms we need in rural land leasing and 
<br/></span><span>development, but people in towns and urban centres often have the same ambitions, anxieties and 
<br/></span><span>frustrations over land use and development as rural dwellers and those in the cities too have faced 
<br/>the same anxieties as the rural dwellers.  Our regulations have long placed unnecessary obstacles in 
<br/>the  way  of  people  who  wish  to  develop  urban  property  or  lease  rural  land.  Whether  you  are  an 
<br/>entrepreneur who wants to build apartments in Nadi or a subdivision in Lautoka, or an aging cane 
<br/>farmer  who  wants  to  retire  on  his  leased  land,  you  will  encounter  the  same  headwinds.  We  are 
<br/>removing those headwinds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  as  our  recovery  progresses,  it  is  vital  that  we  create  opportunities  for 
<br/>development by quite simply making it easier to invest, build and construct in Fiji. We also have to 
<br/>recognise important ways that the pandemic has changed our society and changed the regulations to 
<br/>give steam to some of the positives of the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Town Planning Act which was enacted in 1946 has procedures and processes in place 
<br/>that  were  relevant  in  that  period.    But  some  of  these  decades-old  processes  have  unsurprisingly 
<br/>become redundant and outdated.  These archaic provisions in the Act have delayed, and many times 
<br/>stopped development  projects  from  progressing.  This  is  particularly true of the provisions in  the 
<br/>Town Planning Act dealing with changes to the town planning scheme, or the rezoning of individual 
<br/></span><span>lots or areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amendments proposed will reduce the bureaucracy around the notification and objection 
<br/>period. By reviewing the notification requirements, we are reaching out to more Fijians to have a say 
<br/>on the proposed rezoning.  Since we are using a wider mode of transmitting the notification to the 
<br/>public–that  is,  websites,  widely  used  publications,  and  all  forms  of  media,  the  notification  and 
<br/>objection period has been reduced to 14 days with the ability to lodge an appeal to the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary on the decision of the Director of Town &amp; Country Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our towns and  cities have evolved significantly over time, however, the 
<br/>Town Planning Schemes governing the planning and development of our towns and cities have not 
<br/>changed a bit in nearly two decades.   For example, the Toorak area was mostly residential in the late 
<br/>1970s, but today most properties are zoned as Commercial.  It only makes sense that the remaining 
<br/>properties follow the natural extension and be rezoned as Commercial. This will reduce the need for 
<br/>property owners to apply for amendments on an ad hoc or case by case basis and be subjected to an 
<br/>unnecessary and cumbersome process each and every time.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having block rezoning will cut out the unnecessary bureaucracies and enable the proponents 
<br/>to  immediately commence  with  the lodgement  of their building plans and get  their developments 
<br/>going on the ground.  We have consulted closely with the Director Town and Country Planning, the 
<br/>municipal  councils  and  relevant  stakeholders  and  identified  areas  to  be  blocked-rezoned  to 
<br/>Commercial in several locations, including Suva, Nasinu, Lautoka, Ba, Sigatoka, Nadi, Savusavu, 
<br/>Nausori, Rakiraki and Tavua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By way of amendment to the Town Planning Act, the Permanent Secretary responsible for 
<br/>town planning will immediately approve block rezoning of those areas.  This blanket Commercial 
<br/>zoning will be applied over the properties that fall within designated areas. However, we will not 
<br/>disadvantage any residence within the area. If any affected property owner wants their property to 
<br/>remain zoned Residential  or has  a residential  dwelling on site, he or she will continue to pay the 
<br/>Residential Town/City rate until such time the property is converted for Commercial development.  
<br/>This is a win-win situation for property owners.  First, the property owner will fetch higher rental 
<br/>because the property value will increase.  And if they wish to engage in commercial activities, they 
<br/>will not have to go through the process of rezoning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  announced  a  new  incentive  package  to  encourage  investments  in 
<br/></span><span>subdivision projects for both residential and commercial lots in the 2020/2021 National Budget.  Any 
<br/></span><span>profits derived from the sale of these new lots are tax exempt along with customs duty waivers for 
<br/>construction inputs.  This incentive was due to expire on 31st July, 2022. This will now be extended 
<br/>for another 24 months until 31st July, 2024.  Subdivision of land is a lengthy process, and a large 
<br/>number of investments were delayed due to COVID, so it makes sense to continue this assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the beginning of the pandemic, a number of Fijians who lost their jobs 
<br/>took their skills home and began operating home-based businesses, some in catering services, some 
<br/>in  bakeries,  some  as  hairdressers  or  as  consultants  in  the  area  of  expertise  and  some  of  these 
<br/>entrepreneurially-minded  Fijians  are  not  looking  back.    They  do  face  challenges,  such  as  being 
<br/>required to rezone to commercial before operating the business. This requirement is so onerous that 
<br/>it has pushed some micro, small and medium entrepreneurs out of business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through amendments to the Town Planning Act General Provisions for Schemes and Areas, 
<br/>we will allow home-based businesses to operate from residential areas without going through the 
<br/>rezoning  process,  provided  they  meet  set  conditions  of  operations  that  are  in  keeping  with  the 
<br/>residential nature of the area.  These would include restrictions on noise and equipment, signage, 
<br/>traffic,  hours  of  operation  and  storage  of  hazardous  materials.  We  can  allow  these  businesses  to 
<br/></span><span>operate in a neighbourhood so long as they do not make that neighbourhood less quiet, peaceful, and 
<br/></span><span>liveable. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as per the 2021-2022 Budget announcement, the Town Planning General 
<br/>Provisions 1999 were to be amended to remove the stringent planning requirements for zoning and 
<br/>building-permit applications.  These 23-year-old requirements are badly out of date with our modern 
<br/>development needs. For example, single dwellings were once constructed in a 1,000 square metre 
<br/>property. Now, space is at more of a premium and the developers prefer to maximise the use of the 
<br/>site by building higher.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  process  has  been  conducted  and  amendments  to  the  Town  Planning  General 
<br/>Provisions 1999 will include simplified zones to reflect modern classifications, as currently used in 
<br/>places like Australia and New Zealand, reduction of setback requirements for multi-storey buildings, 
<br/>and increased density for unsewered residential lots. This will reduce the ad hoc requests that need 
<br/>to be put to the Director Town and Country Planning’s office for approval.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>805  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  order  to  counter  inflationary  pressures  and  support  our  vision  of 
<br/>empowering Fijians with their first property, we will be regulating the commission charged by real 
<br/>estate  agents  on  residential  properties.  This  will  also  ensure  that  transactions  occur  in  a  fair  and 
<br/>transparent manner and that we weed out unscrupulous agents. There have been serious  issues of 
<br/>price gouging in the real estate market and instances of collusion that are driving up the prices of 
<br/>homes everyday that Fijians are looking to buy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have seen commission rates as high as 8 per cent. And today as we know, a real estate 
<br/>agent can simply take a photograph of your house on their phone, put it on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> and the cost of 
<br/>them advertising is practically zero and then they come and claim 8 per cent from the person for 
<br/>whom they sold the house or 5 per cent or 3 per cent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is actually pushing up the price of real estate in Fiji and the ordinary Fijians are actually 
<br/>being priced out of this. There is general consensus amongst stakeholders such as Real Estate Agents 
<br/>and Licensing Board, property developers, architects and engineers to regulate the commission rates. 
<br/>Below a certain price threshold, which will be finalised in the regulations, we will be limiting the 
<br/>commission charged by real estate agents on what we call “low income residential properties” to no 
<br/>more than 3 per cent of the sale value. We are looking at this moment properties that are $1.5 million 
<br/></span><span>or less.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs to invest in more skilled and educated people, and we will need 
<br/>more and more of them in the economy of the future. This has to be a priority to provide opportunities 
<br/>for our young people to gain skills and education they can put to work here in Fiji. We already face 
<br/>a shortage in the trades, particularly the building trades. Fiji needs programmes and incentives for 
<br/>our people to gain both the skills and the education they will need to fill important roles across the 
<br/>economy and there is no better moment than our recovery to make those investments in our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that commitment begins with young people in Fiji. The past several years 
<br/>have heaped anxiety on young Fijians. During the pandemic, our primary and secondary students lost 
<br/>months  of in-person learning. New job-seekers entered the worst  market  for jobs  ever and recent 
<br/>hires were often the first crop to be made redundant or sent home. Meanwhile, the climate emergency 
<br/>can make their future  feel  untenable,  with  every cyclone serving as  a traumatic reminder of how 
<br/>serious this crisis has become. To the young people of Fiji, we understand how difficult all of this is 
<br/>for you.  We have heard from you, many of you first-hand and the bulk of the initiatives in this mini-
<br/>budget are designed for your benefit, because you deserve a secure future where your hard work can 
<br/>guarantee a rewarding life, and we know you have the ability to make that possible for yourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We invested in your education for years by paying school fees, subsidizing transportation to 
<br/>school  and  paying  for  your  textbooks.  We  have  invested  in  your  access  to  digital  tools  and 
<br/>technology.  We  have  promised  you  that  your  future  would  be  determined  by  your  skills  and 
<br/>qualifications and not by your last name or family pedigree. Now your generation which is the most 
<br/>skilled,  the  most  unified,  and  the  most  hopeful  in  history  is  entering  higher  education  and  the 
<br/>workforce. As you do, the commitment from your government could not be stronger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, to all those in universities, all those preparing for universities and colleges, you will be 
<br/>supported  to  realize  your  dreams.  Every  ambitious  and  talented  young  person  should  be  able  to 
<br/>complete  education  through  either  loans  or  scholarships.  That  is  rock  solid  commitment.  This 
<br/>commitment  is  about  you.  But  more  so  it  is  about  our  country.  Our  recovery,  our  enterprise  and 
<br/>industry and our economy cannot be sustained, if we do not invest in you, especially young people, 
<br/>across all the skills and capabilities that are needed for a modern economy. Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 
<br/>2021-2022 Budget, a new quota system was introduced for TELS, and the entry mark increased from 
<br/>250 to 280 and to 300 for Year 13 in areas where there was an oversupply of graduates.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This new quota system in TELS was introduced to balance funding between the areas of high 
<br/>priority and skills shortage and manage the areas of possible oversupply. The situation significantly 
<br/>changed after the announcement of the 2021-2022 Budget. The second wave of COVID-19 had a 
<br/>significant impact on the education of students, and we completely understand how that has affected 
<br/>their performance in the recent examinations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has considered a one-off temporary measure to reduce the TELS entry mark 
<br/>to 250, except for the Commerce category where the cut-off mark will remain at 280 with a quota of 
<br/>850 due to oversupply of graduates. In other words now, for TELS, if you get 250 you will be eligible 
<br/>for TELS.  Programmes in the Commerce category will still require an entry mark of 300.  The quota 
<br/>for TELS for degree programmes will now be increased from 2,000 to 2,942 with increased attention 
<br/>to areas such as Medicine and Health, Engineering, Science and Technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Accelerated Repayment Incentives (ARI) for TELS students was introduced in the 2018-
<br/>2019  Budget  to  offer  TELS  students  heavy  discounts  for  the  early  repayment  of  loans.  For  this 
<br/>initiative, the determination of the repayment period for discount eligibility will exclude 2020, 2021 
<br/>and 2022 because a lot of them lost their jobs, some went on part-time work, so again obviously, we 
<br/>cannot expect them to continue with the repayments.  So 2020, 2021 and 2022 will not be counted 
<br/></span><span>as the three years.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also recognize the contribution made by the nurses in our health sector. 
<br/>The quota for nursing was set for 100 students for 2022 new intake, but this may not be sufficient 
<br/>given the fact that many nurses are resigning, either leaving the profession or relocating. To fill the 
<br/>gaps created by resignations and migration of nurses, the TELS quota for Bachelor of Nursing will 
<br/>be increased to 350. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  as  part of the 2020-2021 Budget  announcement,  funding  for the MBBS 
<br/>programme was suspended under NTS and TELS. This decision was based on the fact that Fiji had 
<br/>met its stated goal for the doctor-to-patent ratio and that we had graduated more doctors than there 
<br/>were vacancies in Fijian medical facilities, in particular in the public health system.  Times, of course, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  have  changed  since  then.  Our  experience  with  COVID-19  brought  on  the 
<br/>engagement of General Practitioners to improve access to medical services, as we mentioned earlier. 
<br/>This creates more employment opportunities for graduate doctors in both public and private hospitals 
<br/>and private clinics.  Furthermore, private sector investment is burgeoning in the medical sector, which 
<br/>will create space for Year 6 clinical attachments and employment opportunities. We are also going 
<br/>to put more doctors in rural public medical facilities given this shift and we will be making  some 
<br/></span><span>policy announcements in that.  Generally, now we have nurses, we will be putting in doctors in some 
<br/></span><span>of those areas.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given this shift, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will also provide 20 MBBS and 5 Bachelor 
<br/>of Dental Surgery awards to new students who have completed Year 13 with a mark of 340 in 2021 
<br/>through National Toppers Scheme. Those students who are registered on the TSLS Online Portal for 
<br/>2022  intake  can  apply  or  change  their  programmes  to  qualify.    To  accommodate  private  MBBS 
<br/>students of 2021, the NTS scheme will change to include those who did Year 13 in 2020, had marks 
<br/>of  340  and  above,  a  GPA  of  3.0  and  above  in  2021,  and  combined  parental  income  of  less  than 
<br/>$100,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  2021-2022  National  Budget,  the  Government  allocated  funds  for 
<br/>MBBS students who had privately enrolled and met the criteria for a one-off $10,000 Government 
<br/>Grant. In February this year, 42 students were selected and can use the grant to clear off the fees for 
<br/>2021.  Government  will  now  provide  full-time  scholarships  under  the  National  Toppers  Scheme 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>807  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>effective  from  Semester  1,  2022.  This  will  amend  existing  scholarship  regulation  to  include  the 
<br/>students who did Year 13 in 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, young people in Fiji understand why climate change is such an important 
<br/>issue. They see through the denial of the past generations who have caused this crisis and they are 
<br/>vital to Fiji’s leadership on the world stage. But we know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, young Fijians do not just 
<br/>recognise  the  problems,  they  want  to  know  what  they  can  do  about  it.  They  want  to  become  the 
<br/>experts, they want to be the leaders and it is our duty to give them that chance by becoming a hub for 
<br/>the world’s climate policy research, especially on climate adaptation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia’s Monash University is keen to establish a joint “Monash-Fiji National University 
<br/>Pacific Climate Change Research Centre” that offers high quality research opportunities that produce 
<br/>world-leading climate change mitigation and adaptation issues and high quality training and capacity 
<br/>building for policy makers in the Pacific.  This collaboration will benefit Fiji through engaging with 
<br/>one of the leading global universities. The collaboration will give its students and researchers’ direct 
<br/>access to major funding partners like DFAT, JICA, AusAID, NZAid, EU, ADB and others. It will 
<br/>produce Pacific experts who help the world meet this challenge because it should be Pacific people 
<br/>who lead on an issue that impacts us more severely than anyone in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Research  Centre  will  be  funded  initially  through  the  seed  funding  from  Monash 
<br/>University to fund and host the Centre Director. Other fundings will be secured from donors such as 
<br/>DFAT, AusAID, NZAid, JICA and the Fijian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once our young people complete their education, they should find a market 
<br/>for jobs that is brimming with opportunity, not only for careers but for companies they may wish to 
<br/>start. And not only in traditional sectors, but in the world class and highly sustainable green and blue 
<br/>Fijian economy that we are building. We urge here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the young people, we may 
<br/>say  “pursue  opportunities  that  our  country  will  need  for  that.”  This  may  include  anything  from 
<br/>sustainable forestry, to marine conservation, to green shipping, and oceanography to sustainability.  
<br/>All industries will need these skills. Society will need these skills and indeed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>world will need these skills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Environment launched the Jobs for Nature Rehabilitation Programme (J-NR)  
<br/>in June of last year focusing on protection, restoration and rehabilitation of the natural environment; 
<br/>76  projects  from  Ba,  Tuva,  Rewa,  Labasa  and  Tunuloa  catchments  have  been  awarded  the  J-NR 
<br/>grants  through  the  Fiji  Ridge  to  Reef  Programme  which  is  being  managed  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Environment.  The  projects  have  received  their  first  disbursement  of  60  per  cent  of  the  $45,600 
<br/></span><span>allocation. The remaining 40 per cent or $30,400, will be disbursed after monitoring and evaluation 
<br/>is completed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  is  investing  $83  million  over  time  in  the  world  class  Fiji  Airways 
<br/>Aviation Academy. The Academy reduces the high cost of training that was incurred by Fiji Airways 
<br/>and  allows  us  to  train  more  local  pilots,  thus  reducing  the  need  for  foreign  pilots  and  producing 
<br/>savings of around US$10 million a year.  We trained pilots from other airlines during the pandemic, 
<br/>and the demand by other airlines to use our facility is growing.  Every day the Academy is helping 
<br/>put Fijians in the cockpit including women. These are great jobs that often were going to expatraites 
<br/>when they should all be held our people and the Aviation Academy is making that happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Academy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also kept our pilots ready to fly through the pandemic. There 
<br/>is no question we would not have been ready to re-open the border on 1st December without it. The 
<br/>Academy is also used for cabin crew training, some of which was previously done in Australia and 
<br/>Singapore. This produces about savings of around $10.3 million annually.

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  want  to  apply  that  same  academy-based  educational  model  to  other 
<br/>sectors including in shipping. This is a booming sector for Fiji’s budding blue economy and one that 
<br/>will increasingly help to drive our net-zero commitment. Construction to modernise the facility and 
<br/>provide  a  better  learning  environment  are  partially  completed,  which  allowed  the  Fiji  Maritime 
<br/>Academy to open its doors for the 2022 academic year. As of 21st March, 2022, the Academy had 
<br/>opened its doors to start the new academic year, with a number of short courses and from July to 
<br/>August this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Bachelor in Nautical Training in the Marine Academy will be 
<br/>available.  This is, Mr, Speaker, Sir, has got IMO certification.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Maritime Academy is now becoming a regional academy. Now, we have 
<br/>got students coming from Papua New Guinea and various other Pacific Island countries. We wish to 
<br/>put on record the training and the partnership with CINEC that allows us to get the IMO certification 
<br/>which also helped Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji (MSAF).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2021-2022  Budget,  Government  announced  a  20-year  tax  holiday  incentive  for  Business 
<br/>Process Outsourcing (BPO). Government continues to assist the BPO sector, and will set aside 300 
<br/>awards for BPO Training under TELS for TVET at FNU which has an existing allocation of 5,000 
<br/>awards.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as noted in Parliament previously, this is the only sector in Fiji during the 
<br/></span><span>COVID period in the last two years that grew 3,000 jobs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  means-testing  criteria  was  introduced  in  the  2021-2022  Budget  and 
<br/>combined  parental  income  exceeding  $100,000  is  tested  against  the  number  of  dependents  and 
<br/>extenuating  circumstances.  Business  owners  will  be  required  to  submit  the  latest  tax  assessment 
<br/>showing  business  profit  and  business  net  worth.  The  new  means-testing  criteria  will  require 
<br/>applicants to have a combined family income of less than $100,000 or business net worth of less than 
<br/>$100,000 unless extenuating factors apply. This will be effective from 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,</span><span> </span><span>Government will provide funding for development of Fiji’s 10 Year Human 
<br/>Capital Development Plan. The Plan will provide prudent guidance for planning and investment in 
<br/>tertiary education. The TSLS will host the Secretariat and lead the coordination, and will be funded 
<br/>$80,000 for this project for the remainder of the financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to date the Fijian Government has assisted a total of 100 Fijians under the 
<br/>Reskilling  and  Retraining  Programme  announced  last  year,  with  another  500  students  currently 
<br/>undertaking courses and more expected to apply in the near future. Given the success in the Reskilling 
<br/>and Retraining Programme, offered through FNU, the Government has included an additional seven 
<br/></span><span>short courses that are in highly sought areas, including Caregiving, the Fundamentals of Baking and 
<br/></span><span>Patisserie,  Cooking,  Food  and  Beverage,  Screen  Printing  Artwork  and  Designs,  Household  and 
<br/>Sanitary Plumbing and Domestic Electrical Installation.  A budget of $1 million has been allocated 
<br/>for this programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  recovery  is  an  opportunity  to  accelerate  towards  net-zero  emissions 
<br/>within the legal framework of our Climate Change Act.  The activities and requirements we must 
<br/>now advance under the Act all support mutually beneficial outcomes for communities, the private 
<br/>sector and public services.  On the whole, the Climate Change Act will create cost-savings for our 
<br/>economy, as it is designed to help us best prepare for and avoid climate risks and impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have proposed an electric shuttle bus project that not only makes good 
<br/>economic sense for an urbanising country, but which aligns well with Fiji's global climate leadership.  
<br/>We need clean and efficient urban mass transportation, and we are pleased to report that the project 
<br/>is progressing well.  The technical analysis on the electric-shuttle-bus ecosystem has been completed, 
<br/>and that will be trialled with the construction of a suburban Shuttle Terminal in Valelevu later this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<div><span> Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>809  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year.  The electric shuttle bus will facilitate transit between commercial centres.  Shuttle buses with 
<br/>22 seats will run every five to ten minutes along 23 new routes.  We have identified the first routes 
<br/>to be tendered and electrified for the pilot.  The charging infrastructure to service these routes will 
<br/>initially be housed at the Valelevu Shuttle Station.  This means cleaner transportation that decreases 
<br/>pollution,  noise  and  increases  comfort  for  its  riders.    Further  shuttle  terminals  will  be  coming  to 
<br/>Nakasi and the Tavakubu area in Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, Government takes seriously the need to manage our solid waste and end 
<br/>littering and the proliferation of plastic waste and other debris into our waterways and oceans.  To 
<br/>develop a strategy, we will allocate $45,000 for a consultancy for the development of Fiji's Container 
<br/>Deposit Regulations (CDR).  The intention of the proposed regulation is to minimise environmental 
<br/>pollution by establishing a container deposit scheme that will incentivise recycling behaviour in Fiji.  
<br/>A  consultant  has  been  identified  to  develop  the  CDR  and  will  conduct  a  review  to  identify 
<br/>implementation  issues  from  Pacific  and  other  countries  that  have  adopted  container  deposit 
<br/>regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  court  hearings  were  limited  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  for  safety 
<br/>reasons, which caused new cases to accumulate and remain unresolved.  Now that we are in a post-
<br/></span><span>pandemic era, the Judiciary has positioned additional judges and magistrates around the country to 
<br/></span><span>hear the pending cases.  We recognise that justice delayed is justice denied, so $600,000 is provided 
<br/>to supplement the Judiciary’s operations.  The Government also continues to strengthen the services 
<br/>of Fiji’s judicial sector through the construction of the new Nasinu and Ba Magistrates Courts, for 
<br/>which an additional $2 million is allocated.  The new courts will address the backlog of cases, lack 
<br/>of space for breast-feeding mothers attending family court and congested staffing spaces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a person only needs to be lawfully present in Fiji for 10 out of 
<br/>the 15 years prior to lodging an application for naturalisation.  We will be increasing the requisite 
<br/>aggregate period to 15 out of the 20 years to protect and enhance the value of the Fijian citizenship.  
<br/>While citizenship is becoming more difficult to obtain, we are adopting a more liberal approach for 
<br/>those looking to obtain work permits and investors seeking to establish permanent residency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, taxis play an important role in providing accessibility to 
<br/>many  Fijians,  because  they  give  us  flexibility,  and  yet  the  system  we  now  use  limits  the  very 
<br/>flexibility that people require from a taxi service.  Fiji will now do away with the Base and Stand 
<br/>system and adopt the Open Taxi Ranking System (OTRS).  For the taxi industry, this is the most 
<br/>important change in 33 years.  Fiji has over a total of 4,222 valid taxi permit holders who will now 
<br/></span><span>operate from one of the 453 open taxi ranks - 264 existing ranks and 135 new ones.  Mr. Speaker Sir, 
<br/></span><span>the  OTR  System  is  designed  to  ensure  that  service  is  efficient  and  reliable  while  giving  the  taxi 
<br/>operator  more  opportunity.    The  OTR  System  allows  taxis  to  operate  from  any  rank  within  their 
<br/>designated areas of operation on a first-in, first-out basis on a rotational basis.  So, all taxi operators 
<br/>can pick up passengers in a fair and orderly manner and avoid illegal operations, particularly, private 
<br/>vehicles operating as public service vehicles.  The framework also allows taxi drivers to operate as 
<br/>and when they wish to.  The system will be effective from 25th April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we should  note that this policy  does not  apply to  the  private taxi  bases, 
<br/>which  are  a  commercial  arrangement  between  the  taxi  operators  and  the  base  owners.    But  taxis 
<br/>operating from the private taxi bases will not be allowed to pick up passengers outside of their private 
<br/>base of operation or from any of the 453 open taxi ranks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The introduction of the open taxi rank system has meant the removal of paid Bases and Stands 
<br/>in Fiji. You do not have to pay the base stand fees. The fees formerly associated with bases and stands

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be replaced with an annual PSV levy to be paid at the time of annual vehicle registration at the 
<br/>LTA. Sir, LTA will soon announce the amount of levy and as to when it will commence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previously,  driving  instructor  licences  were  issued  for  five  years  per  subject  to  annual 
<br/>renewal. Driving schools permits were issued for three years but subject to yearly renewals. We will 
<br/>be removing the requirement for annual renewal. These changes will remove the unnecessary burden 
<br/>of  yearly  renewals  in  terms  of  licensing  requirements  for  existing  Driving  School  and  Driving 
<br/>Instructors Permit (DIP) holders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The idea is to promote self-development among Driving School and DIP holders and reduce 
<br/>bureaucracy.  The  LTA  recognizes  the  important  role  Driving  Schools  and  DIP  holders  play  in 
<br/>moulding  the  skills  and  mindsets  of  future  drivers.  Through  this  amendment,  Government  is 
<br/>expressing its trust in the responsibility and trustworthiness of driving schools and licensed driving 
<br/>instructors to give sound instruction and comply with regulations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government will continue to pay for the police clearance report fees for 
<br/>those who need it as a job requirement or for obtaining a PSV Driving licence, that is for taxi drivers, 
<br/>bus drivers, mini bus drivers and carrier drivers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given that police clearance is also an essential LTA requirement for both PSV drivers, for 
<br/>example, employment opportunities from 14</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022, police clearance will be obtained from all 
<br/>LTA  offices.  It  will  be  a  "one  stop  shop"  and  the  Fiji  Police  Force  will  have  a  Memorandum  of 
<br/>Understanding  (MOU)  with  LTA  to  implement  this  initiative.  At  the  moment  if  you  were,  for 
<br/>example, in Tavua to get your police clearance you have to come to Suva, Lautoka or Nadi. Now you 
<br/>will simply be able to go the application at the LTA office and then you will get the Police Clearance 
<br/>from there once the police actually gives you.  So, it stops all the funding that is required for you to 
<br/>get your clearance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to keep local trading activities and businesses afloat, an allocation 
<br/>of $500,000 has been set aside for Trade Enhancement. This programme is essentially</span><span> </span><span>a lifeline of 
<br/>$500 will be provided to successful applicants who are recovering from the impact of COVID-19 
<br/>and aim to kick start their businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For instance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we met a lady in her 50s in Nadi who was a spa worker at one 
<br/>of the resorts. During the pandemic she was laid off so she took the spa home and started her own 
<br/>business from Nadi.  Her reputation earned her customers all the way in Suva particularly among 
<br/></span><span>expatriates. So she would hire a vehicle, grab her spa table and take it to Suva, a costly process. The 
<br/></span><span>costs were eating up her profits and leaving her with nothing to support her family.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So she asked the Government to help her buy a second hand table that could be kept in Suva. 
<br/>That allows her to hire a smaller vehicle and keep more money in her pocket. That is the sort of 
<br/>initiative we would like to see and are happy to support.  There are many tradespeople who want 
<br/>some start-up tools. They do not necessary will go and get a loan but just with a few things they will 
<br/>be able to start up their own business and we have seen that evolution take place in the workplace 
<br/>environment.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  start-up  cash  programme  will  be  administered  through  the 
<br/>Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport, and more details around this programme will 
<br/>be announced soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we overcame the pandemic together through the everyday heroism of civil 
<br/>servants,  members  of  the  private  sector  and  our  development  partners  who  stepped  up  when  Fiji 
<br/>needed them most. We particularly want  to  thank the governments  and people of Australia,  New 
<br/>Zealand, India and the United States for their support in particular the vaccines support.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have allocated $250,000 towards a civil service recognition programme whereby these 
<br/>development  partners,  private  sector  partners  and  civil  servants  who  served  the  nation  during 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic will be recognised for their outstanding courage, compassion and commitment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir we are also going to further engrain that spirit of service and patriotism in 
<br/>the culture of the civil service. We have already placed merit at the centre of the civil service at every 
<br/>level, and our civil service has responded. Some, of course, have responded far better than others and 
<br/>we  need  to  be  able  to  ensure  that  we  marshal  these  resources  and  ensure  efficient  Government 
<br/>services.  The highest performers are setting an example and creating a culture of pride and higher 
<br/>standards. The next step is to put measures in place to build on the better services we offer the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Customer Service Guideline for the whole of civil service has been drafted that consolidates 
<br/>all aspects of processes and activities to provide services to the Fijian public. This Guideline will 
<br/>reinforce  the  policies  and  procedures  already  in  place  by  providing  standard  tools  that  our  civil 
<br/>servants will use to ensure that our citizens receive timely, reliable, effective and impartial services.  
<br/>The Guideline sets standards of performance, with emphasis on face-to-face and virtual modes of 
<br/>engagement  and  provides  guidance  on  managing  complaints,  feedback,  surveys,  form  design, 
<br/>customer relationships and risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijians who use Government services should expect to be treated with respect as a baseline. 
<br/>Our civil servants need to be courteous and need to be empathetic.  Our civil servants should feel that 
<br/>questions  are  taken  seriously  and  answered  honestly  and  promptly.  When  they  need  to  provide 
<br/>information to the Government, it should be easy to do through forms that are appropriately designed.  
<br/>Our service areas must create a welcoming environment and place customers at the centre of service 
<br/>delivery.  We want to encourage feedback, including complaints, because that will help us improve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our citizens need to be addressed as Mr., Ms., Madam or Sir.  These guideline is user-friendly 
<br/>and provides detailed steps that can be easily incorporated into each Ministry’s work processes and 
<br/>adapted by the frontline civil servants on duty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government Mr. Speaker, Sir, is conducting a thorough civil service salary review to 
<br/>determine appropriate competitive remuneration, that is, salary and benefits for positions we know 
<br/>that require scarce skills and personnel that we need to retain. We have seen this continuously, highly 
<br/>sought-after civil servants get posts by multinational agencies and other regional agencies.  There 
<br/>will be a review of the civil service salaries for retention and scarce skills.  An allocation of $50,000 
<br/>has been provided for this exercise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  position,  for  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  Principal  Veterinary  Officer  is  a  good 
<br/>example.  The 2017 Job Evaluation Exercise determined that the skills required for that job did not 
<br/>exist in this country, let alone in the civil service.  Taking into account remuneration data from the 
<br/>private sector and benchmarking against several other positions, the position’s remuneration package 
<br/>was reviewed so that we could attract and retain possible candidates. The same has been done for 
<br/>several  other  positions  in  Government.  This  study,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  allow  for  a  more 
<br/>comprehensive review, in lieu of ad hoc application of Job Evaluation Guidelines.  Mr. Speaker Sir, 
<br/>for the teachers, we are allocating an additional $2.7 million to appropriately remunerate 312 teachers 
<br/>who have taken the initiative to upskill their qualifications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  economy  recovering  and  the  projected  increase  in  revenue 
<br/>collections, we will be able to roll back certain expenditure control measures that were announced in 
<br/>2020.

<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effective from 1st April, 2022, overtime will be reinstated for all civil servants on Band E 
<br/>and below. Overtime will also be reinstated for registered nurses on Band F.  Other officers on Band 
<br/>F and above will be entitled to Time Off in Lieu of overtime pay.  This was as per the past practice 
<br/>and this of course always excludes teachers.  The Ministry of Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be 
<br/>issuing a circular in the coming week.  Meal allowances will now be increased from $10 to $15. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  also  be  bringing  back  rural  and  maritime  allowances  with  an 
<br/>allocation of $1 million.  We recognise the extraordinary efforts by dedicated and committed civil 
<br/>servants who work in remote locations. With immediate effect, civil servants will be paid maritime 
<br/>allowance and following the reconfiguration of the definition of rural, as a lot of previously rural 
<br/>areas are now peri-urban, those in deep rural areas will be paid an allowance also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the last Wage Review was held in 2018 and 
<br/>was due for review in 2020.  It would have been indefensible and quite cynical really to review the 
<br/>minimum wage rate during a pandemic that put more than 100,000 people out of their jobs or on 
<br/>reduced hours.  We focussed instead on providing assistance, as was right.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As things are normalizing, we have conducted the review that was planned for 2020 through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dr. Partha and we are able to consider new pressures, like imported inflation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For weeks, we have held extensive and productive consultations with employers, employees 
<br/>and other stakeholders about wages.  Every consultation was open to the public, but regrettably the 
<br/>unions and their representatives and political parties who were watching  from the sidelines never 
<br/>bothered to give contributions or even show up to the public consultations.  And in fact, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, as was  required only  a few of them turned  up to  the Employment  Relations Advisory  Board 
<br/>(ERAB) meeting.  Of course some of the others did not.  No matter that, Dr. Partha was able to speak 
<br/>directly with the people who will be most affected by a rise in the minimum wage, both in the formal 
<br/>and informal sectors.  These are not the privileged or unionists who drive in their Pajeros, they are 
<br/>people we encounter every day in restaurants, convenient stores and petrol stations.  They may tend 
<br/>gardens or clean offices or they are what we unfortunately in Fiji call “house girls”.  They do much 
<br/>of the work we take for granted every day and their wages should rise as the prices of food and other 
<br/>essentials increase.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will increase the minimum wage to $4 an hour in stages over a one year 
<br/></span><span>period from its current level of $2.68.  The revised minimum wage rate will be implemented in four 
<br/></span><span>tranches, starting at $3.01 from 1st April, 2022, $3.34 from 1st July, $3.67 from 1st October, 2022 
<br/>and $4 from 1st January, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are doing so because we do not want 
<br/>the employers to get an immediate shock.  From all the other 10 wage sectors, the minimum wage 
<br/>rate will also rise in tandem with the new rate and topped up by the relative difference between the 
<br/>current national minimum wage rate and the sectoral wages.  However, we also need to review the 
<br/>existing 10 sectoral job classifications.  The current classification for the 10 sectors is decades old 
<br/>and does not reflect the modern economy and indeed modern day work practices.  Take for example 
<br/>the printing industry. The sector has changed dramatically in this century through automation and 
<br/>digitisation but the job classification has not changed at all. In fact, it does not even recognise that 
<br/>there is digitisation in the printing sector.  We have to recognise these shifts and align sectoral wages 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>

<div><span> Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>813  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with market realities to ensure that people are paid wages for the jobs they perform.   Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, $50,000 has been allocated to carry out this review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has also allocated funding of half-a-million dollars</span><span> </span><span>to adjust 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the wages of civil servants who are hourly paid because of the new minimum wage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to also remember there is still a lot of folks in Fiji who work for 
<br/>themselves in the informal sector who do not make set wages.  A responsible rise in the minimum 
<br/>wage can benefit them indirectly because higher wages mean more spending and that is certainly 
<br/>good news for someone selling roti parcel or </span><span>lovo</span><span> packs or selling boiled </span><span>ivi</span><span> by the side of the road 
<br/>or the many thousands of other Fijians working in our informal sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, a rise in wages must also signal a rise in productivity and we must 
<br/>reward rise in productivity where they happen and root out areas that limit Fiji’s productive capacity.  
<br/>Unfortunately there has been a troubling trend of workers being repeatedly absent on Mondays with 
<br/>the excuse of family care leave.  This impacts productivity and the overall profitability of businesses, 
<br/>many of  which barely survived the pandemic.  We have decided to  put  family care leave on hold 
<br/>given the announced rise in wage rates.  As a further measure to ensure we make the most out of the 
<br/></span><span>next few months and in fact the year,  at least, paternity leave is also now going on hold.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  higher  productivity  must  be  a  good  thing  for  employers  and  employees 
<br/>alike.  So, we are going to further ensure that every hardworking wage earner trusts that their role in 
<br/>improving the nation’s productivity is not only acknowledged but rewarded with further increases to 
<br/>their wages.  By better assessing productivity, wages can keep rising. It is that simple.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  ensure  that  we  are  accurately  assessing  productivity  across  the  economy,  we  have 
<br/>allocated  $50,000</span><span> </span><span>for  the  establishment  of  a  National  Productivity  Commission  based  on  the 
<br/>Australian  model  to  measure  productivity  across  all  the  wage  sectors  and  provide  advice  to  the 
<br/>Government on improving productivity.  This Commission will not work in isolation.  It will be a 
<br/>partner to employers and employees to address issues and complaints as they arise and identify where 
<br/>further wage increase can make the most difference for the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we now get on to tax reform.  We announced an entirely new tariff structure 
<br/>in the 2020-2021 National Budget that was centred around liberal trade and simplicity with a special 
<br/>focus on making life more affordable for ordinary people.  Duty was reduced on more than 2,000 
<br/>lines of items mainly goods that were not manufactured in Fiji.  Those duty reductions will all remain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced in the 2021-2022 Budget, from 31</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022 the fiscal duty on imported 
<br/>liquid milk, full cream powdered milk, yogurt, cheese and butter will be reduced to 5 per cent from 
<br/>the current 32 per cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with this policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fiscal duty rate on lunch boxes with a thickness 
<br/>of 1.8 millimetres or more and which are not manufactured locally, water bottles, wheelie bins, meat 
<br/>patties and chicken nuggets, both raw and cooked will be reduced from 32 per cent to 5 per cent.  
<br/>Import excise of 15 per cent will also be removed from lunch boxes, water bottles and wheelie bins.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to make wheelie bins affordable in Fiji, the Government, of course, as I 
<br/>said, will reduce the duty.  The high duty is a result of wheelie bins being classified under plastics.  
<br/>The reduction of duty will make wheelie bins affordable and will ultimately lead to people using bins 
<br/>to keep our environment clean.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Revised 2021-2022 Appropriation Bill 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also have some new reforms to announce to simplify our tax system.  
<br/>We will raise the VAT on 21 non-essential items to 15 per cent.  The increase in VAT to 15 per cent 
<br/>will  cover  goods  and  services  that  previously  attracted  ECAL  such  as  prescribed  services,  white 
<br/>goods and certain motor vehicles, and will apply to all turnover in excess of $100,000. So, previously 
<br/>there were certain things that attracted 9 per cent VAT and 5 per cent ECAL which was 14 per cent. 
<br/>Now, it will just simply be VAT and will go up to 15 per cent.  In other words an increase of 1 per 
<br/>cent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to be clear about this, in a nutshell ECAL will be removed and replaced by 
<br/>the adjusted VAT rate of 15 per cent for these items. So tax on an item that carried 9 per cent VAT 
<br/>and 5 per cent ECAL would increase only by 1 per cent. The additional list of goods and services to 
<br/>be  taxed  at  15  per  cent  VAT  now  will  include  alcohol,  tobacco,  textiles,  clothing  &amp;  footwear, 
<br/>perfumes,  jewellery,  watches,  stereos  and  sound  systems  and  other  electrical  equipment,  and 
<br/>professional services such as legal and accounting, management and consultancy, architectural and 
<br/>engineering,  scientific  research  and  development,  advertising  and  market  research,  veterinary 
<br/>activities and other professional, scientific and technical activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ECAL on personal income will also be removed but the 5 per cent rate will be added to 
<br/></span><span>the  Social  Responsibility  Levy  with  the  tax  burden  unchanged  for  the  taxpayer.    The  ECAL  on 
<br/></span><span>plastics and super yachts will also be removed and replaced with a plastic levy and a super yacht levy 
<br/>at the same rates.  A proportion of VAT return charged on prescribed services will now be directed 
<br/>towards Environment and Climate Adaptation Projects previously funded by ECAL through the Trust 
<br/>Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  are  not  the  only  tax  reforms  we  are  announcing  tonight,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    As  we 
<br/>explained at the start of the announcement the “why” behind the painful rise in the prices of food and 
<br/>essential items. We are not only raising wages in response, we will be reducing the price of food for 
<br/>everyday Fijians in the most direct possible way that we can.  There was a time when six basic food 
<br/>items in Fiji were zero-VAT rated and these were what they were called “basic food items” like flour, 
<br/>tea, powdered milk, cooking oil, rice and kerosene. We subsequently lowered VAT across a wider 
<br/>basket  of  items  that  Fijians  were  purchasing  more  often,  a  move  that  lowered  the  overall  cost  of 
<br/>living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, this price increase crisis demands that we go further by sending 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>VAT back to zero, not on six basic food items but on 21 everyday essentials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in other words dropping the cost of these 
<br/>items  by  9 per cent  overnight.   From 1st April,  2022, sugar, flour, rice, canned fish, cooking oil, 
<br/>potatoes, onion, garlic, baby milk, powdered milk, liquid milk, dhal, tea, salt, kerosene and cooking 
<br/>gas are all going to become VAT zero-rated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  However,  these  are  not  the  only  items.    There  are  other 
<br/>household essentials that people buy on a daily basis and these include soap powder for washing, 
<br/>toilet  paper,  sanitary  pads  for  women  and  toothpaste;  these  will  also  be  zero-rated.  In  total,  this 
<br/>reduction in VAT will send $163 million in tax revenues back to the Fijian people.  The Government 
<br/>will lose $163 million but it will go back to the Fijian people and alleviate the cruellest burden that 
<br/>the pandemic and the Russian war have placed on our people’s backs. We will continue to review 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>815  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the price of food and other essentials as time goes on, the war could get worse or, God willing, peace 
<br/>will win out.   Either way, we have to maintain a flexible policy posture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And Mr. Speaker, Sir, to alleviate the sharp rise in fuel price due to the conflict in Ukraine, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will remove the current 20 cents fuel tax.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- This will cost the Government approximately $56 million.  
<br/>Prices remain volatile, and we will continue to monitor global crude oil prices and the events that are 
<br/>affecting them, such as the war in Ukraine.  In the same way, should crude oil prices stabilize, we 
<br/>may be able to reconsider this reduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  assist  the  Textile  Clothing  and  Footwear  (TCF)  Council  and  their  industry  with  rising 
<br/>import freight costs on top of the new increase to the sector minimum wage rates, the Government, 
<br/>for the next three years will provide TCF Council a marketing grant of $100,000 a year to allow them 
<br/>to  secure markets  to  expand.   In addition,  the TCF sector will be waived for a customs entry for 
<br/>commercial consignments below $1,500 by FRCS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall Government will also provide for the next three years a 200 per cent tax deduction to 
<br/>those employers who will be paying maternity leave for their staff; a move we highly encourage for 
<br/>the sake of the mums of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and lastly, the interest on bank accounts totalling less than $1,000 in a year 
<br/>will be exempt from the Resident Interest Withholding Tax. This exemption covers more than 75 per 
<br/>cent of holders of interest-earning bank accounts. People with low bank deposits, recipients of social 
<br/>welfare  funds,  senior  citizens  and  students  will  benefit  from  this  exemption  and  they  will  not  be 
<br/>required to apply for a Certificate of Exemption. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last year, there were two moments that lifted our spirits when they needed lifting 
<br/>most and those were the Olympic Gold and Bronze victories for our men’s and women’s  Sevens 
<br/>sides.  Sport, of course, has a special place in Fijian life, none more so than rugby. So tonight we 
<br/>have saved a special final announcement about what is next for the game that means so much for our 
<br/>national life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our </span><span>Drua</span><span> have landed in Super Rugby and made an immediate impact, putting eyes on Fiji 
<br/></span><span>globally. We will all be able to see them in action around this time tomorrow evening in Melbourne 
<br/></span><span>(hopefully Opposition will not make us stay too long here) against the Rebels.  We want to make 
<br/>sure that Fiji secures its permanent place in Super Rugby, and we know that that will depend on more 
<br/>than just the skill and heart of our athletes.  It requires a full financial commitment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support the Fiji Rugby Union and the Fijian  </span><span>Drua</span><span> in meeting the New Zealand Rugby 
<br/>Union’s (NZRU) financing requirements for Super Rugby Pacific, the Fijian Government will invest 
<br/>$6  million  for  51  per  cent  shareholding  in  the  Counter  Ruck  Pte  Limited  or  CRL,  which  was 
<br/>established by the Fiji Rugby Union to own and operate the Fijian </span><span>Drua</span><span>. The FRU had requested a 
<br/>grant, but Government is unable legally to give a grant to a private company. We can, however, take 
<br/>a share in the company and divest it at a later stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this revised budget, the Fijian Government will allocate the first tranche investment 
<br/>of  $3  million  for  25.5  per  cent  shareholding.  The  second  tranche  investment  of  an  additional  $3 
<br/>million will be undertaken by December 2022 to secure the total 51 per cent.  By December 2022, 
<br/>the Fiji Rugby Union will own 49 per cent shareholding while the Fijian Government will own 51 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>24</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per cent.  The FRU will maintain the management control of the company, and Government will 
<br/>consider divesting its shares once an opportunity arises.  Additionally CRL will be granted a 13-year 
<br/>income tax holiday and will be provided a waiver for customs duty on goods imported specifically 
<br/>for Fijian </span><span>Drua</span><span>-related venues and High Performance Base from 1st July, 2022 to 30th June, 2023. 
<br/>Additionally, any sponsorship above $250,000 made to the Fijian </span><span>Drua</span><span> will receive a 200 per cent 
<br/>income tax deduction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The support to the Fijian </span><span>Drua</span><span> has two main purposes.  First, it will ensure that we realise the 
<br/>significant benefits the team will have on the growth and development of rugby in Fiji. Second, it 
<br/>will  allow  us  to  capitalise  on  our  great  competitive  advantage  in  the  sport,  our  people,  who  are 
<br/>naturally gifted athletes and rugby players. The Fijian </span><span>Drua</span><span> provides an avenue for Fijian players to 
<br/>pursue a professional sports career right here in the Pacific which will further strengthen grassroots 
<br/>rugby. Home matches played in Fiji will become important sports tourism events. They will create 
<br/>jobs, attract large numbers of tourists and generate a great deal of economic activity, a spirit very 
<br/>much in keeping with the budget we announce tonight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these changes are coming into effect from 1st April which just so 
<br/>happens to be April Fool’s Day.  Let us be perfectly clear that the only fools in Fiji on that day will 
<br/></span><span>be those who oppose these meaningful measures to aid our people, create new opportunities and build 
<br/></span><span>on our recovery. The only fools will be those who oppose VAT going to zero on 21 everyday items; 
<br/>those who oppose the reductions of fiscal duties on fuel, the rise in wage rates and the assistance 
<br/>heading for the people of the Northern Division. Only fools could oppose a budget that widens high 
<br/>quality healthcare access for our people. Only fools would oppose the maintenance of civil service 
<br/>salaries and the return of their overtime pay, the increase in meal allowances, the reinstatement of 
<br/>maritime allowances and the increase in TELS Loans and Topper’s Scholarships. Only fools would 
<br/>say no to clearing the backlog of land that should be surveyed and the new assistance to those looking 
<br/>to  build  or  buy  their  first  home.  And  truly  only  a  fool  would  deny  the  opportunity  to  become  a 
<br/>shareholder of the </span><span>Drua</span><span> and become part of the future of Super Rugby.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question on the mind of the nation is, 
<br/>“what is next?” and this budget is the answer. We look forward to getting this budget and its policies 
<br/>over the line at tomorrow’s parliamentary session.  The Fijians who need our help cannot wait and 
<br/>we cannot waste a minute in seizing the opportunities created by our strengthening recovery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank the honourable Attorney-General and the 
<br/></span><span>Minister of Economy for the presentation of the 2021-2022 Revised Budget Address.  Pursuant to 
<br/>the  resolution  of  Parliament  passed  tonight,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy  has  now  completed  his  part  and  tomorrow  the  response  from  the  Shadow  Minister  for 
<br/>Economy will be the next part of this Budget Address which is an important part of this process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, copies of the revised budget documents have been circulated to all for 
<br/>your necessary preparations for tomorrow’s proceedings.  On that note, honourable Members, we 
<br/>come to the adjournment.  I thank all honourable Members and Parliament is now adjourned until 
<br/>tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
