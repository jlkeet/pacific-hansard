<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting of Parliament, those present in person 
<br/>and those joining virtually. I also welcome all those watching the live broadcast and the livestreaming 
<br/>of today’s proceedings from the comfort of their homes, offices and electronic devices.  Thank you 
<br/>for your continued interest in the workings of your Parliament.

<div><span>Honourable Members, take note that the Fijian Elections Office Voter Registration Team will 
<br/></span><span>be present in Parliament today from 9.00 a.m. to 4.00 p.m. to undertake voter registration services.  
<br/>The Team will be based at Level 2 outside the Party Offices and I encourage honourable Members 
<br/>to utilise the services that they will provide.  At this juncture, I extend my gratitude to the Supervisor 
<br/>of Elections and his team for accommodating the request from Parliament.

<div><span>Honourable  Members,  following  the  Budget  announcement  last  night  pertaining  to  the 
<br/>removal  of  the  social  distancing  protocols,  be  advised  that  we  will  revert  to  the  normal  seating 
<br/>arrangement in the next sitting of Parliament, so you can get more cosier.

<div><span>to blame.  Unless I am satisfied that everything is ready, the session will not begin, and that was the  
<br/>reason for yesterday’s delay. Unlike His Excellency the President, he is always on time but if he is 
<br/>late, it is not the President who is late but it is the Aide-De-Camp (ADC) who is late.
