<h3>ADOPTION OF STANDING ORDERS</h3>
<div><span>ADOPTION OF STANDING ORDERS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That pursuant to Section 71 of the Constitution, the Standing Orders of the Parliament 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji, published and gazetted on 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2019, be adopted by Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this  motion is purely procedural in nature.  
<br/>The Standing Orders lays out the rules for the order and conduct of business and the proceedings of 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  the  administration  of  oath  or  affirmation  earlier  today,  it  is  envisaged  that  the 
<br/>Parliamentary  Standing  and  Select  Committees  will  meet  soon  and,  therefore,  it  is  pertinent  that 
<br/>Parliament adopts the current Standing Orders so as to allow Parliament and its Committees to start 
<br/>and continue with business accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Section 71 of the Constitution provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Parliament  may  make  standing  orders  and  rules  for  the  order  and  conduct  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>business and proceedings in Parliament and its committees.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 128(2) also further provides, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Immediately following the first sitting of Parliament after each election, the Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Orders Committee shall be automatically convened to –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a) 
<br/>(b) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>review the Standing Orders; and 
<br/>report  to  Parliament  within  14  sitting  days  with  recommended  amendments  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Standing Orders if any, in which case, on the third sitting day after the tabling of the 
<br/></span><span>report, the Speaker must put the question ‘That the amendments recommended by the 
<br/>Standing Orders Committee … be adopted by Parliament’.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  order  for  the  Standing  Order  128(2)  to  take  place,  Parliament  on  its  first 
<br/>sitting after a general election (which is today) must adopt the Standing Orders in its current form.  I, 
<br/>therefore, seek support from all honourable Members for this motion.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Adjournment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  point  of  clarification.    The 
<br/>honourable Member, I assume over this sort of long introduction is basically the motion is that we 
<br/>adopt the Standing Orders on the first day of April 2019 I assume, that is what it is.  Yes?  We have 
<br/>no objection to that, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no objection,  I call upon the Leader of the Government in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament for his right of reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no further comments to add to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
