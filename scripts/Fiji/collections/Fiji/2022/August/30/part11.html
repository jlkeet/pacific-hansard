<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report 2017-2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr Speaker, Sir, by way of a brief background, the Fiji Corrections 
<br/></span><span>Service  2017-2018  Annual  Report  was  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and 
<br/></span><span>Human Rights to provide an oversight review of the Annual Report and table its findings back to 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Corrections Service Annual Report 2017-2018 covers information 
<br/>on the type of work carried out and the significant target it has achieved within the reported year. 
<br/>The Annual Report also highlights the work undertaken by Fiji Corrections Service in order to fulfil 
<br/>its mandate under the 2013 Constitution of the Republic of Fiji and the Corrections Service Act 2006 
<br/>which  is  to  serve  the  public  by  keeping  in  custody  those  convicted  by  the  courts  and  providing 
<br/>effective corrective and rehabilitation services, whilst applying the relevant human rights obligation 
<br/>and standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the review, there were few key issues identified which the Committee 
<br/>is obligated to present before this august Parliament.  The first issue I would like to highlight is the 
<br/>rate of recidivism recorded by the Fiji Corrections Service.  This is one key area of focus for the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service in terms of trying to reduce the rate of re-offenders.  The Committee saw that
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this would be an opportune time to understand the Service’s efforts in working towards the National 
<br/>Development Plan of achieving the three percent threshold of reducing reoffenders annually.  The 
<br/>Committee notes that the Fiji Corrections Service has made progressive steps which saw the rate of 
<br/>reoffenders decline for the periods 2016-2017 to 2017-2018. This provides a positive indication that 
<br/>the strategies put in place by the Fiji Corrections Services are being implemented effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further to this the Committee acknowledges the numerous Rehabilitation 
<br/>Programmes  implemented  by  the  Fiji  Corrections  Services  which  includes  the  “Yellow  Ribbon 
<br/>Project”.  It would be worth noting that the implication of these programmes have impacted the lives 
<br/>of inmates in their transition back to the community.  The Yellow Ribbon Project was evidently seen 
<br/>to have a leading role in creating awareness and educating the public on the roles and responsibilities 
<br/>on taking ownership of ex-offenders once they complete their sentence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another significant  issue is  the  number of  staff turnover which occurred 
<br/>within  the  reported  year.    The  Committee  noted  that  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  had  engaged  a 
<br/>substantial amount of staff to man what is called the </span><span>Musudovu</span><span> Operation for a short period.  The 
<br/>length of the contract for these temporary staff were entirely dependent on the harvesting season of 
<br/>sugarcane, and once the task is completed the contract of these temporary officers are terminated at 
<br/></span><span>the  end  of  the  cutting  season.    This  added  to  the  high  turnover  rate  for  the  reported  year.    Also 
<br/></span><span>included in the number of staff turnover, are the retirements, resignations and dismissals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also noted that the Fiji Corrections Service has endeavoured 
<br/>not to let the staff turnover affect its service delivery and their main aim of achieving the international 
<br/>benchmark of one correction officer per five inmates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee also took time to deliberate on the financial statement of  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections  Service  and  noted  that  during  the  review  of  the  Annual  Report,  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service had utilised a total of 81 percent of its budget allocated for the fiscal year.  It was noted that 
<br/>the unutilised coverage of the expenditure was a result of some pending projects that were yet to be 
<br/>completed  in  due  time.    There  were  certain  discrepancies  also  identified  in  the  Services’  Annual 
<br/>Financial Statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was advised that the discrepancy was merely caused by the different types of 
<br/>financial  statements  published  whereby  Fiji  Corrections  Service  publishes  audited  financial 
<br/>statement but the budget documents, especially the estimates, shows an unaudited financial budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee  also  undertook  a  scrutiny  of  the  Annual  Report  using  a 
<br/></span><span>gender  lens  and  it  was  encouraging  to  note  that  Fiji  Corrections  Service  is  committed  to 
<br/>implementation  of  gender  neutral  and  non-discriminatory  policies  including  those  that  relate  to 
<br/>staffing.  At the end of the review, the Committee noted and acknowledged that the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service has achieved so much in the 2017- 2018 period.  However, the Committee also believed that 
<br/>for  the  continued  improvement  in  service  delivery,  it  would  be  prudent  to  put  forth  a  few 
<br/>recommendations for consideration by Fiji Corrections Service and these are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee  appreciated the fact that there  was a  high number  of  staff turnover but 
<br/></span><span>acknowledges  Fiji  Corrections  Service  for  trying  to  ensure  that  service  delivery  was 
<br/></span><span>maintained, which is in par with international standards.  The Committee also recommends 
<br/>that Fiji Corrections Service does a thorough review of its human resource policies and 
<br/>plans,  and  develops strategies  to build the  capacity of their staff  and retain them in the 
<br/>Services. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>acknowledges  Fiji  Corrections  Service  for  trying  to  ensure  that  service  delivery  was 
<br/>maintained, which is in par with international standards.  The Committee also recommends 
<br/>that Fiji Corrections Service does a thorough review of its human resource policies and 
<br/>plans,  and  develops strategies  to build the  capacity of their staff  and retain them in the 
<br/>Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the discrepancies identified in the Financial Statements of the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service, the Committee recommends that more collaboration is needed between the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service, the Ministry of Economy and the Office of the Auditor-General, to 
<br/>strengthen  the  financial  management  system  and  ensure  that  there  are  minimal  serious 
<br/>discrepancies in future reported financial statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  few  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, namely honourable Rohit 
<br/>Sharma  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  Mosese  Bulitavu,  honourable  Dr.  Salik  Govind, 
<br/>honourable Mikaele Leawere and former Member, Ratu Suliano Matanitobua for their deliberations 
<br/>and input, and the alternate members who made themselves available when the substantive members 
<br/>could not attend, and the secretariat for their support.  I also acknowledge the representatives of Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service and the Commissioner who cooperated and assisted the Committee with its work.

<div><span>Review Report - iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  report  of  the  Standing 
<br/></span><span>Committee on Social Affairs on the Annual Review of the iTaukei Trust Fund Board (TTFB) for 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which mandates 
<br/>the committee to  look  into issues related to  health, education, social services,  labour,  culture and 
<br/>media.  The committee first met to deliberate in May of this year and formulated questions pertaining 
<br/>to  the  Annual  Reports, which  were  sent  to  FPTCL  for  its  response.    Upon  receipt  of  all  relevant 
<br/>information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the  Committee  compiled  its  findings  and  subsequently 
<br/></span><span>endorsed its report in June.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the  course of our deliberations, several  pertinent  findings were made.  We note that the 
<br/>board  made  significant  inroads  in  both  organisational  strategic  direction  and  development.  It 
<br/>achieved a  gross revenue of $8,095,992 and a net  profit from  operations of $1,438,770 for 2019, 
<br/>compared to $3,984,876 in 2018. The decrease in profit was attributed to the written-down value of  
<br/>the burnt </span><span>Vale ni Bose</span><span>.

<div><span>Furthermore, the Fund launched its Strategic Development Plan (2019-2023), which outlines 
<br/>five  priority  areas,  which  are  Prudent  Financial  Sustainability,  Language,  Culture  and  Heritage, 
<br/>Communication, Leadership, Entrepreneurial and Business Skills and Human Capital Management.  
<br/>It was also pleasing to note that the Fund’s investments continued to satisfactorily grow during the 
<br/>year, with its investment portfolio continuing to generate positive returns in funding the mandated 
<br/>objectives for the Fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to thank the Chief Executive Officer of iTaukei Trust Fund Board and 
<br/>his  staff  for  their  timely  assistance  in  this  review  process.    I  also  extend  my  gratitude  to  my 
<br/>Committee  colleagues  namely,  honourable  George  Vegnathan  (Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable 
<br/>Alipate Nagata, honourable Salote Radrodro and honourable Ratu Tevita Navurelevu who substituted 
<br/>for  honourable  Dr.  Ratu  Atonio  Lalabalavu  for  their  contributions  during  the  Committee’s 
<br/>deliberations.

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji Rice 2013-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs is pleased 
<br/>to submit to Parliament the Review  Report of the Fiji Rice 2013-2017 Annual Reports.  The Fiji 
<br/>Rice Limited was first established as Rewa Rice Limited in the early 1960s before going through a 
<br/></span><span>name  change.    The  Executives  of  Fiji  Rice  Limited  were  invited  to  produce  a  submission  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Committee  during  the  key  achievements  and  challenges  during  the  period  under  review  were 
<br/>discussed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommended  that  Fiji  Rice  Limited,  in  full  consultation  with  the  key 
<br/>stakeholders such as the Ministry of Agriculture to formulate a comprehensive Strategic Plan to align 
<br/>it with the Ministry’s Commodity Development Plan.  The Committee believes that when marketing 
<br/>Fiji grown rice, the industry in collaboration with relevant stakeholders could promote brown rice as 
<br/>it is known for its rich source of dietary fibre, which can reduce risk of non-communicable diseases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, it was noted that there is an issue of aging farmers as the younger generation 
<br/>are not as willing to take up rice farming.  The Committee in its recommendations stated the need for 
<br/>stakeholders to work together to develop initiatives, policies and a conducive environment to make 
<br/>rice farming a more lucrative career choice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to extend our appreciation to the CEO of Fiji Rice Limited

<div><span>Review Report – Fiji National University 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  the  Report  of  the  Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee on Social Affairs on the annual review of the Fiji National University for 2020.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This review was undertaken in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b) which mandates 
<br/>the Committee to look into issues related to health, education, social services, labour, culture and 
<br/>media.  The Committee first met to deliberate in May of this year and formulated questions pertaining 
<br/>to  the  Annual  Report,  which  were  sent  to  FNU  for  its  response.    Upon  receipt  of  all  relevant 
<br/>information  on  the  Committee’s  queries,  the  Committee  compiled  its  findings  and  subsequently 
<br/>endorsed its Report in June.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FNU  is  a  dual  sector  university,  offering  Technical  and  Vocational 
<br/></span><span>Education and Training (TVET) from Levels 1 to 6 and Higher Education from Levels 5 to 10.  The 
<br/>University recorded operating surplus for the year, achieving an operating surplus of $7.4 million 
<br/>compared  to  $6.1  million  deficit  in  2019.    The  University  has  undertaken  a  major  upgrade  of  its 
<br/>digital infrastructure, which enabled it to make a speedy transition to fully online learning at the onset 
<br/>of the COVID-19 pandemic. Across the University’s Campuses, there is also extensive building and 
<br/>renovation  work  underway  as  the  University  transforms  its  Campuses  to  meet  the  needs  of  21st 
<br/>Century students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FNU  is  an  institution  committed  to  investing  in  its  staff.  In  2020,  the 
<br/>University had a full-time staff body of 785 academic staff and 1,016 professional services staff.  In 
<br/>terms of overall staffing, the University is relatively evenly balanced between men and women.  The 
<br/>Committee  acknowledges  FNU’s  commitment  to  the  improvement  of  female  participation  in  the 
<br/>science colleges and to promoting the advancement of women in their academic careers and has 
<br/>launched a series of initiatives to address gender imbalances.

<div><span>Review Report – Performance Audit on Licensing and Monitoring  
<br/>of River Gravel and Sand Extraction 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  provides  the  Committee’s  review 
<br/>findings  on  the  performance  audit  on  the  Licencing  and  Monitoring  of  River  Gravel  and  Sand 
<br/>Extraction.  The Report focuses on three areas, namely: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Assessment of potential river gravel and sand extraction site; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Licencing system and extracting river gravel and sand; and  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring of extraction operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plans express the need to revise and update 
<br/>the monitoring and evaluation of mining and quarrying operations for better oversight in areas such 
<br/></span><span>as  environmental  safeguards.    Development  of  minerals  play  a  major  role  in  Fiji’s  domestic 
<br/></span><span>development, especially in the areas of infrastructure, construction of buildings, road construction, 
<br/>agriculture, disaster reconstruction, as well as supporting a large number of Fijian small and medium-
<br/>sized domestic enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary objective of the audit that was carried out by the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>was to determine whether the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources effectively regulates the river 
<br/>gravel and sand extractions through a proper system of contracting, licensing and monitoring in order 
<br/>to ensure good governance and sustainable development in the sector.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, river gravel and sand extractions falls under the extractive industries sector 
<br/>in Fiji, in addition to mining, petroleum, hard rock quarrying and ground water resource extractions.  
<br/>Extractive industries consist of any operations that remove oil, gas, metals, minerals and aggregates 
<br/>from  the  earth  and  or  sea.    The  seven  steps  of  extractive  industries  value  chain  includes;  legal 
<br/>framework,  resource  exploration,  awarding  of  contracts  and  licenses,  monitoring  of  operations, 
<br/>collection of revenue, resource management and  the implementation  of sustainable policies.  The

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mining and quarrying of development minerals in Fiji are dominated by crushed aggregate, gravel 
<br/>and  sand,  used  for  construction  materials,  and  to  lesser  extent  limestone,  used  for  agricultural 
<br/>purposes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, information on potential river gravel and sand extraction sites can be further 
<br/>improved through the development of a centralised database.  Moreover, while the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and  Mineral  Resources  (MLMR)  compliance  with  the  licencing  system  for  river  gravel  and  sand 
<br/>extractions is fair or moderate, the quality of decision is an area of concern due to gaps in the SOPs, 
<br/>which is compounded by the absence of a structured and thorough review process, inadequate data 
<br/>maintenance,  inconsistent  application  of  pivotal  work  processes,  and  the  substandard  quality  of 
<br/>information being provided based on which decisions are made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Furthermore, the Ministry’s established monitoring processes have not been able to prevent 
<br/>issues arising from river gravel and sand extractions because of a weal penalty system on offenders, 
<br/>which does not act as a deterrent, not taking full advantage of available technologies and inconsistent 
<br/>monitoring of works carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the above findings, the Committee recommends that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>

<div><span>The Committee notes the gender parity in the Senior Management of the Ministry of Lands 
<br/>and Mineral Resources and commends the Ministry for fulfilling SDG 5 - Gender Equality. 
<br/>The MLMR to transform manual record keeping to electronic centralised database system 
<br/>for all rivers, streams and resources. 
<br/>The current fees levied by the Ministry needs to be reviewed and brought on par to what is 
<br/>being paid by the extractors of river gravel on </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> land. 
<br/>The MLMR should consider digital technologies for monitoring purposes such as drones. 
<br/>The MLMR in conjunction with iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission should conduct 
<br/>regular training and workshop on financial literacy and resource management for resource 
<br/>owners.  
<br/>The MLMR should carry out awareness programmes with landowners on the impact of 
<br/>river gravel and sand extraction to the environment, targeting SDG 15 – Life on Land. 
<br/>The MLMR should expedite the finalisation of the two manuals, namely the River Gravel 
<br/>Extraction Guideline and the National Development Mineral Policy Guideline that are yet 
<br/>to be finalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most  importantly,  Mr.  Speaker,  while  phasing-out  of  river  gravel  and  sand  extractions  is 
<br/></span><span>blurred,  improvements  in  the  areas  of  geological  exploration  or  similar  surveys,  licensing  and 
<br/></span><span>monitoring  need  to  be  actioned  by  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  with  more 
<br/>consultations  and  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  in  order  to 
<br/>ensure the safeguarding of the environment and the society.  Overall, we commend the work of the 
<br/>Ministry of Land and Mineral Resources in addressing majority of the issues that were highlighted 
<br/>in the audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in view of the above findings and recommendations by the Committee, I 
<br/>wish to also shed some light into some of the areas of improvements that the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources has thus far taken into consideration and we acknowledge the efforts shown – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  currently  focusing  on  finalising  a  proper  work  plan  of  the  actual  work 
<br/>required, including resources and capacity prior to seeking funding to start with collection 
<br/>of relevant data thereafter it will develop a database. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is currently working on a Cabinet Paper for the formulation of a National

<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Drafting  of  the  River  Extraction  Guideline  has  been  formulated  and  currently  with  the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Solicitor-General  for  vetting.    This  will  address  the  issue  of  sustainable 
<br/>extraction practices and processes in place for issuing of river gravel and sand extraction 
<br/>licences.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry’s SOP on extraction licences for sand, lime and common-stone was reviewed 
<br/>and adopted since 26th February, 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Divisions are now coordinating the collection and management of data at divisional 
<br/>level with a designated officer at the headquarters being responsible for the consolidation 
<br/>of all data received from the three (3) Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Divisional  Managers  and  responsible  processing  officers  have  been  instructed  to 
<br/>ensure full compliance of the procedural guidance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to the honourable Members of the Committee who were 
<br/></span><span>part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report namely honourable Joseph Nitya Nand 
<br/></span><span>(Deputy  Chairperson),  honourable  Ro  Teimumu  Kepa,  honourable  Virendra  Lal  and  honourable 
<br/>Aseri Radrodro.  With those few words, I submit the Report to Parliament.
