<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Parliament debates the review of the Compliance Audit Report which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was tabled on 7</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022.

<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  at  the outset the contents of  the Compliance 
<br/>Audit  Report  on  the  four  key  audit  areas  were  thoroughly  examined  and  scrutinised  by  the 
<br/>Committee, prior to the scheduled public hearings conducted with relevant agencies.  The four audit 
<br/>areas were: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Commencement of Quarry Development Projects and Appointment of Certified Foreman-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in-Charge; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Government Payroll System; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Management Information System (FMIS); and 
<br/>Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The audit covered the laws where the Department of Mineral Resources derives its powers 
<br/>to issue approvals of Quarry Development and the ambiguity it may have stipulated in the applicable 
<br/>laws.  It also covers the process involved and lack of documentation when appointing a qualified 
<br/>Foreman or Quarryman to oversee quarry development projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, the audit focuses on the application of proper controls in the payroll system of the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Education Payroll Section and in its Financial Management Information System, and an 
<br/>IT audit on the IT governance structure and IT Operations that should deliver and meet the IT needs 
<br/>and  requirements  of  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  as  part  of  the  background 
<br/>information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to extend our appreciation and commendation to 
<br/>the  relevant  Ministries  and  Departments  involved  in  the  compilation  of  this  Compliance  Audit 
<br/>Report.  Much needed effort and improvement was evident throughout the implementation phase 
<br/>showing the ability of Ministries and Departments to be better stewards towards the people and our 
<br/>nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first area of audit is on the Commencement of Quarry Development 
<br/>Projects  and  Appointment  of  Certified  Foreman-in-Charge.    Despite  the  highlighted  findings  by 
<br/>OAG, the Committee was advised that the Mineral Resource Department has been able to rectify 
<br/>around 90 percent of the issues highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-General.  Also, in order to 
<br/>address better coordination information sharing amongst relevant departments, audit meetings have 
<br/>been undertaken with other relevant agencies in terms of information sharing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) has commenced discussions with FRCS for a 
<br/>MOU for information sharing in relation to the importation of mobile crushers. However, with other 
<br/>agencies  like  TLTB  and  Department  of  Environment  who  are  other  proving  agencies  for  the 
<br/>development  of  quarries,  DMR  relies  on  individual  department’s  professional  courtesy  to  inform 
<br/>them of any new potential quarry developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Department of Mineral Resources has also indicated that their main focus 
<br/>of review in the Mining Act which has been approved by Cabinet with the assistance of other donor 
<br/>agencies, is to conduct  a gap analysis on the current Quarries Act. Additionally, improvement on 
<br/>record management to capture information relating to quarry men and quarry development has been 
<br/>maintained by DMR through the use of Excel to keep a digital copy of the quarryman’s records with 
<br/>a stringent checklist to be adhered to when acquiring a quarry development approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second area was the audit of the Government payroll system.  The Committee, during its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>deliberations, noted a major improvement by the Ministry of Economy as follows:
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2163 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.  All payroll files are loaded on a secure bank portal except for Home Finance Bank, that 
<br/>is,  bank files are  encrypted using  an encryption programme before being  sent  to  the 
<br/>banks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Changes  to  the  payroll  system  whereby  the  Ministry  is  continuously  upgrading  the 
<br/>payroll system and its reporting requirements to ensure that the payroll is compliant to 
<br/>FNPF,  FRCS,  General  Ledger  and  related  stakeholders  requirement  with  adequate 
<br/>training and presentation on the changes in the wages process.  Quarterly user group 
<br/>meetings are conducted to communicate changes made in the payroll system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is currently undergoing a review of the financial regulations and all the 
<br/>changes in the payroll system processes with the user manual, is made accessible to all 
<br/>payroll users. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of data  accuracy  and  completeness,  Ministry of Economy has a data report 
<br/>which  is  generated  every  pay  and  used  by  ministries  and  departments  to  update 
<br/>information which is missing as and when identified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  The Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Civil Service are looking to finalise the 
<br/></span><span>integration of a payroll system and Human Resource Management Information System 
<br/>in the new financial year.  The integration will ensure that the current and future HR 
<br/>information  system  will  be  able  to  integrate  employee  details.    On  this  note,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, due  consideration has been undertaken by the Minister of  Economy in 
<br/>ensuring  that  full  compliance  and  monitoring  are  progressively  factored  into  the 
<br/>Ministry’s system and processes to address the highlighted issues by the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The third area, was the audit of Financial Management Information System. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Ministry of Economy advised the Committee that they have developed a Business Continuity 
<br/>Plan and Disaster and Risk Management Framework which will come into effect in December 2022.  
<br/>The objective of having a Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan with the associated 
<br/>control is to ensure that the organisation can still accomplish its mission, and this will not lose the 
<br/>capability process, retrieve and protect information maintained in the event of interaction or disaster, 
<br/>leading to temporary or permanent loss of computer facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FMIS is  making use of infrastructure as a service provided by  ITC  and also  needs to 
<br/></span><span>consider  how  the  system  can  be  recovered  in  the  events  of  hardware  failures,  network  failures, 
<br/></span><span>programme failures and other unforeseen circumstances.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, audit had noted 
<br/>that the Department of ITC is providing MOE with the infrastructure as a service, by hosting the 
<br/>FMIS server at their data centre and also providing network related services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there is no service level agreement or MOU between MOE and ITC in accordance 
<br/>with Ministry’s response, that the drafting was earmarked to be completed by the end of December 
<br/>2021 to demarcate clear lines of responsibility.  Additionally, the audit had highlighted that the FMIS 
<br/>section  does  not  have  an  IT  strategy  but  works  in  consultation  with  the  Department  of  ITC  for 
<br/>procurement  and execution of its  IT projects.    In July 2022, the strategic plan had been finalised 
<br/>which will address  COVID-19 implications for the next  three  years to  build resilience within the 
<br/>Ministry’s recovery plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also  audit  of  FMIS  noted  that  there  is  no  Risk  Management  Framework  present  in  the 
<br/>Ministry to facilitate the design and development of its Risk Management Plan in order to identify 
<br/>and document the risk with controlled measures and will mitigate the risk identified or to be kept at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a  minimum.    However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (in  its 
<br/>response) reported that the Risk Management Plan is currently being spearheaded by the Treasury 
<br/>Department.  The Asian Development Bank is funding a Risk Management Consultant to develop a 
<br/>comprehensive Risk Management Framework for the Ministry.  It is important to note the Ministry 
<br/>of  Economy  has  taken  proactive  action  to  implement  those  recommendations  highlighted  by  the 
<br/>OAG.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth one was the audit of the Fiji Education Management Information System.  It is 
<br/>pleasing to note that for the audit of the Fiji Education Management Information System, the Ministry 
<br/>of Education Heritage and Arts (MEHA)  IT Unit has been working closely with Government ITC 
<br/>regarding the IT plans, documentations and framework, as all have to be aligned to Government’s 
<br/>ITC.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was further noted that in view of highlighted audit issues, the Ministry has prioritised the 
<br/>work on the IT governance plan and system security. Identified reasonable actions undertaken are as 
<br/>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>IT governance framework for MEHA.  The Ministry has developed a draft IT governance 
<br/>framework in consultation with ITC for their feedback, which will be reviewed quarterly.  This 
<br/>document has been vetted by ITC since July 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan.  MEHA IT Unit had developed a business 
<br/>continuity plan and the Disaster Recovery Plan in consultation with ITC which was to be made 
<br/>ready in July 2021. 
<br/>Information Security Policy.  At the time of reporting, MEHA has indicated that works are in 
<br/>progress with the assistance of ITC.  The draft policy was made readily available since July 
<br/>2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>Physical  Security.    MEHA  IT  Unit  has  managed  to  secure  funding  to  upgrade  its  official 
<br/>facilities  at  Senikau  House  in  order  to  introduce  physical  controls  to  governance  and 
<br/>accessibility of its operational system as well as safeguard its physical IT assets.  Upgrading 
<br/>of MEHA IT facility was carried out in July 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With other implementations, the Committee would also like to acknowledge the hard work 
<br/>and effort shown by MEHA to obtain assurance on the levels of control used by FEMIS to safeguard 
<br/>the resources of Government maintained through the system.  Overall, the Committee commends the 
<br/>efforts  of  the  Ministries  and  Departments  who  have  progressively  implemented  the  relevant 
<br/>recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  acknowledge  the  support  from  the  Ministries  and  Departments  that 
<br/>despite  the  ongoing  COVID-19  restriction,  the  Committee  met  on  virtual  platform  to  conduct  its 
<br/>scrutiny process of the audit report.  With these words, I support the motion that is before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion, but 
<br/>before we move on to that, we will take half an hour break and we will resume and continue with the 
<br/>debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.14 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Parliament resumed at 4.56 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  as  a  Member  of  the  Public  Accounts 
<br/>Committee, speaking on the motion that is before the House today.  Firstly, Mr Speaker, Sir, I would 
<br/>like  to  confirm  the  bipartisan  Committee  recommendation  that  the  relevant  ministries  and 
<br/>departments to take note of the Committee’s recommendations on each topic and implement those 
<br/>recommendations that are yet to be fully implemented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we commend the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) for undertaking this 
<br/>exercise in terms of performing the compliance audit for the respective ministries and departments 
<br/>under this Report.  We hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be more similar exercises undertaken by 
<br/>the  OAG  to  review  the  many  happenings  in  terms  of  the  policies  that  are  being  rolled  out  by 
<br/>Government  to  ensure  whether  they  are  being  carried  out  efficiently  and  effectively  and  also  the 
<br/>intended results for the respective policies that has been rolled out by the respective ministries and 
<br/>departments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just briefly, the audit notings on the first ministry regarding the approval of commencement 
<br/></span><span>of  quarry  development  projects  and  what  has  been  highlighted  here  is  probably  the  lack  of 
<br/>communication  between  ministries  and  departments  who  give  approvals  in  terms  of  quarry 
<br/>development projects.  We note that one set of approval is given by the iTLTB and another set of 
<br/>approval has been given by the Department of Mineral Resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What has been highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report is that some of the projects have 
<br/>been performed without proper approvals being given as per requirements of the Act. Hopefully the 
<br/>ministries have taken note of the recommendations of the OAG.  The Public Accounts Committee 
<br/>have concurred with the recommendations of the OAG and we hope to see an improvement in the 
<br/>respective areas that have been highlighted by the OAG on the four ministries and departments that 
<br/>have been audited in terms of compliance, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We see the importance of having policies and procedures and SOPs  within  ministries and 
<br/>departments.  Not only do they need to have, they need to comply and ensure that it is being followed 
<br/>to the letter and the need for the OAG to come and inspect on areas where they can improve going 
<br/>forward.  I think this Report is commended and we hope that improvements on the areas that have 
<br/>been identified by the Committee along with the OAG in the future reports to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address 
<br/>this particular motion before Parliament and I also would like to thank the Committee for the work 
<br/>that  it  has  done,  in  particular  I  will  just  focus  on  Part  I  which  is  the  Commencement  of  Quarry 
<br/>Development Projects and Appointment of Certified Foreman in Charge. I think the honourable Aseri 
<br/>Radrodro has referred to this and a lot of the issues that I just proposed to give an update on what the 
<br/>Ministry has done in relation to some of the key recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the first part of the Report from Page 6 where it talks about the approval of commencement 
<br/>of Quarry Development Projects.  In terms of governance issues, there are some recommendations 
<br/>on Page 7 which states, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“With the legal clarification received whereby the Department is not required to issue 
<br/>quarry permits, for quarries to be operational, the Department should consider reviewing 
<br/>and  updating  the  relevant  legislations  including  take  the  lead  role  on  developing 
<br/>mechanisms on how collaboration between approving agencies can be improved.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>2166 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can inform Parliament that currently, the Mineral Resources Department is undertaking the 
<br/>review of the Mining Act.  At present, we have a Quarries Act and the Mining Act so under this 
<br/>review  of  the  Mining  Act,  the  quarry  operations  hopefully  will  be  merged  so  that  it  can  all  be 
<br/>managed under one hat.  So, the process for reviewing the Mining Act is something that will take us 
<br/>about a year, hopefully it will address a lot of the governance issues that have been highlighted in 
<br/>this particular Report; the various recommendations on different pages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue that I see here, one of the PAC recommendations is that the Department of 
<br/>Mineral Resources processes and criteria needs to be communicated to other relevant agencies such 
<br/>as iTLTB, Department of Lands and Department of Environment.  I can inform Parliament also that 
<br/>currently the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources has a regular meeting with iTLTB where they 
<br/>talk  about  issues  that  are  relevant  to  both  parties  including  things  like  gravel  extraction  and  also 
<br/>quarry.  So, there are those mechanisms that have been put in place - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>to ensure that there is better governance of all the quarry operations; and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>to ensure that there is better collaboration and cohesion between the different agencies that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have some part to play in managing quarries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is about meeting the mandatory requirements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for approval of quarry operations and the recommendation has been, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Department  of  Mineral  Resources  should  ensure  that  all  relevant  quarry 
<br/>documentations  are  properly  stored  and  maintained.  The  Department  should  consider 
<br/>developing  standards  for  the  content  of  quarry  files  and  verify  that  these  standards  are 
<br/>applied before approvals are given.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can inform Parliament that these recommendations have been adopted and currently there 
<br/>is a Standard Operating Procedure for quarry development that has been reviewed and adopted and 
<br/>it also includes a checklist to ensure that all necessary documents are in place before the approval 
<br/>letter is sent.  That is the recommendation that is on Page 8 of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Page 9, there are recommendations with relation to the notification on the commencement 
<br/>of Quarry Operations and here the recommendation is that the Department should consider including 
<br/>a  clause  in  its  quarry  approval  letters  stating  that  quarry  operators  are  mandated  to  provide  a 
<br/>notification letter to the Department two weeks prior to commencement of its operation with penalties 
<br/>being  clearly  outlined  for  non-compliance.    This  is  also  been  adopted  and  currently  the  current 
<br/></span><span>practice is that final vetting is conducted by the Director of Mines Office before approval letters are 
<br/></span><span>sent.  So there is that vetting process that is in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation on that same page is, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Department should consider strengthening its monitoring role as a custodian of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the quarry regulations.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  expressed  already,  this  has  been  adopted  through  the  reviewed  Standard  Operating 
<br/>Procedure being used in the Mineral Resources Department. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Page  10  of  the  Report  has  two  recommendations  with  respect  to  the 
<br/>appointment  of  foreman  and  in  particular  the  governance  of  this.  The  first  recommendation  is,  I 
<br/>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2167 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Department should expedite the creation of the database for maintaining records 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on quarryman or quarry people.”         
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  has  been  adopted  and  there  already  exists  a  register  book  for  quarry  men  or  quarry  person 
<br/>licences that are issued for new and renewal applications received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation is, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Supervisory  checks  should  be  strengthened  to  ensure  that  processes  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procedures outlined in the Quarries Act and Regulations 1939 are complied with.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  recommendation  also  has  been  adopted  and  now  we  have  a  cover  checklist  that  has  been 
<br/>developed  to  ensure  all  necessary  documents  are  in  place  before  the  quarryman’s  certificates  are 
<br/>approved by the Director of Mines or the Inspector of Mines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Page  11,  there  are  a  number  of  recommendations  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>notification  of  appointment  of  commencement  and  changes  of  Quarry  Foreman.  There  are 
<br/>recommendations about supervisory checks, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Supervisory  checks  should  be  enforced  as  the  Department  should  include  new 
<br/>clauses in the Quarry Approving Letter saying that the quarry operators are required by 
<br/>law  to  provide  a  notification  letter  to  the  Department  within  14  days  of  appointing  a 
<br/>quarryman.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another recommendation is, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When  acknowledging  the  appointment  of  the  quarryman,  the  Department  should 
<br/>include a clause in its acknowledgement letter that the quarryman is required by law to 
<br/>provide a notification letter to the Department within seven days after he or she assumes 
<br/>control and supervision of the quarry.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of those recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have been adopted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Page 13 in relation to mandatory requirements prior to issuing quarryman’s certificates, 
<br/>there are proposals, recommendations that the Department should consider maintaining separate files 
<br/>for quarryman whereby all information/documents regarding a particular quarryman is maintained 
<br/></span><span>and updated accordingly.  This is now being adopted and new hardcopy files are created for new and 
<br/></span><span>renewal of quarryman’s applications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last recommendation was that the Mineral  Resources Department should consider the 
<br/>creation  of  a  database  to  electronically  maintain  information  on  quarryman.    This  is  pending, 
<br/>currently we have an excel spreadsheet on records of quarryman in use which are saved in the Mines 
<br/>Division’s share folder database.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, however, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources is making 
<br/>a  move  towards  digitising  everything  that  it  is  doing  and  also  trying  to  make  that  information 
<br/>available online.  Now, for instance, lessees can check the status of their lease if they log into an 
<br/>application that is in place.  Over the rest of this year, there is strong emphasis in digitising everything 
<br/>that takes place in the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources and as much as possible make this 
<br/>available online so that people can view and check for themselves the status of anything that they do 
<br/>in relation to what the Ministry does. This is going to be a process that will take some time but it is 
<br/>all part of our process of providing better service to the people that we serve.

<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  to  speak  on  the  motion  by  honourable 
<br/>Maharaj. I thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts who spent numerous 
<br/>hours scrutinising the Report. We need no reminder that the Government is accountable to the people.  
<br/>We have shown and comprehend the commitment through our actions and through the promises we 
<br/>have delivered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  Government  values,  above  all,  transparency  in  the  Fijian  Civil  Service.  We  pursue 
<br/>innovative ideas to meet ever changing workplace challenges and streamline process to ensure the 
<br/>Fijian public have access to quality public services.  This process is never ending as I said yesterday 
<br/>and there is always room for improvement. The Compliance Audit Report identified some important 
<br/>areas  where  we  can  take  our  commitment  to  serve  even  further.  As  part  of  the  audit  process, 
<br/>Ministries were involved and were able to resolve many of the most pertinent issues raised in the 
<br/>Audit Report, however, this is not a one-way street we are walking, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  needs  to  match  the  trust  and  transparency  it  seeks  to 
<br/>ingratiate across Government.  As Government improves, so must the standard of auditing and that 
<br/>is something we are right to ask from this Constitutionally Independent Office.  My Government has 
<br/>made  swift  since  it  was  elected,  resolved  many  of  the  inherited  failings  of  past  leadership  in  the 
<br/></span><span>country.  We have done more than listened to concerns of members of the Fijian public.  We have 
<br/></span><span>acted on them and addressed many outstanding issues that have improved Government’s services to 
<br/>a point that is unrivalled in our independent history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The results of an efficient and well-tuned government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are reflected in the 
<br/>benefits that our people receive and the Fijian people do not have to look very far to see that my 
<br/>Government has not wavered in its commitment to them. They have witnessed in their lifetime, a 
<br/>growth in opportunities that were not afforded to past generation of Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  includes  free  education  for  primary  and  secondary  aged  children.  
<br/>Scholarship support for tertiary level, free medicine and health care assistance, improved coverage 
<br/>and outreach of social protection programmes, wide ranging assistance to vulnerable Fijians, funding 
<br/>over 47,800 micro, small and medium enterprises, increase in food and fisheries production, better 
<br/>connectivity  for  rural  and  maritime  dwellers,  improvements  in  employment  opportunities  and 
<br/>assistance and a better standard of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Audit  Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, before this august  Parliament is  a kind reminder that 
<br/>changes for the better can always be made.  It is my promise to our people that they will be made and 
<br/></span><span>we do so confidently in the progress we have already made to deliver real improvements in the lives 
<br/></span><span>of all Fijians everywhere in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, again, thank the Committee for the Report and based on those remarks, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  very  quickly  in  respect  of  the 
<br/>Government Payroll System, these were some of the matters that were identified in the Report itself.  
<br/>The Ministry of Economy’s directly uploading all bank data, files on the secured Westpac Corporate 
<br/>Online Platform.   The file is  now encrypted before it is  uploaded on the portal.   Only  authorised 
<br/>officers have access to view the status and whether the bank has processed the payment from their 
<br/>end. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  for  tax  authorities,  Sir,  the  data  is  directly  uploaded  on  this  Taxpayer  Online 
<br/>Service.  The Ministry of Economy also sourced development partner funding is currently recruiting 
<br/>a consultant for the new payroll system.  The payroll advisor will in the scope of work provide for a

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review of the Compliance Audit Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2169 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>change management process which will be a sub-set of the payroll implementation.  However, the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy is currently managing major changes in the payroll process through circulars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, adequate trainings are being provided to the whole of Government Payroll Users. 
<br/>Furthermore, quarterly user group meetings are held to discuss updates to the payroll system, follow 
<br/>up some concerns brought up by ministries and other information that the payroll team feels is crucial 
<br/>for users to be aware of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy also as part of its ongoing plans aims to establish 
<br/>service level  agreements  that segregates the responsibility between the  Ministry of Economy and 
<br/>ITC.  Furthermore,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  have  worked  with  ITC  to  ensure  policies  and 
<br/>documentations are updated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Internal controls have been put in place to strengthen the creation of employee profile in the 
<br/>payroll system, for example, if FNPF or Tax Identification Number (TIN) registration fields are not 
<br/>filled, the system will reject the creation of employee files or profiles.  In addition, the employees 
<br/>above  the  age  of  55  are  re-engaged  through  the  approval  of  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  and 
<br/>furthermore disciplined forces are outside the scope.  They have their own rules, as you would know, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following on from the Report on the core information system requirements 
<br/>and  the    implementation  of  several  recommendations  from  the  Report,  the  Fijian  Government  is 
<br/>looking to undertake a cost-benefit analysis exercise in the review of the current payroll against the 
<br/>procurement of a new payroll system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Economy sourced the development partner funding and is currently recruiting 
<br/>the consultant to undertake the exercise.  The cost-benefit analysis will take into account associated 
<br/>risks, time frames, cost impact on operations and organisation capability.  The Ministry of Economy 
<br/>keeps a record of all payroll users, the users at the agency level have limited access for viewing and 
<br/>reporting purpose only to payroll as majority of the payroll processing are centralised at the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy and of course we provide regular trainings in that respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a number of other issues that have been addressed and I think a lot 
<br/>of them have in fact been addressed by the respective ministers and I also raised generally the overall 
<br/>work that has been carried out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I want to echo the sentiments of the honourable Minister for Defence in respect of the 
<br/></span><span>current Acting Auditor-General, Sairusi Dukuno.  Since he has taken over as Acting Auditor-General, 
<br/>we have seen a significant change in the way that the Auditor-General’s Office is now working. He 
<br/>is very solution-driven, he actually comes to the entry meetings, goes to the exist meetings, works 
<br/>with the Management because afterall, the role of the Auditor-General, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to not 
<br/>only identify gaps but also to find solutions, as to how it cannot happen year in year out.  We have 
<br/>seen a significant progress in clearing the backlogs, currently they are focused on clearing Financial 
<br/>Statements for 2019 -2022, 2020-2021 and they are obviously on target to clear the backlog, very 
<br/>collaborative, very solution driven, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Professor Prasad again he is taken leave like the rest of his Members and I do not 
<br/>know we should do an audit of how many hours they actually spent in Parliament and the reason they 
<br/>are away from Parliament, Sir,. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact is, that he said “the Auditor-General must review policy decisions 
<br/>too”. They obviously do not understand the significant difference and the separation of powers: there 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a Legislature, there is an Executive and, of course, there is the Judiciary.  The Auditor-General’s 
<br/>job as prescribed by law is to scrutinise the financials, not to scrutinise policies.  He is quite explicitly 
<br/>stated in the Auditor-General’s Act.  I have noticed the way he tried to sneak that in, to say “Oh, we 
<br/>must also review policies because it has impact on finance”.  No, members of the public will go into 
<br/>Elections, they vote a particular political party into Government because they believe on the policies 
<br/>that Party will implement.  If they have been elected because they say they will do X,Y,Z they will 
<br/>as  a  responsible  Government,  elected  Government  will  carry  out  those  policies  and  the  merits  of 
<br/>those policies will be decided by the people. How that money is spent under the policy framework is 
<br/>what is scrutinised, not the policy itself, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very glad that the Acting Auditor-General has moved away from the 
<br/>shenanigans that used to take place during his predecessors’ time and we look forward to work in 
<br/>collaboration with the Auditor-General’s Office and finding solution so that we cannot come year in 
<br/>year out and discuss these matters which are not political in nature but they are actually accountable 
<br/>and transparent, choose which one you want to work on as the honourable Prime Minister said we 
<br/>are focussed on that.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank all honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who have contributed positively towards the Report. Thank you.
