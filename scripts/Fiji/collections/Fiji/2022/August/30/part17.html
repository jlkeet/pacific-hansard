<div><span>Proposed Activities of the National Trust of Fiji 
<br/>(Question No. 146/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, and Local Government 
<br/></span><span>inform Parliament on the proposed activities of the National Trust of Fiji with funds allocated 
<br/></span><span>in the 2022-2023 National Budget? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Trust  of  Fiji  is  the  custodian  for  eight  important  national 
<br/>properties vested in the National Trust by the Government and this is being done to safeguard cultural 
<br/>values,  biodiversity  and  unique  ecosystem.  The  key  biodiversity  areas  and  sites  of  national 
<br/>significance under the care of the National Trust are Sovi Basin protected area in Naitasiri Province, 
<br/>Yadua  Taba  Crested  Iguana  Sanctuary  in  Bua  Province,  Nakanacagi  Bat  Sanctuary  in  Macuata 
<br/>Province and the Garrick Memorial Forest Reserve in Namosi Province.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Trust of Fiji sites which are well known and frequently visited by the public, 
<br/>schools  and  tourists  are  the  Sigatoka  Sand  Dunes,  National  Park,  Momi  Battery  Historic  Park, 
<br/>Waisali  Reserve  and  the  Levuka  Community  Centre  Library.    These  four  sites  received 
<br/>approximately 3,000 school children and about 15,000 international and local visitors in 2019, which

<div><span>was a normal year, generating an income of approximately $130,000.  These earnings were through 
<br/>park entry fees, specific group facilitation activities, event hire, corporate team building and permit 
<br/>fees for filming.  The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of all National Trust sites to the public 
<br/>for filming, leisure, recreation, research and tourism activities for two years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these sites have a potential to generate income but more work needs to be 
<br/>done.  We would like to turn these sites into a better facility so that more students can go there for 
<br/>their excursion trip and also we can encourage the general public to visit these sites.  In this financial 
<br/>year, the National Trust of Fiji received $550,000 to rebuild and promote heritage tourism and for 
<br/>better management of these sites.  The key objective is to assist the National Trust of Fiji to transition 
<br/>from a Government dependent institution into a financially sustainable organisation as we see in the 
<br/>rest of the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $90,000 has been allocated to improve visitor infrastructure at the Sigatoka 
<br/>Sand  Dunes,  National  Park,  Momi  Battery  Historic  Park,  Waisali  Reserve  and  the  Levuka 
<br/>Community  Centre.    A  marketing  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  develop  Marketing  and 
<br/>Merchandising Plan for implementation at all National Trust sites.  This initiative will rebrand and 
<br/>promote these heritage sites as vibrant places for education, tourism and research with an opportunity 
<br/></span><span>to create further employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $35,000 has been allocated to develop and digitise the online National Trust 
<br/>Heritage database.  The database will be available online for public access, knowledge and awareness 
<br/>of  Fiji’s  heritage.    An  advanced  technological  web  based  software  called  Arches  specifically 
<br/>designed for heritage, which is of international standards will be used to promote best practice and 
<br/>data sharing and protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An additional $40,000 has been allocated for the feasibility assessment and implementation 
<br/>strategy for generating revenue from forest areas managed under the National Trust.  This will include 
<br/>assessment  and  requirements  for  actual  carbon  trading  estimates  assessment  and  the  feasibility 
<br/>structures for payment for ecosystem services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $63,230 is allocated to undertake national consultation on the new strategic 
<br/>direction for the National Trust of Fiji.  The allocation of $321,770 is to continue management of 
<br/>eight  National  Trust  properties  for  public  access  and  enjoyment,  and  also  to  support  the  various 
<br/>conservation actions, for example, Biodiversity in invasive species Research at Yadua Taba Crested 
<br/>Iguana Sanctuary and Waisali Reserve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultation surveys and research needs to be conducted for the management plan for the Bat 
<br/>Sanctuary, Training and Implementation of the Special Monitoring and Reporting to for the National 
<br/>Trust  of  Fiji  Rangers.    Finally,  consultation  workshops,  training  and  implementation  of  three 
<br/>reforestation demonstration areas with the National Trust of Fiji properties.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Trust  budget  for  this  financial  year  enables  the  Trust  to 
<br/>undertake its legislative responsibilities for the protection and preservation of the national sites under 
<br/>its care and also to focus in a way that they can start generating more revenue and become financially 
<br/>stable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  The next  question (Question No. 147/2022),  I have  allowed for it to  be 
<br/>carried over to tomorrow because the Honourable Minister is unwell this afternoon and is unable to 
<br/>be here.  Therefore, that question be carried over to tomorrow’s question time.

<div><span> Progress of the Bridge Replacement Programme  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 148/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, Meteorological Services, Lands and 
<br/>Mineral  Resources  update  Parliament  on  the  progress  of  the  Bridge  Replacement 
<br/>Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to respond to this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question and I thank the honourable George Vegnathan for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bridges have a special place in transportation infrastructure because they are the link between 
<br/>different parts or different places with other places and the structures of the bridges that we have are 
<br/>for the purpose to carry the traffic loads of the highway, crossing any obstacle in performing effective 
<br/>communication between two destinations.  Sir, FRA has been caring for over 1,200 bridges on our 
<br/>road  network  and  like  the  roads,  bridges  age  and  they  also  require  a  programme  of  regular 
<br/>maintenance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of upgrading and replacement of bridges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the FRA came into 
<br/>existence, a total of 52 bridges have been replaced and hundreds continue to receive repairs until they 
<br/>get replaced because we cannot replace all the bridges at once, so sometimes we just have to keep 
<br/>repairing them until it gets time for them to become replaced.  Sir, FRA has now invested around 
<br/>more than $450 million for the past nine years for the bridges and jetties’ maintenance and renewals 
<br/>and currently FRA has already completed 14 bridges and 10 are to be completed by 2022 and three 
<br/>to be completed by the Year 2023 and all these amount to more than $100 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just for the benefit of the Members of Parliament, some of those bridges are central critical 
<br/>bridges in the Central Division included the Tamavua i Wai Bridge completed in 2020, Waidamu 
<br/>Bridge completed in 2021, the Viria Bridge completed this year, Waidra Bridge completed this year, 
<br/>Wainawi Bridge currently in progress, the Waidalice Bridge currently in progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Toga  Modular  Bridge  is  a  bridge  where  the  contract  had  been  awarded  but  had  to  be 
<br/>terminated and retendered out.  The Nasese Bridge is currently being developed as we speak.  That 
<br/>is part of the Queen Elizabeth Drive Project that is beautifying the shores of Suva, the Suva Pony 
<br/>Club Crossing and the Beqa Steep Hill Project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Western Division, some of the bridges have included the following:

<br/>Vunikawakawa Modular Bridge scheduled also for completion this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So those are, Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the major bridges that FRA has been working on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Around $67.6 million was allocated for the upgrade and replacement of bridges and crossings.  
<br/>This included the renewal of bridges and crossings.  There are 14 bridges in the Central Eastern Division, 
<br/></span><span>20 in the Western Division and 20 in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $300,000 was allocated for the rehabilitation of the Vunimasei Access Road 
<br/>in Legalega, Nadi.  There has also been money allocated for jetties across different parts of Fiji and 
<br/>also FRA has set in place a plan for 40 bridges and 30 jetties nationwide.   So currently, the design 
<br/>work is scheduled to be done on these 40 bridges across Fiji and what FRA has done is that, it has 
<br/>looked at all the bridges that need to be carried out and has prioritised them - Priority 1, Priority 2, 
<br/>Priority 3 and Priority 4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bridges for Priority 1 are now in the planning stage and include the following:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is  also  another 60 rural  bridges  that the FRA is  looking at  right  now, it is  awaiting 
<br/>proposals from bridge suppliers for the design supply and construction of these bridges.  So in terms 
<br/>of bridges Mr. Speaker, Sir, FRA has looked at the whole number of bridges that we have in Fiji, 
<br/>everyone wants their bridge to be fixed using its objective criteria.  It has identified the ones that we 
<br/></span><span>have  had  to  fix  first  and  then  prioritise  the  others  that  need  to  be  fixed  and  they  all  fall  in  line 
<br/></span><span>according to the prioritisation that FRA has done for the whole network.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.

<div><span>Reduction of Motor Vehicle Accidents  
<br/>(Question No. 149/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and Transport inform 
<br/>Parliament on the progress made by the Land Transport Authority in reducing motor vehicle 
<br/>accidents? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Sir, 
<br/>vehicle accidents and road fatalities are actually a global phenomenon and it is based on some data 
<br/>from WHO approximately 1.3 million people actually die each year as a result of road traffic crashes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2175 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally road traffic injuries are the leading cause for children and young adults between the 
<br/>ages  of  5  years  to  29  years  and  over  about  3,500  people  actually  die  daily  on  the  roads  and  an 
<br/>estimated 50 million injuries each year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I wish to say that road safety is everyone’s responsibility and 
<br/>thus the prevention of vehicle accidents and road fatalities is of utmost importance to everyone, to 
<br/>all of us as parents as teachers, as just adults.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a global recognition of this particular road safety concerns, the UN General Assembly in 
<br/>2010 declared 2011-2020 as a decade of action for road safety worldwide. So, in September, 2020 
<br/>UNGA adopted resolution on Improving Global Road Safety and proclaiming the Decade of Action 
<br/>for Road Safety 2021 right  through  to  2030.   It  is  quite  an ambitious target,  Sir, it is  a target  for 
<br/>preventing  at  least  50  percent  of  road  traffic  deaths  and  injuries  by  2030.    So,  the  World  Health 
<br/>Organisation (WHO) and the UN Regional Commissions in cooperation with other partners in the 
<br/>UN Road Safety collaboration, have developed a Global Plan for the Decade of Action which was 
<br/>released in  October 2021.  The reason why  I say this, Sir, is  because Fiji  being a  member of the 
<br/>United Nation has actually automatically adopted this particular Global Action Plan, to pave the way 
<br/>forward for road safety and the reduction of road accidents and road fatalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  successful  reduction  of  accidents  and  fatalities  is  not  just  the  LTA,  it  is  not  just  one 
<br/>particular body, it is only made possible with the contribution of all Government agencies and that 
<br/>ensures safe roads, which means safe drivers, post roads safety education, accident data and research, 
<br/>traffic law enforcement, post-accident care and these thematic areas will comprise the national efforts 
<br/>and strategies to reduce those road accidents and fatalities in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although the question is posed directly to the LTA, responsibility of road safety and reduction 
<br/>of  accidents  is  only  possible  through  the  contribution  of  all  the  agencies  such  as  the  Fiji  Roads 
<br/>Authority (FRA) to  ensure safe infrastructure, Fiji  Police Force to  ensure  safe drivers and proper 
<br/>traffic management, the Ministry of Education with the dissemination of road safety education and 
<br/>the Ministry of Health with proper post accidents care.   It is only made possible through a whole of 
<br/>Government approach, Mr. Speaker. Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst having a call of Government approach is adopting whole of nation approach which 
<br/>are actually includes the main stakeholders and road users, the Fijian public also is quite critical in 
<br/>all of these.  This will ultimately, lead to success in actually reducing these accidents.   When a person 
<br/>sits behind the wheel, Mr. Speaker, that person is actually responsible for his or her action and when 
<br/></span><span>he is crossing the road, they are responsible for their behaviour.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the LTA Act, Section 8, it provides the functions for the LTA which is align with goals 
<br/>and objectives for road safety.  In Fiji, the statistics show that road accidents have actually dropped 
<br/>over the years.  In 2017, we had 3,276 accidents recorded; in 2021 this number decreased by 19.3 
<br/>percent to 2,643.  This is an average of four percent reduction per year over the five years.  So, despite 
<br/>been  slightly  lower  than  the  target  of  five  percent  annually  from  2011,  Fiji  actually  achieved  a 
<br/>reduction of five percent in 2012.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we also need to realise the main cause of accidents in Fiji includes 
<br/>speeding,  drunk  driving,  careless  driving  and  also  pedestrians  that  maybe  at  fault.    Despite  the 
<br/>reducing numbers are main causes of these road accidents and fatalities are  actually  attributed to 
<br/>human  era  and  therefore,  as  I  said  earlier,  it  actually  incumbent  that  road  safety  is  everyone’s 
<br/>responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in line with Government reforms to build road safety, this Government established the

<div><span>Accident Compensation Commission of Fiji (ACCF) in 2017, to ensure compensation must be paid 
<br/>for  any  personal  injury  or  death  suffered  by  any  person,  as  a  result  of  accident  in  Fiji  lump  sum 
<br/>payment maybe under the no fault scheme or a lump sum awarded by the Court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, LTA has a twofold approach on this in reducing road accidents and ultimately, 
<br/>minimising these fatalities and this include awareness raising and education of members of the public 
<br/>through various platforms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, LTA also carries out Defensive Driving Course (DDC) to introduce drivers to safe driving 
<br/>practices and through our enforcement, LTA is also committed in ensuring the drivers are cautioned, 
<br/>warned and issued with Traffic Infringement Notices, to ensure safe driving habits and compliances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, LTA also carries out joined operations with the Fiji Police Force, especially during the 
<br/>festive  season  to  increase  visibility  and  to  deter  offenders  in  ensuring  that  we  have  a  safe 
<br/>infrastructure also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the FRA is working on improving 30 different black spots around the country; 
<br/>40 kilometres of Route Action Plan in place, for example, the overtaking lanes, et cetera, that have 
<br/></span><span>been done; 30 village treatments that have been completed, 60 mass action plans, 600 kilometres of 
<br/></span><span>major roads have been marked and delineated and traffic management plans implemented on four 
<br/>major and six smaller rounds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to take this opportunity to pass on my condolences because there 
<br/>were some fatalities over the weekend in Kasavu and other parts of Fiji and we send our condolences 
<br/>to the families of the deceased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Sir, I must emphasise to make our roads safe, it is everyone’s responsibility; not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just the Land Transport Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Block Rezoning Exercise 
<br/>(Question No. 150/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, Tourism and  Transport update 
<br/>Parliament on the Block Rezoning Exercise that the Ministry is currently undertaking and its 
<br/></span><span>implications on property owners within Towns and Cities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the question.  Sir, 
<br/>I would just like to begin by stating the definition of block rezoning in the context of town planning.  
<br/>The concept basically involves applying a continuous zoning along a strip of land that commonly 
<br/>fronts on to a thoroughfare or cycle and the pre-requisite being that, there are activities of the same 
<br/>nature already being undertaken within that particular area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  particular  block  rezoning  initiative  is  a  strategy  that  was  introduced  by  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  to  reform  the  outdated  and  bureaucratic  steps  associated  with  the  Town  Planning 
<br/>Scheme amendment process.  The ultimate objective is to provide Fijians with a more streamlined 
<br/>and flexible approach when it comes to yielding a highest and best use of their property.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  amendments  to  the  Town  Planning  Act  now  empowers  the  Permanent  Secretary 
<br/>responsible for Town Planning to immediately approve block rezoning of identified areas within the 
<br/>town boundary and this include areas that have already gone significant changes and development 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pattern and trends indicating significant growth or commercial development in particular.  And the 
<br/>areas that have been identified have been done in consultation with the Director of Town &amp; Country 
<br/>Planning and the relevant Municipal Council and after a thorough analysis on the rezoning patterns 
<br/>that was conducted by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  purpose  of  the  block  rezoning  is  to  enable  property  owners  within  these  areas  to 
<br/>immediately lodge their building plans and commence their commercial development, so previously 
<br/>individual  property  owners  would  require  to  lodge  an  application  for  rezoning  to  the  Municipal 
<br/>Council and be subjected to the detailed scheme amendment process which was very archaic, we are 
<br/>doing it with the Ministry before they could lodge their building application and commencement with 
<br/>their respective developments.  These, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will no longer be required, these are benefits 
<br/>associated  with  the  block  rezoning  initiative  for  property  owners  such  as  being  located  in  a  pre-
<br/>dominantly commercialized area which, in turn, increases their property values and enable them to 
<br/>ultimately fetch a higher selling price for their properties, if they wish to sell. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously,  those  who  intend  to  operate  commercial  businesses  will  be  vying  to  purchase 
<br/>these  properties  with  an  added  advantage  of  not  having  to  convert  the  use  of  those  properties  to 
<br/>commercial, as this is done already through this particular exercise, saving considerable time and 
<br/></span><span>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Property owners, Mr. Speaker, within these block rezoning areas now have greater flexibility 
<br/>with respect to their particular properties, however, property owners who wish to maintain their lots 
<br/>as residential can do so without any changes to their towns or city rates and that change in town rates 
<br/>from  residential  to  commercial  will  only  be  applied  once  the  commercial  activity  is  formalized 
<br/>through a building approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal Councils will also be monitoring this in accordance with the respective laws and 
<br/>bylaws that are already in place pertaining to rates.  In terms of the change that you may be required 
<br/>with respect to the Ministry of Lands or iTaukei Lands Trust Board (iTLTB), we will be doing this 
<br/>in consultation with the Ministry of Lands and iTLTB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Ministry through the Permanent Secretary’s Office 
<br/>has actually approved block rezoning areas for commercial blocks with conditions in the following 
<br/>11 municipal boundaries as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>City of Suva; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Nasinu Town; 
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nausori Town; 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Sigatoka Town; 
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi Town; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>9.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>Labasa Town; and 
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Savusavu Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>City of Lautoka; 
<br/>Ba Town; 
<br/>Tavua Town;  
<br/>Rakiraki Town; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the interest of time, I will not go and read out all the specific areas which have been block 
<br/>rezoned, however, in particular, in relation to the legal description of these lots and areas, these block 
<br/>rezoning applied to can be viewed by the public at the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, Tourism and 
<br/>Transport at Level 3, Civic Tower.  The general public can also view the same on the Ministry website 
<br/>at www.mcttt and learn more.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2,744 lots are part of the block rezoning around the country. Nadi Town has recorded the 
<br/>most number of block rezoned properties standing at about 891, followed by Suva which is 664 lots 
<br/>block rezoned.  That is a substantial increase in the value of people’s properties just by getting that 
<br/>done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also to promote commercial activities in the town of Rakiraki and Tavua, we have rezoned 
<br/>426 lots and 125 lots respectively, just for commercial purposes.  Whilst in the Northern towns of 
<br/>Savusavu and Labasa, 105 and 48 lots have been blocked rezoned respectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this reform, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also ensure that from a planning perspective 
<br/>the strategic planning documents such as outdated Town Planning Schemes are all updated and by 
<br/>doing this, we are not only increasing efficiency but working actually smart.  The Ministry through 
<br/>the Office of the Permanent Secretary responsible for Town Planning will continue to assess these 
<br/>areas with respect to block rezoning, to change the use in an effort not only save time and save money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the programme, the Ministry is committed to creating more opportunities also for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investment and actually construction in Fiji now and also for the future.

<div><span>Roll Out of the $60 Million Inflation Mitigation Assistance  
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 151/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development update Parliament on the roll out 
<br/>of the $60 million inflation mitigation assistance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Member for the question.  Sir, in the Budget that has recently been approved by Parliament, we had 
<br/>allocated $60 million to shield the most vulnerable Fijians from the rapid price increases including 
<br/>certain commodities, for example fuel.  Of course, this has been precipitated by the fact that we had 
<br/>a  one  in  a  hundred  year  event  COVID-19  affected  supply  chains,  et  cetera  but  that  has  been 
<br/>exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine War. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, there has been a shortage of, for example access to fuel, wheat, et cetera.  To help 
<br/>cushion the impact of inflation, inflation in certain countries like USA is about 8 percent to 9 percent, 
<br/></span><span>UK has similar rates of inflation, Fiji is now seeing the inflation rate of about 5 percent, whereas 
<br/></span><span>other trading partners have got higher inflation rates.  I think the only one that has got the lowest 
<br/>inflation rate until a few months ago was Japan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as a result of helping cushion the impact of inflation, Government will be paying a lump 
<br/>sum  payment  of  $180  to  families  for  six  months,  this  includes  tertiary  students,  social  welfare 
<br/>recipients,  those  who  receive  After  Care  Fund,  government  pensioners  and  of  course,  general 
<br/>children that are also below the age of school and school going age and all students in schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, just in respect of the pensioners, After Care and Social Welfare recipients will receive a 
<br/>direct  additional top  up  of $180 to  their account on 31st August,  2022  which is  tomorrow.   This 
<br/>payment date is being aligned to the next pension payment and no application is required from this 
<br/>group of beneficiaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  all  welfare  recipients  will  receive  a  direct  additional  top-up  of  $180  to  their 
<br/>accounts on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September, aligned to  the next  welfare payment  date.  To make it easy for them, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>social  welfare  recipients  are  not  required  to  submit  any  kind  of  application  as  with  those  with 
<br/>aftercare  and  Government  pensioners  because  we  already  have  the  details.    Approximately,  $18 
<br/>million will be paid out to more than 90,000 social welfare recipients and around 8,000 Government 
<br/>pensioners and aftercare recipients.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All registered tertiary students who are already under TELS and Toppers Scholarship will be 
<br/>paid a lump sum of $180, again, on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September.  Sir, TELS loans service will facilitate the payment 
<br/>on behalf of the Ministry of Economy.  As such, more than 13,000 TELS and Toppers recipients will 
<br/>be assisted with approximately $2.4 million and they get paid that next week.  Again, they do not 
<br/>need to apply because we already have the details.  Tertiary institutions covered by TELS include 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific, FNU, University of Fiji, Corpus Christi Teachers College, Fulton 
<br/>College, Sangam Institute, Pacific Flying School and Advance Aviation Training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those students who are in tertiary studies and who are currently not on the TELS programme 
<br/>or are not Toppers - private students, can also apply online through the Online Inflation Mitigation 
<br/>Application  System.    These  students  will  be  required  to  provide  their  personal  details,  mobile 
<br/>numbers and evidence of active enrolment registration in one of the universities to be eligible.  The 
<br/>payment  to  them  will  be  made  through  M-PAiSA  or  My  Cash,  depending  on  the  mobile  phone 
<br/></span><span>number.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have already received a total of 5,839 applications from such tertiary students who are 
<br/>not on TELS or Toppers on the online platform as of 29</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022.  All the applications received 
<br/>as of now are currently at the verification stage.  We have to verify that, look at their TIN number 
<br/>and, indeed, verify whether they fall within this category over household of less than $50,000, and 
<br/>of course, any other details that may be applicable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as announced in the Budget also, the Government will provide support on 
<br/>per child basis for families who earn less than $50,000 in combined annual household income.  This 
<br/>is applicable to them.  In total, parents will receive $180 per child over six month period.  Families 
<br/>with children in Year 13 or below who currently receive subsidised transportation assistance, a total 
<br/>of 91,000 students, can fill out a simple manual form that calls for My Cash and M-PAiSA account 
<br/>details to receive assistance.  As these students already qualify for transportation assistance, there is 
<br/>no need for additional income verification by the parents or indeed by the school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, parents can also apply online through the Inflation Mitigation Application 
<br/>System, which is now open for applications which will close on 30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2022.  Manual forms 
<br/></span><span>are also available at all schools since 15</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022 and can be filled out and submitted to the 
<br/></span><span>child’s school.  In the interest of time, a deployment of funds, families are strongly encouraged to 
<br/>apply  online  for  assistance.    Payments  for  these  will  begin  on  1</span><span>st</span><span>  September,  2022,  subsequent 
<br/>payments for late applications will be made out fortnightly basis starting on 15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2022 
<br/>after 1</span><span>st</span><span> September followed by 30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 14</span><span>th</span><span> October and 31</span><span>st</span><span> October.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those families earning below $50,000 but whose children currently do not 
<br/>receive  transportation  assistance  can  also  apply  for  Inflation  Mitigation  Assistance  through  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education through the same manual application form at schools or indeed apply online.  
<br/>The manual application form will gather details of parents and obtain phone numbers of payment.  
<br/>Students will need to get the form filled in by the parents and teachers and heads of schools will be 
<br/>responsible to upload the details of the form on the FEMIS.  It is important that parents and teachers 
<br/>and the heads of schools declare that they are providing the correct information to avoid any abuse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, parents of children who are below Year 1 or not attending school can either 
<br/>apply through the Online Inflation Mitigation Application System or through manual forms available 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at Legal Aid Offices throughout Fiji, and the nearest schools and the schools have also agreed, so if 
<br/>the child is three years old, there is no Legal Aid Office, they can go to the nearest school and the 
<br/>schools will actually accept those forms.  The category of these applicants completed manual forms 
<br/>are to be submitted to the nearest school or Legal Aid Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage, only parents are permitted to submit the applications as of now 
<br/>to avoid any abuse of the initiative.  For those in the maritime islands with no access to M-PAiSA or 
<br/>My Cash, they also have the option to receive their $180 assistance through their nearest Post Office 
<br/>agency in applying on the manual application form.  We are in the process of signing an agreement 
<br/>with the Fiji Post Office where they will facilitate the payment for that and they are charging us a 
<br/>lesser rate.  All applications will close on 30</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2022 and final payments will be paid out 
<br/>on 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of today, a total of 20,571 applications have been received for the online 
<br/>inflation mitigation application system and these applications are currently at the verification stage.  
<br/>A total of 100,476 applications have been received by schools as of 26</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022 through the 
<br/>hard  copy  manual  application  forms.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  has  already  assessed  these 
<br/>applications and payment for this batch will be made this Thursday, 1</span><span>st</span><span> of September in two days’ 
<br/></span><span>time.   Sir, we will be paying out this week and next week $38 million for 210,000 Fijian students, 
<br/></span><span>tertiary students, social welfare recipients, pensioners and aftercare fund recipients.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen, in fact I was just sharing with the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>yesterday, a surge of parents now going to all the BDM offices because a lot of parents in fact, you 
<br/>know some of them are very late in registering the birth certificate for their children so they are all 
<br/>going across, getting the birth certificates registered and of course that is free.  We offer that for free 
<br/>in terms of extraction of birth certificates and they are registering obviously to make the applications, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just on that note, I also would like to highlight, as we have said repeatedly 
<br/>in Parliament that all of these instances of inflation and the import inflation, Sir, is in fact out of our 
<br/>control.    Government  can  only  control  things  as  they  land  in  Fiji  where  we  have  price  control 
<br/>measures.  As announced by the FCCC today, Sir, the price of fuel (on the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of September which is 
<br/>this Thursday) for motor spirit, it is dropping by 55 cents a litre.  In other words, it is $3.67 at the 
<br/>moment, by the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of September, it will go down to $3.12.   Premix is currently at $3.47 but it will 
<br/>go down to $2.93 cents from Thursday.  Kerosene is currently $2.89 and it will go down to $2.45.  
<br/>Diesel which is currently $3.61 a litre, will go down to $3.09 - all of them are dropping significantly.  
<br/></span><span>Motor Spirit by 55 cents a litre, premix by 54 cents a litre, kerosene by 44 cents a litre and diesel by 
<br/></span><span>52 cents a litre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), the 4.5 kilograms cylinder currently costs 
<br/>$16.63, but it will drop down to $16.13 or a drop of 50 cents. The 12 kilograms cylinder currently at 
<br/>$44.35, will drop down to $43.01 – a drop of $1.34.  Bulk gas, Sir, is $3.42 and it will go down to 
<br/>$3.32, a drop of 10 cents.  Autogas which is $2.28 currently will go down to $2.21 which is seven 
<br/>cents.  So, as we can see, Sir, this is all subject to international market conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we saw that a barrel of oil costs about US$120.00 just a few weeks ago.  Today, it is 
<br/>sitting at US$89 a barrel.  So November, December traditionally is when the price of fuel goes up 
<br/>because there is winter in the Northern Hemisphere in Europe, USA, Canada et cetera.  There is more 
<br/>demand for energy so the price traditionally goes up.  If you read the market news, Iran is about to 
<br/>sign a deal which hopefully will get across the line with USA and Europe.  Should that agreement 
<br/>get across the line, it means that the Iranians have a lot of oil that they have got stocked or piled up.  
<br/>If that agreement gets on line, they will be able to push that supply into the market.  If they do that 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>2181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then suddenly the market is fluxed with oil and we will expect the prices to drop significantly. Of 
<br/>course there is always machinations behind the scenes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some oil companies currently are making a handsome profit, some countries are making a 
<br/>handsome profit - they do not want that to happen because they are making the amount of money 
<br/>they are making in 24 hours, the amount of money we actually have in our GDP annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have said, it is all subject to market prices.  Unfortunately, when I 
<br/>said this yesterday and today, when honourable Prasad was saying that people should be allowed to 
<br/>think for themselves and I said that we know that they were going around and saying that they will 
<br/>bring down the price of fuel, they will bring down the price of cooking oil, they will bring down the 
<br/>price of flour - these politicians are actually going and doing that.  They are hoodwinking members 
<br/>of the public.  They cannot do that.  This is complete vindication of what we have been saying because 
<br/>as I said, and I would like to reiterate that point, if it was within our control and because the elections 
<br/>are there, we would drop the price of everything so people can vote for us but we cannot do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  can  do  is  provide  for  inflation  mitigation  which  is 
<br/>precisely what we are doing and we will see all these Fijians who are more vulnerable and the children 
<br/></span><span>who get vulnerable, we will be paying out $60 million in the next couple of weeks, Sir.  Thank you.
