<br/>OF HIGH RISK MINISTRIES/DEPARTMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  That Parliament debates the Review of the Audit Report on the Follow up of High 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Risk Ministries/Departments which was tabled on 6th April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; at the outset, 
<br/>I take this opportunity to speak on the motion for debate on the review of the Audit Report on the 
<br/>Follow Up of High Risk Ministries and Departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Review Report focused on the outcomes on the follow up audits that were carried out 
<br/></span><span>by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  and  audit  recommendations  provided  in  2017  of  High  Risk 
<br/></span><span>Ministries/Departments.  Sir the follow up audit that were carried out during the audit of 2017–2018 
<br/>Agency Financial Statements.  The following reports and agencies were covered: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  General  Administration,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and 
<br/>Natural Disaster Management and the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force; 
<br/>Under Social Services Sector, Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts, Ministry of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation; 
<br/>Under Economic Sector which includes the Ministry for Agriculture; and  
<br/>Under the Infrastructure sector, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  had  examined  the  extent  and  the  progress  of  implementation  of  the  audit 
<br/>recommendation made by the respective Ministries and Departments that were highlighted above.  
<br/>The Committee noted that these detail status update was done on a follow up audit for the eight high 
<br/>risk agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commended those Ministries and Departments’ efforts and progress on the 
<br/>improvements made on their systems and processes to address the internal control issues that were 
<br/>highlighted in 2017 audit.  The recommendations that were yet to be implemented in the audit report 
<br/>have been progressively implemented by the eight respective Ministries and Departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of the above, the respective Ministries and Departments have undertaken necessary 
<br/>actions to fully implement the remaining recommendations.  To take a snapshot of the progress from 
<br/>each entity, summary is as follows. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF):  The follow up audit of recommendation of RFMF 
<br/>was carried out on 11</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2019.  From then till to date a lot has been done by RFMF, for example, 
<br/>all the recommendations for the issue on the anomalies in the Main Trust Fund for the Engineers 
<br/>Project Fund Account have been fully implemented and monitoring mechanisms have been put in 
<br/>place by RFMF not to be repeated in future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  Risk  Management  Framework,  the  RFMF  has  confirmed  through  a  written 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response to the Committee that they were developing one which should have finalised by August, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2021.  Also,  it  is  important  to  note  that  those  recommendations  that  were  categorised  as  partially 
<br/>implemented by the Auditor-General will be addressed by the Internal Audit Charter which has been 
<br/>developed and currently in a stage of being endorsed by the Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Police Force: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted audit issues raised in the accounts 
<br/>of the Fiji Police Force and we commend the response received with regards to the Audit findings 
<br/>that were raised.  Sir, for the anomalies noted in the Revolving Fund Account, the Force confirmed 
<br/>that  the  RFA  has  been  reduced  from  $102,376.91  as  at  July  2017  to  $6,908.69  in  July  2018  and 
<br/>efforts and resources have been put in place to further reduce the balance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, on the irregularities in the Operating Trust Fund Account the Fiji Police Force has 
<br/>made it clear that its analysis that there were no loss of Government funds but rather misallocation 
<br/>between 2007 and 2015 were identified which soon the Force will seek approval from the Minister 
<br/>for Economy to have this long outstanding previous years, balances written off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Agriculture:  It is pleasing to note that all audit recommendations for the year 
<br/>2017 have been fully implemented and currently there are no outstanding issues with the Minister 
<br/>for  Agriculture  as  reported  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General.    It  was  further  noted  that  the 
<br/>Ministry  has  recognised  its  organisational  structure  in  order  to  ensure  a  smooth  flow  of 
<br/>communication and a well function monitoring mechanism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has also recruited the Head of Finance and the Principal Economic Planning 
<br/>Officer to lead the Monitoring Unit and they are serious in addressing its internal control issues. Also 
<br/>noted that a Post Implementation Review (PIR) mechanism has been implemented by the Ministry 
<br/>for all the projects and initiatives going forward with respective functional divisions responsible for 
<br/>performing this review three months after the programme completion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Committee was informed that the Monitoring and Evaluation Team will conduct an 
<br/>independent review of PIR, assess the programme’s efficacy and make recommendations for changes 
<br/>or  improvements.  These  have  been  included  in  the  key  control  action  list  and  a  monthly  review 
<br/>progress has been established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also noted that under the Finance Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, a new Compliance 
<br/>and Governance section has been established. The Manager Compliance and Governance will be in 
<br/>charge of developing the Ministry’s governance plan. This section will be in charge of developing 
<br/>the  Ministry’s  governance  plan.    This  section  will  be  in  charge  of  ensuring  that  all  audit 
<br/>recommendations are executed and that they do not reoccur in future - all of which will be monitored 
<br/>within the governance structure.  The Manager Compliance and Governance position was expected 
<br/>to be filled by 31st December, 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a positive note, the Ministry of Agriculture has established a Compliance Review Team 
<br/>which is similar to an Audit Committee and the audit recommendations for 2017, 2018 and 2019 
<br/>have been implemented.   It  is  important to  note  that Ministry of Agriculture has strengthened its 
<br/>internal control and measures are in place and these have rectified all those issues that were raised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Education:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Ministry has put in place measures to address 
<br/>the  recommendations  that  are  partially  implemented.  That  is  for  the  recommendation  on 
<br/>underutilisation of capital expenditure budget which was partially implemented has been actioned 
<br/>and  Minister  for  Education  is  working  with  the  Minister  of  Economy  to  ensure  that  all  financial 
<br/>requirements, guidelines are met and future capital projects are implemented on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendations on all capital project submissions are through Public Sector Investment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme  process  and  consider  including  the  Minister’s  initiatives  allocations  in  their  Budget 
<br/>submission has been fully implemented by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendation on the Building Grant has also been fully implemented in which they 
<br/>should only release building grants to schools which have fully complied with the capital grants for 
<br/>non-Government  school  policies.    It  is  important  to  note  that  on  the  recommendation  for  the 
<br/>finalisation of financial statement, the Ministry of Education has set strict deadlines on all its critical 
<br/>deliverables  including  the  submission  of  financial  statements  and  this  has  been  reflected  in  the 
<br/>Individual Work Plans (IWPs) for the Finance Section staff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Health and Medical Services:  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the progress made by 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  at  the  moment,  the  Ministry  is  reviewing  and 
<br/>strengthening  its  internal  processes.    Therefore,  the  Senior  Accounts  Officer  Audit  added 
<br/>responsibility is to carry out a follow-up on the implementation of relevant recommendations in the 
<br/>Finance Section and other respective Units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services:  It is pleasing to note that the Ministry 
<br/>of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services had set up an Audit Committee in the 2021 financial 
<br/></span><span>year to review the audit findings and collate the Ministry’s information in regards to the issues raised.  
<br/></span><span>Also noted is that there is a monitoring and evaluation team set up under the new Strategic Planning 
<br/>Unit which monitors progress of individual departments against the Government targets in line with 
<br/>the approved processes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the implementation of recommendations, it has been noted that the issue on the 
<br/>anomalies  in  reporting  of  TMAs  has  been  fully  implemented.    The  FEA  Grid  and  house  wiring 
<br/>refunds in the Energy Trust Account has also been fully implemented.  The issue with P2P listing 
<br/>not regularly updated and reconciled with the General Ledger has also been fully implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue on the delay in filling of vacant positions, the Committee was advised that the 
<br/>recommendation  has  been  progressively  implemented  by  86  percent,  whilst  14  percent  has  been 
<br/>evaluated  for  filling  and  reprioritisation  for  new  positions.    This  process  is  currently  in  the 
<br/>consultation process between the Ministry of Infrastructure, the Ministry of Civil Service and the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy, and this should be finalised soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the issue on Internal Control Deficiency in Inventory Management  – GSS, the 
<br/>issue  has  been  addressed  with  the  recommendation  being  fully  implemented  as  detailed  in  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry’s response to the Committee.  Further, for projects on hold due to land consent, the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>has responded that the project has been completed in the Year 2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  Main  Trust  Fund  Receipts  not  used  for  Solar  Home  Systems,  the  Committee  was 
<br/>informed that the Ministry is progressively implementing the recommendations, that is to consult the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy for the utilisation of funds for rural electrification projects.  It is pleasing to 
<br/>note  that  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  has  put  in  place  measures  to  fully  implement  those 
<br/>recommendations  that  are  recorded  as  partially  implemented,  and  this  has  been  actioned  by  the 
<br/>Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Ministry of Infrastructure and Meteorological Services has addressed all of the 
<br/>recommendations made, which brings a total of 20/20 (100 percent) recommendations implemented, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation:    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  finally,  this 
<br/>Ministry has put in place its 2021-2022 Costed Operational Plan as a measure to guide the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in the implementation of those recommendations that are recorded as partially implemented or not 
<br/>implemented at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The implementation of the 12 recommendations, as well as the Ministry’s Operational Plan 
<br/>has  been  monitored  by  the  Executive  Support  Unit.    It  is  pleasing  to  note  that  majority  of  those 
<br/>recommendations have been fully implemented with the rest progressively in the verge of being fully 
<br/>implemented as planned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall,  the  Committee  commends  the  efforts  of  those  Ministries  and  Departments 
<br/>highlighted in this Report as high risk, for putting in place measures to improve their internal control 
<br/>processes, as that will address all other audit issues that may arise in future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I thank you for the opportunity to speak on the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Mr. Speaker, in the debate yesterday, I talked about how 
<br/>we  have  fully  implemented  eight  of  those  recommendations  and  partially  implemented  eight 
<br/></span><span>recommendations.    As  you  are  aware,  when  this  was  actually  done,  there  were  only  three 
<br/></span><span>recommendations that were fully implemented, so we have moved on from there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will not go back to what I had discussed yesterday, but suffice to say that some 
<br/>of the reasons why we have been able to do that is, No. 1, is the improvement in our internal processes 
<br/>and, secondly, the Open Merit Recruitment system that we have in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This has actually ensured that we brought capable people in to our Ministry, especially into 
<br/>the administration and financial area, to actually ensure that we have due diligence in the work that 
<br/>is done.  I have been very pleased to meet some of our new staff, a lot of them have come from the 
<br/>private sector, including the banking industry, and I am very grateful that we are able to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that has also happened is the fact that, just before COVID-19 and through 
<br/>COVID-19,  we  have  been  able  to  strengthen  our  means  of  communicating  with  our  distant  or 
<br/>Divisional Command Centres with the mechanisms of zoom, not only are the clinicians using this 
<br/>but  also  the  corporate  sector  that  meet  regularly.    As  a  rule  of  thumb,  the  leadership  within  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Health  meet  two  times  a  week,  the  Permanent  Secretary  does  that  on  our  behalf 
<br/>commonly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Also we encourage the corporate sector to meet regularly with them, and they are also doing 
<br/>out  its  visits.    Apart  from  the  senior  doctors  at  CWM  and  Labasa  going  into  the  smaller  Sub-
<br/>Divisional Hospitals, the HR specialists, the accountants and the administrative staff that are there at 
<br/>headquarters actually go and visit apart from their zoom meetings, to actually work with the teams 
<br/>on the ground in the remote and rural areas about the internal processes that they need to ensure that 
<br/>they follow.  These are, I thought were some very useful pertinent points to bring up in this debate 
<br/>as to why we have been able to move on from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my contribution will be very brief.  I note 
<br/>the Chairperson of the Committee did highlight the implementation of the recommendations where 
<br/>he says that only 39 percent of the recommendations were fully implemented.  I see the Ministry of 
<br/>Health and Medical Services has only fully implemented 19 percent of the recommendations.  The 
<br/>best out of the lot is the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Rural Development and Natural 
<br/>Disaster  where  they  have  implemented  67  percent  and  50  percent  respectively.    The  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture is  the best,  which has implemented  73 percent  of the total.    I think it is  important  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2141 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mention that because the work of the Office of the Auditor-General is very important and it can only 
<br/>be effective and have meaning if the different ministries implement those recommendations so I am 
<br/>quite  pleased  that  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  has  actually  implemented  73  percent  of  the 
<br/>recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said before that we need to strengthen the Office the 
<br/>Auditor-General and also I think it is about time that we look at the Standing Orders governing the 
<br/>operations of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts because when we look at big ministries, I 
<br/>know the honourable Attorney-General has this particular view about what the executive can do and 
<br/>cannot do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  very  important  to  look  at  some  of  the  policies  as  well  and  it  is 
<br/>appropriate for the Public Accounts Committee to look at some of the policies because the policies 
<br/>itself could lead to misuse and wastage of taxpayer dollars.  I do not know what is happening with 
<br/>the Commission of Inquiry as to when we are going to get that report, but hopefully that inquiry itself 
<br/>will bring out the strength and the weaknesses of the Auditor-General’s Office and how it can be 
<br/>strengthened, how that can be then linked to what the Public Accounts Committee can do because in 
<br/>some big Ministries, in some big projects, it is always important to do audits or monitor while it is 
<br/></span><span>happening because once it has happened, the Committee can only look at what happened and where 
<br/></span><span>the wastage was but the wastage has already been done.  So perhaps, it is time and may be, the next 
<br/>government will do that, may be not this Parliament but it is an important consideration for anyone 
<br/>looking at the whole issue of wastage and how the work of the OAG can translate into the work of 
<br/>PAC which makes appropriate recommendations, also in addition to the recommendations that the 
<br/>OAG makes to different ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make a contribution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because three of the Ministries or agencies listed are under my portfolio.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first, let me acknowledge and thank the acting Auditor-General.  There has 
<br/>been a significant change in the way this office operates under the new leadership and I need to raise 
<br/>this  because  this  was  a  point  that  was  raised  to  me  by  my  Permanent  Secretary.    Now,  they  are 
<br/>conducting entry and exiting interviews.  Not only that, Sir, the acting Auditor-General is physically 
<br/>present, making sure that things are done in the right way and that needs to be acknowledged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On rural development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were two issues raised; one is on our main trust 
<br/>account.  The exit interview on this has been conducted just very recently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 9th 
<br/></span><span>August.  In fact, this month, everything has been cleared, no irregularities noted and as I have stated, 
<br/></span><span>the acting Auditor-General was present in that exit interview, so that can be taken off the list. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Risk Management Framework, I have the draft copy here 
<br/>with me.  We are looking at signing it around mid-September, once all the final editing is completed.  
<br/>But let me just put context to some of the issues, Sir, particularly on the main trust account.  There 
<br/>were a lot of organisational changes in the Ministry and some of these issues raised were as a result 
<br/>of the changes that were happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry  of Rural  Housing used to  be with  the Ministry, it is  now under Community 
<br/>Development and Housing.  The same thing, the Meteorological Services, in 2018 we were together 
<br/>as a Ministry, Meteorological Services and Disaster Management but now it is back with the Ministry 
<br/>of Infrastructure and Disaster Management is back with Rural Development and this led to some of 
<br/>the issues raised but of course, the good thing out of all this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I would like to 
<br/>mention  this here that now there is  a database established.  Previously,  a lot of things were done 
<br/>manually and we are thankful now that the management of course, in consultation with the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>2142 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Economy and the OAG have managed to have this electronically.  Therefore, a database has been 
<br/>created  about  projects  and  allocations,  et  cetera,  and  this  database  is  then  matched  against  trust 
<br/>account reconciliations and thereby the contents of the database and reconciliations with the General 
<br/>Ledger  were  substantiated  and  reviewed  with  the  Auditor-General’s  team.    So  that  has  been  a 
<br/>significant change as well in terms of improving processes and systems within the Ministry. This is 
<br/>the positives that we get out of audited reports and of course, give assurance that we are addressing 
<br/>the issues raised and of course, are focused on good governance and best practices, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have mentioned about the Risk Management Framework.  I have the copy here and we will 
<br/>finalise our own editing and the final approval is likely to take place in the next two weeks and of 
<br/>course, this document will then be readily available as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issues raised regarding the RFMF, there were two issues raised.  Let 
<br/>me say that the RFMF audit charter, as highlighted will be signed next week when the Commander 
<br/>RFMF returns from the Maldives and the Risk Management Framework will also be ready in mid-
<br/>September as well and that definitely, will address the issues that were raised concerning the RFMF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the Fiji Police Force, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Operating Trust Fund. The Fiji Police 
<br/></span><span>Force has done all their investigations and of course, as alluded to by the Chair, they have noted that 
<br/></span><span>there were no loss of government fund but there was misallocation. This has been tidied up with the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy, so that it can be written-off and on the Revolving Fund Account, as already 
<br/>alluded to as well by the Chair of the Committee that they have managed from an outstanding amount 
<br/>of $102,000, they have now come down to $6,908 and the difficulty that they are facing, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is again on their manual records because some of these transactions were done probably involving 
<br/>the use of LPOs and other means. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to give assurance that with the Fiji Police Force, one of the issues also highlighted 
<br/>earlier in probably one of the audited reports for the Fiji Police Force, was for them to have an internal 
<br/>audit committee and let me assure this august Parliament that one of their Assistant  Commissioners 
<br/>is now responsible, that committee has been formed and there are three members of the committee, 
<br/>apart  from  the  Chair  who  is  one  of  the  Assistant  Commissioners,  an  Assistant  Superintendent, 
<br/>together with one Inspector and one Corporal.  That briefly highlights some of the responses that the 
<br/>agencies  have  taken  in  response  to  the  issues  raised  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  and 
<br/>highlighted by the Committee and I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to this debate.  
<br/></span><span>Firstly, I thank the Committee and the Chairman for scrutinising the Report.  Sir, my Government 
<br/></span><span>has made significant progress since it was elected to resolve many of the inherited financial failings 
<br/>of past governments. We have listened to concerns of the members of the public addressed many 
<br/>outstanding issues in the numerous audit reports, and improve government’s overall service delivery, 
<br/>raising it through the best chances and at least the last half century.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is more that can be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if there is a theme to this session, it is that 
<br/>improvement is a continual process and this Government will not rest on its laurels.  On the audit 
<br/>issues that were raised to the eight high risk ministries, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to assure this 
<br/>august Parliament that this inefficiencies have been addressed and brought under control through the 
<br/>signing    of  a    host  of  recommended  measures  coupled  with  stringent  policies  and  effective 
<br/>management of a vision risk strategy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is critical to note here that during the review period, 86 percent of the audit 
<br/>recommendations were implemented, whilst 14 percent  are not. This demonstrates that Ministries 
<br/>and Departments have since improved their adherence to the Finance Instruction of 2010, Financial

<div><span>Management  Act  2004  and  International  Auditing  Standards.    In  addition,  they  were  notably 
<br/>significant  improvement  in  accounting  functions  and  services,  following  the  establishment  of 
<br/>monitoring  compliance,  a  governance  section 
<br/>implementation  of 
<br/>recommendations of the eight Ministries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  ensure  effective 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  development  and  adoption  of  the  Risk  Management  Framework  by  the 
<br/>majority of agencies is the testament to my Government unwavering commitment to the principles 
<br/>of transparency, accountability and good governance in its operations and administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generic  issues  that  were  raised  in  the  Consolidated  Audit  Report  is  the  management  of 
<br/>various trust fund accounts held within Government Ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture,  
<br/>Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, to name 
<br/>a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while the Office of the Auditor-General has highlighted measures to address its 
<br/>anomalies,  the  respective  eight  Ministries  that  embarked  on  the  review  and  establishment  of  an 
<br/>internal  audit  committee  to  undertake  a  first-hand  review  and  address  issues  before  been 
<br/>independently audited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition,  Mr. Speaker, the Ministry  of Economy is  collaborating with the Ministries to 
<br/>ensure that they perform their reconciliations on a timely basis and to guarantee that internal control 
<br/>mechanism are firmly in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to share that the Ministries have established their dedicated Compliance Review 
<br/>Team to strengthen internal control environment and to drive business process review through the 
<br/>Open  Merit  Recruitment  and  Selection  (OMRS)  System.  Mr.  Speaker,  Ministries  were  able  to 
<br/>appoint highly qualified and competent individuals to the position of Head of Finance and Accounts 
<br/>Officers.  Timely submission of accurate and quality financial statements are now been prioritised to 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General and to address audit queries. The same is expected from all of my 
<br/>Government Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure this august Parliament that many of the 
<br/>issues raised in the Report have been addressed.  Various Ministries have been seen implementing 
<br/>the  Risk  Management  Policies  through  the  prudent  Financial  Management  Act  and  embedded  its 
<br/>improvements in the individual Ministerial Strategic Policies and Operational Plans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on these remarks, Mr. Speaker, I, therefore, do support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I still have four speakers on my list but time moves 
<br/>on. We will now take a break for lunch and when we resume, the first speaker will be the honourable 
<br/>Aseri Radrodro, followed by the honourable Minister for Agriculture, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education, Heritage and Arts and Local Government and the honourable Minister for Infrastructure, 
<br/>Meteorological Services, Lands and Mineral Resources, so in that order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We break for lunch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.34 p.m.

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.33 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we will continue with the debate and I give the floor to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the first speaker, honourable Aseri Radrodro. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribute as a member of the Public Accounts Committee on the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me start that this is a bipartisan report that all Members of the Committee 
<br/>have agreed to the recommendations that is in the Report.  I would like to acknowledge and thank the 
<br/>Ministries for giving us an update of the respective Ministries and Departments commitments to the audit 
<br/>issues that have been raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir in addition to the report before us, I would like to comment on the effort and the 
<br/>time that has been taken by the Office of the Auditor-General to do this special exercise. Special exercise 
<br/>meaning  to  say  that  they  take  an  effort  to  conduct  this  special  audit  in  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>recommendations they have put through in the audit of the whole of Government accounts in 2017.  They 
<br/>did this exercise in 2019,  one year after the audit was conducted, the recommendations and yet they have 
<br/></span><span>highlighted some of the deficiencies in terms of full implementation, partly implemented and the non-
<br/></span><span>implementation of the audit recommendations, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think some Members on this side of Parliament have already highlighted that there are important 
<br/>issues, a lot of activities that are happening in the Ministries since the time of the audit, in which the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General could efficiently and effectively divert their resources to.  For them to take 
<br/>up these special activities in chasing up the implementations of the recommendations is a bit of a concern 
<br/>and that is why we had directed the recommendations accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I think the Auditor-General has properly  highlighted  why the audit  was undertaken on these 
<br/>ministries as a basis of high risk classifications, as has been highlighted.  The audit was undertaken due 
<br/>to  various  factors  such  as  large  number  of  year-end  transactions,  high  budgetary  funding  being 
<br/>implemented,  implementing  agencies  for  Government  policies,  extremely  complex  transactions  and 
<br/>specialised niches of operations. These are very important aspects in terms of how the Auditor-General 
<br/>had conducted its activity, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in addition to that, the Auditor-General has also highlighted the limitations of their act and 
<br/>the limitations in the way they conduct their activities.  We have also highlighted that the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>reports to Parliament with recommendations to improve the performances or enhance accountability of 
<br/></span><span>public sector entities. The Auditor-General is not responsible nor does it have the powers to enforce the 
<br/>implementation of these recommendations.  I think it is very clear that the role of the Auditor-General is 
<br/>only limited to highlighting the issues to the respective ministries and departments. It is the responsibility 
<br/>of the Permanent Secretaries as Chief Accounting Officers to address these anomalies that have been 
<br/>highlighted by the Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  raises  another  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  so  when  these  Permanent  Secretaries,  Chief 
<br/>Accounting Officers are not doing their jobs, as highlighted by the Auditor-General in this report and also 
<br/>in the previous report, who will be responsible for addressing these certain officers when they are not 
<br/>implementing the recommendations to improve the accountabilities of the various entities, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  I think in addition to that, as a matter of good governance, all public sector entities should have 
<br/>systems and processes to consider and implement recommendations of the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have heard that a few Ministers have already highlighted that they are addressing the issues, 
<br/>but  we  have  to  wait  until  the  next  cycle  of  audit  reports  to  see  whether  the  issues  that  have  been 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2145 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlighted here will continue to re-emerge.  You have said that the Acting Auditor-General is now part 
<br/>of the exit interview which is a normal process of auditing, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We hope that it will not 
<br/>influence them to water down certain issues that needs to be brought to Parliament for discussion.  With 
<br/>that brief summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I note the urgency in no.7, Ministry of Agriculture’s 
<br/>audit finding and the recommendations thereof.  I want to begin by thanking our PS Agriculture and the 
<br/>team finance and operations at the Ministry of Agriculture for turning around the operational issues to get 
<br/>a clean bill from the Office of the Auditor-General (OAG) over the last two years.   Over the last two 
<br/>years, we got unqualified audit reports from the OAG so we want to report to Parliament that we do take 
<br/>the issues raised by the OAG very seriously.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, at the Ministry of Agriculture of course, and all the other ministries want to ensure that we 
<br/>get the maximum value for taxpayers money and that we get through the budgetary allocation. We want 
<br/>to ensure that in that process, we are able to really push on to the maximum with regard to individual 
<br/>ministries, and in this case, the Ministry of Agriculture’s output in national interest as well as the interest 
<br/>of all the stakeholders that are involved in the agriculture supply chain process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this audit report, the Committee noted that out of the 11 recommendations, 
<br/></span><span>the Ministry of Agriculture managed to fully implement eight - there were three pending at that particular 
<br/>point in time.  As I speak, all three have been taken care of.  The first one is, the Government wage earners 
<br/>being  paid  from  established  staff  vote.    With  the  assistance  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  the 
<br/>introduction of a new monthly wage reconciliation format focusing on the regularising of the General 
<br/>Ledger and Payroll System last financial year 2021-2022,  this has been resolved and the matter has been 
<br/>closed - so no more of that particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second pending issue was the variances in inventory quantity during annual stock take.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, a regular stock take is now consistent and up to par and this issue is now closed.  The third 
<br/>one is the unsubstantiated TMA VAT charges.  This has been dealt with and the matter has been closed.  
<br/>I want to assure Parliament, now that we are getting a clean record from the OAG, we have got to this 
<br/>point by ensuring that we got the right person to do the job in regard to this financial audit  Internally, we 
<br/>established and appointed a separate compliance team, reporting directly to PS so that there is no conflict 
<br/>with the payment and the operational side, and in the process regularly if there are some issues that are 
<br/>found, it is dealt with immediately rather than waiting till the end of the year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I want to commend the staff of Ministry of Agriculture right down to the 
<br/></span><span>frontline staff.  All of them are involved in service delivery, all of them have done an excellent job and I 
<br/></span><span>want to thank the leadership of the Ministry, executive arm and the PS, Dr. Vinesh Kumar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on the motion 
<br/>that is before Parliament.  As noted by the Standing Committee, the first two recommendations out of 
<br/>four have  been  fully  implemented.   The third  recommendation,  which is on the utilisation of capital 
<br/>expenditure budget, is partially implemented.  This is being addressed by putting in several measures, for 
<br/>example, the Ministry has improved internal processes, which include a quarterly project performance 
<br/>reporting, to the Ministry of Economy on all capital projects.  We have prepared and we are also following 
<br/>a clear set of guidelines for the various project implementation steps.  Schools are given the guidelines 
<br/>which gives step by step instruction on what they need to do when implementing capital projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now restructured our Asset Management Unit (AMU). The Unit will 
<br/>have specialised positions that includes project managers, engineers and quality surveyors and not just 
<br/>industrial arts qualifications, as was the case previously.  Previously this Unit was managed by teachers

<div><span>30</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from the school system and they had not managed such big projects so that is one of the biggest change 
<br/>we have brought about at the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have appointed a Director Asset and Infrastructure Services from the private sector, who has 
<br/>extensive experience in project management amongst other things.  We are confident that going forward, 
<br/>projects will be completed in a timely manner.  To save time and money in implementing capital projects, 
<br/>the Ministry has produced architectural designs and engineering plans for the ablution block which is an 
<br/>approved plan from the municipal councils.  Such templates ensure that the Ministry is construction ready.  
<br/>We do not have to wait to go through this process each time a school requests for an ablution block to be 
<br/>built in that school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have  arranged the DFAT to  receive the approved  plans for classrooms, 
<br/>ablution blocks and teachers quarters after the north project ends, which the Ministry can use without 
<br/>seeking consent from the architect or the engineer.  These approved plans can again be used to build this 
<br/>infrastructure in any other school.  Generally schools make a request to donor agencies as well to get the 
<br/>classrooms done or dormitories done and each time the request is made, it requires an architect to be on 
<br/>board, the engineering drawings to be developed and the preparatory phase takes a lot of time.  To shorten 
<br/>the preparatory phase, now we have got approved plans.  These plans are passed and it meets category 
<br/></span><span>five  cyclone  standards.    This  will  greatly  reduce  the  time  taken  during  the  preparatory  phase  as  I 
<br/></span><span>mentioned.  It will also assist in creating more standardised building structures in our schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry carried out an assessment of secondary school infrastructure by 
<br/>filling in the infrastructure and facilities monitoring template.  It is an exercise that we did this year and 
<br/>this assessment has helped the Ministry to use traffic light signals to prioritise school rehabilitation and 
<br/>repair works.  Schools in the red category means urgent attention, amber reflects medium term attention 
<br/>that is within three to five years the school needs to be repaired or rehabilitated, and green indicates no 
<br/>issues, however, long-term attention is needed.   We intend to complete a similar template for primary 
<br/>schools by the end of this year and use this information, not just for our annual budget submission process 
<br/>but also to reach out to the donor partners that wish to provide funding for infrastructure development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In regard to the fourth recommendation, that is, the delay in finalising of financial statement, the 
<br/>Ministry is working towards this particular recommendation and we are following the guidelines set by 
<br/>the Ministry of Economy.  In 2019 the finance section was strengthened by recruiting three managers.  
<br/>These  are  Manager  Finance,  Manager  Procurement  and  Manager  Grants  with  oversight  of  Director 
<br/>Finance.  This has not only improved the functions of the Unit but has brought the level of accountability 
<br/>to the managers and this is one way of improving the various findings highlighted in the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also carried out business process improvements by automating 
<br/>a number of manual processes.  One significant contribution to timely submission of financial statements, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been the strengthening of SOPs and checklists with all staff, and making sure that 
<br/>the staff are aware of the SOPs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We take the OAG’s Report very seriously and also the recommendations made by the Standing 
<br/>Committee and the finance team, the corporate section, they normally go over these recommendations 
<br/>and they make sure that these recommendations are translated into action items which are put into the 
<br/>individual work plan.  These are some of the ways through which we are trying to address the current 
<br/>issues which the OAG has found.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally I want to thank the Standing Committee on Public Accounts for this 
<br/>Report and also thank the Ministry for implementing some of these recommendations that was made by 
<br/>the Standing Committee.

<div><span>Review Report-Follow Up of High Risk Ministries &amp; Departments 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2147 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  the 
<br/>discussion on this very important paper which is the review on the follow-up of High Risk Ministries and 
<br/>Departments.  From my point of view, I appreciate the work that has been done by the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General in terms of what has been reviewed here and also greatly appreciate the work of the 
<br/>Committee in putting this Report together and highlighting the kinds of things that need to be addressed 
<br/>by the ministries in carrying out their roles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As Ministers we always want to make sure that the ministries are using the resources that are 
<br/>given to them in the best possible way to get optimal results for the benefit of the people of Fiji.  Looking 
<br/>at the report Mr. Speaker, Sir, I notice that in the initial table given on page 7 it highlighted that the 
<br/>Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport (as it was at that time), had fully implemented 40 percent of the 
<br/>recommendations that had been outlined in the report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Chairperson has pointed out today, as a result of a later follow-up all 20 recommendations 
<br/>have been addressed.  But just two of these recommendations - while it was being addressed and because 
<br/>of the circumstances around those particular issues - could not be fully brought to a conclusion.  The first 
<br/>is in relation to the variation between the Trade and Manufacture Account (TMA) for building cash book 
<br/>with the bank reconciliation.  This has been a long standing issue with the Ministry of Infrastructure.  
<br/></span><span>Honourable Members will recall that back in the year 2012 there was an inherited fraud case that involved 
<br/></span><span>this particular Ministry where some of the staff worked together with suppliers to cheat the system out of 
<br/>what was supposed to be given and as a result of that, there was a court case in place and this is one of 
<br/>the issues that has also been there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  I  joined  this  particular  Ministry  one  of  the  things  that  we  keep  telling  the  Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries is that we expect our accounts to come with no qualification but this has been a long standing 
<br/>qualification with this particular Ministry - the fraud that happened back in 2012.  It is because of that 
<br/>particular issue that we are still awaiting the outcome of the court case that we cannot complete this 
<br/>particular issue - it is awaiting that.  So the things that were highlighted in relation to the variation between 
<br/>TMA  building  cashbook  with  the  bank  reconciliation,  all  the  review  functions  around  the  bank 
<br/>reconciliations have been strengthened, job responsibilities have been changed, the way the cashbooks 
<br/>have been reconciled has been relooked at including the General Ledger, the ways in which the Standing 
<br/>Operating Procedures have been improved upon and the audit issue in regards to the anomalies picked 
<br/>during the bank reconciliation of accounts, could not be substantiated due to the missing documents of 
<br/>that particular case.  So, this particular issue has been addressed but its final resolution will have to wait 
<br/>for the court to clear it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The case has been dealt with in part by the court and the case has not closed.  Legal opinions have 
<br/></span><span>been sought from the Solicitor-General to write off these variances from the Ministry of Economy but 
<br/>neither has responded so the audit issue on this variance will remain until the court clears that particular 
<br/>case.  So, that is an issue for me as a Minister.  It is a thorn in the flesh because no Minister wants to see 
<br/>any of their accounts with qualifications and this is obviously an issue around that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that we still have to fully get to terms with to fully reduce is the delay in the filling 
<br/>of vacant positions.  Most of these has been done - the percentage at which the vacant positions have been 
<br/>filled has almost been completed but having changes all along with the ministry in terms of the structure 
<br/>of  the  ministry,  the  implementation  with  the  Open  Merit  Recruitment  Selection  System,  the  Job 
<br/>Evaluation  2017,  the  undergoing  reform  of  the  Department  of  Works,  the  various  realignment  of 
<br/>departments within the ministry, the transition of the Fiji Meteorological Services into the ministry and 
<br/>National Disaster and Management Office out of it, all of that has led to some issues which means the 
<br/>filling of vacant positions.  While there has been a dramatic improvement and the processes are being 
<br/>addressed, there is still a little bit left to be done.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee again for the report and as Ministers we would 
<br/>like to see this kind of audit report because it allows us to keep our Permanent Secretaries who are the 
<br/>captains of our ship of the ministry, on board and we can make sure that we review the implementation 
<br/>of the resources given to the ministry for the best possible impact for the people of this country.  Thank

<br/>hand in hand with the Office of the Auditor-General in fulfilling all the recommendations that has been
