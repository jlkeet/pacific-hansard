<div><span>“… which he manages relying heavily on aid and budget support loans and grants from 
<br/>our  neighbours.    The  increasing  poverty  and  extreme  poverty  levels,  unemployment, 
<br/>decline in real wage of the majority of workers including civil servants, increase in crime 
<br/>and suicides, a failed health services, mass termination of workers in WAF, Fiji Airways 
<br/>and ATS like never seen in Fiji’s history and the list goes on.   We have also witnessed 
<br/></span><span>and  experienced  the  serious  contraction  in  our  democratic  space  like  the  freedom  of 
<br/></span><span>speech, assembly, political rights, freedom of association, denial of workers’ rights, press 
<br/>freedom, again the list goes on.  Of course, the most important of all is the imposition of 
<br/>the Fiji Constitution with so many limitations to rights and which only protects those that 
<br/>were responsible for the 2006 coup and any actions taken by them or their supporters until 
<br/>2014 without any exceptions.  It is time we did an analysis of our human rights under this 
<br/>AG and his Government. This is no time for the AG to lecture as he normally does but to 
<br/>listen and learn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Trades Union Congress takes its responsibility to workers in Fiji, whether 
<br/>they are union  members or not, very seriously and will continue to  advocate for them 
<br/>whenever and wherever the needs arises.  There is no need for sophistication to disguise 
<br/>the real issues.  The AG needs to be schooled in trade union advocacy so that Fiji does 
<br/>not become an embarrassment in the international arena. An analysis since 2014 of the 
<br/>ILO Committee of Experts Reports on Fiji may well serve as a good example.

<div><span>Mr. Felix Anthony  
<br/>National Secretary FTUC.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is what I wanted to share today in terms of FNPF and some of the issues arising from it.  
<br/>Thank you to the Committee, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let me remind you, if you are going to quote from 
<br/>someone, quote extracts of it, do not quote the whole statement because they are not accountable to 
<br/>Parliament.  Here we are making a statement about someone, written a letter at length and it has taken 
<br/>up  about  10  minutes  of  your  presentation.    Let  us  get  that  clear.    What  is  made  in  Parliament  is 
<br/>accountable to Parliament, not accountable to someone else. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/>Viam Pillay. First, I commend the work of the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs on the deliberations of the Annual Reports.  By the same token, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the  management  and  staff  of  the  Fiji  National  Provident  Fund  for  their  efforts  in  ensuring  the 
<br/>employed  members  and  business  employers’  hard-earned  savings  and  contributions  are  protected 
<br/>despite the challenges they face in their daily operations and administrations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund’s role is to provide a secure future for its members by ensuring 
<br/>that  they  have  a  meaningful,  comfortable  retirement  supported  by  the  hard-earned  savings  they 
<br/>accumulated  during  their  working  life.    My  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  been  diligent  in 
<br/>developing  robust  divestment,  liquidity  and  preservation  policy  and  regulation.  For  example,  the 
<br/>allocation  of  70  percent  of  funds  into  members  preserved  account  for  retirement  purposes.    We 
<br/>actively partnered with strong institutions like the FNPF to ensure that members do not have zero 
<br/>balances in their savings once they retire or if they become unemployed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund also safeguards members’ interest against liquidity risk through 
<br/>its robust business continuity plan and risk management, the Fund is equipped to address a range of 
<br/>different scenarios that may crop up.  In terms of ease of doing business, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fund 
<br/>works with key agencies such as the Fiji Revenue &amp; Customs Service, Reserve Bank of Fiji, Ministry 
<br/>of  Justice,  Real  Estate  Agents  Licensing  Board,  Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission  and  other 
<br/>government agencies to carry out their duties ensuring that every member benefits from a healthy 
<br/>and well-regulated savings institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is extremely encouraging Mr. Speaker, Sir, to see that the Fund is operating at international 
<br/></span><span>standards, made evident among several others the International Social Security Association Good 
<br/></span><span>Practice Award - Asia and Pacific Region 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There you go! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  My  Government’s  commitment,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  not  only 
<br/>maintaining but exponentially growing the investment capabilities of the Fund is evident.  Some of 
<br/>the  current  investment  opportunities  being  pursued  focus  on  affordable  housing  initiatives, 
<br/>agriculture, business process outsourcing, health care, retail, manufacturing, financial and insurance 
<br/>sector and infrastructure assets to name are few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  through  my  Government’s  sound  economic  policy,  including  digital 
<br/>transformation and through the provision of various Government incentives through the Fund, Fiji 
<br/>has  enhanced  its  superannuation  services,  delivered  world  class  products  and  established  easier 
<br/>communication channels thereby creating never before seen value for its members. Despite the onset

<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiji and a hike in extreme withdrawals from the Fund by members, 
<br/>the FNPF is still a major investor and is one of the largest property owners in the county.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am very pleased to see the positive results of increased net income during the review period 
<br/>due to strong performances for its over 446,000 members. As of 2021, the FNPF had FJ$1.5 billion 
<br/>in General Reserves, FJ$8.2 billion in net assets and had paid out an unmatched 5 percent interest to 
<br/>its  members.    Mr.  Speaker,  FNPF  is  operating  at  international  standards  of  Fund  diversification 
<br/>boasting a mix of Government securities, equities, loans and cash reserve.  This is the formulae by 
<br/>which the Fund works to advance National Economic Development objectives while simultaneously 
<br/>maximising members’ returns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recently passed FNPF Budget (Amendment) Bill is timely and has ensured that mandated 
<br/>rates of contributions from employees and employers increase from January, 2023. Also, trustees are 
<br/>allowed to invest monies held in trust for minors in the Fund thereby allowing FNPF membership 
<br/>for minors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Government has been clear and the 2022-2023 Budget is clear.  This will be a year of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>growth, recovery, resilient building and historic achievement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Ultimately in all that we do, we will continue to put the Fijian 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people first. This has been our mission from day one and it remains our mission today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, despite this  progress,  you will hear the Opposition  try to score points by preaching 
<br/>words they do not practice like governance, accountability, transparency and loyalty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition has again raised concern that the Fund’s Board lacks a diverse representation 
<br/>citing  the  recently  published  International  Transport  Workers’  Federation  Report  on  making  the 
<br/>FNPF work for workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, board appointments are now merit-based as this is the case for every board we 
<br/>are responsible for, meaning that appointments are made based on relevant expertise and knowledge 
<br/>criteria, including skill sets that assist and contribute to the positive growth and development of the 
<br/>Fund’s investment portfolio, security and maximising of members benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while it is noted that 80 percent of members had a balance less than $20,000, 
<br/></span><span>this does not mean that they have exhausted their total savings. This balance is only a reflection of 
<br/></span><span>their General Account.  As I mentioned earlier, the Fund’s Preservation Policy means that 70 percent 
<br/>of the members’ total contributions are secure and cannot be touched until the person retires.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, there are members who have exhausted their 30 percent in the General Account during 
<br/>the pandemic, not their entire FNPF savings. To provide these Fijians with security, my Government 
<br/>paid over $200 million in unemployment assistance to members whose General Account Funds are 
<br/>depleted during the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.V.  BAINIMARAMA.-  There  was  a  lot  of  discussion  and  concern  regarding  the 
<br/>legitimacy of the Fund’s partnership with Aspen Medical and I urge honourable Professor Prasad, 
<br/>who is again not here, to listen carefully.  Health Care (Fiji) Pte Limited trading as Aspen Medical is 
<br/>a  special  purpose  vehicle  setup  for  this  Public-Private  Partnership  between  the  FNPF  and  Aspen 
<br/>Medical Limited to manage the Lautoka and Ba Hospitals.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary objective, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to improve access to affordable healthcare services 
<br/>in two Hospitals.  I do not know anyone in the right state of mind would argue with that, maybe some 
<br/>sick people down that side of Parliament.  The project is bound by the concession agreement which 
<br/>is in line with the Financial Management Act 2004, Procurement Regulations 2010, Companies Act 
<br/>2015  and  other  laws  of  Fiji.    For  the  finalisation  of  this  partnership  with  Health  Care  (Fiji)  Pte 
<br/>Limited,  there  was  extensive  technical  work  and  consultations  undertaken  before  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government signed the concession agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government engaged the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to assist with the design 
<br/>and implementation of the project, as we wanted to get it done right.  There was a rigorous process 
<br/>undertaken by the IFC consultation with my Government, Fiji National University, FNPF, among 
<br/>others, to design the transaction structure itself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An  open  international  competitive  bid  process  was  undertaken  by  IFC  and  all  bids  were 
<br/>assessed against the stringent technical and financial criteria for the selection.  Health Care (Fiji) Pte 
<br/>Limited has successfully transitioned into the management of Lautoka and Ba Hospitals.  All the 
<br/>services available at the two Hospitals are free for the people and more tertiary care services will be 
<br/>available in Fiji, including for the first time ever, open heart surgeries, radiotherapy, chemotherapy 
<br/></span><span>for cancer and the 24/7 availability of cardiac surgery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pandemic and ongoing Russian-Ukraine war has impacted supply chains 
<br/>globally,  including  the  supply  of  clinical  equipment  such  as  those  required  for  cardiac  surgery.  
<br/>Further, cardiac surgery involves cleaning, selection and stabilisation of patients in order to optimise 
<br/>the outcome, including echo-cardiology and the management of comorbidities such as diabetes and 
<br/>obesity as undertaken prior to any intricate surgery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those reasons, honourable Professor Prasad, who is again not here, cardiac surgeries are 
<br/>complex and a lot is required prior to commencing procedures.  At the end of the day, I want to make 
<br/>it clear, Mr. Speaker, that no amount of hard work, rigorous decision-making or length of time needed 
<br/>will be too much for my Government to improve the health and care of the Fijian people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My Government will not deprive the Fijian people their constitutional right of access to better 
<br/>and higher quality health systems and care services, especially because we are the first Government 
<br/>to have prioritised a ‘never-before-seen’ medical care in Fiji.  One only must think of the children’s’ 
<br/>heart hospital in Nasese. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no such thing as a ‘private cash cow’, as some honourable Members 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Opposition  are  trying  to  make  the  Fijian  public  believe.    Risky  loans  and  undisciplined 
<br/>financial structures do not lead to award winning national provident fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- As none of the accusers have ever contributed to the success 
<br/>of  a  world  class  national  provident  fund,  allow  me,    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  briefly  highlight  one 
<br/>important  aspect.    My  Government,  through  the  Fund,  has  made  independent  assessments  on  its 
<br/>Financials and Annual Reports where auditors thoroughly produced and make recommendations for 
<br/>improvement and actuarialists are doing the work.  Now, my dear colleagues, that is transparency, a 
<br/>concept that honourable Professor Prasad knows nothing about. I hope he has been paying attention 
<br/>to the facts I have laid them out, so I suspect the Professor will ignore this lecture, despite how sorely 
<br/>he needs to hear it.  Sadly, his desperate pursuit of power depends on him painting the most negative 
<br/>picture he possibly can to other countries, including his two Party colleagues in Parliament.

<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian Government is committed to growing our economy, supporting 
<br/>Fijian businesses and improving Fijian livelihoods.  When it comes to securing pension funds for a 
<br/>better future, my Government does more than just listen.  We implemented change through the review 
<br/>of policies that will deliver better investments, superannuation and national development projects.  
<br/>We focus on transforming Fijian lives for the better in every single decision we make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk from the other side about Felix Anthony, I would 
<br/>like to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that one of the best things I ever did was to get rid of Felix Anthony 
<br/>from the Board for abuse of funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, I do support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity for me to partake on 
<br/>this  motion  before  the  House.    I  thank  honourable  Pillay  and  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social 
<br/>Affairs for the Annual Reports of 2019, 2020 and 2021.  That is a very clear indication of things that 
<br/>are moving forward on the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), being very updated on its Annual 
<br/>Reports.  That has to be a reflection to all institutions of Government whereby they have to bring to 
<br/>par all their Annual Reports and also the review of their Annual Reports to be tabled in Parliament, 
<br/>and also reviewed and debated in Parliament as soon as.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTaukei Trust Fund Board 2019 Annual Report and the 
<br/>Airports Annual Report was presented on Tuesday.  The Ministry of Waterways which has lacked 
<br/>with six years report (2017-2018 Annual Reports) has just been tabled.  The Ministry of Employment, 
<br/>Productivity and Industrial Relations 2016-2017 Annual Report has been tabled on Monday. This is 
<br/>a bad reflection on Government and the institution.  The Ministry of Industrial Relations 2017-2018 
<br/>Annual  Report and the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation 2018-2019 Annual 
<br/>Reports. We are supposed to be in line with the Reserve Bank of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were so glad the other day that we debated on the latest   of the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>Annual Report (2021 Annual Report) and this is a good reflection.  I hope that all Ministers and also 
<br/>Permanent Secretaries of Government institutions or Departments and Ministries to bring to par the 
<br/>submission of their Annual Reports.  I have been here for about four years and we are still discussing 
<br/>Annual Reports and their review even before 2018.  The next government will come in and try and 
<br/>speed up the Annual Reports and their review.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I would like to thank the FNPF for what they have done in regard to securing the future 
<br/>for the workers of Fiji.  Every time that we speak of things on this side of the House, this is how we 
<br/></span><span>look at it from this end.  Government should accept the credible criticisms that we give so that it can 
<br/></span><span>help and enhance the way you operate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- It’s not credible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  It  is  relevant  as  of  today,  this  report  is  going  back  to  2021.    So 
<br/>whatever that we are telling you right now, it should work and you should accept that and every time 
<br/>that we say something, you are very defensive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- No, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  RASOVA.-  There  are  two  Military  persons  beside  you  and  you  seem  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>defensive, honourable Minister for Defence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regards to the 58,712 members that have zero balance, what are we going 
<br/>to do with that, honourable Minister for Economy?  Are we going to pump in about $2,000 each, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2207 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rather than giving freebies out of $200 million that we gave?  Now, that we are giving about another 
<br/>$60 million which the honourable Minister confirmed yesterday that we are going to roll out about 
<br/>$38 million this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Not really! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Are you calling it freebie now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- It is in the papers, I only refer to public opinions.   
<br/>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Which paper? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Your paper, the Fiji Sun.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Do not carry out a conversation between you and them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Apology, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are distracting me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- If you finish your statement, then finish it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the one thing that I would like to stress is the FNPF, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the companies, it is the largest property owner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fund also owns majority shares in Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited (and I think this 
<br/>has to be public knowledge - everyone has to know about this), Vodafone Fiji Limited, HFC Bank and 
<br/>fully owns Natadola Bay Resort Limited (InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort &amp; Spa), Holiday Inn Suva, 
<br/>Momi Bay Resort (Pte) Limited (Fiji Marriott Resort), Marriott Denarau Properties (Sheraton Fiji and 
<br/>Denarau Golf and Racquet Club), and the Grand Pacific Hotel.  I think everyone who works in Fiji should 
<br/>know about this, that we should patronise those places if we want our 5 percent shareholding in FNPF, 
<br/>without prejudice to other big companies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Committee observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that the Committee requested the Fund to provide 
<br/>data on loans issued by FNPF from 2015 until the present time, the entities of which the loans were given 
<br/>and their financial performance.  They also inquired the amount recovered and outstanding loan balance 
<br/>for  each  of  these  entities  and  whether  any  entity  had  defaulted  on  loan  repayment.    However  this 
<br/>information was not disclosed to the Committee by the Fund as they were informed that it was bound for 
<br/>confidentiality clause of the loan agreements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was assured that all loans went through a vigorous due diligence process, which 
<br/>are then vetted by three type Committee systems before they have been tabled to the Board.  I think that 
<br/>there is a good vetting system in FNPF and publicly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, everyone goes against Government 
<br/>when you touch any funds or without public consultations when the Government is taking funds out of 
<br/>FNPF.  I hope that things improve - communications publicly, that we should know in fine detail because 
<br/>everything just seems to be a secret with Government.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution and I would like to thank the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs, Mr. Chairman, and also the Members, and the public.  Lastly, I would like to thank those 
<br/>students who are from the NGO who are interested in Parliament.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a number of matters that I just wish 
<br/>to respond to.  Honourable Members from the other side, obviously, have a narrative in respect of FNPF 
<br/>and they wish to tow that line, irrespective of the facts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>2208 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister has given a very succinct elucidation in respect 
<br/>of where FNPF stands.  I just wish to highlight a couple of issues that were raised by honourable Members 
<br/>on  the  other  side.   Firstly, they  talked  about  a Government-controlled  Board.  They  made those very 
<br/>flippant comments, but they do not understand that under the FNPF Act, there is a requirement now to 
<br/>appoint Board members who have specific skill sets that are required to run a superannuation fund.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members also do not talk about the fact, and I see some young 
<br/>people in the audience there.  If these young people are working now or they would soon be working, by 
<br/>2050 and 2060 when they retire, if we had not reformed the FNPF, they would actually have no pension 
<br/>funds  left.    That  was  a  report  by  the  World  Bank,  not  once,  but  twice.    Two  independent  reports 
<br/>highlighted that the way the FNPF was being managed, the funds would actually have been completely 
<br/>depleted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were members in FNPF who were receiving a rate of 25 percent.  There was one particular 
<br/>trade unionists, I know, Sir, who was receiving a rate of 17 percent to 19 percent.  They do not talk about 
<br/>that.  Honourable Jale knows about this.  They need to make inquiries about this.  That was how FNPF 
<br/>had been run.  Investments that come to mind, many of us may remember the Malt House near the Golf 
<br/>Course.  What happened to that Malt House?  FNPF funds.  Bligh Shipping. PAPI leader was involved 
<br/></span><span>in Bligh Shipping, what happened then, Mr. Speaker, Sir?    They do not talk about all of these things.  
<br/></span><span>They do not talk about Momi and Natadola.  Honourable Rasova, we have actually salvaged it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They were investing with people who were wanted by the law, not in Fiji but in Europe and 
<br/>New Zealand.  One was an undischarged bankrupt.  He used to come on a helicopter from Nadi to 
<br/>Natadola, with red carpet.  If we had not intervened, Sir, the total investment in Natadola would have 
<br/>exceeded a billion dollars of members’ funds.  There is no way they would have got a rate of return 
<br/>on that.  Momi – one of the investors has ended up in prison in New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Wow!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  In  New  Zealand,  it  is  factually  available.    Honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members can do their research, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  investigations  were  done  on  the  CEO  and  the  Deputy  CEO  of  FNPF  post-5th 
<br/>December,  2006,  one  of  them  took  off  to  NZ.    I  have  seen  receipts.    When  she  used  to  go  to  a 
<br/>hairdresser, drink a cup of coffee, it was paid for by FNPF.  Not from her wallet but by FNPF through 
<br/>their credit card.  This was the kind of shenanigans that were taking place in FNPF which they do 
<br/></span><span>not talk about, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- They don’t know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They absolutely do not talk about it.  We have today, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, salvaged FNPF.  All the young people sitting here and outside these Chambers would 
<br/>know that their FNPF funds, if they are members today, they know at retirement, they will get their 
<br/>money.  That was not guaranteed previously, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they go on about Government using it as a cash cow.  Government does not 
<br/>use it as a cash  cow.   In fact,  I would  argue that FNPF, in  the past  two  years, used Government 
<br/>because there was no other investment opportunity for them to give them that rate of return.  That is 
<br/>why, as the honourable Prime Minister read out, the interest rate on the rate of return has been 5 
<br/>percent or more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During a period when the economies in the entire world was contracting globally, yet FNPF 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2209 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was able to assure that level of rate of return to the members, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  And what better 
<br/>place to invest than the Sovereign State of the Fijian Government.  If the Government is actually 
<br/>investing and you are getting a rate of return, why not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, we were being criticised back in 2011 when the FNPF provided necessary funding 
<br/>to Fiji Airways for the A330s.  They had prepaid in advance the loan.  They do not talk about that.  
<br/>They prepaid in advance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they went on about members who have balances been reduced to zero.  On 
<br/>the 2021 Annual Report if they bothered to read it rather than trying to sort of find loopholes, it says 
<br/>58,712 accounts were zero accounts and it gives reasons.  Reasons!  Did you read the reasons?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It says, those over the age of 55, these member accounts have been reduced to zero because: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there were no contributions paid to their accounts.  
<br/>no contributions received for re-entrant accounts.  
<br/>98 percent accounts inherited from pre-preservation policy. 
<br/>there  were  inconsistent  contributions  and  continuous  withdrawals  which  depleted 
<br/>members’ balance.  
<br/>97 percent are dormant for 10 years or more.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They forget that in the last session of Parliament, we passed an amendment to the FNPF Act 
<br/>because the FNPF, as an organisation, was bound by the law that said that you could not write-off 
<br/>accounts.  There are people who have migrated and have disappeared.  They are not contributing but 
<br/>their accounts are still here.  So, now with the amendment to the law, FNPF can actually close those 
<br/>accounts in the same way  you see in savings bank accounts.   The banks will advertise in the </span><span>Fiji 
<br/>Times</span><span> or </span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>or wherever else they advertise. These accounts have been dormant.  If people do 
<br/>not claim their monies which is five cents, to a hundred dollars to a thousand dollars, we will put it 
<br/>into whatever consolidated fund or wherever else it will go.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FNPF was not given the opportunity to do so, that is why it is sitting on 
<br/>their books.  Again, 56 percent of the 58,000 are below the age of 55.  They are made up of members 
<br/>who: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>joined the workforce for a short period and had inconsistent contributions.  There are so 
<br/>many people who work as casual labourers.  They may work for three months.  They go 
<br/>back to the village or go back working for themselves.  They may come back the following 
<br/>year and make some contribution.    
<br/>joined the informal sector without any contribution payments to their accounts.  
<br/>87 percent of accounts inherited from pre-preservation policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reasons are given here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Radrodro’s entire thesis on her contribution  was about zero balance.  “Where 
<br/>will these people go?  What will happen to them?” Not actually using her intellect to see that the 
<br/></span><span>reasons  are  here.    She  went  on  about  the  people  who  now  receive  $100.    No  Government,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir,  factually proven, ever  gave pension to  those people over the age of 65 with  $100 a 
<br/>month who had never worked for anyone.  No Government!  They do not acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are so many people living in the maritime islands, there are so many people living in 
<br/>the rural areas, there are so many women, for example, who work in the urban corridors as what we 
<br/>call “house girls”, unfortunately, in Fiji where the employers have never paid FNPF to them.  They

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are today getting $100, bulk of the beneficiaries are women.  Yet, honourable Salote Radrodro, who 
<br/>pontificates herself as some saviour for women does not ever acknowledge or recognise that, in the 
<br/>same way she does not acknowledge many things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the same people.  She talked about, “let us give a helping hand.” 
<br/>When we give a helping hand or when we give a hand-up or leg-up they say it is freebees. What do 
<br/>they want?  Do you know whether you are Arthur or Martha?  What are you?  Today you sit here, 
<br/>today you sit there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that reminds me, honourable Professor Prasad, yesterday only went on and 
<br/>berated us and said, “You should not have lowered the deductions, you should not have said that 
<br/>members should contribute less”.  This is the famous article where he said that civil servants should 
<br/>get a 35 percent pay-cut, it is in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and I have actually brought the original </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span>
<br/>which is here for everyone to see - the two-page article. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the second-page he says, “Employers tax payment and FNPF deduction 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>obligation should be suspended ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  …as  long  as  they  can  show  that  money  is  being  paid  to 
<br/>suspended or temporary redundant employees.”  He is saying, “Stop it completely.”  We reduced it 
<br/>to 5 percent.  Honourable Qereqeretabua, honourable Tikoduadua - this is the kind of hypocrisy and 
<br/>the disingenuity that we have from honourable Members of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Tuisawau actually read this whole press statement. Thank you, Sir, 
<br/>for telling him to just stick to his own intellect and ingenuity and way of thinking.  He read out the 
<br/>entire press statement about this ITF Report.  I have the ITF Report here.  I said, “Who are they?, 
<br/>meaning what expertise do they have to assess the superannuation fund - a superannuation fund that 
<br/>has nearly 38 percent to 39 percent of our entire cash reserves in this country?  Who are they?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the level and credibility of their report.  If I could read out, Sir.  In order to show that 
<br/>the FNPF is not doing well, they say, “The loan was attacked (the loan to Fiji Airways) by Opposition 
<br/>politicians.    Opposition  Member,  Tanya  Waqanika,  criticised  the  Government  Guarantees  to  the 
<br/>Airlines stating how retirement savings are being used to prop up dead or life-support government 
<br/>statutories and the biggest threat is Fiji Airways.”  Then they go and quote honourable Gavoka saying 
<br/></span><span>that Fiji Airways can take the country down.  Then they go and quote Mr. Mahendra Chaudhry.  They 
<br/></span><span>used  that  as  the  basis  for  condemning  what  FNPF  is  doing  -  by  quoting  three  people  who  have 
<br/>absolutely no clue about the superannuation fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is really interesting.  Again, please, read it, it is there on page 31: “The Fiji Trade 
<br/>Union Congress (FTUC) claimed that the loan to Fiji Airways was a justified move.” What do they 
<br/>want?  They are saying FTUC was saying it was a justified move.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, they have quoted wrong figures. They are saying that we reduced the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNPF funds.  On page 33, it says, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  FNPF  rolled  out  withdrawal  assistance  programme  during  COVID-19  to 
<br/>ease the social and economic impacts of the pandemic.  The FNPF reported negative net 
<br/>contributions of $197 million in 2021 financial year.  This is the result of $104 million 
<br/>COVID-19 assistance payment paid from members’ funds during the year and a reduction 
<br/>in contribution totalling 8 percent - 5 percent from employers and three percent from in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2211 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>employees.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where did they get these figures from?  Completely incorrect!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the Report.  Honourable Ro Tuisawau holds it as some kind of Holy Grail.  Do you 
<br/>know it is like a super bullet to condemn FNPF?  This paper is not even worth it - I do not know, 
<br/>give it to kindergarten kids to write on.  That is the point.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the issue about freedom of expression - I do not even go on to that. 
<br/>The fact that the people are able to make the statements without anything happening to them, the fact 
<br/>that it is gratuitously published and broadcast in </span><span>Fiji Village</span><span> and </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> and nothing happens to 
<br/>them, means they have the freedom.  It means that you stand here and say things, you go outside 
<br/>there and say things, they make all sorts of statements, correct or not correct, they get published, that 
<br/>is what you call ‘freedom of expression’.  So, what we see from the Opposition is basically sarcasm, 
<br/>conjecture, obfuscation, obscurantism, speculation, disingenuity, and that is what the Opposition in 
<br/>themselves are actually involved in.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last point I wish to make just very quickly is that, they have gone on 
<br/></span><span>about Fiji Airways.  Before I say that, Sir, one of the well-known superannuation funds in the world 
<br/></span><span>with high levels of contribution, to contribute to the superannuation fundin Singapore, I think, it is 
<br/>somewhere like 32 or 38 percent.  Members contribute 18 percent of their salary and the employers 
<br/>contribute  (I  think)  10  percent  or  15  percent  of  their  salary.  We  have  flipped  it  around  where 
<br/>employers actually contributed more than the employees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, their superannuation fund has invested in their airports and in other key 
<br/>strategic investments that actually help the government and the country to propel themselves.  In the 
<br/>same way as the honourable Prime Minister highlighted, about this relationship with Health Care 
<br/>(Fiji) Limited.  Sir, Health Care (Fiji) Limited will provide open heart surgeries. Bulk of the FNPF 
<br/>members who faced medical problems and those procedures that cannot be provided in Fiji, take out 
<br/>their  funds  and  go  to  India  or  those  who  can  afford  it,  to  Australia  and  New  Zealand.    If  those 
<br/>procedures are going to be available in Fiji, what is wrong with that?  In fact, it is a benefit to the 
<br/>members.  They will be able to actually access those services here.  Money does not leave the country 
<br/>and when the Health Care (Fiji) Limited makes money, that money goes as an interest payment to 
<br/>their accounts.  Again, they do not think. There is absolutely no thought about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent investment by FNPF into Fiji Airways goes to show that 
<br/></span><span>they have made a very smart investment and I will tell you the reason why.  Because the share price 
<br/></span><span>which they have paid for at $4.22.  Before COVID-19, the share price in 2019 in Fiji Airways was 
<br/>$16 a share. They have now bought it at $4.22 a share.  With Fiji Airways flying the way it is with 
<br/>the borders being reopened within two years they will be able to double or triple the share value.  
<br/>That is what you call smart investment.  They did not do it as some willy-nilly investment and in the 
<br/>same way they made some smart investment in EFL.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, today Fiji Airways is 51 percent owned by the Fijian Government, FNPF 
<br/>owns 30 percent, Unit Trust of Fiji (UTOF) owns 1.58 percent, Qantas owns 16.45 percent and then 
<br/>Air New Zealand 0.68 percent, Kiribati 0.1 percent, Tonga 0.1 percent, Samoa 0.043 percent and 
<br/>Nauru 0.031 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the last point I wish to make, honourable Rasova listed down all the hotels that Fiji had 
<br/>that FNPF owns.  You know this is what you call smart investment. If you own the hotels you want 
<br/>to make sure that the hotels will be filled.  And how do the hotels get filled? When you get tourists.  
<br/>And how do the tourists come to Fiji, because this is a maritime country they come by an aeroplane.

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who owns the aeroplane?  You need to own the aeroplane.  You need to have the supply chain.  So 
<br/>you have the right packages done.  A hotel can do a package with an airline to fill up the rooms and 
<br/>then the workers get jobs in those hotels.  The young people get their pension paid when they retire, 
<br/>Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just very briefly these are the comments in respect of the FNPF Report.  I would like to thank 
<br/>the CEO and his team, the board, many of the board members do not even pick up fees unlike Mr. 
<br/>Daniel  Urai  and  Mr.  Felix  Anthony  who  used  to  pick  up  exorbitant  fees  for  even  sitting  in  sub-
<br/>committees.  A number of the board members of our FNPF do not actually even pick up any fees 
<br/>because they are doing it for the good of their country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank all those who are involved and we wish FNPF all the best and thank the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee for the Report.
