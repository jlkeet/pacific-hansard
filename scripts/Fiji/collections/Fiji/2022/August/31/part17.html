<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - NATIONAL FIRE AUTHORITY 2015 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was tabled on 11</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second  the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in exercising its powers under National Fire Services Act, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the National Fire Authority’s (NFA) responsibilities include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span>The corporate governance of NFA including the establishment of sub-committees; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span>Administration and operations of the national fire services; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span>Establishing strategies and objectives; 
<br/></span><span></span><span> </span><span>Monitoring the performance of management; 
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ensuring effective and efficient communication with all stakeholders; 
<br/>Appointment of officers of NFA;  
<br/>Ensuring effective human resources programmes for NFA; and 
<br/>Overseeing the development strategies for senior and high performance officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To streamline communications and better administer the organisation, the Authority established 
<br/>three  fire  divisions  namely,  Central/Eastern,  Northern  and  Western  Fire  Divisions  and  appointed 
<br/>Divisional Fire Officers to head these three Divisions. At the time of scrutiny of NFA’s 2015 Annual 
<br/>Report, there were a total of 21 fire stations around Fiji serving of which eight were commissioned in the 
<br/>past five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  NFA  also  formed  a  multi-agency  taskforce  committee  to  review  sub-standard  electrical 
<br/>appliances in early 2020.  The NFA employed aggressive fire safety awareness messages on television, 
<br/>radio, dailies, house to house awareness visit, and billboard and bus stop advertisements throughout 2015 
<br/>in efforts to curb the occurrence of fire incidents and fatalities. In 2015, the Authority continued to meet 
<br/>all of its obligations and fulfil its responsibilities whilst continuing with the efficient provision of fire and 
<br/>emergency management services to various communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make very brief contribution to the motion, I 
<br/></span><span>take this moment and stand with the </span><span>Bose ni Momo ni Yasana ko Ba </span><span>and the </span><span>Yasana o Ba </span><span>to pay tribute 
<br/>to the Head of the </span><span>Vanua o Betoraurau, Momo Levu na Tui Sabeto, </span><span>the late Ratu Tevita Susu Mataitoga.  
<br/>Sir, </span><span>Na  Momo Levu  na Tui Sabeto  </span><span>is  a paramount chief  and overlords seven  </span><span>yavusa  </span><span>in  the  </span><span>Vanua o 
<br/>Betoraurau </span><span>namely Conua, Leiwavuwavu, Nasara, Waruta, Leweidrasa, Ne and Leweikoro.  I join the 
<br/>chiefs of Ba, the RKS Old Boys community in the West and friends to thank </span><span>Na</span><span> </span><span>Momo Levu na Tui 
<br/>Sabeto </span><span>for his contribution to our province and send our condolences to the </span><span>Vanua o Betoraurau </span><span>and in 
<br/>particular the family.  May the </span><span>Momo Levu na Tui Sabeto’s </span><span>soul rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I choose to focus my contribution today to other matters raised by the auditor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in relation to National Fire Authority’s 2015 accounts and specifically for subsection (1) and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Authority has not been exercising Section 32(e) of the National Fire Service Act 
<br/>1994 whereby the owner of the property that is not insured is liable to pay to the Authority 
<br/>reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Authority in providing firefighting services.”

<div><span> Review Report-National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $60,000 have been billed by the Authority which is part of the outstanding 
<br/>debtors to- date.  Here we have the National Fire Authority trying its best to provide service for the 
<br/>protection  of  properties  and  in  the  process  is  accumulating  a  lot  more  debts.    Therefore,  I  call  on 
<br/>Government to either explore the provision of an affordable insurance for every household in Fiji as a 
<br/>property cover or to subsidise the cost incurred by the Authority in their effort to protect properties.  Sir, 
<br/>with those words, I fully support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak 
<br/>on the motion.  Let me first acknowledge the Chairman and the Committee Members for the Report and 
<br/>I also wish to acknowledge the executive management and service men and women of the National Fire 
<br/>Authority.  Although my contribution will not focus on the Report, for a few reasons I wanted to speak 
<br/>on this motion particularly based on the achievements, the progress and maybe the honourable Minister 
<br/>responsible will elaborate further on this; the achievements and the progress made by this institution 
<br/>since this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Saukuru has talked about the debt but like every organisation, they are doing 
<br/>their best in terms of debt recovery so that they can sustain their own operations and of course contribute 
<br/>to the overall development as well, not only in their specific area of work but of course in the wider 
<br/></span><span>development needs of Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is an organisation that we can say has made 
<br/></span><span>significant progress particularly in terms of its revenue collection, an institution that used to struggle 
<br/>previously. Of course there are challenges, the laws that we have and affordability as well when it comes 
<br/>to new rates, insurance and so forth that most of the people that we live within the municipal boundaries 
<br/>particularly do face.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  did  not  contribute  in  the  previous  motion  on  local  government  and 
<br/>environment because I would want to speak when we have this motion debated.  But if you can allow me 
<br/>just to say are few things, additional to what has been aired here in the previous motion, particularly in 
<br/>terms of the delays in the municipal councils about the implementation of projects.  As the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, the honourable Minister for Economy and the honourable Minister for Commerce, Trade, 
<br/>Tourism and Transport stated that it is not that simple. This is not the only Government that has these 
<br/>huge delays in big projects, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would recall that in Labasa there has been plans for ages to move Labasa Town to the other side 
<br/>of the river, but that has never taken place until 2008.  Now we have Damodar building their new complex 
<br/>there, FNU although the project is stalled and that has been discussed already in this Parliament.  We now 
<br/>see new investments taking place but that is a typical example of what has been in the pipeline for so long 
<br/></span><span>but never implemented, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Of course, there are some self-interest as well in that, that 
<br/></span><span>delayed the project but these are typical examples.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Labasa Hospital, I remember when the honourable Prime Minister came in 
<br/>one of his earlier visits to Vanua Levu and he was briefed by the Ministry of Health staff then (SDMO) 
<br/>about the project, that has taken about 10 years or so but still not completed.  What was projected to be a 
<br/>$3 million or $4 million project has reached about $12 million and yet it is not completed. The honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister made a promise that within 12 months from this date we will complete this hospital and 
<br/>services will be provided to the people.  So that was delivered but delayed.  It is not that simple as seems 
<br/>to  be  portrayed  by  are  few  Members  who  probably  have  not  had  enough  experience  in  serving  in 
<br/>institutions as such.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  back  to  the  National  Fire  Authority,  I  talked  about  the  progress  and  the 
<br/>improvements in this organisation that probably is worth mentioning in Parliament. Over the last few 
<br/>years, the National Fire Authority has constructed nine fire stations throughout the divisions particularly 
<br/>the Central, Northern and the Western Divisions.  In the Northern Division, Taveuni, who would imagine 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that Taveuni would one day have its own fire station together with the capabilities that are there?  I am 
<br/>saying this as the Minister responsible for rural development.  The new Fire Station in Savusavu, one in 
<br/>Seaqaqa although we are talking about Seaqaqa being declared as a town but the Fire Station is already 
<br/>there.  It brings a lot of confidence and assurance to the communities in Seaqaqa when we have this 
<br/>facility there.  We are talking about Nabouwalu becoming a town.  There is already a Fire Station state 
<br/>of the art sitting in Nabouwalu as we speak today, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Central Division Korovou is yet to be declared a town as well but they have the Fire Station 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>already there and hopefully next will be the swimming pool for Korovou Town before Sigatoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Davuilevu and Nakasi we have the new Fire Station there.  In the West one in Rakiraki Town, 
<br/>one in Korolevu.  In this year’s budget, $1million has been allocated for a new Fire Station in Navua 
<br/>Town.  This is an achievement that probably is beyond the imagination of most of our communities but 
<br/>of course thankful to this Government and the Executive Management of the National Fire Authority - 
<br/>these projects are happening throughout Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Fire Authority is also operating beyond its primary areas of focus and tasks.  I wish 
<br/>to commend them particularly on Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR).  They play 
<br/></span><span>an important role in rescue operations, particularly water rescue in the provision of water for hospitals, 
<br/></span><span>schools, Government facilities and even in the cleaning up of towns and cities - they play a prominent 
<br/>role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Provision of manpower:  As I have said this is beyond their areas of responsibilities as they deliver 
<br/>rations, they do extra work and also even in the Emergency Operation Centres (EOCs) at the Division or 
<br/>at the district level, they form the core of the operations and the planning team in the respective Divisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An area that we are also progressing together with the NFA is the possibility of using them as 
<br/>well. This is something that we learnt from the Australians and the New Zealand fire fighters, particularly, 
<br/>during  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>  when  they  were  also  able  to  do  structural  damage  assessments  on  buildings.    I 
<br/>remember that the school in Vanuabalavu was assessed by the Fire Authority Australia and New Zealand 
<br/>and this hopefully will be covered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most recently, just over the weekend the unfortunate incident in Kasavu, we saw the fire fighters 
<br/>again doing rescue and trying to do their best but unfortunately we lost two senior citizens as a result of 
<br/>that incident but this is something that needs to be acknowledged.  Their presence as I have alluded to in 
<br/>the Divisions, particularly in the rural stations has brought a lot of confidence to the local communities 
<br/></span><span>and not only that, they are very much part of the national building process in their respective communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another benefit that is coming out of these places is the value of the properties has improved 
<br/>because of NFA’s presence in those areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Like other Disciplined Forces, the NFA is 
<br/>very prominent in sports as well these days, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is our national teams, particularly in rugby 
<br/>– Rugby 7s and 15s.  We have members of the NFA in these teams.  Therefore, I feel obliged to express 
<br/>our appreciation to an organisation that deserves to be given that, as I have alluded to earlier on, based on 
<br/>the progress and the developments that have taken place in the institution over the years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we wish them well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and hopefully, more good things will come out 
<br/>of the organisation and significant improvements as well in the Report that we have before Parliament.  
<br/>Of course, I support the motion before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, for my brief contribution this afternoon, 
<br/>I would like to, first of all, thank Parliament for allowing the Committee to go for site visits to see firsthand 
<br/>and listen to the challenges by NFA, especially in the North, in Savusavu and Labasa, and how we were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>2240 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fortunate to be accompanied by the CEO, Mr. Puamau, and their National and Divisional Fire Officers.  
<br/>We are thankful to the NFA and also the CEO, that they even invited us to the opening of the Nabouwalu 
<br/>Fire Station.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  Member  of  the  Committee,  I  just  wish  to  touch  on  a  few  recommendations.    On 
<br/>Recommendation No. 1 - a Community Fire Warden framework be implemented in all communities to 
<br/>raise the level of awareness on fire prevention and mitigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very important recommendation based on the fact that previously, there 
<br/>used  to  be  voluntary  services  which  have  now  been  regularised  into  regular  fire  officers.    This 
<br/>recommendation was brought about when we asked questions to the Chairman and members of his staff 
<br/>that it would be another stepping stone for our community to find a permanent employment in the field 
<br/>of NFA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation  No.  2  -  recognise  the  importance  of  taking  the  NFA  services  to  the  rural 
<br/>communities  and  recommend  that  future  plan  establishment  be  prioritised  and  implemented.    The 
<br/>honourable Minister for Defence has alluded to that - the opening of the new NFA Station in Nabouwalu.  
<br/>With regards to the budget, I am sure we were told that there would be a sub-station coming up in Matei 
<br/></span><span>in the near future, and we look forward to that.  It is important that fire services is centralised to the rural 
<br/></span><span>communities as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, on Recommendation No. 4 - the NFA continues to invest in upgrading its 
<br/>vehicle fleet that are conducive to all road conditions and comply with international standards.  I am sure 
<br/>this is important recommendation as well and hope that the NFA will take that on board, based on the 
<br/>fact that they need the vehicles to transport water and Fire Officers to the various parts where they are 
<br/>needed and in doing so that the vehicle itself has to be conducive to the road conditions, especially the 
<br/>hilly parts for where they serve.  That is my contribution Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I wish the NFA well in 
<br/>their service to the country.  </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/>Pillay.  I begin by thanking the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for 
<br/>their comprehensive deliberations of the Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Fire Authority (NFA) provides an essential service for our nation.  
<br/>Keeping our people safe is of utmost importance to my Government and NFA plays a crucial part in 
<br/>ensuring that we are able to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since its establishment, NFA has grown and broadened its services to provide a wide range of 
<br/>risk reduction and fire response and suppression services, significantly minimising the effects of fire and 
<br/>related life-threatening emergencies.  Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are 21 Fire Stations in the country, 
<br/>eight of which were commissioned in the last five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this year, I opened a new $1.35 million Fire Station in Vanua Levu and 
<br/>we continue to invest in improving our emergency services.  My Government recognises the critical need 
<br/>for access to efficient and effective emergency services for all Fijians.  Additionally, by investing in this 
<br/>critical sector, we also increase business and homeowner confidence, and reassure investors that Fiji can 
<br/>provide the safe environment they are looking for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note that during the review period, Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA responded to 127 structural fires, 
<br/>mainly electrical-related.  This has continued to be a concern as NFA reported that they responded to 687 
<br/>structural fires across the country from 2017 to 2021.  Fire safety should be of paramount concern and 
<br/>priority for all Fijians and I urge everyone to be vigilant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2241 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA does not only focus on putting out fires but also on prevention, safety and 
<br/>recovery.    I  commend  their  commitment  to  raising  awareness  on  fire  safety,  particularly  during  the 
<br/>COVID-19 pandemic when most people were at home.  It is devastating when people face loss that could 
<br/>have been prevented with due diligence - even one fire is one to many.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we continue to strengthen Fiji’s emergency services, Mr. Speaker, Sir, including the NFA, I 
<br/>urge all Fijians to ensure fire safety measures are being observed at home, at work, at school, in places of 
<br/>worship and everywhere else where people converge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we continue our resilient recovery, it is critical, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we practice fire safety, 
<br/>along with COVID-19 safety for the benefit of all Fijians.  Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the motion that is 
<br/>before Parliament.   The  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and the  National  Fire Authority  (NFA) have 
<br/>considered the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, and I would like to 
<br/>thank the Committee for this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to specifically focus on the seven recommendations made by the 
<br/></span><span>Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs.    On  Recommendation  No.  1  –  NFA  has  identified  1,193 
<br/>settlements around Fiji to implement the Community Fire Warden Framework in the next five years.  The 
<br/>Authority  received  positive  feedbacks  from  the  communities  where  Community  Fire  Warden  is 
<br/>established.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the launch of this programme at Yako Village in 2021, NFA has trained a total of 428 
<br/>Community Fire Wardens in 23 communities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, these Community Fire Wardens were 
<br/>trained  in  the  area  of  fire  safety  surveillance  so  that  fire  safety  compliance  are  met  within  their 
<br/>communities or villages.  And at this point, I want to respond to honourable Dr. Lalabalavu’s question.  
<br/>He was asking whether these Community Fire Wardens will be absorbed in the service and whether they 
<br/>will find an employment.  This is a volunteer programme which is launched by NFA and this is only to 
<br/>protect the village and communities. So, when these wardens are trained, particularly in the surveillance 
<br/>work and compliance, they will be able to check the village to see that people meet that compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  communities  that  have  recently  completed  their  Community  Fire  Warden 
<br/>Training Programme, include; communities in Bau Island in Tailevu and Nabukavesi Village in Namosi. 
<br/>This year NFA will conduct training in 36 communities around Fiji, and this programme is more of a 
<br/></span><span>community awareness-related and it is done through community volunteers, what we called as ‘wardens’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 2, NFA acknowledges the importance of taking NFA 
<br/>services to rural communities.  Even though is legally mandated to operate within the boundaries, they 
<br/>have been providing services to rural communities outside the municipal boundaries and gazetted district.  
<br/>This is in accordance with the Government mandate to provide same level of services received by urban 
<br/>communities to those living in the rural communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to three Fire Stations they have established in the rural areas which we have heard 
<br/>from honourable Seruiratu, NFA has acquired nine pieces of land for future establishment.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, NFA has also identified areas to establish fire station but land is yet to be acquired, for example, in 
<br/>Matei, Taveuni and in Dreketi, Macuata, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 3, I am pleased to inform Parliament that the priorities 
<br/>of  the  NFA  has  been  streamlined  into  a  five-year  Strategic  Plan  2021-2026.    The  Authority  is  now 
<br/>conducting  compulsory  fire  safety  inspections  to  determine  compliance  in  all  commercial  buildings, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report-National Fire Authority 2015 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>including MSMEs.  MSMEs will an annual gross turnover of below $500,000 is exempted from paying 
<br/>the instruction fees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address the fire and emergency safety issues, NFA implemented the Fire Safety Awareness 
<br/>Programme in all Divisions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Programme includes daily activities in all Fire Stations 
<br/>around the country, involving house to house visits, business house visits and school visits.  For general 
<br/>awareness, radio and television advertisement on fire safety messages are used. Radio Talk Back Shows, 
<br/>Buses carrying fire safety messages and fire safety tips on billboards are placed.  In addition, the Authority 
<br/>conducts  Fire  Safety  Training  for  relevant  businesses.  This  training  in  designed  after  Fire  Safety 
<br/>Compliance Inspections are carried out in the building premises. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The training programmes relate to firefighting team training, confined space training, breathing 
<br/>apparatus training, fire safety at work training and fire evacuation drills.  And as we have heard from the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, the Authority attended to 687 structural fires across the country where Fijians 
<br/>lost $288 million.  Further to the fire safety training, the Authority is in the process of developing its 
<br/>Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 4, the Authority invests in upgrading its fleet. The 
<br/></span><span>current fleet includes; 21 twin cabs, 53 fire and specialised appliances, 9 emergency ambulances and 3 
<br/></span><span>executive vehicles for 21 Fire Stations around the country.  Sir, NFA will be procuring another 2 x 3,000 
<br/>litre fire trucks and 2 ambulances in this financial year with the Government grant.  And recently with 
<br/>Government funding, NFA procured two 4 x 4 300 litre fire appliances at a cost of $900,000 which are 
<br/>designed for rugged roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Recommendation No. 5, NFA is working closely with Water Authority of 
<br/>Fiji (WAF) on fire hydrants and GIS mapping of water mains.  Such information will assist NFA to 
<br/>demarcate areas which will need support in boosting the water, a water pressure during a fire emergency.  
<br/>Discussion is going on with WAF to link GIS to NFA’s command centre.  This will help officers to liaise 
<br/>with WAF contacts to boost water pressure where pressure is low during fire emergency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA is building capacity of its workforce locally and internationally.  They 
<br/>have been trained in  fire  and  rescue operations with counterparts in Japan,  Indonesia, Singapore  and 
<br/>Malaysia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Recommendation  No.  7,  to  strengthen  fire  emergency  response  and  operations,  NFA  has 
<br/>engaged  with  local  companies  such  as  BIMA  Holdings,  Rattans  Transport,  Water  Authority  of  Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>Kashmir  Transport  and  Juicy  Transport  to  provide  water  tankers  during  fire  emergencies  and  with 
<br/></span><span>Vatukoula Gold Mine for fire trucks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, NFA engages with overseas agencies such as the Country Fire Authority in Australia (that is 
<br/>in Victoria) for fire investigations and other fire operation and consultation.  NFA is collaborating with 
<br/>relevant stakeholders to create a guideline on the standards for importation of electrical appliances into 
<br/>the country, 31 percent of structural fires are as a result of electrical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  multi-agency  taskforce  is  set  up  to  review  sub-standard  electrical  appliances  and  electrical 
<br/>components coming to Fiji.  The taskforce consists of representatives from the Ministry of Commerce,

<div><span> Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Authority  has  taken  genuine  steps  to  rectify  the  issues 
<br/>highlighted by the Committee.  I also take this opportunity to respond to honourable Saukuru, he raised 
<br/>his concern that NFA is not collecting the debts.  This debt is related to uninsured properties so if the 
<br/>property is uninsured when NFA provides services, then the property owners are charged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, NFA is working on a Cabinet Paper to amend section 22(e) because we realise that only 10 
<br/>percent of properties in Fiji are insured and the chances are that fire can occur anywhere and when fire 
<br/>occurs, people lose their properties, belongings and on top of that, they have to pay NFA and it is not fair.  
<br/>We will be developing a Cabinet Paper on that Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister had already said that 
<br/>but I just wanted this to be brought to the attention of Parliament the amount of money that we make 
<br/>available  to  NFA.    As  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  highlighted  and  also  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/>highlighted, there has been a record number of outlets (I could say for one of the better word) for NFA 
<br/>throughout Fiji.  In the past five years the allocation of $3.85 million for capital projects and also $2.3 
<br/>million operating grant including ambulance services that they do provide through NFA too.  I would like 
<br/>to thank the Committee’s Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/></span></div>
