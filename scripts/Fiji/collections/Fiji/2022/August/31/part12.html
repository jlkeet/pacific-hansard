<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – FIJI NATIONAL PROVIDENT FUND  
<br/>2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2019, 2020 and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2021 Annual Reports which were tabled on 10th May, 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FNPF  is  Fiji’s  largest  financial  institution.  
<br/>Established over 50 years ago, it is Fiji’s only superannuation fund committed to securing the future 
<br/>of Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FNPF  is  a  defined  contribution  fund  that  provides  superannuation  services  to  its 
<br/>members.  The FNPF Act 2011 guides the operations of the Fund.  As such, FNPF is mandated by 
<br/></span><span>law to collect compulsory contributions from all employees and employers towards the retirement 
<br/></span><span>savings of all workers in Fiji.  Apart from retirement savings, the Fund also provides pre-retirement 
<br/>benefits such as housing, medical and education assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, FNPF is a major investor in Fiji and one of the country’s largest property owners.  The 
<br/>Fund also owns majority shares in Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Limited, Vodafone Fiji Limited, 
<br/>HFC Bank, and fully owns the Natadola Bay Resort Ltd., that is, the InterContinental Fiji Golf Resort 
<br/>and Spa, Holiday Inn in Suva, Momi Bay Resort Pte Ltd, that is, the Fiji Marriott Resort, Marriot 
<br/>Denarau Properties and the Grand Pacific Hotel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fund recorded a net income of $543 million in 2021, compared to $370 million in 2020. 
<br/>Strong performance in fixed income and treasury investments contributed $331.3 million towards 
<br/>the net income.  Other investment portfolio such as equity, commercial loans and properties added 
<br/>$212.1 million as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to such steady performance, an interest rate of 5 percent was declared and $302.8 million 
<br/>was distributed to 389,986 members.  The Funds’ net assets as at 2021 stood at $8.2 billion with a 
<br/>growth rate of 3.5 percent.  The investments portfolio generated return on investment of 6.5 percent 
<br/></span><span>overall.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the 2021 Annual Report outlined the following key activities to be rolled out: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Development  of  disruption  framework  that  would  encompass  measures  to  be  followed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during disruption events, such as pandemic, natural disaster, et cetera;

<div><span>Review  of  the  Fund’s  human  resource  processes  to  ensure  its  relevance  is  dictated  by 
<br/>changing environment and business needs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Robust learning and development programmes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Continuation of the Funds’ succession planning programme to ensure talent is managed 
<br/>appropriately and leadership skills continue to be developed and sustained; and

<div><span>manage the effects of COVID-19 on its members and staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.R. LEAWERE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to contribute very briefly on the 
<br/>Review Report of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2019, 2020 and 2021 which is before Parliament 
<br/>this  morning.    I  thank  the  Chairman  of  the  Standing  Committee  and  Members,  as  well  as  the 
<br/>Secretariat for this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) was formed to ensure that workers 
<br/>in Fiji had a decent life at retirement and according to its vision of securing our future and in fact the 
<br/>mission statement also reflects what the Fund is supposed to do, that is, to understand its customers, 
<br/>offer services and ensure sustainable returns for a meaningful retirement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one must ask, what does this mean?  In reality, come retirement with 
<br/>the 70 percent members who have below $10,000 in their accounts, they would have virtually nothing 
<br/></span><span>to support them financially.  The Scheme condemns the workers to extreme poverty and, in fact, into 
<br/></span><span>the category of destitute. This is a concern for the workers, Sir, as clearly, the richer are getting richer 
<br/>while the poor are condemned to poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, with the Government imposing fixed term contracts causing job insecurity, hardship in 
<br/>securing bank loans for housing, education and medical treatment, the Government uses FNPF as a 
<br/>cash cow to help workers of this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We see that the Vision Statement is very odd in terms of what FNPF is currently doing.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, FNPF needs to walk the talk and make workers their priority rather than using their 
<br/>members’ funds for government borrowings and of which they have a right to be informed about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also of concern, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the changing of the law to suit the Governments’ agenda 
<br/>of  choosing  who  they  want  to  be  Board  members.    This  is  a  deviation  from  why  FNPF  was 
<br/>established. In the absence of the workers representatives in the Board, Sir, the Government can do 
<br/>whatever they want because those making decisions are like pawns in a chess game - you put them 
<br/>there and everywhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This breeds wastage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, by poor decision-making when there are no workers 
<br/></span><span>representatives to provide the checks and balances and does not reflect proper financial management.  
<br/>In  the  case  of  Fiji  Airways  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Board  has  demonstrated  its  total  disregard  for 
<br/>workers’ fundamental rights and has shown no sensitivity to those who put money into FNPF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Committee’s observation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is of concern that the FNPF was not 
<br/>able  to  disclose  to  them  the  entities  who  had  defaulted  on  repayments.    The  FNPF  informed  the 
<br/>Committee that it was bound by the confidentiality clause of those loan agreements, which further 
<br/>assured that all loans went through a vigorous process which were vetted by a three-tiered committee 
<br/>system before being tabled to the Board for approval or otherwise.  Of course, in the absence of the 
<br/>workers representatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Committee of Parliament has the  necessary  powers to  obtain any information  from  any 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>entity.  It begs the question, who is who in this case? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations of the Committee are quite pertinent and I hope that

<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNPF take this on board.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank the Chairman of the Standing 
<br/>Committee for the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  LT.  COL.  P  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  this  Review  Report  focusses  on  three 
<br/>FNPF Annual Reports, namely from 2019 to 2021, ending on 30</span><span>th</span><span> June,  2021.  The 2022 Annual 
<br/>Report has not been released yet, and even if it was, it would not have been reviewed to-date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, FNPF Reports are released in a timely manner.  One wonders, why? Maybe, it is 
<br/>due to the fact that FNPF is not funded by taxpayers, but by the workers of Fiji, and the Government-
<br/>control Board of FNPF has no choice…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P TIKODUADUA.- ….but to strictly adhere to the timeline, as far as the 
<br/>announcement  of  dividend  for  members,  as  well  as  the  publication  and  release  of  the  Report  is 
<br/>concerned.  At least, Mr. Speaker, we get to know how much debt the Government has, or where the 
<br/>bulk of the workers’ money has gone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As at 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2021, Government’s debt stock with FNPF stood at $3.5 billion. Undoubtedly, 
<br/></span><span>it has increased like it does every year, so let us make realistic comparisons.  As of 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2021, 
<br/>the total  Government  debt,  according to  the 2021-2022 Budget  Fiscal  and Economic Update was 
<br/>forecasted at $7.6 billion, which means that as of the last financial year, Government’s debt portfolio 
<br/>with FNPF was 46 percent of its total forecast debt as of July 2021.  Has this increased or decreased?  
<br/>Only the honourable Minister for Economy, the FNPF Board and the Executive Management can 
<br/>answer this, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the most alarming fact, Mr. Speaker, is that, 80.5 percent of FNPF members had balances 
<br/>of less than $20,000 in their accounts as of 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2021.  It meant that 359,516 out of a total of 
<br/>446,658 members had less than $20,000 as their fund balances.  It is not surprising, therefore, that 
<br/>only a little over 4 percent of members opted for the Pension Scheme upon their retirement. This 
<br/>means that 96 percent of the total eligible members who have full access to their funds, withdrew 
<br/>every cent.  Why?  Because at 9 percent annuity, even a member having a balance of $20,000 will 
<br/>receive $1,800 per annum as pension or $150 per month for their survival. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, while all honourable Members of Parliament living beyond 30 kilometres of this Chamber 
<br/>received $350 per day allowance or the honourable Prime Minister receiving an average of $3,000 
<br/></span><span>in daily allowance alone for overseas travel, Mr. Speaker, is this fair? The FNPF can post annual 
<br/></span><span>dividends of 7 percent but it does not change the fact that 18.5 percent of its members would receive 
<br/>a maximum of $150 per month full pension for their survival.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  late  Mr.  Ambalal  Dahyabhai  Patel  or  Mr.  A.D.  Patel,  the  founder  leader  of  the 
<br/>National  Federation  Party  moved  a  motion  in  the  Legislative  Council  in  March  1965,  for  the 
<br/>establishment of a social security scheme or a provident fund to lift ordinary workers out of poverty, 
<br/>he would have never envisioned that 57 years later, 80.5 percent of workers of such a scheme would 
<br/>have savings far below than they desired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fair game saw things that FijiFirst Government that taught to shred the pension contract and 
<br/>force members who are decreed to a pension rate of less than 9 percent of their savings.  Even if a 
<br/>member’s balance upon retirement is  $10,000 and the member withdraws lump sum, the average 
<br/>spend per month would be $133.23 and the member will exhaust the funds forever. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the member chooses to go on pension, he or she will reserve $100 per month because 9

<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2199 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent gives only $75 per month and the minimum rate stipulated in the FNPF Decree of 2011 is 
<br/>$100.  Who can survive on $100 per month?  Try telling that to the current Government which only 
<br/>knows its insatiable hunger for power, even if it means imposing suffering and misery on our people.  
<br/>We have already seen this, but this Government which refuses to get off its ivory tower in the form 
<br/>of Level 9, as well as from black dark-tinted Prado four-wheel drives cannot see the reality on the 
<br/>ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. P.TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why we are saying that this 
<br/>Government is treating FNPF like a cash cow.  Over 359,000 members will receive pittance, if they 
<br/>choose  to  retire  and  if  they  go  for  social  pension  scheme  or  welfare  as  well,  they  will  receive  a 
<br/></span><span>saqamoli </span><span>per day for $180 for six months.  No wonder we have people with permits from District 
<br/>Offices to  raise  funds for medical  treatment  or burnt homes because this Government’s so-called 
<br/>“social wages” is a colossal failure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kicked from pillar to post, our workers about to retire have nightmares.  This is not giving 
<br/></span><span>anyone a leg-up, or leaving no one behind.  It is trampling upon them.  Why is this happening, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker?  Because this tripartisam on the FNPF has been removed and because this Government rule 
<br/>by Decrees and change laws to suit its agenda, long before it sets itself out to be a political party.  But 
<br/>that will end soon, Mr. Speaker, and I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.V. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I rise to make a contribution to the Fiji National 
<br/>Provident Fund (FNPF) Review Report and I would like to enlighten and remind Parliament of the 
<br/>Mission Statement of FNPF which is “securing  your future”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my contribution, I will focus on the membership of the FNPF Fund and 
<br/>as  already  highlighted  and  briefly  touched  on  by  honourable  Tikoduadua,  I  will  be  specifically 
<br/>looking at the 2021 Report which says that the total membership is 446,658.  Out of that, members 
<br/>that have less than $5,000 contribution is 188,288 and of that amount, there is also those holding zero 
<br/>balance, which it is 58,712.  It is interesting to note that the members holding zero balance continue 
<br/>to appear in the annual reports and they range between 50,000 and even over 60,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  total  membership,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  those  holding  zero  balance  to  maximum 
<br/></span><span>$40,000,  there  is  a  total  of  406,204  members.    That  is  about  90.9  percent  of  the  total  number  of 
<br/></span><span>446,658.  For members that hold above $40,000 and taking it up to over $500,000, there is only 40,634 
<br/>members and that only accounts to about 9.9 percent of the total membership, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is 
<br/>important  for  us  to  note  these  numbers  because  it  could  be  misleading  in  regards  to  their  Mission 
<br/>Statement in securing your future because 90.9 percent of this total membership sits only to a maximum 
<br/>of $40,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, particularly after COVID-19, members were encouraged by Government policy 
<br/>to dip into their FNPF to be able to help themselves.  Sir, that would mostly affect those who are sitting 
<br/>with $5,000 to less than $10,000, or even $40,000 contributions.  With that in mind, a lot of those people 
<br/>may still be out of jobs.  How will these people help themselves, to be able to have a secure future, 
<br/>according to the Mission Statement of the Fund?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there is a requirement by the Department of Social Welfare that if you have been a member 
<br/>of FNPF, then you would not be entitled to social welfare. So that picture gives a kind of gloom future 
<br/>for those sitting on $40,000 and below, which is 406,024 members, or 90.9 percent of those members. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  future  looks  very  gloomy  for  90.9  percent  or  406,024  members  in  our 
<br/>country, particularly during this economic challenging times brought about by COVID-19.  So we can 
<br/>anticipate that a big number of our population sitting at 400,000 would not be benefiting from Social 
<br/>Welfare, after they finish from the Fund.  Also, you will note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that a big number of those 
<br/>who hold less than $5,000 are sitting on 55 years and above, and that is, 11,212 members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also with that big number, it kind of reflects an unequal distribution of wealth 
<br/>with those sitting with more than $100,000 to over $500,000.  The numbers are smaller, it is only a pocket 
<br/>of our population who have that kind of savings in their account.  Also, a question comes to mind in 
<br/>regards to investment.  According to the Report, the Fund will explore investment opportunities in the 
<br/>agriculture sector, business process outsourcing, healthcare, retail manufacturing, financial and insurance 
<br/>sector, infrastructure assets, et cetera.  A question that also comes to mind, Sir, is that in the 2019 Report, 
<br/>the Chairman had highlighted the FNPF’s role in assisting members to achieve a better quality of life, 
<br/>must strike a balance with the need to save sufficiently for retirement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, members can only save for retirement, if they are in gainful employment.  Also, 
<br/>members who are retiring have funds.  A question that we can ask is, how can these individual members 
<br/>be assisted?  A lot of these members have worked throughout their lives, they have not really done any 
<br/></span><span>sort of business or engaged in businesses opportunities, whereby they could invest their FNPF savings.  
<br/></span><span>So, rather than just the Fund concentrating on the organisational investment, if the Fund could also look 
<br/>at individual opportunities for members that have FNPF savings and would like, for example, to invest 
<br/>in the agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How  does  the  FNPF  link  up  with  the  Fiji  Development  Bank  (FDB)  for  small  business  and 
<br/>medium enterprises to help members invest their funds into some kind of business opportunity whereby 
<br/>they  themselves  can  engage  in  business  rather  than  relying  on  FNPF  to  engage  on  investment 
<br/>opportunities that are there?  That is something that comes to mind when reading through the Report if 
<br/>individual opportunities for members could also be accorded to them by the FNPF Board, with some kind 
<br/>of, maybe hand holding initiative in those sectors that I have already highlighted where the FNPF intends 
<br/>to invest in.  That being said, so the members could also be empowered with regards to investing their 
<br/>own savings into business opportunities that the Board could assist them access in terms of sustaining 
<br/>their retirement and having financial independence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they get very excited every time I stand up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday we discussed the work of the Committee.  That is an interesting point because in the 
<br/>Committee we have members from the Government and Opposition.  In the Committee, we work very 
<br/>well together and that is why we produce the Committee Report, but when we come here, as I explained, 
<br/>we can add additional information for the sake of the public and also to assist Parliament with further 
<br/>information.  So the bipartisanship is working well, it is just at the PM level and AG level that is not 
<br/>working, and they need to make it work.  I note from the Report, if you look at recommendation three of 
<br/>the Committee, they mentioned Aspen.  I support the call by the NFP leader regarding an investigation 
<br/>into that partnership.  Aspen formed a partnership in 2019 and it resulted in the creation of a subsidiary 
<br/>company, Health Care (Fiji) Pte. Limited which oversees the running of Ba and Lautoka Hospitals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNPF had pumped $10.1million over the past three years into the Public-Private Partnership 
<br/>company with Aspen.  Apart from FNPF’s investment of $10.1million, $424,000 was borrowed by Aspen 
<br/>from FNPF as highlighted in the Fund’s 2019 Report.  Also noted in that suggestion, $10.1 million was

<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2201 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>injected in three instalments: 2019 - $1.224 million; 2020 - $3.2 million and 2021 shows an investment 
<br/>of a further $5.7 million totalling $10.1million.  The public needs to know how has this been spent, and 
<br/>the returns, of course, might be in a few years, so what are the expected returns?  Those details need to 
<br/>be clear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2021 Report shows the value of 80 percent ownership by FNPF of Health Care (Fiji) Pte.  
<br/>Limited is $6.109 million, somehow amazingly rising from $1.87 million in 2020.  So, $10.1 million of 
<br/>workers’ money has been pumped into this so-called partnership but the 380,000 people that were 
<br/>supposed to benefit are still waiting for the much promised world class health and medical services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to add that the open heart surgery which was supposed to happen in Lautoka, 
<br/>that has been announced quite a few times and we are still waiting for that.  I think it has been shifted 
<br/>about four times, so the sooner that eventuates, the better, if not, do not announce it.  Just announce 
<br/>it when it happens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently  on  the  FNPF,  there  have  been  suggestions  by  International  Transport  Workers’ 
<br/>Federation (ITF) with FTUC and when they did that, the honourable Attorney-General said, “who 
<br/>are they?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, who are they?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.-   They recommended an urgent independent review.  Again, we 
<br/>fully  support  this.    I  support  the  NFP  Leader  in  his  suggestion  for  a  review  and  some  of  their 
<br/>recommendations to have worker representatives on the FNPF Board, separation of asset investment 
<br/>and management of the Fund from the functions of the Board of Directors.  Regulations and laws 
<br/>that govern FNPF stipulates clearly, fiduciary duty, what that means in practice and regulations that 
<br/>stipulate how the interest of members are defined and reviewed in consultation with its members.  So 
<br/>they note from that that it is important to have a scrutiny on government structures of these provident 
<br/>funds so that they do what they are intended to do.  Sir, ITF and FTUC were of the view that it is 
<br/>critically important that the Fijian Parliament takes on board those recommendations.  So that is why 
<br/>I am mentioning it here but unfortunately honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Economy 
<br/>has totally rubbished this Report and even the ITF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Yes, who are they?

<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Let me read out the statement by the FTUC National Secretary, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Felix Anthony.  So it is good to read it out because we have to be here for the workers, unlike 
<br/></span><span>the Government of the day.  It reads, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The honourable Attorney-General has again displayed his ignorance and arrogance 
<br/>when questioning the credibility of the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF).  
<br/>The ITF is a Global Union Federation of all transport workers’ unions around the world 
<br/>based in London.  It has 20 million members…” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is questioning, who are they?  Fiji’s population is not even one million and they are asking, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are they?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…  represented  in  the  aviation,  shipping,  road  transport  and  railways  in  150 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countries.  It has 6 affiliates in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Attorney-General  would do himself a favour if he simply read the  report and 
<br/>understood its contents rather than making personal attacks to deflect the real issues. The

<div><span> Review Report – FNPF 2019-2021 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>report is a fair and independent overview of the Fund and makes clear recommendations.  
<br/>It is not meant to be a criticism of the Fund but to raise legitimate concerns that we believe 
<br/>needs to be addressed for the betterment of the Fund and its members.  It must be clearly 
<br/>understood that the FNPF is a workers’ superannuation fund and not an extension of the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy or the AG’s slush fund.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- </span><span>Areh!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- It continues, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We  have  raised  these  concerns  from  the  reports  that  FNPF  makes  public.  
<br/>Thousands of members in the Fund have zero balance.  Even if we were to accept the 
<br/>AG’s  explanation  that  70  %  of  members’  savings  is  in  preserved  accounts,  a  $20,000 
<br/>savings  would  mean  $14,000  in  preserved  account  for  retirement.    That  is  grossly 
<br/>insufficient  for  a  secure  future  which  FNPF  reminds  us  daily.  The  AG  talks  about 
<br/>Government’s unemployment assistance but very conveniently does not talk about the 
<br/>millions of dollars that workers were enticed into withdrawing from their own savings to 
<br/>survive.  He is still not talking about whether this government will repay the withdrawals 
<br/></span><span>that members made during the pandemic and other natural crisis to survive.  He is not 
<br/></span><span>telling the members of the fund whether the Government or employers would refund to 
<br/>the workers the reduction of employer contribution from 10% to 5% and now 6% now 
<br/>that  employers  are  back  on  their  feet.    These  cuts  are  tantamount  to  a  wage  cut  and 
<br/>continues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The AG talks about a ‘sophisticated analysis’ which sounds hollow in the face of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the state of the economy … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Yes, you do not have any.
