<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HOUSING  
<br/>AND ENVIRONMENT ANNUAL REPORTS 2015 - 2018 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of the Ministry of Local Government, Housing and 
<br/>Environment Annual Reports for 2015, 2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 which was tabled on 
<br/>10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, following reforms, the Ministry of  Local Government, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing and Environment has now been split into the Ministry of Local Government, Ministry of
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2221 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing and Community Development and Ministry of Environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government is responsible for the overall administration and regulation of 
<br/>Municipal Councils and oversight of National Fire Authority (NFA) through the Local Government Act 
<br/>1972 and the National Fire Services Act 1994 respectively.  The Ministry monitors Municipal Councils 
<br/>in line with specific bylaws of the 13 Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also ensures that policy reforms are in accordance with the needs of the Councils 
<br/>and the communities.  Its programmes are funded by Government grants.  To maintain public safety and 
<br/>security, the Ministry also works closely with the NFA in issuing operational grants, funding fire station 
<br/>upgrades and subsidising the purchase of emergency fleet and life-saving equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Housing and Community Development, on the other hand, is responsible for the 
<br/>strategic  policy,  funding  assistance  and  monitoring  of  Fiji’s  housing  system.    It  plays  a  lead  role  in 
<br/>promoting and facilitating the provision of accessible and adequate housing for low and middle-income 
<br/>households and people living in informal settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry was established in 2018 as a dedicated standalone line Ministry with a single focus 
<br/></span><span>on  the  housing  sector,  bringing  together  Fiji’s  long  running  urban  housing  programme,  previously 
<br/></span><span>overseen by the Department of Housing, within the wider Ministry of Local Government.  The Ministry 
<br/>oversees and contributes to the development and monitoring of all housing-related legislation, including 
<br/>the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span><span></span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Act 1955; 
<br/>Fair Rents Act 1965; and 
<br/>Unit Titles Act 1985. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of the major  achievements of the Ministry  in the 2017-2018 financial  year include the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Three new Fire Stations were commissioned to serve the people of Taveuni, Seaqaqa and 
<br/>Savusavu. 
<br/>73  major  developments  were  approved,  costing  approximately  $324,433,890.  This 
<br/>included;  the  Wainibuku  Subdivision,  Seashell  Cove  Resort  and  Sun  Insurance 
<br/>Commercial Complex. 
<br/>430 applicants received grants, of which 156 applicants received a $5,000 grant and 274 
<br/></span><span>applicants received a $10,000 grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Garvey Park in Tavua and Ganilau Park in Savusavu were re-developed with facilities, such 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as convenience, construction of the hall, pavilion, floodlights, et cetera. 
<br/>1,423 applications were approved for the subdivision of land. 
<br/>298 rural rezoning applications were approved. 
<br/>37 recipients of the Fire Victim Assistance benefitted and $185,000 was paid out. 
<br/>11 settlement socio-economic surveys were conducted.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. BULANAUCA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Report by the Committee but I wish 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to say and elaborate on a few of the observations and  recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, on the Lautoka Swimming Pool, a peer review has been conducted and the way forward 
<br/></span><span>will depend on the report by the consultant.  Is that report now on hand?  What does the report say that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>2222 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Lautoka ratepayers and the public need to know?  How much did it cost, is it $14 million or $10 
<br/>million?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I stand to be corrected but it is a lot of money compared to $30,000, $40,000 and being taken 
<br/>to court.  Were there investigations carried out?  Was FICAC investigations carried out?  What is the 
<br/>conclusion of that?  It is important as a Government to ensure that things come to conclusion of what has 
<br/>been done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, on the Sigatoka River Bank Upgrade, the Sigatoka Town Council took legal action 
<br/>against a consultant for the structural failure.  What is the status of that now?  Legal action has been taken.  
<br/>What is the result of that legal action, particularly for the consultant and the failure of the river bank 
<br/>upgrade whether in Sigatoka Town or other villages nearby - Yavulo, Sigatoka, Nayawa and Laselase?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to ensure that the river banks are steady rather than is the money spent there for 
<br/>consulting and structural work?  It has failed.  How much has it cost us? Those are what we need to know 
<br/>and need to be clarified to the Sigatoka people and the public at large.  So, it is important to conclude 
<br/>with those and come out with a status of those projects, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Nabouwalu,  Keiyasi,  Korovou  and  Seaqaqa  town  developments,  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/></span><span>Government ensures that the development of those satellite towns and major projects be completed by 
<br/>scheduled deadlines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to concentrate on Nabouwalu.  What was the deadline?  I understand it was 2016, we 
<br/>have gone past that.  Again, promised for the 2018 Elections and, again, 2018 has passed.   Now, we are 
<br/>still talking about the development of Nabouwalu in 2022, six years or seven years later on.  So it is 
<br/>important that when we have a deadline to meet, we must ensure that the funding, resources and expertise 
<br/>are spent and done on it to ensure that the projects are completed within that time or a little bit past that 
<br/>time.  That is acceptable to the people. So, it is important that the scheduled deadlines are known for the 
<br/>Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Korovou and Seaqaqa town developments.  But if you cannot complete it, do not 
<br/>worry, we will come next year and complete it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am just letting you know of the things that need to be done.  For Nabouwalu, it is important to 
<br/>encourage economic development in the area to ensure that the township of Nabouwalu is meaningful 
<br/>for agricultural purposes, industrial and manufacturing.  We need to open up areas.  Land is available 
<br/>there that can be used for agricultural, industrial and commercial purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There needs to be a plan and vision surrounding Nabouwalu to develop economic activities to 
<br/>ensure livelihood and meaningful development of such a township.  Before you can have a township like 
<br/>that, it is important to have a secure source of energy, particularly in Nabouwalu that has been diesel all 
<br/>along. At 10 o’clock at night, you off the generator until morning at about 4 o’clock or 6 o’clock, then 
<br/>you switch it on again.  We need the power that can work 24 hours a day for seven days a week, 365 days 
<br/>a year all around.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to ensure power is secure and as I have already mentioned and I need to repeat it - 
<br/>there are many sources of power around there that you need to connect them to ensure larger sources of 
<br/>energy around that area supply power, light, et cetera, to Nabouwalu and the whole of Bua, particularly 
<br/>the hydro in Nuku.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to repeat that in my village of Navakasali, Nuku, it is important to ensure that hydro is 
<br/>completed.    Feasibility  studies  have  been  carried  out  since  2004  and  was  completed.    I  think  the 
<br/>honourable Seruiratu was the Commissioner Northern at that time, but I think it was already filed with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Department of Energy  and  Department of Rural Development.   Everything is  ready  but it  needs 
<br/>funding.  You have to look for funding to get it done.  If you cannot get the funding, do not worry, we 
<br/>will get funding next year and do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to have power, particularly for our natural resources within us like that hydro that 
<br/>I was talking about in Navakasali, Wainunu in Bua.  In that study, it was mentioned that it is bigger than 
<br/>the one at Bagata.  It can supply more energy, than the one at Bagata.  The one at Bagata feeds Savusavu, 
<br/>up to Botonitoba (I think) and down to Nakorovatu.  It is quite a large area, so if you develop that one 
<br/>here  in  Nuku,  Navakasali,  Wainunu,  Bua  with  a  bigger  energy,  you  can  electrify  Dreketi,  Lekutu, 
<br/>Wainunu, Kubulau and may be right down to Nabouwalu.  But if you join that hydro with Nasawana, 
<br/>Driti and Dama in Lekutu and the pine grid in Wairiki, then we can have a network of power supply there 
<br/>that will electrify Nabouwalu Town and all other villages in the Bua Province. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you can have a biomass in Dreketi to make use of all the waste around there in Vanua Levu, 
<br/>Macuata, Bua and Cakaudrove, well and fine.  It adds on to the supply of energy or power to Nabouwalu 
<br/>and surrounding areas. So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are important areas that we need look into it and declare 
<br/>fax  free  zone  for  Nabouwalu,  to  encourage  people  to  invest  in  the  industrial  and  manufacturing 
<br/>developments that we can go into, and housing for the increase in population.  We need population for a 
<br/></span><span>thriving town so we have to develop economic resources, housing and infrastructure to ensure a viable 
<br/></span><span>town is to be successful, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the connection of all that hydro, solar, pine grid, wind in Nabouwalu and the biomass, you 
<br/>will have a lot more energy around Bua itself and we can do that in other areas as well, to be a source of 
<br/>development wherever.   So it is important to have that in mind, but if you cannot do it, forget it, we will 
<br/>do it next year. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to present some observations on the 
<br/>review of the Ministry of  Local  Government, Housing  and  Environment Annual Report 2015,  2016, 
<br/>2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but I have to ask, whether the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>side was wide wake when they put forward this Report for debate this week in what could be the final 
<br/>Parliamentary Sitting week of the 2018 Parliamentary term?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has opened itself up for public condemnation through this Report. Even the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee seems exasperated in its observations and says, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>"We note that the following major projects are yet to be completed and urge the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to complete prioritisation of these development works.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Major projects from 2015, Mr. Speaker, that have been in the pipeline will continue to be in this 
<br/>pipeline until 2023, 2024, 2025 or until legal issues are resolved. What a stunning performance indicator 
<br/>to be walking into the next elections with, Mr. Speaker!  Not even the distractory events, like FBC's 
<br/>"</span><span>sigidrigi"</span><span> concerts in Valelevu, can help them here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Report  says  that  the  Nabouwalu  Town  Development  is  to  be  realised  in  the  2023-2024 
<br/>financial year.  Really? My colleague who is not here right now, honourable Salote Radrodro, noted in 
<br/>her </span><span>Facebook</span><span> post of February 2020 that not one stone had been turned in Nabouwalu, despite cumulative 
<br/>budget injections totalling $15.2 million since 2015.  All the hype, including the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> proclaiming on 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2018 that the contractor, Hussain’s Hire Plant, of Labasa was awarded the contract.  Then 
<br/>what happened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, this Report says that Keiyasi Town Development should be online by the 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year. Yet, only in June this year, we see on the Government </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>
<div><span>2224 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Economy with its engineering consultants and 10 prospective civil works contractors, taking 
<br/>a site visit there.  This Report was tabled in May 2020.  From 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 or whenever the 
<br/>funds were allocated, it is only in June of this year that a posse from the Government with their convoy 
<br/>of vehicles sees fit to do the trek there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What about the Korovou Town Development project?  This Report says that survey works for 
<br/>two sites in Korovou will be submitting a scheme plan for approval, but nothing will appear there until 
<br/>2024-2025 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us look at the Seaqaqa Town Development. This Report says surveys have been done but 
<br/>they will hand over to Labasa Town Council for “development purposes”.  Yet, honourable Koya was in 
<br/>Seaqaqa on Wednesday, 29th June, 2022, to visit the Seaqaqa site where "a majority of the infrastructural 
<br/>developments would take place for the upcoming Seaqaqa town."  So, basically, Mr. Speaker, this is 
<br/>another  of  those  initiatives  by  the  FijiFirst  Government  that  is  in  the  pipeline,  but  blaming  climate-
<br/>proofing for delays. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, let us turn to the Lautoka Swimming Pool festering fiasco by the FijiFirst Government and 
<br/>what this Report says about it. What was supposed to be a taxpayer-funded $2 million project in 2015 
<br/></span><span>exploded with cost overruns, totalling $7.8 million, then $12.6 million - all the gory details are captured 
<br/></span><span>on the </span><span>Fiji Sun Facebook</span><span> post of 31</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2020.  Of course, in the event of a crisis, Mr. Speaker, get 
<br/>a consultant in to obfuscate what is already a disgusting collusion of messes that no one wants to own up 
<br/>to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Report says the Lautoka Swimming Pool is to be peer reviewed by a consultant to audit the 
<br/>works of another consultant. How is that for brilliant logic? Paralysis of analysis because there is too 
<br/>many  dirty  hands in there  and  everyone is all  a-scatter, trying to  avoid the fallout. No one has been 
<br/>FICAC-ed yet, Mr. Speaker, selected political opposition using only words, are FICAC-ed at the drop of 
<br/>a hat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what about Govind Park in Ba, costing $4.9 million? This Report says it is supposed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be realised in this current 2022-2023 financial year. Any sign of it, Ba MPs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Surely, it is not like the Ba Swimming Pool that now lies derelict and overrun by vegetation.  
<br/>Honourable Premila Kumar said in the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> of 6</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2019, that it was to be opened in April that 
<br/>year.  In May this year, the honourable Minister, of course, gave this in this Parliament every excuse 
<br/>under the sun, like COVID-19, contractor defects, I am glad that we have not started to blame Russia and 
<br/></span><span>the Ukrainian conflict for this.  It is a project that has been on their books since 2016, for goodness sake, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And finally let us turn to the Sigatoka River Bank Upgrade, as laid out in this Report.  What did 
<br/>the Committee say in this Report?  Of course, it is the consultants.  Of course, it is legal action.  But the 
<br/>Committee says, despite them repeating the cautions of the auditors about the laxity in internal controls 
<br/>and timely reconciliations, the Ministry seems to be struggling to comply because of high staff turnover 
<br/>and internal investigations - not a very good outlook. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government recently sacked the Sigatoka Town Council’s Special Administrator, 
<br/>Mr. Adish Naidu.  Before the FijiFirst Government side can start their predictable rhetoric about Mr. 
<br/>Naidu’s friendship with National Federation Party (NFP), let us look at merit first.  He is a seasoned 
<br/>architect with years of professional experience.  When he was approached by the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>side, we warned him that he may be victimised.  But Mr. Naidu, as an honourable and principled man, 
<br/>took it on because he lives in Sigatoka and was keen to serve the people in some small way.  Never did 
<br/>he divulge to us anything about his area of responsibility, Mr. Speaker.  He did not even tell us about his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>savage removal, until we heard it from a third party. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Economy knows him well and he was dancing to Mr. Naidu’s music, 
<br/>contrary to what the honourable Prime Minister says about people dancing at a recent Fiji Institute of 
<br/>Accountant’s function and perhaps, the honourable Minister for Economy can shed some light about what 
<br/>happened there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  closing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Report  is  yet  another  shameful  indictment  on  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.  When it is time to debate, Sir, we are on the receiving end of rude, obnoxious comments 
<br/>and misogynistic comments as well from the FijiFirst Government side upon the </span><span>viber</span><span> command of their 
<br/>master.  But before us all today, is but another tip of many icebergs of sub-zero quality of their leadership 
<br/>in black and white.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These Review Reports and Auditor-General Reports are the FijiFirst Government manifesto that 
<br/>we will show the people.  No wonder the FijiFirst Government side needs to distract people and cry and 
<br/>whinge  for  our  manifesto.    All  the  hot  air  of  bravado,  cemented  by  clay  feet  is  about  to  pay  the 
<br/>Government side their due dividends at the upcoming polls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people who employ us - the voters, the taxpayers of this country, are no longer interested in 
<br/></span><span>artistic impressions or signage of cultural concepts and build teams of infrastructure still being dreamt 
<br/>about, like Waila City and the CWM Maternity Hospital renovations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Suckers will get the better of some people one day, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Listen, honourable Qereqeretabua, you will learn. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to contribute to the motion for debate which is before 
<br/>Parliament,  and  actually  wish  to  provide  some  truthful,  honest  insights  into  the  status  of  the  town 
<br/>development projects, not things that they believe and they do not know about.  The comments and the 
<br/>recommendations, Mr. Speaker, are noted, particularly in relation to the new town development projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I continue, I want to briefly outline, and  this is not an excuse, these are 
<br/>the challenges that we actually face in implementing new town projects post-2018.  In 2019 and 2020, 
<br/>we all know we faced the full brunt of COVID-19, which actually resulted in reprioritisation of the budget 
<br/>that was allocated for capital projects to assist in the COVID-19 Response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, there was no specific budget allocated, for example, for the Nabouwalu Town Centre 
<br/></span><span>Project for obvious reasons, as the Fijian Government was investing resources in unemployment support 
<br/>and economic recovery initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, due, also to the site experiencing inundation issues, they were not anticipated in the earlier 
<br/>engineering studies conducted.  We were required to take some remedial action, specifically with respect 
<br/>to Nabouwalu, and worked on redesigning of the stormwater drainage around the proposed town centre 
<br/>subdivision.  This is the practical reality on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Qereqeretabua listen, he is telling you the fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. L.S. Qereqeretabua interjected) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>2226 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Economy has been assisting on this particular project to ensure that the proper ground work 
<br/>is  undertaken.    We  are  not  going  to  do  this  willy-nilly,  like  it  used  get  done  before,  Mr.  Speaker.  
<br/>Ministries actually also working with the Fiji Roads Authority to upgrade the periphery drains around the 
<br/>proposed town centre so that the drains do not overload during torrential rain. These are simple things, 
<br/>but they need to be taken care of in a proper manner and it is all calculated properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The contractor currently is mobilising to the site with procured materials to recommence with the 
<br/>civil works.  Again, this is another huge issue.  We have got three families who reside on that particular 
<br/>new location who are squatters. So, we are working on the relocation of those three families from the 
<br/>town centre site to a new location for which iTLTB and the landowners have already given their consent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Sir, this is not a simple thing where you just go and drag him out, take him and put 
<br/>him somewhere else.  No!  It has to be done properly, but moving forward, Mr. Speaker, the Ministry has 
<br/>actually strategised to break that project into different phases, as per the 2022-2023 budgetary allocation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In concurrently, the Ministry has commenced work also on the Nabouwalu Passengers Services 
<br/>facility which will be located just next to the Nabouwalu Market. This facility will provide the people of 
<br/>Bua, all the Fijians travelling between the two islands, a designated waiting area with kiosk provisions.  
<br/></span><span>The Ministry is currently also evaluating a tender for design and build facility which will be awarded 
<br/></span><span>around October 2022, and the construction proper should commence by December 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Keiyasi Town, the Ministry through the Ministry of Economy, is evaluating 
<br/>the tender for civil works which is expected to commence in the first quarter of this financial year.  The 
<br/>project will roll over in the next two financial years, this is because the term for civil works completion 
<br/>would be approximately 18 months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Korovou Town, the Ministry was in the process of having the agreement of lease from iTLTB 
<br/>through the Ministry of Lands and we have completed the periphery survey of the two sites, that is, the 
<br/>10-acre site next to the market. I have been on the ground myself, Mr. Speaker, and the 40-acre beside 
<br/>Tailevu North College.  The Ministry will be able to register and secure the leases in this financial year 
<br/>and thereafter, the comprehensive scheme plans for both sites will be prepared by the Ministry in this 
<br/>financial year, along with the engineering designs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Korovou, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have to be very careful.  Again, we have been left 
<br/>with a legacy issue because these towns now sit in rivers. We have to be very careful about what we build 
<br/>and what is actually used in terms of the ground work that has actually been done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are working on also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in identifying development partners in the dredging of 
<br/>the Waibula River to mitigate any future risk of flooding the Town and we may also have to build some 
<br/>embankment, like they have done towards Sigatoka, Sir.  At the moment, there is no local expertise in 
<br/>that particular field, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  for  Seaqaqa,  the  Ministry  is  currently  finalising  the  scheme  plan  for  creation  of  new 
<br/>commercial and civic lots and once completed, we will look at the engineering civil works to commence 
<br/>in the next financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also had to rejig some issues around there because of the community that there is  that has 
<br/>grown, but having said this, Sir, we are actually fully focused and committed to completing and delivering 
<br/>these particular projects within the set timelines.  But as I have said, there are no excuses.  These are 
<br/>practical problems that have been faced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is genuinely a practical problem, and it 
<br/>is not an excuse.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I hope that clarifies the issue, and I thank the Committee for 
<br/>their Report.

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2227 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, and I will speak only on matters that come under my portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local of Government acknowledges the findings and recommendations made by 
<br/>the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs.  The  Ministry  has  taken  decisive  steps  towards  corrective 
<br/>actions to remedy issues by establishing good governance and financial prudence in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has managed to resolve a number of internal staffing issues, which 
<br/>has  improved  the  audit  qualification.  The  Ministry  recruited  five  Accounts  personnel,  including  a 
<br/>Manager Finance in February 2018, and four Accounts Officers between August and October 2019 to 
<br/>establish a more robust Finance Team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2015 to 2017, the Ministry received qualified audit opinion  - this has 
<br/>changed.  The Ministry received unqualified audit opinion for 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 financial years 
<br/>after qualified people were recruited by the Ministry under OMRS.  To-date, Sir, the Ministry continues 
<br/>with the in-house capacity building on procedures and processes for effective management of internal 
<br/>controls.  While the Ministry has taken steps to address a number of concerns, it will continue to closely 
<br/>monitor governance in order to be preventative and proactive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now speak on Recommendations 2 and 3 related to the timely completion 
<br/>of capital projects, in particular the Lautoka Swimming Pool, Govind Park and Sigatoka River Bank 
<br/>Upgrade.  All three projects mentioned in the Committee Report were not completed as scheduled.  The 
<br/>Ministry has to make sure that the work is done in accordance to the scope of work, work is of high 
<br/>standard and quality is maintained and delivered within the approved cost and time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because of disputes, the projects were delayed.  The initial step is to amicably resolve the issue 
<br/>and when this fails, the matter is either filed in the court or peer review option is taken to get the work 
<br/>assessed independently on a mutually agreed terms of reference.  Such was the case with these projects 
<br/>mentioned in the Standing Committee Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a dispute between Lautoka City Council consultant and contractors 
<br/>that caused delay in completing this project.  To resolve the dispute, a peer review exercise was carried 
<br/>out by an independent consultant to audit and validate the works carried out by the lead consultant and 
<br/>the  contractors  so  far.    The  findings  and  recommendations  in  the  final  report  by  the  consultant  will 
<br/>determine the way forward.  We are optimistic that we will be able to complete this project as we go 
<br/>along.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  talking  about  this  project,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  seems  that  honourable  Members  do  not 
<br/>understand the difference between public-funded projects and personally when you develop a house or 
<br/>any other project that you carry out as in individual.  There is a lot of difference between the two.  If you 
<br/>carry out your own project, it is your money, you decide how you are going to use, you will not be calling 
<br/>for tender, you will not be calling for other things, you will simply get your plan approved, and if you 
<br/>find a good contractor that you think is good, you will give the job to that person.  That is how easy it is.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  for  the  public-funded  projects,  there  are  financial  regulations  to  be  used,  there  are 
<br/>certain other requirements to be met, because we also have to take care of safety and security when it 
<br/>comes to any project that we deliver.  There are layers of scrutiny undertaken for that particular project 
<br/>because at the end of the day, the Government will be held accountable for it, so we understand that.  
<br/>Sometimes,  we  often  actually  depend  on  experts,  whether  it  is  an  architect,  engineer,  consultants, 
<br/>plumbers, electricians or whoever they are - they are professionals.  They know the job better.   We rely 
<br/>on them.  But if they are not able to deliver the work as expected, what do you expect us to do then?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- Penalise them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Exactly.  So, if it is to do with penalising, there are so many other methods, 
<br/>for example, taking the matter to court and peer review is another way of amicably solving the issue, and 
<br/>if we are not able to strike a balance, of course, the matter will go to court.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mediation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mediation is another option.  So there are many other options available, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as a Government, we have to go through all these processes to ensure that we get 
<br/>the best result at the end of the day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But for individual projects, I can tell you, as an individual, when people make their houses, they 
<br/>go into dispute as well and sometimes their project is not completed for one year, two years or even three 
<br/>years.  That is the reality on the ground.  So, let us not come here and say that this is the only issue with 
<br/>public projects.  It is also an issue with individual projects, but as I have mentioned that we have layers 
<br/>and layers of requirements to meet, it is only for good governance that we do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  also  noted  that  from  the  Opposition  point  of  view,  as  soon  as  the 
<br/></span><span>announcement is made, as if we are carrying a magic wand and through this magic wand, we will be able 
<br/>to complete the project - this is not how it works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Tell them!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Again,  there  is  a  preparatory  phase,  consultation  phase  and  land 
<br/>acquisition phase.  Announcement is made, it takes time to complete that, and this is not the case with 
<br/>only  local  government  in  Fiji,  it  is  a  case  with  all  local  governments  around  the  world.    For  your 
<br/>information,  simple  projects  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  can  take  30  years  to  complete.    A  good 
<br/>example is the airport they are making in Western Sydney.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Badgerys Creek.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Yes, and it has taken them so many years to get that project started.  But 
<br/>here we are, we have Opposition Members who do not read, they do not understand how the system 
<br/>works but they come here expecting things to be done overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to correct honourable Qereqeretabua as she has said that the 
<br/></span><span>Special Administrator that we appointed for Sigatoka and Nadi,  Mr. Adish Naidu, we approached him.  
<br/>In  fact,  no,  he  applied,  and  when  he  applied  we  did  not  consider  his  political  affiliation.    If  we  had 
<br/>considered his political affiliation, probably we would not have appointed him in 2020 but we did because 
<br/>we believed in giving any work or putting anyone in a board or as special administrator based on merit - 
<br/>that is what we did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let us look around Sigatoka and Nadi.  Where do you development in Nadi, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  
<br/>What new things have come up in Nadi?  So these were the reasons as to why we had to let go the whole 
<br/>team for Sigatoka and Nadi so that we can appoint people who can get the job done.  This is as simple as 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to stress on another point; when the Opposition come to his House, 
<br/>they think that there is a lot of money sitting somewhere which can be pulled out as and when needed.  
<br/>And  if  you  compare  our  national  budget  of  Fiji,  it  is  around  $3.6  -  $3.8  billion  as  compared  to  just 
<br/>Auckland City Council.  Auckland City Council have a budget 10 times more than the national budget 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2229 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji.  And sometimes I wonder how the honourable Minister for Economy runs this country with that 
<br/>kind of money and yet, he is able to provide pension, free education and all the development work that is 
<br/>being undertaken.  Only he is able to do it because it requires a lot of thinking and a lot of knowledge and 
<br/>determination to get the job done.  So, do not come here and say that we were not able to complete this 
<br/>and that, we are doing whatever we can within our means.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also tend to forget that from 2016, we had 14 cyclones and they are asking, 
<br/>‘so?’  This is the level of intelligence they have, I am sorry to say.  You know what happens when you 
<br/>have a cyclone.  When you have a cyclone, we have to divert government funds in urgent areas, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   They do not understand that.  If there is no road, that road needs to be fixed.  When the 
<br/>bridge goes down, the bridge needs to be fixed.  We also provide food in the area where people cannot 
<br/>access towns and cities, so this is where the funds are diverted, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Do not say that we are 
<br/>not doing what we are supposed to be doing, we are doing everything based on as situation arises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  cyclone,  after  that  came  COVID-19,  and  we  all  have  seen,  it  was  about  life  and 
<br/>livelihood.  Capital projects were put aside, the focus was on health and survival.  Now that the economy 
<br/>is picking up and you have heard in the last Budget, the Ministry of Economy has given around $2.8 
<br/>million to complete Govind Park.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Govind Park, Phase 1 is a $9,600 sitting capacity 
<br/></span><span>pavilion with associated facilities, such as two conference rooms, four change rooms, VIP room, two 
<br/></span><span>restrooms, one restroom for people with disabilities and squash room is completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the defect liability period, defects were identified which took take time 
<br/>to be fixed.  When you identify defects, obviously, there is disagreement between the two parties and that 
<br/>takes some time to solve through mediation or other mechanism and that was the case in this particular 
<br/>matter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the lead consultant will lead the works for Phase 2 and contractors will be hired 
<br/>for the completion of this Phase.  Phase 2 of the project will include the upgrade of the playing field with 
<br/>drainage, construction of ground parameter fence, installation of electronic scoreboard, backup generator, 
<br/>construction of ticket booths and the construction of embankment.  This Phase is expected to complete 
<br/>within this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Local Government and the Ba Town 
<br/>Council are working together to ensure that the Govind Park Project is operational by this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the Sigatoka River Bank Upgrade, the grant was given to Sigatoka Town Council with 
<br/></span><span>good intention, to complete the river embankment area and the idea was to create more spaces around the 
<br/></span><span>river bank so that tourists can enjoy that space and activities can be held in that area, like </span><span>bilibili</span><span> races, et 
<br/>cetera, where people can have more access to that space.  So, it was two-fold - one was to create space, 
<br/>and also to safeguard the erosion of the riverbank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project has not progressed well simply because there was a design fault by the lead consultant 
<br/>who happens to be an engineer from a well-known company.  The design fault was, when they did the 
<br/>sheet piling in the river, somehow or the other the piles fell in the water so it could not hold firmly on the 
<br/>ground or in the river.  It cannot hold, so there was some problem with the design.  When you have a 
<br/>problem like this, I would like to ask honourable Qereqeretabua, through you Mr. Speaker, Sir, what do 
<br/>you expect us to do?  It was a contract signed by two parties and the service provider did not provide the 
<br/>service according to the contract. So what do you do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  we  can  do  is,  we  can  have  negotiations  with  the  lead  consultant  who  happens  to  be  a 
<br/>qualified and well known engineer.  Now, if he comes to the table and still does not agree that he is at 
<br/>fault or he should fix that, while you can see the piles are all in the water, in that situation, we had no

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other option but to take the matter to court.  The matter is in the court and what we want to do is, we want 
<br/>to  recover  every  cent  and  other  related  cost  from  the  lead  consultant,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally I would like to thank the Committee for the Report and I hope I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>given an update on all three projects and the reason why it was delayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I rise to contribute to the Review Report of the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government, Housing and Environment Annual Report, in particular I would like to comment on the 
<br/>projects mentioned there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Committee recommendations on the Sigatoka River Bank Upgrade, I would like to thank 
<br/>the honourable Minister for updating us.  I would like to share some other information on the Sigatoka 
<br/>River Bank Project from the audit which was carried out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A review of the reclamation of the Sigatoka River Bank Project revealed the following anomalies: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>The Council had used funds totalling $619,708 from the total grant received of $845,000.  
<br/>However,  the  project  was  yet  to  be  completed  due  to  structural  failure  defects  noted,  as 
<br/>updated by the honourable Minister.  But some of the interesting issues about that project 
<br/>which I feel should have been adequately addressed may be there was not enough monitoring 
<br/>and oversight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span></span><span> </span><span>The Council did not tender the works carried out for landfill upgrade which costs the Council 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over $10,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  those  are  the  anomalies  which  the  management,  the  Ministry  or  whatever  could  have 
<br/>addressed and if the tender works was not carried out, then what disciplinary action has been taken? A 
<br/>total payment of $54,086 was made to an Engineer, even though there was no contract in place between 
<br/>the Council and the Engineer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, who is responsible?  Was there any contract?  Has these funds been recovered? Again, I 
<br/>understand it is going through the court. There was no evidence to indicate the basis on which the engineer 
<br/>was elected, that the Council sought confirmation or undertook reasonable steps to ascertain the ability 
<br/>of the contractor and engineer to undertake such project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a variance of $100,731 was noted between the balance utilised as per the work in 
<br/>progress amount and the details of payments provided by the Council.  A payment of $75,651 was made 
<br/>to the contractor in 2018 for the second progress payment, even though the Progress Payment Certificate 
<br/>provided by the Project Manager for this payment was not signed. Again, how did this happen?  This 
<br/>smells like corruption and collusion. Has this money been recovered? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Management of the Council agreed with this findings and also measures to recover. So what 
<br/>I  am  asking  is;  what  has  been  done  about  this  because  these  are  major  anomalies?  Here,  we  have 
<br/>everything and all sort of things reported to FICAC but this case has not been reported, so there needs to 
<br/>be further investigation.  I know that the honourable Minister has updated us but those details point to 
<br/></span><span>other things which need to be actioned on and reported - not only exposing anomalies in the process.  
<br/></span><span>They  did  some  things  in  terms  of  the  tender  process  but  also  the  management  of  the  contract,  the 
<br/>monitoring of the performance in terms of the contract, et cetera, even before this stage of payment, but 
<br/>payments were made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Sigatoka Pool, I noticed as updated, of course, there is the peer-review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2231 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- There’s no Sigatoka Pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I am sorry, Lautoka Swimming Pool, my apologies. You can also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do a project there, Sigatoka Swimming Pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this project, the contract was $4.8 million and the Construction Implementation Unit said that 
<br/>Luxury Pools had been paid a total of $4.4 million, while another company has been paid a total of $1.28 
<br/>million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand this is being looked at by the Peer Review and it is interesting that money was already 
<br/>paid, what was it for?  To my understanding, part of it was for the completed part, but what about the 
<br/>other  one?    Again,  the  latest  from  the  honourable  Minister  on  20</span><span>th</span><span>  August,  2022,  she  stated  while 
<br/>officiating in a function that the much anticipated Lautoka Swimming Pool will go ahead.  She said that 
<br/>the matter was called before the Court and once the report is finalised, we will be able to discuss the report 
<br/>and move forward, which is commendable, I suppose on the part of the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Peer Review is ongoing and we look forward to the findings of that and further action.  Some 
<br/>of the questions which arise, again, what kind of compliance and due diligence process was done for 
<br/></span><span>those projects from the beginning, especially the tender process, selection of contractors, performance 
<br/></span><span>and monitoring contract payments process?  I note that Luxury Pools, again, as I have mentioned, was 
<br/>paid $4.4 million and another company $1.2 million.  Is this justified?  What actions have been taken 
<br/>regarding these anomalies who were responsible and whether these cases warrant reporting to FICAC?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the issues which I would like to raise, Sir, on these Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/>Pillay.    First,  Sir,  I  wish  to  convey  my  appreciation  and  commend  the  work  of  the  Chairman  and 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs,  in  reviewing  the  Reports  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government is mandated under the Local Government 
<br/>Act 1972 and the National Fire Services Act 1994, to administer and regulate all Municipal Councils in 
<br/>Fiji and provide oversight to the National Fire Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have always emphasised my Government’s intent to modernise the nation’s 
<br/>laws,  some  of  which  have  not  been  updated  since  the  Colonial  era,  to  improve  the  efficiency  and 
<br/></span><span>effectiveness of the delivery of Government services in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ongoing review  of the Town  and Country  Planning Act demonstrates  my  Government’s 
<br/>commitment, to ensure that we make space for more modern and sophisticated development planning.  
<br/>Past Governments in Fiji used to go about urban development as if they will all die the next day, as if 
<br/>roads would never needed to be widened, water pipes would never needed to be replaced and buildings 
<br/>would  never  needed  to  be  taller  than  palm  trees.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  do  not  work  that  way,  my 
<br/>Government considers and plans for development over decades.  We work towards a long term vision 
<br/>that accommodates for future needs before they become urgent - life or death matters.  I commend the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government for applying a lens of strategic innovation to the policies that are relevant 
<br/>to town and residential planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issues identified by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs are currently being addressed 
<br/>by the respective Ministries.  Working towards a goal requires effective collaboration and planning, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and I welcome the work of the Ministry of Local Government and the 13 Municipal Councils, 
<br/>in getting blocks rezoning, building and subdivision and locations with growing population. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before she abundant her parliamentary post, I recalled Lynda Tabuya speaking 
<br/>of, and I am quoting her directly here; “…the explosion of informal settlements in our cities and towns 
<br/>around the country under this Government.”  That is a lie and there is no surprise.  Lynda has never been 
<br/>a leader and has always been disingenuous.  She lied when she stood in this Chamber, and she continues 
<br/>to do so ever since she ran out from her voters.  The truth is that, the explosion in informal settlements 
<br/>happened during the mass expiry of land leases among farmers during the SDL Government.  That is part 
<br/>of the mess they left that we are cleaning up now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Government does not create problems, we solve them.  We are the 
<br/>Government that is regularising squatters in informal settlements - to grant them the dignity and stability 
<br/>of secure tenure where we can.  We are the Government that is creating solutions to the longstanding 
<br/>rural to urban drift and the corresponding need for wider scope of development in peri-urban, rural and 
<br/>maritime  areas.    That  work  is  twofold,  we  must  ensure  our  towns  and  cities  can  reliably  serve  their 
<br/>residents, and we must ensure that services are readily available in the rural and maritime areas in Fiji so 
<br/>that people who want to stay where they live can do so. The revised Act will address how we plan for the 
<br/>expansion of our towns and cities and generally, a more equitable Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I encourage the Ministry to continue implementing the initiatives under their 
<br/></span><span>ambit,  and  I  reaffirm  my  Government’s  support  and  commitment  to  deliver  its  strategic  priorities, 
<br/></span><span>supported by budgetary initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on those comments, Mr. Speaker, and those remarks, I support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to some of the comments 
<br/>made from the other side,  on Page 11 of the Committee’s recommendations,  the first recommendation 
<br/>is  that,  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Community  Development  complete  the  review  of  the  National 
<br/>Housing Policy which is pending  due to COVID-19 pandemic.  None of the speakers actually spoke 
<br/>about that.  The honourable Prime Minister, of course, has alluded about the squatter growth and the 
<br/>reasons as to why there has been a squatter growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the policy review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, overall, it is still in progress.  In 2019, there was 
<br/>a Policy Advisor who was appointed with funding assistance from New Zealand, the Ministry of Foreign 
<br/>Affairs and Trade (MFAT), to assist the Ministry.  The National Housing Policy review has reached the 
<br/>consultation phase but, of course, was disrupted as a result of the pandemic and which we are going out 
<br/>to members of the public and that will continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In respect to that and carrying on from what the honourable Prime Minister said, Sir, there is a 
<br/></span><span>number of informal settlements throughout Fiji that we are in the process of formalising.  No one spoke 
<br/>about this but in respect of the work we have already had, for example, in the lot allocation, these sites 
<br/>have already completed: Ledrusasa in Nadi, Cuvu in Nadroga and Waidamudamu in the Central Division 
<br/>(near Goat Road), just before you reach Koronivia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The following projects have been tendered out for construction: Tore and Tavela in the Western 
<br/>Division and Wakanisila and Sasawira in the Central Division.  We have scheme plans now for Nabara 
<br/>and Delaisaweni in the Western Division. There is quite a lot of work going on, Sir.  Of course, we have 
<br/>the following projects that have been allocated in the 2022-2023 Budget:  Capital works will commence 
<br/>in Sakoca, 30 percent of the works have already been completed; Tavela, as I mentioned; Tore Field 4, 
<br/>Wakanisila,  Caubati,  Nadonumai,  Vunika,  Lovu  Seaside,  Valewaqeiyaya,  Tauvegavega  and  also 
<br/>Sasawira.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, all of those works are currently on foot.  There are literally thousands of people who live in 
<br/>these areas.  In the next few weeks, we will also be going out to many of the other sites. Most of the sites,

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2233 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  where  we  have  informal  settlements  that  we  are  trying  to  formalise  are  on  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>land  where 
<br/>Government has essentially taken out development leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  paying  monies  directly  to  iTaukei  Land  Trust  Board  (iTLTB)  and  then  iTLTB  is 
<br/>disbursing those funds to members of the landowning unit.  In some cases, Sir, the development leases 
<br/>were taken five years ago and, therefore, they have expired and we are now negotiating to get another 
<br/>five or seven years of development lease.  Because there are over 40 sites, we are also looking at some 
<br/>public private partnerships in respect of developing those sites because if we continue to depend solely 
<br/>100 percent on Government budgetary allocation, it can take a long time.  We need to expedite those 
<br/>projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Minister for Local Government had highlighted and honourable Members of 
<br/>the Opposition do not actually discuss these issues, when you run Government and decide on policies, 
<br/>when  you  look  at  various  policy  measures,  you  do  not  do  these  things  in  a  silo.    Honourable 
<br/>Qereqeretabua’s comments are very (what I call) “ siloistic”, apart from being pedestrian.  Why was not 
<br/>this done?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If anyone has been to Nabouwalu, for example, I am sure honourable Salote Radrodro goes there 
<br/></span><span>a lot when she takes the boat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact is that, where the site has developed it is actually 
<br/></span><span>not very conducive.  It is not flat land, there are various creeks and rivers.  The soil texture is so prone to 
<br/>landslides.  If you go down further East towards the fish market, you will see it gets inundated by rising 
<br/>tides because of inundation of waters due to rising sea levels.  These are challenges.  You do not just flick 
<br/>a finger and it all goes away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua and others who commented on this, standing up there with a lot of 
<br/>sarcasm  and  making  those  comments,  obviously,  do  not  appreciate  the  fact  that  these  are  everyday 
<br/>challenges that we face.  What they do not also mention is that, this is the only Government that actually 
<br/>said, “Let us build a town in Nabouwalu.”  This is the only Government that said, “Let us build a town 
<br/>in Keiyasi, let us build a town in Seaqaqa.  Get some municipality set up.  Let us get streetlights.  Let us 
<br/>get water.  Let us get electricity.”  They do not mention that at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFP is completely obsessed with the elections.  All their comments this week, 
<br/>they stand up and talk about elections.  Of course, this is marked by the large absence from their chairs.  
<br/>The  fact  is  that,  we  have  also  called  out  Members  of  Parliament  -  we  have  called  out  honourable 
<br/>Tuisawau,  honourable  Bulanauca,  honourable  Gavoka  and  every  one  of  them,  exactly  on  the  same 
<br/>matters that honourable Qereqeretabua has made.   Just because we point out to her, she says that we are 
<br/></span><span>being misogynistic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think that is actually quite derogatory.  Just to hide behind that comment and saying we have 
<br/>been misogynistic.  So that means biologically, following through that if we do not pick on anything that 
<br/>she says, if we do not point out that the narrative is wrong, if we point out to her that she got the law 
<br/>wrong, then it is okay.  That I think is an insult to many other women, who are highly intelligent.  They 
<br/>will not mind actually having a useful discussion or constructive discussion, but the moment you point 
<br/>out anything to her, it is about misogyny.  She does not pick on the fact that her leader made misogynistic 
<br/>comments about journalists in Fiji.  Not a word, not a word about that comment.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think 
<br/>it is quite unbecoming to hide behind that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point  I wish to  also  make is  that, if they  had  come to the  budget 
<br/>consultations, honourable Qereqeretabua, like at least honourable Rasova turned up and two or three of 
<br/>his other colleagues, we had been inviting them since 2014, they bothered not to come.  They would have 
<br/>heard not just from us, but from the team at the Ministry of Economy what are the significant changes 
<br/>we have to go through.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government  is  absolutely  correct.    When  you  have  three 
<br/>cyclones in one season, we already had a budget approved, you have to divert funds for funds that are not 
<br/>being used or funds actually that could be put on hold.  What she is saying is that, “Oh well, do not worry 
<br/>about those people whose electricity poles have fallen down and the roads being cut off from their villages 
<br/>or the bridges gone away, do not worry about them but continue building the town, because we will stand 
<br/>up and criticise you, if you do not build the town.”  That is what she is saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not understand the fundamentals of running a Government.  You have 
<br/>to divert the funds.  We had only one cyclone in the last season, but the road was completely washed out 
<br/>at the highway near Maro, Kabisi, the entire highway went.  One lane went near Semo, one lane went 
<br/>near Nalawa.  We have to build the highway, and we have to get the money from somewhere, people are 
<br/>not going to be disconnected, if we discontinue with the Nabouwalu Project for a period of time but 
<br/>people will be disconnected, if we do not build the road.  It just makes logical sense, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and the other point I wish to also make is that, all governments have this issue.  In fact, we recently had, 
<br/>a couple of years ago with ADB too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a Government Tender Board, if government tenders out work.  A lot of the municipal 
<br/>council works for example, goes to the Municipal Tender Board.  They have their own tender process 
<br/></span><span>but, as has been highlighted by honourable Tuisawau and I hope he understood what he was reading out 
<br/></span><span>that the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) now, from the Ministry of Economy has been called in 
<br/>to provide their expertise to the Municipal Councils, to be able to assist them to get across some of these 
<br/>difficult situations they have found themselves in, because CIU is a much bigger organisation and they 
<br/>handle much bigger contracts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tension is, do you give it to the cheapest tender?  He says no.  Now, if 
<br/>tomorrow for example, Sir, this is not an easy issue because sometimes, you may have some who may 
<br/>tender for a work that is $7 million.  The next highest could be $11 million or the next cheapest, I should 
<br/>say.  There is a weighing of these issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same way, we have said to the ADB, we no longer can give the road works to the cheapest 
<br/>company  because  they  may  not  have  a  good  outcome,  as  far  as  the  quality  of  the  construction  is 
<br/>concerned, as far as the longevity of the project is concerned because you have some companies, they 
<br/>may be very cheap but there may be a lot of variations.  Some companies may be very cheap, after they 
<br/>have completed the work, there is potholes within three months but ADB told us to give it to the cheapest 
<br/>company, so we are stuck, so honourable Rasova drives on the road and said oh government is useless, 
<br/>there is a pothole after three months.  But we had actually followed a particular tender process through 
<br/></span><span>the ADB and we have said to them we no longer want to do this.  We also need to look at quality.  In the 
<br/></span><span>same way for government tender works also, we need to look at quality now, not the cheapest.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know honourable Tuisawau would pick it up and say I know there was a tender for $7 million, 
<br/>why have you not given it to him.  He was the cheapest or must have been underhand dealing, that is why 
<br/>you gave it to the other guy.  That is what they all stand here and pontificate.  Honourable Qereqeretabua 
<br/>says oh FICAC.  How can you FICAC somebody?  You report the matter to FICAC but before you report 
<br/>any matter to FICAC, you need to exhaust, you need to establish whether there is any untoward dealing 
<br/>and let me say this again, Sir, this is the only government that has not hesitated to report people to FICAC 
<br/>both within government, within the civil service, within the municipal councils.  Honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar will tell you how many people they have reported to FICAC, as far as Municipal Councils are 
<br/>concerned.  How many civil servants?  The scam that has been revealed under this government and they 
<br/>have the audacity to come here and say that we only are selective or it is a political machination that is in 
<br/>place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the other issue that I wish to also make is that, they seem to think that the word “consultant” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022  Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2235 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a dirty word.  Yes, if you are a fly-by-night consultant, then it is a dirty word.  If you give it to people 
<br/>who do not know what they are doing then it is a dirty word but you have reputable companies, you need 
<br/>people to project manage.  It would appear that, if they were able to form government, God forbid, they 
<br/>themselves will go and manage the projects without having absolutely any knowledge.  We would like 
<br/>to give the job to the people who actually know the business, not for people who want to think that they 
<br/>know the business, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we wanted to make was that, about this whole conspiracy, 
<br/>this whole conspiracy about we give stuff to people or we do not give stuff to people just because they 
<br/>support NFP or support some other party.  There are currently engineers, who through the government 
<br/>tender process, have won tenders and they actually are open supporters and donors to NFP.  But they 
<br/>have the contracts fair and square.  They do not mention that.  But they and their supporters including 
<br/>SODELPA go and harass our people, who are actually legitimate donors.  They belittle them.  They troll 
<br/>them.  Yet this is a government that gives people awards or tenders based on merit, not on their political 
<br/>affiliation.  If that was the case, then Adish Naidu would have never got that job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He actually applied for the job and honourable Qereqeretabua stands up here and says that why 
<br/>did you select him.  He applied.  See, this is the level of obfuscation that takes place and I can tell you, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, this article that I am holding up again is a completely perfect example of the amount of obfuscation 
<br/></span><span>and disingenuity that comes from the Opposition. Here we have the Leader of NFP saying, “do no pay 
<br/>superannuation,  do  not  pay  FNPF”  and  then  he  stands  up  two  days  ago  saying  we  should  have  not 
<br/>deducted or reduced FNPF when here he is saying, “take it off completely”.  When he says, “I never said 
<br/>that you should have a pay cut”, over here he says “cuts civil servants pay by 30 percent” in your favourite 
<br/>tabloid.  That is the culture that exists in that party and I am afraid to say it is creeping into SODELPA 
<br/>too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last one I want to make, honourable Tuisawau made about how tenders may 
<br/>not be called.  As you would know working at USP when those days when USP used to be somewhat 
<br/>okay that there are certain thresholds.  As you know, for example honourable Jale will tell you that if you 
<br/>have,  for  example,  works that  would be less than  a  particular threshold,  you do not actually  call for 
<br/>tenders.    You  do  not  go  and  call  for  tender  for  something  that  is  going  to  be  $5,000,  you  get  three 
<br/>quotations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has a threshold of $30,000, $50,000, municipal councils may have different 
<br/>thresholds.  You did not bother to find out what was the threshold, you said $10,000, maybe the threshold 
<br/>was $20,000.  Did you bother to find out if they have got three quotations or not?  But you stand up in 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and make these comments trying to create disquiet and saying I am just reading the report.  
<br/></span><span>You have an added responsibility, Sir, to actually get all the facts before you stand up and talk about a 
<br/>particular issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as the rest of the works are concerned and honourable Koya has also 
<br/>highlighted the works pertaining to Town and Country Planning and so as the honourable Minister.  I 
<br/>would  like  to  commend  the  Committee,  some  of  the  Members  of  the  Opposition  have  said  that  the 
<br/>Committee has highlighted and said the work should be completed too.  I also would like to urge the 
<br/>Committee to perhaps go deeper and find out exactly why sometimes these works are not completed. 
<br/>There are various reasonings behind it, there are very rationale reasons and very good reasons behind the 
<br/>non-completion of sites on time or indeed there are supply chain issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Qereqeretabua, again I find it so flippant to say we blame everything on Ukraine and 
<br/>we will blame this  on  the  Ukraine war.  In fact, it is  a huge insult, there  are people today in various 
<br/>countries that do not get access to food as a result of the war in Russia and Ukraine. Women and children 
<br/>are suffering, in certain countries they actually fight for bread in the morning which is their staple diet.

<div><span> Suspension of Standing Orders  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have today Fijians, Mr. Speaker, Sir, who are paying much higher prices for wheat, flour and 
<br/>various other commodities as a result of the war.  So please, in your quest for political ascendancy, do 
<br/>not belittle the ordinary Fijians, do not belittle people who are suffering directly as a result of the war 
<br/>because it is very unbecoming, Sir and it is in fact a very pathetic display of what political life should be 
<br/>like.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for the report.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, for the purposes of complying with Standing Orders
