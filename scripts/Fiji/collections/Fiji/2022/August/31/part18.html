<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visionary leadership of the FijFirst Government not only focusses on 
<br/>local employment opportunities but also opportunities with our neighbouring partners - Australia and 
<br/>New  Zealand,  which  was  clearly  demonstrated  when  we  were  struck  by  the  pandemic,  causing 
<br/>temporary closure to majority of our local workplaces.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  the  employment  opportunities  through  the  Vuvale  Partnership, 
<br/>many of our Fijian citizens were still able to travel to Australia for employment.   Sir, to-date, a total 
<br/>of 6,192 Fijians have joined the Seasonal Work Programme both, in Australia and New Zealand, and 
<br/>from 2019 the Pacific Labour Scheme Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the reopening of our borders in  December 2021, we are seeing an 
<br/>increasing  number  of  Australian  approved  employers  coming  to  engage  our  workers.  This,  Sir, 
<br/>signifies the confidence that they have in our workers and the operation in terms of selecting the best 
<br/>workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  positive  multiplier  effect  of  Fijians  participating  under  the  Pacific 
<br/></span><span>Australia  Labour  Mobility  (PALM)  Scheme  going  on  a  four-year  work  visa  is  most  significant 
<br/></span><span>towards our economic recovery. The spinoff, Sir, includes, amongst others, the remittance inflow, 
<br/>family income, growth of new small and micro-enterprises, new skills and experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been some talks about remittance in the last few 
<br/>days.    Let  me,  once  again,  say  to  this  august  Parliament,  that  we  have  always  mentioned  about 
<br/>remittance in the past, we are making it now, and in the future we will also acknowledge the remittance, 
<br/>as far as the workers of this country is concerned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the local front, the Ministry is assisting our local employers in facilitating 
<br/>attachés and volunteers on three months’ or six months’ engagement as part of capacity building.  Our 
<br/>unemployed citizens, through our formal employment ‘service first’, as of now a total of 1,656 clients 
<br/>were provided the pathway to local work attachment that provides our young people with the opportunity 
<br/>to gain employability skills in order to be absorbed into permanent employment.  Sir, over 70 percent of 
<br/>these work attachés were able to secure permanent employment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Fiji Volunteer Service (FVS) facilitates the needs of our local employers 
<br/>wanting graduate trainees coming out from the tertiary training institutions.  This engagement is through 
<br/></span><span>our volunteer programme where the Ministry in partnership with the local employers jointly contribute 
<br/></span><span>50 percent each towards the weekly allowance of these volunteers.  A total of 439 graduate volunteers 
<br/>benefitted from this initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  following  the  onset  of  the  pandemic,  the  Ministry  in  partnership  with  the 
<br/>National Training and Productivity Centre of  the  Fiji  National  University,  provided opportunities  for 
<br/>those who were affected by the pandemic through reskilling and upskilling short courses to ensure that 
<br/>they are job-ready for the labour market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  our  Youth  Capacity  Development  programmes,  many  youth  have 
<br/>graduated  and ventured into income-generating initiatives.   As  of  now  close to 6,000  youth  are  now 
<br/>engaged in the youth farm.  As part of the Ministry’s commitment to ensure that we adapt to the new 
<br/>norm and continue to explore new employment opportunities, my Ministry is working very closely with 
<br/>the International Labour Organization (ILO) to review Fiji’s National Employment Policy 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the honourable Minister, please, explain the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2245 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>procedure or processes within the Ministry in handling grievances or issues arising from the employees 
<br/>in the PALM Scheme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do not think he heard your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- He is explaining, but it is not heard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have grievances processes in place and whenever there 
<br/>is  any  grievance  from  any  worker  in  Australia  or  New  Zealand  who  has  been  engaged  under  these 
<br/>programmes, they are dealt with in accordance with the Grievances Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Plans to Promote Agriculture Export 
<br/>(Question No. 153/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the Ministry’s plans to promote agriculture export? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to answer the question raised by honourable Lal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I want to thank the honourable Member for asking this question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, primary produce exports had never played an important role in Fiji’s overall 
<br/>export  agenda  up  until  the  early  1990s.    So  up  until  the  early  1990s,  non-sugar  primary  agricultural 
<br/>produce (fresh and chilled) was never on the export agenda and there was no export strategy as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it prominence was never brought to the forefront for two reasons.  Firstly, sugar 
<br/>exports from sugarcane, given its volume, value, number of farmers and households involved in it and a 
<br/>historical significance, always overshadowed the small volume and value of primary produce exports that 
<br/>was undertaken at that particular point in time.  The entire discourse was in terms of agricultural exports 
<br/>and from sugarcane to sugar manufacturing and export, it was basically sugar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, because most of the primary produce was domestically sold and consumed, the surplus 
<br/>was low, so mostly at that particular point in time, most of the non-sugar primary produce, such as </span><span>dalo</span><span>, 
<br/>cassava or whatever, were mostly consumed domestically and that is how, at that particular time, the 
<br/>target was with the Government and the Ministry.  So the surplus was a very small amount and that 
<br/></span><span>surplus then was exported by a few exporters at that particular point in time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all along, the strategy for non-sugar agricultural export was pretty much only 
<br/>for food security at that particular point in time up until 1990s to feed the nation - food security.  So all 
<br/>discussions  uptil  then,  resources  and  strategies  were  focused  on  sugarcane  production,  sugar 
<br/>manufacturing, milling, exports, preferential price, subsidies and grants to the sugar industry.  Later on, 
<br/>two other extractive sectors joined sugar – forest and fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, over the last 25 years, we have seen the exports of non-sugar primary 
<br/>produce emerging as a potential export sector, to reckon with.  Initially, it was driven by private sector 
<br/>players  and  exporters.    So,  initially,  there  were  a  dozen  or  so  of  private  sector  exporters,  who  were 
<br/>basically exporting at that particular point in time from the 1990s to early 2000, horticultural crops, fruits 
<br/>and vegetables mostly from Sigatoka right up to Nadi and to some extent, Lautoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, noting its growing export volume, the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industry and Trade then started taking a lead in organising the exporters and also organising trade 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>missions to explore new markets overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey in the last 25 years has seen major developments in the agricultural 
<br/>landscape in Fiji.  Now, non-sugar agricultural exports (fresh and chilled) in 2021 stands at $121.3 million 
<br/>whereas the traditional sugar export came down to $66.6 million.  The entire ball game has changed now.  
<br/>It is the non-sugar agricultural exports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, leading this is kava.  Last year, kava alone, after consumption locally, is now $41.9 million 
<br/>in export earnings, from $5.7 million in 2000 (21 years).     </span><span>Dalo,</span><span> last year was $30.2 million from $12 
<br/>million in 2000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Turmeric was not at all in the picture, but just came in the picture about three years ago - $23 
<br/>million.  The third most important export crop is turmeric.  From $0.1 million in 2000, so it was basically 
<br/>a non-existence 21 years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ginger - $6.4 million now.  Ginger was a high export earner sometime back but due to complete 
<br/>ban by Australia and all kinds of restrictions, the ginger exports have come down to $6.4 million and we 
<br/>are working on that, together with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fruits  and  vegetables  is  now  $7.9  million  from  $4.7  million  about  eight  years  ago.    Poultry 
<br/>products, one of the livestock sector that we are 100 percent self-sufficient is poultry products - $4.7 
<br/>million export after feeding the entire nation.  It was $0.7 million about eight years ago.  So, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, this export income received is then shared amongst all the players in the supply chain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, one must understand how important the agriculture sector is when they get to have a good 
<br/>grasp of the entire supply chain.  Who are the players in the supply chain?  The landowners, farmers, 
<br/>farm households, labourers, the financial sector players who are financing, the other input suppliers, the 
<br/>hardware  shops,  fertilizer  companies,  exporters  and  middle  supply  chain  operators.    There  is  an  old 
<br/>terminology that they use called “middlemen”, which is really not very sensitive in terms of gender.  So 
<br/>I say that they are the middle supply chain operators.  Then we have Government coming in to facilitate 
<br/>the various Ministries, including Biosecurity Authority of Fiji (BAF) as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those players sharing the proceeds, the country also benefits and grows 
<br/>because the money then multiplies.  From the primary sector, the money is pushed to the non-urban area 
<br/>for investment, the spending on supermarkets for the financial sector, et cetera.  So those have massive 
<br/>multiplier effect.  From those  days,  we  now  see 375 active operators,  exporting our fresh  and chilled 
<br/></span><span>produce from Fiji, surpassing our traditional sugar export. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the 2020 Census data, we have a total area of 194,768 hectare in a 
<br/>rounded figure, 195 hectares of land under agriculture.  Of this, 54 percent of agriculture is undertaken 
<br/>on  </span><span>mataqali  </span><span>land,  23.7  percent  agriculture  is  undertaken  on  land  lease  from  iTLTB,  13.9  percent  of 
<br/>agriculture is undertaken on freehold land, 6 percent on State Land lease, 2.1 percent through informal 
<br/>arrangement and 0.2 percent with no arrangement and the farmers are doing work on a small scale. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so agriculture sector directly employs more than 83,395 farmers, along with 
<br/>additional labourers from the area.  Of these 83,395 farmers, 14 percent are female and 85 percent are 
<br/>male.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji no other sector contributes to interior rural development, as much as the 
<br/>agriculture sector does, no other sector including tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, whilst we do not have a detailed data on the various exporters transfer of money to the rural 
<br/>areas,  I  am  using AMA  as  an  example.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2017-2018  AMA’s  total sale was $2.3 
<br/>million, of these, 762,000 was exported.  Most of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is transferred to the rural area.  In 
<br/>2018 from $2.3 million went to $2.6 million, of the $2.6 million $1.3 million was export earnings.  In 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2019 from $2.36 million to $3.3 million, of these $3.3 million, $1.7 million was from export.  In 2020 
<br/>from $3.3 million has gone to $5 million of that, $3.2 million is from export.  Last year, the total sales 
<br/>was $6.6 million.  So, from 2017 from $2.3 million, AMA alone has grown substantially and from $6.6 
<br/>million, 90 percent of it is from export earnings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost all these money is transferred, over 5,000 contracted farmers AMA has 
<br/>on its book throughout Fiji and the rule is that, they will buy and pick up produce from those in the interior 
<br/>maritime who cannot come to the market because of the transportation and the rule is that, they will not 
<br/>buy those in the interior and maritime who cannot come to the market because of the transportation costs 
<br/>and other logistics, Sir.  So, the amount of money they make and those areas where exporters will not go 
<br/>and pick up the private sector exporters. May be, you do not want to cannibalise on where the private 
<br/>sector operators are working.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this journey to surpass sugar exports was not easy.  A lot of investment from 
<br/>Government took place; from ground level right to exporters, so that they are able to pick it up and send 
<br/>it overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last 10 years, the Ministry of Agriculture spent $3.35 million in providing direct support 
<br/></span><span>to exporters and agro processors, in terms of freezer trucks, cold storage facility, pack house, collection 
<br/></span><span>centres and processing centres, so that they can collect the produce, process it and export it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in this year’s Budget, we have expended, noting the entire supply chain. We can equip the 
<br/>exporters but there must be enough to produce for them to pick.  At the moment, we are re-routing kava 
<br/>from Vanuatu. We are not able to fulfil the kava demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $7 million have been allocated to ensure that farmers bring in their  productions, 
<br/>existing land to assist them on a 50/50 cost sharing basis, so that  there is enough produce for exporters 
<br/>to pick up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protected Agriculture, so that we do not want to hear complaints from the tourism sector or the   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>middlemen that offseason, we are not getting enough supply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nursery material, hydroponic, last year, we provided to 10 hydroponic farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Irrigation  equipment,  so  that  during  dry  season,  they  continue  to  produce  and  supply  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exporters and middlemen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No restriction in planting as long as they return the open pollinated seeds or planting material 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>back to the Ministry within three years’ time, again provided at no cost to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mechanisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, to assist the farmers, so that mechanisation which is a 
<br/>critical binding is dealt with.  So, we have excavators and 90 percent of ginger comes from Lomaivuna. 
<br/>I was there last week and we have allocated five excavators for cooperatives there, for them to buy with 
<br/>one-third contribution from them.  Sir, 25 tractors will be given out to cooperatives on a one-third, two-
<br/>third basis. Organic manure is promoted and supply to farmers at no cost to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year’s Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have for agro-processors $10,000 grant. We are looking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at about 25 agro-processes to get $10,000 grant, to upgrade basic facilities that they have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commercial farm and this is the second year that the Ministry has rolled out, again with half a 
<br/>million dollar grant to get them to make large investments on their processing facility through a loan from 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Development Bank where Government through the Ministry of Agriculture, will provide 20 percent 
<br/>equity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are the strategy to leverage our supply chain right from the production 
<br/>farm level, supply post-harvest issues  to the exporters and get them to the market where we have a brand 
<br/>image. We want to ensure that we maintain the brand image and export it to that market that we have in 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand and America, in particular.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- A Supplementary question, Sir. I thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>update on the promotion of agriculture export.  You have mentioned all the time “rural”.  Is that rural 
<br/>inclusive  of  maritime  rural  of  Kadavu,  port  of  Vunisea,  port  of  Naleca,  port  of  Levuka,  Gau,  Koro, 
<br/>Vanuabalavu Lakeba and Rotuma? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, of course, yes, that is part of rural and maritime.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a separate allocation for rural and maritime for agriculture development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Seizure of Hard Drugs  
<br/>(Question No. 154/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU T.N. NAVURELEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Defence,  National  Security  and  Policing,  Rural  and 
<br/>Maritime Development and Disaster Management update Parliament on the progress made by 
<br/>law  enforcement  agencies  in  the  seizure  of  hard  drugs,  including  crystal  methamphetamine, 
<br/>cocaine and heroin? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Navurelevu and I wish to thank him as well for raising this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  as  I  have  stated  here  during  the  Monday  proceedings,  that  our  war  against  drugs, 
<br/>particularly given what we are going through, is not that easy and it is very relevant as we progress in the 
<br/>cases of handling hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not only happening in Fiji as we are all aware, it is happening in the US, 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand and even very closely Tonga; one of our closest neighbour is having serious 
<br/>issues with hard drugs.  For us being the hub in the region, we are vulnerable and of course, we continue 
<br/></span><span>to see the influx of illicit substances from within the region and of course, from outside the region as well.  
<br/></span><span>The recent discovery of drugs washed ashore in the Lau Group, is an indication of the movement of drugs 
<br/>within the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from 2017 to to-date, the Fiji Police Force has registered a total of 6,282 cases.  
<br/>Out  of the 6,282,  302  are on methamphetamine, 22 cocaine and  5,958  cases are on marijuana.   The 
<br/>honourable Member included heroine as well, there was no heroin confiscated in Fiji during this period.  
<br/>But again, most of the cases are on marijuana but probably, we will focus more on the methamphetamine 
<br/>(302) and the 22 cocaine cases.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  these  cases,  most  of  the  offences  comprises  of  unlawful  importation, 
<br/>exportation,  possession,  cultivation,  supply,  transfer  and  transportation  of  illicit  drugs,  together  with 
<br/>controlled chemicals and even laboratory equipment as well in some instances, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I just wish to acknowledge the co-operation between the agencies and the Fiji Police Force, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particularly the National Substance Abuse Advisory Council, the Fiji Revenue and Customs Services, 
<br/>Biosecurity Authority of Fiji, INTERPOL, Department of Immigration, Fiji Navy, RFMF, Corrections 
<br/>Services, Social Welfare Department, other NGOs and CSOs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that worked with us, not 
<br/>only in our fight but of course, in our approach and advocacy as well to eliminate these drugs from Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I did mention about the Narcotics Bureau as raised by the honourable Ratu Navurelevu in his 
<br/>supplementary  question  about  the  Drug  Squad  in  the  Fiji  Police  Force.  We  have  slowly  formed  the 
<br/>Narcotics Bureau, we have 84 personnel in the team so that speaks volume but still probably we can say 
<br/>insufficient  for  now.   But as  I  have  alluded to earlier,  hopefully  we  are moving towards  having this 
<br/>independent from the Fiji Police Force, probably by 2027, based on the Singapore model that we are 
<br/>monitoring very closely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will stop there for now and if there are any further questions, I will be glad to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answer it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you, honourable Minister for Defence for answering that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My supplementary question is in regards to have methamphetamine being produced locally and 
<br/>if so, what are the mechanisms within your Ministry to target large purchasing of common household 
<br/>items in terms of methamphetamine production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I thank the honourable Dr. Lalabalavu for 
<br/>the question, which is very relevant as well.  Of course, we have had some cases but the majority of the 
<br/>methamphetamine, the 302 cases are coming from offshore. I was told by the Police that the price is really 
<br/>lucrative, it is about a million dollar to a kilogram now.  But we had instances where the ingredients, 
<br/>materials were sourced locally and this is why we are going on the Illicit Substance Drug Act that we are 
<br/>now trying to finalise with SG’s Office.  Because most of the materials or the ingredients can be available 
<br/>in the local pharmacists, you can just Google, see how to cook it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had an instance in Nadi, where there was a top floor nightclub, a level down, they were doing 
<br/></span><span>the cooking there but the Police are on to it. Our efforts towards drug dealers, we just need the information 
<br/></span><span>and if we can all work together on this, co-operate with the Fiji Police Force and other agencies, we 
<br/>should be able to have it under control I would say.   But of course, we have had instances where this is 
<br/>being attempted to be produced locally as well.

<div><span>Maritime Essential Services Centre Project  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 155/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H.R. POLITINI asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Defence, National Security and Policing, Rural and 
<br/>Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  update  Parliament  on  the  Maritime 
<br/>Essential Services Centre project funded by the Australian Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Member 
<br/>for raising this question.  This has been a topic of interest lately, but it is a good project for Fiji and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>region, particularly, given our responsibilities to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which 
<br/>is not with the Fiji Navy but with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport.  Both have links to the 
<br/>IMO.  I wish to clarify as well the issues relating to this project.  At the outset, I wish to again extend our 
<br/>profound appreciation to the Government of Australia for its continued partnership with Fiji, particularly 
<br/>in supporting Fiji’s defence and security capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Maritime Essential Services Centre (MESC) as we 
<br/>commonly refer to is being funded by the Australian Government as part of Fiji’s ever growing </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>
<br/>partnership with  Australia.   The MESC project  comes  at  a  cost of  around  AUS$38 million which is 
<br/>equivalent to FJ$56.2million and will also create around 445 jobs depending on the various stages of the 
<br/>project.  We all know that Black Rock has been completed and this is the next big project that has been 
<br/>agreed between Australia and Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, MESC will be an inter-agency facility which will essentially house the command element 
<br/>of the Republic of Fiji Navy who are currently based at Stanley Brown Naval Base, Walu Bay; the Fiji 
<br/>Hydrographic Office; the Fiji Maritime Surveillance and Rescue Coordination Centre and the 3DP Suva 
<br/>Coastal Radio Station, and other normal facilities like gymnasium, mess hall, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again we are thankful to the honourable Minister for Transport.  I need to clarify 
<br/></span><span>this because the land is already a State land under MSAF.  We had other options, but, unfortunately, the 
<br/>geotechnical survey ruled out the use of </span><span>RFNS Viti</span><span> in Togalevu and even in Walu Bay itself.  The ideal 
<br/>location for us is in Lami.  For those who are not aware of this site, this is where the lower leading light 
<br/>is located.  There are two that the ships use when they want to come into the harbour, the lower light and 
<br/>the upper light.  So, once the two are aligned then you enter.  The facility is where the lower light is and 
<br/>that is or was previously owned by MSAF.  We are thankful to the honourable Minister because we are 
<br/>desperate to have the project proceed, and the honourable Minister came to our rescue and we are indeed 
<br/>grateful for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been some issues raised lately but I must assure the general public that the consultations 
<br/>began way back in 2019.  We started having consultations with the local communities.  Most recently, 
<br/>because of some concerned  citizens, we have  again,  I  personally  tasked the Permanent Secretary  for 
<br/>Defence to go and lead those discussions rather than the Australians who are there providing the project 
<br/>management team because this is a national project belonging to the Ministry of Defence. We are to be 
<br/>in the frontline and my Permanent Secretary is having discussions now with the communities in Lami 
<br/>but the benefits are huge, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  An investment of approximately FJ$50 million, creation of 
<br/>jobs and most importantly our roles as we have committed to under the IMO, particularly on hydrography.  
<br/></span><span>As you are well aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have an issue of unsurveyed waters and of course the need 
<br/></span><span>for us to resurvey our waters as well.  So, when they have, with the ships available now and with a better 
<br/>facility, we should be able to fast track all the outstanding works.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we move up to that station as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when it comes to coastal radio  – 
<br/>coastal radio monitors all the movement of the ships within the local waters.  We will have 100 percent 
<br/>coverage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we move up to that location.  And of course, search and rescue, we 
<br/>have that responsibility not only for Fiji but for our neighbouring islands as well – Kiribati and are few 
<br/>others, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so we have that responsibility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we have this project in Lami, definitely the real estate value in the 
<br/>surrounding areas will improve and most importantly that base alone will provide security to the area and 
<br/>this is probably something that we need to assure our people that the base itself will bring security to the 
<br/>people in there.  I will stop there for now, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span> Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of Farm Access Roads – Update of   
<br/>(Question No. 156/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.R. RASOVA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Agriculture,  Waterways  and  Environment  update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the development of farm access roads nationwide? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Member for asking 
<br/>this question.  I do understand why he has asked this question.  Farm roads are very important in 
<br/>interior rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with farm roads, it is not only about accessing the market from the farm.  It 
<br/>is from the village to the farm as well.  There are a number of places, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are still 
<br/>organising our work to ensure that farmers have access to the farm, they can take machineries so that 
<br/>they can take large scale work there, land clearing with machines.  Without a farm road, machinery 
<br/>use is not possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Directly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will be opening up these farming areas to market and that again 
<br/></span><span>gives incentives and boosts the moral for these farmers to expand their area, expand the production 
<br/>and contribute to not only their development but national development as well.  It also, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, boosts the moral of the farming households who stay there, the children to go to school, go to 
<br/>health centres, a lot of places.  Farm roads are used for more than farming activities and communities 
<br/>do understand and appreciate the investment that we are making to construct these farm roads because 
<br/>it immediately enhances the value of them staying in that particular area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last four years, we have established 118 kilometres of farm roads.  
<br/>On an average, 30 kilometres per year. We have got on our books now 243 kilometres of farm roads 
<br/>to be established.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have got on our books now 243 kilometres of farm roads to be established.  
<br/>Now it is  not because suddenly  there  are these is  new  farm  roads that needs to be  established.   Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we have inherited these places where farmers have been struggling for so long and now over 
<br/>the last 10 years started to construct farm roads then these requests are coming because Government is 
<br/>now establishing these farm roads for them. Before Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was no allocation for farm 
<br/>road establishment, it is this Government who has decided that we will establish farm roads. So, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, 101 roads of a total of 243 kilometres needs to be established as now in our books. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, we have got three sets of machineries in three areas.  Nukulau in 
<br/>Ra, farm road work has started for this financial year, Lomaivuna in Naitasiri, farm road work started on 
<br/>Monday for this financial year and Vunivau in Bua, farm road establishment started from today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking at the past data of 30 kilometres per year, this 243 kilometres will 
<br/>take us years.  For that reason we have decided to have a combination of outsourcing using contractors 
<br/>who have got a separate allocation for farm roads in the Budget as well using the machinery we have, as 
<br/>well as the $7 million that has been allocated will also be utilised.  With the combination of these three 
<br/>approaches, we are looking at, at least this financial year undertaking close to 80 kilometres of farm roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in three years’ time we should be able to deal with these lot of farm 
<br/>roads that we have on our books now – 243 kilometres. The Central Division has 60 kilometres, Western 
<br/>Division  has  38  kilometres,  Northern  Division  has  133  kilometres  (largest),  Eastern  Division  has  12 
<br/>kilometres.  So, the largest farm road request is from the Northern Division 133 kilometres, second comes

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Central  Division  with  60  kilometres  and  then  Western  Division  with  38  kilometres  and  Eastern 
<br/>Division with 12 kilometres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  T.N.  NAVURELEVU.-  A  supplementary  question,  Sir.    These  development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>includes the repair and maintenance of the existing farm roads? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Yes, this includes the maintenance of the existing farm roads that we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- I thank the honourable Minister for giving us a brief on the amount of 
<br/>kilometres;  12  kilometres  on  maritime,  Eastern  Division.    We  want  the  Eastern  Division  (Kadavu, 
<br/>Lomaiviti, Lau and Rotuma) to contribute into your agricultural export. When are you going to do more 
<br/>farm roads on these islands in the Eastern Division? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. M. REDDY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a request we have on board.  The Ministry of 
<br/>Rural and Maritime Development just did a farm road in Ra, they are also undertaking the work.  So, if 
<br/>there is a request from Kadavu or any other place, we are happy to look at it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SIGARARA.- We have done it in Kadavu, but he was not there.

<div><span>US Treaty Agreement 
<br/>(Question No. 157/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Fisheries update Parliament on the significance of the 
<br/>US during the PIFs meeting on the increase in US Government’s annual contribution under 
<br/>the US Treaty Agreement? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  CDR.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    I  thank  honourable  Kirpal  for  the 
<br/>question.  The announcement made during the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting by the US Vice 
<br/>President is significant for many reasons.  The US Treaty was first negotiated in 1983 and finalised in 
<br/>1988.  It is a Treaty between Pacific Island nations and the US and has been the platform for collective 
<br/>collaboration and partnership in which assistance and funding is channelled to the region.  The increase 
<br/>to US$60 million represents a jump of 153.8 percent which will generate a total of $600 million during 
<br/></span><span>the term of the agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the overall management and sustainable use of the Pacific region’s tuna stock 
<br/>is accredited to the assistance of the US Tuna Treaty.  As a matter of fact, the Treaty led to the recognition 
<br/>of  Pacific  Island’s  sovereign  rights  over  its  many  Exclusive  Economic  Zones  (EEZ).    This  was  a 
<br/>milestone achievement given the fact that tuna stocks are highly in migratory and move across different 
<br/>maritime boundaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2016 the US Government’s annual contribution under the Treaty was at 
<br/>US$21 million.  These funds which are kept and administered by the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) are 
<br/>equally divided between the 15 FFA members which includes Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in the US Government’s contribution is significant as it strengthens 
<br/>the  collective partnership under the Treaty  and meets the needs of the broader  FFA  membership.   It 
<br/>reaffirms the commitment from the US to address the growing concern of tuna politics in the region and 
<br/>brings about balance in the wider membership. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally these funds go directly to member fisheries development initiatives.  The increase 
<br/>allows  for  countries  to  channel  additional  funds  towards  the  development  and  realisation  of  national 
<br/>fisheries aspirations. This includes providing funds for fisheries projects, access to innovative science 
<br/>within the fisheries sub-sector and boost self-reliance, market access and economic progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase of $60 million also elevates support towards national and regional 
<br/>capacity building initiatives.  The increase will help in the development of fit-for-purpose training and 
<br/>technical assistance that there will be more options available as funding is available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in US$60 million will provide significant support towards 
<br/>broader cooperation in addressing illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  Through the US, there will 
<br/>be more support from surveillance asset providers which includes partners such as France, Australia and 
<br/>New Zealand.  All these developments will serve as a deterrent to illegal distant-water fishing fleets that 
<br/>would otherwise target areas of less surveillance.  It solidifies our rights as sovereign nations and enable 
<br/>us to set management measures to sustainable harvest and protect the region’s tuna stock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O'CONNOR.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We have one here and one there.  I will take the lady first.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  can the honourable Minister inform this  august 
<br/>Parliament on how these funds are received?  Does it come directly to the Government for utilisation 
<br/>every year or is there a process to enable access? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I thank the honourable Member for the supplementary 
<br/>question.  The US Treaty Funds is a fund that actually comes to the Government.  Over the past, it has 
<br/>been agreed for the funds to stay within the Forum Fishing Agency which is based out in Honiara and the 
<br/>members would need to provide project development proposals for the funds to be released.  Now, the 
<br/>funds come through via authorisation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then it is given to the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy, which then details the utilisation of the funds as per requirement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. O'CONNOR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; noting the use of Treaty 
<br/>funds for fisheries development and realisation of fisheries explorations, can the honourable Minister 
<br/>inform Parliament with examples of how Fiji has utilised these funds in the past? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his 
<br/></span><span>supplementary  question.  As  highlighted  in  my  earlier  response,  the  US  Tuna  Treaty  Funds  is  made 
<br/></span><span>available to cater for national fisheries programme initiatives and needs.  The fund is given after it has 
<br/>been divided among the 12 members of Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) and then each country dictates 
<br/>what the funds will be used for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in Fiji’s case, most of the funds go to the grassroot communities, an assistance 
<br/>that  is  provided  to  them,  channelled  through  the  Ministry  of  Economy  as  priorities  are  given  by  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Fisheries.    It  also  provides  scientific  assistance  from  other  agencies,  so  this  fund  is  also 
<br/>allocated to fund that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also given to villages and </span><span>tikina </span><span>around the country.  I think the fisheries associations that are 
<br/>established around the coastal areas and the maritime islands, I think one of the best examples is the Bua 
<br/>Fisheries Association.  They have been given a fiberglass boat with a 75 horsepower.  They generated 
<br/>funds and they have been one of the most successful fisheries association and at the moment, they have 
<br/>round about $15,000 in their bank account after they were donated with the boat and the engine that was 
<br/>provided through the FFA funds.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Sir,  a  supplementary  question;  with  an  increase  in  the  US  Government 
<br/>contribution to the region’s Forum Fisheries membership, is that $60 million all that is paid to fish within 
<br/>our EEZ, or is there a separate payment received for fishing access? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. CDR. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his 
<br/>supplementary question.  The simple response is, no.  Access to fishing in the EEZ for members to catch 
<br/>tuna is dealt with under a different arrangement in the Treaty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an ongoing discussion in the re-negotiation process and depending on the amount agreed 
<br/>upon, members are then paid according to the amount of days the fishing fleet access members’ EEZ to 
<br/>fish.  This is done on a </span><span>pro rata </span><span>basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improvement of Inter-Island Ferry Services 
<br/>(Question No. 158/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A. JALE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Commerce,  Trade,  Tourism  and  Transport  update 
<br/></span><span>Parliament on the measures taken to improve inter-island ferry services to maritime islands which 
<br/></span><span>has affected the delivery of supplies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said this before that we must all realise that when 
<br/>we  are  dealing  with  the  maritime  sector,  we  have  two  kinds  of  routes  -  the  economical  and  the 
<br/>uneconomical routes.  I am not pointing at you too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As a maritime economy, Sir, Fiji’s shipping sector, Mr. Speaker, plays a critical role in our trade 
<br/>and our economic development and basically sustaining our everyday livelihood, so we understand it.  
<br/>The question is actually alluding to the uneconomical routes through the Government Shipping Franchise 
<br/>Scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are serving 18 ports with and without jetties. For 10 routes with an 
<br/>average of about 15 trips a month, and the routes which are serviced are Lower Southern Lau, Rotuma, 
<br/>Lomaiviti, Northern Lau, Kadavu, Upper Southern Lau, Yasayasa Moala, Yasawa, North East Vanua 
<br/>Levu, Beqa, Yanuca and Vatulele.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite, Mr. Speaker, the private vessel operators withdrawing services to our maritime islands, 
<br/></span><span>shipping  services  actually  continued.    Passengers  are  actually  travelling  and  cargo  continues  to  be 
<br/></span><span>transported to our maritime islands.  This was only made possible through some private vessel operators, 
<br/>such as Brighton Holdings and Valeisasa Shipping who, despite the hard times, Mr. Speaker, they faced 
<br/>through the increase in the price of fuel and cost, et cetera, they withstood the hardship and continued 
<br/>they contracted services and more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have our 12 Government Vessels which are part of the Ministry’s Government Shipping 
<br/>Services (GSS). The Government fleet has been providing continuous service to all our franchise routes 
<br/>and providing charter services to ensure continuation of our Government development programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government is actually strongly committed to improving its services and from the 
<br/>$2.3 million in 2019-2020 financial year to $3.14 million in the 2022-2023 financial year, is actually the 
<br/>increase, so we have got an increase in subsidies for different routes.  For example, for Rotuma in the 
<br/>previous budget, we were allocated a subsidy of $25,000 per trip per month whereas in this financial year, 
<br/>Rotuma will be allocated $44,000.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Lower  Southern  Lau  which  includes  Ono-i-Lau,  was  previously  allocated  a  subsidy  of 
<br/>$18,000 and in this financial year, it goes up to $29,000. This is, obviously, only possible through the 
<br/>commitment of the Government and the new budgetary allocation to the Government Franchise Scheme 
<br/>which came into effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  relation  to  passengers  and  cargo,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  may  have  been  some  minimum 
<br/>disruptions in service, and  to-date, we have transported about 6,537 tonnes of cargo in 2020 and 12,441 
<br/>passengers were moved between the main ports and the island ports.  In 2021, it was about 4,650 tonnes 
<br/>of cargo transported and 6,000 odd passengers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an indication, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the magnitude of movement of cargo and passengers 
<br/>between  our  maritime  islands.    Despite  the  heightened  passenger  movement  due  to  the  COVID-19 
<br/>restrictions, we had developed mechanisms to allow the movement of cargo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been working hard to ensure minimal disruptions also in terms of provision of services 
<br/>to our maritime islands. This is made possible with Government fleet taking over some of the franchise 
<br/>services as and when suspended or cancelled by the private vessel operators.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During financial year 2021-2022, GSS was able to cater for about 34 franchise trips that enabled 
<br/></span><span>it  to  transfer  7,069  odd  tonnes  of  cargo  and  accommodate  1,353  odd  passengers,  Sir.    From  the  34 
<br/>provision of franchise trips services, we have provided to Upper Southern Lau, Yasayasa Moala, Beqa, 
<br/>Yanuca, Vatulele, Lower Southern Lau, North East Vanua Levu, Rotuma and Yasawa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, GSS has taken about 347 odd voyages for the period of 2018 right through the 2022, 
<br/>Sir, and so for the same period, about 15,000 odd passengers and 13,000 odd tonnes of cargo to the 
<br/>maritime islands.  Some of these services are actually wholly and solely funded by Government to provide 
<br/>only supplies to the maritime islands, particularly for items for our cooperatives and our shops, fuel for 
<br/>generators, fibreglass boats and general cargo.  For example, in July, Sir, the </span><span>MV Vunilagi</span><span> had to deliver 
<br/>supplies only to Rotuma, to ensure that groceries and fuel were delivered urgently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  team  at  the  Ministry  are  also  in  daily  contact  and  they  communicate  daily  with  the 
<br/>representatives from the Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development, iTaukei Affairs, particularly with 
<br/>the Provincial Administrators, the District Officers, </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span> and </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>, to establish and 
<br/>determine the supplies and the fuel that are needed on the islands to enable urgent deployment of vessels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst the Government is playing its part, Sir, we plead with our travelling public to maximise 
<br/></span><span>the use of the services provided.  For example, in the lower Southern Lau route which consists of Kabara, 
<br/></span><span>Fulaga, Ogea, Vatoa and Ono-i-Lau, a total of 12 trips must be deployment in any given year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2019, 12 trips were deployed and utilised; 11 trips in 2020; seven trips in 2021 due to the 
<br/>impact of the pandemic and seven trips in 2022 up to last month.  And in all trips, Sir, an average of 60 
<br/>percent of the capacity of the vessel is utilised in each service, meaning passenger and freight.  Therefore, 
<br/>our maritime islands are actually encouraged to increase their utilisation capacity to ensure that we get 
<br/>maximum delivery of those services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is also an indication, Sir, that we are actually catering for the entire maritime travelling public 
<br/>and we still have capacity to increase the numbers.  The team in the Ministry is in collaboration with other 
<br/>Ministries and we will continue to provide the services to our maritime islands efficiently and effectively.  
<br/>I hope that answers his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this question was supposed to be asked by honourable 
<br/>Nand but who has had to attend to an urgent matter, therefore, the question will be asked by honourable

<div><span>Economic Benefits of Nadi-Vancouver Flight 
<br/>(Question No. 159/2022) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. R.R. SHARMA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Attorney-General  and  Minister  for  Economy,  Civil  Service, 
<br/>Communications, Housing and Community Development inform Parliament on the economic 
<br/>benefits of the direct Nadi-Vancouver flight? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to publicly acknowledge and thank the 
<br/>six honourable Members from the Opposition who have decided to remain in Parliament.  I think we 
<br/>should acknowledge your presence for having the perseverance to stay on.  The others, of course, have 
<br/>chosen to leave which, I think, is quite an abomination in respect of their respect for Parliament and, 
<br/>indeed,  the  respect  for  the  taxpayers  of  Fiji,  who  are  actually  paying  for  their  salaries.    The  Nadi-
<br/>Vancouver  flight  officially  commences  on  25</span><span>th</span><span>  November.    Of  course,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  offers  a 
<br/>multitude of opportunities for Fijians and also Canadians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the flight to Vancouver covers four major cities which includes Vancouver and 
<br/></span><span>Surrey in Canada and Seattle and Portland in the United States.  Currently, the closest connecting flights 
<br/>for them are Los Angeles and San Francisco for these two American cities, both of which are over 1,000 
<br/>kilometres away.  Seattle is only a couple of hours away from Vancouver, Sir.  So, it is a huge catchment 
<br/>area, not just for Canada from a Canadian perspective but also from American perspective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be brief, Sir.  We also inform that Seattle and Portland not only has Fijians but also Tongans 
<br/>and Samoans, who reside in those two cities.  For them, it will be a lot easier to come to the Pacific and, 
<br/>indeed, further creating Nadi as a transit hub for the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this opportunity to fly to Vancouver was not something that was thought of 
<br/>overnight, as honourable Gavoka seems to imply in his statement.  I think he sometimes seeks relevance 
<br/>and  that  is  why  I  make  statements  willy-nilly.    Similarly,  people  like  Mahendra  Chaudhry  made 
<br/>statements on it calling it a junket.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were essentially, Sir, on the ground for about 36 hours with that.  We left Fiji on Tuesday.  
<br/>We were on the promotional flight in the evening.  We arrived there on Tuesday morning, their time, 
<br/>round about midday and then we spent about three or four hours at the airport.  There were a lot of 
<br/></span><span>celebrations.  We would like to publicly acknowledge and thank the Fijian diaspora who turned up at the 
<br/></span><span>airport.  They were very, very excited about the fact that we will have direct flights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were flights, Sir,  a number of years back, where Fiji Airways used to fly a 737 that used 
<br/>to go from here to Hawaii, and then on to Vancouver.  This is a completely different product, Sir.  It is a 
<br/>one flight, there is no stopovers, and it is obviously going to be A330 and God willing, if we are able to 
<br/>get a bigger aircraft, we could fly the A350 to Vancouver and that will depend on the loads that we will 
<br/>see.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the idea is not only to tap into the 100,000–odd Fijians that live on the Northwest 
<br/>Coast of Canada, but also Fijians on the Eastern Seaboard of Canada, including Canadians themselves 
<br/>because  many  Canadians  do  fly  to  Hawaii  and  to  Mexico  as  holiday  opportunities  but  Fiji  is  a  new 
<br/>destination for them where they will have direct connectivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the team that went on the promotional flight, Sir, we had a number of travel agencies that went 
<br/>with us, and also Tourism Fiji.  In fact, Sir, they went on a promotional tour, after we came back the next 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>day.  They went to Toronto and San Francisco which included, of course, Fiji Airways, Tourism Fiji and 
<br/>other hotel operators, including someone we saw who was from the Pearl Resort in Pacific Harbour.  A 
<br/>number  of  other  operators,  Sir,  were  also  there  and  they  spent  a  couple  of  weeks  there  in  terms  of 
<br/>promoting Fiji, of course, as a destination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the other point that I wish to make also, following on from what the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture mentioned, is the potential for trade and also export of Fijian products and produce with direct 
<br/>flights.  The current forecast is that, we expect about 15 tonnes of cargo per flight, which will be made 
<br/>up of fresh and frozen vegetables, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, cassava, frozen seafood such as fish, crabs, </span><span>kai</span><span> and not forgetting, 
<br/>of course, kava.  Sir, even things like eggplants and </span><span>bhindi</span><span>, and you would be surprised how the Fijian 
<br/>diaspora want to eat things from Fiji.  I mean, we have people coming from Australia and buying Bongo 
<br/>and Twisties from Fiji because they think it has a different taste and then it reminds them of home.  So, 
<br/>there  are  a  lot  of  Fijians  there  and  this  will  create  opportunities  for  them  and  also  for  the  Fiji  Agro 
<br/>Marketing Authority, and they will be pursuing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, the Fiji Airways is in discussions with Biosecurity Authority of Fiji 
<br/>(BAF) to ensure that a regulatory pathway is open for our exports with BAF’s counterpart in Canada 
<br/>because we have to overcome the quarantine issues.  Some former Fijians in Vancouver are also tapping 
<br/></span><span>into this opportunity, a lot of them actually did talk about it.  Some of them have stores, they want to be 
<br/></span><span>able to sell things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the flip side, of course, Sir, is that, we can bring in fruits and various other produce from 
<br/>Canada.  When we were there, this is only a couple of weeks ago, they were selling cherries, strawberries 
<br/>and various other  stone fruits because they were in season and are really, really inexpensive.  Cherries 
<br/>were $2 a punnet in Canada.  Of course, it is off-season in Australia and New Zealand, so we have the 
<br/>opportunity. So when it is on-season in Canada, we can have the fruits coming in from Canada and when 
<br/>it is off-season in Canada, we have the on-season fruits from Australia and New Zealand because they 
<br/>are in the Southern Hemisphere.  So, those kind of synergies and opportunities do exist and, indeed, we 
<br/>have spoken to them.  It will also mean that in our hotels, they may be paying top dollars to just serve 
<br/>strawberries  in  their  restaurants  or  in  their  hotels  now,  but  they  can  get  much  affordable  fruits  and 
<br/>vegetables which they want from overseas, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, one of the things that we found now, we have seen that our Los Angeles 
<br/>flights are bringing in a lot of transit cargo that are going onward to Auckland or to Sydney or Melbourne 
<br/>and various other places.  So, again, this is another opportunity for Nadi to act as a transit hub, as far as 
<br/>airfreight is concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that we also wish to make is that the connectivity we are currently 
<br/>seeing a lot of people who fly from Australia to go to West Coast of North America are again transiting 
<br/>through Nadi they come on the Sydney flight arrive here at 7.00 p.m. and then the 10.00 p.m. flight to 
<br/>Los Angeles.  As we know Sir that the Fijian Government has recently amended the laws where you can 
<br/>stay in Fiji for five days or less you actually do not pay departure tax. We know we want to use that 
<br/>opportunity, we may have Canadians wanting to go to Australia, they come to Nadi spend three-four days 
<br/>jump on the next plane to Sydney - these are the opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, we had an interesting discussion too where we met with the Vancouver Airport CEO and we 
<br/>met a lot of former Fijians who work at the airport - the number of opportunities in that way. We also met 
<br/>up with two British Columbian Ministers.  British Columbia is equivalent to State that is over Canada.  
<br/>We met honourable Ravi Kahlon who is the Minister for Jobs, Economic Recovery and Innovation.  The 
<br/>Minister for Labour, honourable Harry Bains and we also discussed with them about opportunities in 
<br/>industrial hemp because we have been informed by the United Nations (UN) that Canada has some of 
<br/>the best industrial hemp seeds.

<div><span> Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka, I saw there was an article in the Fiji Times saying that “we want to introduce 
<br/>industrial hemp as a back door bringing marijuana” which is really quite obtuse too for him to say that.  I 
<br/>do not know again probably desperate to get some publications printed under his name but industrial 
<br/>hemp is obviously quite different to normal marijuana that you smoke with the THC levels that is higher 
<br/>than 1 percent and they were quite keen to assist us in respect of helping us getting industrial hemp seeds 
<br/>in collaboration with the Fiji National University Agriculture School and of course through the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture once we are able to roll that out and there is quite a lot of work been done in that respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So Mr. Speaker, Sir, all in all we are very excited about the Canadian direct flight, Fiji Airways 
<br/>as we have said fly to San Francisco to LA from November to Vancouver fly to Narita, Hong Kong when 
<br/>it opens up, we fly to Singapore, Eastern Sea Board of Australia and now including Adelaide and of 
<br/>course  Auckland,  Wellington  and  Christchurch  and  not  forgetting  the  other  Pacific  Island  country 
<br/>destinations.  The only continent that Fiji Airways does not fly to is South America.  We fly to every 
<br/>other single continent that are the rims of the Pacific Ocean except South America and we need to be all 
<br/>very proud about this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have also had discussions, I think honourable Gavoka the other day mentioned about we need 
<br/>to fly to some England places and USA and again those are the opportunities we are looking at to be able 
<br/></span><span>to tap into what we call middle-America and the east coast of USA.  Thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
