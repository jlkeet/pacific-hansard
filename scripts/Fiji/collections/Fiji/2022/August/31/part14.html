<div><span>REVIEW REPORT- FIJI FILM AUGUST 2016 TO 31 JULY 2017  
<br/>AND JANUARY TO JULY 2016 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of Film Fiji 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2016 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017 and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Film Fiji 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 Annual Reports which was tabled on 10</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Film Fiji is the Film Commission of Fiji tasked with 
<br/>managing  Government’s  incentives.  Film  Fiji  provides  location  services,  administers  the  rebate 
<br/>processes, grants film permits and facilitates necessary approvals from  authorities such as the tax 
<br/></span><span>department, immigration and other government departments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Film  Fiji  also  provides  advice  on  production  budget  and  assists  with  administrative 
<br/>procedures,  with  the  aim  of  making  business  of  film  making  exciting,  stress-free,  and  ultimately 
<br/>positioning Fiji as one of the most sought-after film destinations in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Government statutory body, Film Fiji has a large network of local stakeholders who are 
<br/>directly involved in the film industry, ensuring that production companies have a pleasant experience 
<br/>while shooting in Fiji.  From January to July 2016, 32 productions were filmed in Fiji and came from 
<br/>various countries such as Australia, United States of America, New Zealand, China et cetera. This 
<br/>generated FJ$92.4 million of new economic activity which contributed to Fiji’s economic growth 
<br/>and also created employment for our locals.  Moreover, for the period from August 2016 – July 2017, 
<br/>57 productions were filmed in Fiji which generated FJ$212.3 million of new economic activity in the 
<br/>economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Film  Fiji  continues  to  create  employment  opportunities  for  our  locals  by  bringing  film 
<br/>productions into the country. As majority of the productions were filmed in rural locations, most of 
<br/>the locals were engaged from these local communities and this helped improve the standard of living 
<br/></span><span>of these communities.  In anticipation of the new challenges of the post-COVID-19 pandemic era, 
<br/></span><span>Film Fiji’s working steadily on improving all areas of its operation.  In its path to recovery, Film Fiji has 
<br/>structured its strategy under three main pillars: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Do more with less; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tell the world what makes Film Fiji unique; and 
<br/>Prepare for the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me to give a brief contribution 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would try to draw your attention to the composition of the Film Fiji Board, 
<br/>based on the 2016-2017 Annual Report. The problem is, I believe there is a missing link from the Board 
<br/>down to the communities.  Sir, I want to be clear that I am not questioning the integrity or capability or 
<br/>credibility of the Board Members. I want to say here that because of the Film Fiji Project are based on 
<br/>rural areas and villages, there should be a representative from the communities into the Board.  I suggest

<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the Minister responsible to co-opt a Board member from each province especially from the Provincial 
<br/>Office, the Roko Tui of every province to be part of the Board during the term of film making. Sir, we all 
<br/>understand  that  our  provinces  have  slightly  different  approach  to  traditional  protocol  and  culture. 
<br/>Therefore, it is the responsibility of these representatives to be co-opted from the Provincial Office to 
<br/>ensure that traditional protocol and culture are observed during the term of film making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  film  must  not  be  culturally  derogative  in  its  portrayal  of  Fiji  or  the  people  of  Fiji.    For 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>example, these people do not understand the culture … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Which people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- The film makers and we need someone who understand the culture and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the protocol … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- … to ensure that these are observed during film making.  I and you have 
<br/></span><span>noticed that so it is better for them to co-opt these provincial council representatives, the Roko Tui to 
<br/>ensure that these culture and protocols are being observed during film making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will quickly go to page 10 of the Annual Report which says “encouraging local employment 
<br/>opportunities”.  I come from a community where they have been doing a lot of film making.  Since 2018, 
<br/>these film makers from overseas are no longer coming to the communities or to the villages to present 
<br/>their </span><span>sevusevu</span><span> and discuss the reasons and the terms of staying in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  discussion,  Sir,  we  normally  engaged  in  discussion  regarding  the  recruitment  of 
<br/>unskilled labour, security guards, kitchen hands, beach cleaners, weavers, builders all these come from 
<br/>the community but we have noticed lately, Sir, that these have not been happening now. It is the Film Fiji 
<br/>that has been sourcing all these from other parts of Fiji, overlooking the communities to where they are 
<br/>based on which they are supposed to be benefiting from the film money. That is why I said, Sir, it is 
<br/>important for the honourable Minister responsible to consider co-opting a member from the province or 
<br/>the </span><span>Roko Tui</span><span> to be part of the Board.  If there is a film making in Lau then co-opt the </span><span>Roko Tui </span><span>Lau to be 
<br/>part of the Board, if you have a film making in Bua, co-opt the </span><span>Roko Tui</span><span> Bua to be part of the Board.  
<br/>That is what I am trying to say, so that the benefits actually is done to the community.  I hope that they 
<br/></span><span>will consider that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have one word for my friend across on the other side, 
<br/>“absolute hogwash”.  It is actually quite ridiculous, he has not done one ounce of research on Film Fiji 
<br/>and came here and made allegations against the Board without any basis whatsoever, and he calls them 
<br/>“culturally derogatory”.  My honourable friend, I think you ought to go and sit down at Film Fiji and find 
<br/>out how culturally sensitive they are, how culturally sensitive the Board is and how culturally sensitive 
<br/>this particular side of Parliament is.  We take care of all citizens, we make sure that all our cultures are 
<br/>looked after and that is the policy of this particular Government and that is portrayed in every single 
<br/>Board that actually exist in Fiji.  It does.  You ought to go and do your research before you make such 
<br/>statements, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- Do you have the evidence where film making is being done?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Excuse me, every single culture is actually respected by Film Fiji.  We do 
<br/>not, we must not, we shall not, we will not, we never do in terms of Film Fiji, they are being culturally 
<br/>sensitive from day one.  So it is the generalised pie in the sky statements that he makes about culturally 
<br/>derogatory way in which they operate, actually that is out of order.  It is absolute hogwash.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to contribute to the actual Report of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Affairs on Film Fiji for the 2016-2017 Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  acknowledge  the  Report  of  the  Committee,  especially,  in  thoroughly  perusing  the  Annual 
<br/>Report.  I am clarifying and noting relevant facts, and this is in particular to the Board of Survey, which 
<br/>is  being  carried  out  before  the  end  of  each  financial  year,  following  Film  Fiji’s  change  from  annual 
<br/>calendar year to Government financial year, which is August to July each year.  I also take note of the 
<br/>recommendations that have been highlighted by the Standing Committee in the review report, whilst time 
<br/>is of the essence,  I shall be brief with my response.   It is no secret, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Fijian 
<br/>economy was significantly impacted by COVID-19 pandemic one way or the other.  So as businesses 
<br/>had to adapt and also to be innovative in the operations to keep afloat, Film Fiji as well has continued to 
<br/>persevere with improving their operation in the face of uncertainty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is evidence as Film Fiji continues to work in projects in the areas of digitalisation of the 
<br/></span><span>Film Commission’s operations by implementing productions management software, and digitalising of 
<br/>paper work related production incentives and also the launch of their new website.  This was actually 
<br/>internally  developed  with  goal  of  offering  better  useability  providing  quicker  and  more  complete 
<br/>information on available services in Fiji and actually simplifying the access to information related to film 
<br/>permit procedures and relevant applications.  Realising the importance also of upskilling and reskilling 
<br/>of the staff in any organisation, Film Fiji has actually begun to build staff capacity also in digital skills in 
<br/>addition to working with relevant stakeholders in strengthening Film Fiji’s friendly policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Film Fiji has actually set a vision of strengthening, training 
<br/>and developing in Fiji by launching a couple of things.  One is the School Media Learning Programme, 
<br/>and again, this undertakes a training programme for all different parts of the community.  First of all, they 
<br/>got a School media Learning Programme with Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts and with the 
<br/>support of Australian Film Television and Radio School to bring the key media skills to Year 9 to Year 
<br/>11 across the country.  These skills will prepare children for the media and visual skills required by jobs 
<br/>in the future.  We also got the professional media learning programme bringing online courses from 
<br/>international sources to upskill and train professional local filmmakers in Fiji and also Suva International 
<br/>Short Film Festival, Sir, to share international award winning short films with local filmmakers and with 
<br/></span><span>schools participating at the social school media learning programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  exposure, Mr. Speaker, to these  films, is  meant to  provide  a  benchmark to promote the 
<br/>creation and exhibition of local films.  It will be remiss of me also not to add that Film Fiji Commission 
<br/>is also strengthening its presence in international markets and trade shows and this is to showcase Fiji to 
<br/>major  studios  and  our  readiness  to  attract  film  and  television  productions  and  also  the  available 
<br/>infrastructure accessibility, our pristine locations, our English speaking crew and the current film tax 
<br/>rebates incentives that are offered by the Fijian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  these  projects  have  been  highlighted  to  the  Parliament,  that  they  are  actually 
<br/>commendable,  I  wish  to,  Mr.  Speaker,  underscore  the  importance  of  the  film  industry  to  our  Fijian 
<br/>economy.    During  COVID-19  pandemic  and  with  the  gradual  opening  of  our  borders,  Fiji  actually 
<br/>facilitated the famous  reality television show  “US  Survivor”  for seasons  41  and 42,  and through the 
<br/>facilitation of the COVID-19 Risk Mitigation Taskforce (CRMT) and has generated employment, my 
<br/>dear honourable friend, it has generated employment of 408 locals and created $70 million worth of new 
<br/>economic activity and that is during COVID-19 and this was across the board for everybody.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>2216 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this year alone, till to-date, we have hosted five major productions which 
<br/>created a local employment of 690-odd persons with a new economic activity of about $110.25 million.  
<br/>Similarly, we have 55 productions that have also filmed on our shores and generating employment for 99 
<br/>locals and creating new economic activity of $4.6 million.  Prior to the pandemic, we had attracted 57-
<br/>odd productions which contributed about $43 million to the Fijian economy in 2016.  In the following 
<br/>year, Fiji hosted around 73 productions, which in turn, generated an increase of 173.95 percent, which is 
<br/>$217.8 million of new economic activity collectively for 2018 and 2019, and we facilitated a total of 203 
<br/>productions which contributed about $358 million to our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, film and television productions have also contributed (and I hope you are listening), 
<br/>towards the surrounding communities as a gesture of goodwill and commitment to the development of 
<br/>Fiji, so do not tell us that we desensitise it by being, taking some particular part of our community out.  
<br/>These donations also ranged from school items, books, desks, household care packs, medical equipment, 
<br/>generators, donating cash to women’s funds and education funds, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the years, Film Fiji has developed new skills and talent in a number of areas that are required 
<br/>by production companies and the Film Fiji database, Sir, provides a list of talent and skills that Fiji has to 
<br/>offer and are engaged by the production companies.  This is actually quite a specialised skill, the film 
<br/></span><span>industry, Sir, so it is not like you can hire anybody in the film industry to do these things.  We are going 
<br/></span><span>through the necessary training with all the productions that actually come to Fiji, so local vendors are 
<br/>engaged to supply products and services to these particular productions and these actually include hotel 
<br/>accommodation, land, air, sea transportation, catering, hardware and building materials, equipment hire, 
<br/>financial insurance and professional services and there are also investments, Mr. Speaker, by locals into 
<br/>new areas of business that can provide technical support to industry.  For example, certain prop designs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, the benefits are not limited to just employment and business but includes 
<br/>payment of location fees to landowners where the production is located.  Most productions have been 
<br/>undertaken in maritime zones and smaller townships and I will just stop there, pause for a moment, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, you just heard what I said about payment of location fees to landowners.  All of this is done in 
<br/>conjunction with iTLTB, so you cannot say that we are leaving somebody out.  Anything and everything 
<br/>that happens, they are very sensitive about where they film, what they do within the particular location, 
<br/>so please do not mislead the public by saying that we are being desensitised, we are actually, as you said 
<br/>“culturally derogatory” in the way we actually operate or the filmmakers operate because they do it in 
<br/>conjunction …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI. - A Point of Order, Sir.  He is misleading, he is misleading Parliament.  I 
<br/></span><span>did not say that it is “culturally derogative”.  What I said is not to be.  I did not say that it is culturally 
<br/></span><span>derogative.  I said to make sure that they are not culturally derogatory. You are misleading the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is like saying a glass is half full or half empty, you said 
<br/>half empty I said half full, it is still a half glass of water.  You stop being culturally derogatory that is what 
<br/>you said, do not twist it around honourable Member, you are saying it wrong, you said the wrong thing 
<br/>and you know it is wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it was a case of any film making company been culturally insensitive or derogatory to any of 
<br/>our communities, they would be taken into task and we would have a massive amount of complaints 
<br/>already.  He has pulled something out of thin air which I find quite offensive, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry and Film Fiji continue to engage with a lot of other agencies, all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the other government agencies that are involved; whether it is the Department of Environment, whether 
<br/>it is iTLTB or   iTaukei Affairs, but they do before they do things.  Please, do your research before you 
<br/>come here both locally and also internationally?  We want to promote Fiji as an audio visual destination, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we have had hundreds of millions of dollars been spent on this particular area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We want to increase the benefits also to all Fijians and make the audio visual industry a strong 
<br/>and lucrative industry for investment. Furthermore, Film Fiji is providing trainings for locals in critical 
<br/>areas of productions and also hosting of the Annual Kula Awards is helping develop a new talent in the 
<br/>audio visual sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in respect of the second recommendation by the Standing Committee, I wish to 
<br/>highlight the strong focus of the Film Commission with the continuous regaining of the pre-COVID-19 
<br/>markets.  The European market used to be Fiji’s second most important market after the USA, when the 
<br/>USA used to represent about 60 percent of the film production market in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Europe at 20 percent, Australia and New Zealand at 30 percent.  So, aside from building a strong 
<br/>presence and attendance at the three of the key trade shows that takes place in Europe,  being  European 
<br/>film market, the Film Market including  Film Fiji  also work closely with our tourism industry, in finding 
<br/>innovative approaches in regaining our European market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU N.T. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to also make a brief contribution 
<br/></span><span>on the debating of the motion that is before the Parliament and I hope that if it could be taken in the vein 
<br/></span><span>in which I am about to present what I have to say, Sir.  I fully endorse the views raised by honourable 
<br/>Kuridrani, especially in his concern regarding the involvement of iTLTB and the Roko Tuis’ office, in as 
<br/>far as engaging of local landowners, et cetera in the usage of their land and resources as well, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We fully understand the greater benefit that accrued from this filming industry and the amount of 
<br/>money that goes to the landowners and here based on experience, Sir, one of the biggest estate in Fiji 
<br/>known as “Vunilagi” belongs to my clan.  It has been used quite a lot for shooting of videos and movies 
<br/>by the video boards and all I want to highlight regarding what was being said by honourable Kuridrani, 
<br/>yes, there are sometimes instead of the payment going to my clan, who are the registered landowners at 
<br/>Vunilagi, together with others that are there from Nakobo, et cetera, the payment goes to my village in 
<br/>Somosomo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are two different issues altogether, Sir, one is the village and the other is the registered 
<br/>landowner. I have had a good chance to sit with the chairman of the board and one of their key personnel 
<br/>who used to be a hackerman  at the TV One at one time and I shared these views with them in the hope 
<br/>is how best we could better this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On top of that, Sir, I only wish to bring to the attention of the honourable Minister as well is that, 
<br/></span><span>for the last so many years, even though COVID has come in the figure that they usually paid out to the 
<br/>resource owners has been the same all the time.  I do not know whether they take it off from the gross 
<br/>receipts or gross turnover that the movie make or the film make or that is just the flat rate of cost that has 
<br/>been slapped on and paid to resource owners.  I  am  talking  about  beautiful  movie  spots  in  Taveuni, 
<br/>Vurevure and especially in Vunilagi. These are the two areas that they have been regularly using to shoot 
<br/>whatever they want to shoot, as far as movie is concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The point that I am trying to drive is perhaps, if the honourable Minister cares to just go over this 
<br/>with the officials because we have highlighted to them that even though the payment has come, it has 
<br/>gone to the wider circle of people in the village rather than the clan who are the registered owners. On 
<br/>top of that, some of the estate owners in Vurevure in Bouma they lived in Sydney. This is from the 
<br/>Hennings family and they have been asking me whether this amount is enough for the shooting of the 
<br/>movie.  I  said,     as far  as  I  know, we are lucky  that they  are shooting  something there  and they  pay 
<br/>something. But as far as whether the amount is enough, I am sorry I cannot help you with that, you need 
<br/>to talk with the relevant Minister or the relevant people that runs the board of Film Fiji.

<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those are few comments that I wish to bring to the attention of this august Parliament, in as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>far as the point that was raised by the honourable Kuridrani.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like  to thank the Chairperson and also the 
<br/>Committee of the Social Affairs on this Review of the Film Fiji  from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2016 to 31st July, 2017 
<br/>and Film Fiji 1</span><span>st</span><span> January to 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  would  like  to  comment  on  the  Report  itself  and  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  for 
<br/>scrutinising the Report. There were permanent findings emanating from the scrutiny of Film Fiji. The 
<br/>thing that I would like to thank is that, it was Film Fiji bringing the film to the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Ono in Kadavu 
<br/>since 2016 to 2018 and it really did a hike in the economy in the Northern part of Kadavu.  I think there 
<br/>was the English “</span><span>Survivor</span><span>” Japanese “</span><span>Survivor” </span><span>and French “</span><span>Survivor”</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  also  relate  the  traditional  culture  the  amount  of  interference  into  our  village 
<br/>activities when the “</span><span>Survivor”</span><span>’ comes in. We are all targeted into making money but our traditional, 
<br/>cultural, church and religious callings were kind of neglected at that time. It really suffered for three years. 
<br/>Luckily the COVID came and all the “</span><span>Survivor”</span><span> films withdrew from Kadavu and it is unfortunate.  Now 
<br/>it is in Mana Island and I hope that if there can be a commission to inquire the effects that it does to these 
<br/></span><span>communities especially the villages.  We have our own way of doing business in the village but then we 
<br/></span><span>are hoping that Film Fiji will reconsider Ono, I think it is from honourable Lenora Qereqeretabua’s island 
<br/>of  Buliya; a  small place  they  call  Tokana that  was given the opportunity  to film most of the  French 
<br/></span><span>Survivor</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- The village was Buliya and it involved all the seven villages in the district 
<br/>of Ono in Kadavu, that is where I come from, we both come from there.  People were not attending their 
<br/>village activities, they were 24/7 in the film industry, they were drinking on Sundays, and it really affected 
<br/>the jobs of the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro </span><span>and the </span><span>Mata ni Tikina</span><span>.  That was something that the villages and </span><span>tikina</span><span>
<br/>were not prepared for with the influx of people and also of money.  People were getting about $500 a 
<br/>week on average salary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As long as it was good on the recovery of the economy, but it affected the cultural and tradition 
<br/>of a person.  The honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs is supposed to look at that and control the 
<br/>iTaukei people.  Yes, he is supposed to see it, get a commission to look into that.  We did not say no to 
<br/>money, but the side effect, that we have to think of.  It is coming back and I hope that it is coming back 
<br/></span><span>soon to Kadavu.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- We want you to also help our tradition to be protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Committee for Social Affairs, my colleagues and honourable Salote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Radrodro for participating and getting the Chairman to present a very well scrutinised Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion by honourable 
<br/>Viam Pillay.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, first I wish to convey my appreciation and commend the work of the 
<br/>Chairman and members of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs in their deliberations of the Annual 
<br/>Report.  Gratitude, of course, extends to the management, the Board and staff of Film Fiji for helping to 
<br/>see our film industry through the challenge of the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Film Fiji is the driving force in managing the incentives we have introduced to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – Film Fiji 2016-2017 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2219 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attract productions and the issuance of the approvals and permits required to film in Fiji.  Fiji is a historic 
<br/>film production destination that is on the cusp of becoming a global force in television and movie making.  
<br/>The pandemic put a hold on production globally, but just like with tourism, we will be fools not to give 
<br/>the audio visual industry our full support as a source of jobs for our people and exposure for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thanks to this marketing strategy, Film Fiji has helped us fully resume our film 
<br/>industry which is now welcoming massive pent-up demand from overseas producers.  I am told the team 
<br/>just wrapped up another season of </span><span>Survivor</span><span> on Mana Island and well done to the crew.  Fiji is the world’s 
<br/>most beautiful backdrop, better than anything you can create on a green screen, but production need more 
<br/>than good scenery, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need capacity and Fiji has that as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  improved  network  of  telecommunications  and  infrastructure  that  my  Government  has 
<br/>invested  in,  coupled  with  enormous  wealth  of  skills,  talents,  facilities  and  services  within  Fiji’s  film 
<br/>industry makes us a world class production destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, access to the production industry creates great jobs especially for young people.  
<br/>We have to leverage that access and exposure to attract a new generation of Fijian film makers.  That is 
<br/>why I was proud to see that despite the pandemic, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this industry still involved our school 
<br/></span><span>children through the mobile movie competition.  I was also proud to see a son of the Pacific, Taika Waititi 
<br/></span><span>win an Academy Award which I understand is the premier recognition in film for a screenplay he adapted. 
<br/>That is a wonderful inspiration for young Pacific people. I hope to see a Fijian with an Academy Award 
<br/>in my life time, involving our children in creative arts can make that possible.  That is why Government 
<br/>is providing a platform for our children to learn and gain experience in this industry.  This Government 
<br/>is the only one that has done anything like this … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- … and I reaffirm our commitment to strengthen for the sake of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our children and for Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now draw my attention to the two Reports to be deliberated before Parliament.  
<br/>I  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  acknowledges  the  Committee’s 
<br/>observation  on  the  general  satisfaction  of  the  operation  of  Film  Fiji  and  the  issue  on  hand  has  been 
<br/>addressed by Film Fiji. Based on those remarks, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Sir, just very briefly, a couple of comments.  The reason why 
<br/></span><span>Government  had  offered  the  incentives  was,  of  course,  we  are  talking  about  diversification  in  the 
<br/></span><span>economy. There is a lot of what we call a multiplier effect of movie production or any type of production 
<br/>to do with film in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When people come to Fiji, they are not only bring equipment but they also bring in people.  People 
<br/>need  to  eat,  they  buy  our  food,  they  go  to  the  market,  they  need  to  rent  premises,  they  need  to  hire 
<br/>equipment and indeed they need to hire personnel.  So the multiplier effect is enormous, honourable 
<br/>Rasova  lamented  the  fact  that  people  are  getting  $500  a  week  which  actually  is  quite  contradictory 
<br/>because $500 a week out in the island is actually a lot of money, that is, you are looking at $2,000 a 
<br/>month.  There is a movie production for </span><span>Real Life</span><span> TV Series for six months, we can do the mathematics 
<br/>on that ($2,000 x 6 = $12,000) for six months; that is not bad money actually. I think a lot of people forget 
<br/>that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think some of the comments from the other side, I did not catch all of it appears 
<br/>to be only looking at how much span there is in terms of being given only to the landowners for the use 
<br/>of the land.  It is not only about that but it is also the multiplier effect. We have seen many of the locations 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report–Ministry of Local Government 2015-2018 Annual Reports   31</span><span>st</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where they have chosen, the local villagers actually supply food, they supply handicraft, they hire people 
<br/>to do the backdrop paintings, they do joinery and carpentry for the sets and they also hire punts or the 
<br/>local boats; a lot of that.  They actually not necessarily hold back on paying.  We have seen our people 
<br/>actually demand quite large amounts of money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point I also want to make, Sir, is that it is not only about </span><span>Real Life</span><span> TV Series and also 
<br/>full length movies, it is also advertisements. We have seen, for example, there was one production from 
<br/>North America, they spent an entire two weeks to shoot I think a one minute or one and half minute TV 
<br/>advertisement  on  Natadola.  That  is  the  amount  of  time  and  resources  it  takes  to  shoot  a  very  good 
<br/>production. Sir, it is actually a quick win, they have of course used Fiji Airways to come to Fiji, now they 
<br/>are flying to Vancouver and various other destinations, it just fulfils the requirement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last point I would like to make, Sir, as was mentioned by honourable Koya and also the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister is that the opportunities for young Fijians, the talent pool that we have.  We 
<br/>have seen, for example, Sir, mushrooming a lot of local talent, we have seen dance groups, Government 
<br/>currently, for example, provides the 200 percent or 300 percent tax rebates so hotels that go and hire </span><span>meke</span><span>
<br/>groups, hire bands, hire dance groups, restaurants and various other places and they should pay their 
<br/>money for that, they actually claim rebates from us at a much higher rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So we have seen that local talent feed into that, we also have a requirement as part of getting the 
<br/>rebate that  you have to  work  with the  Fiji National University, the  Film  School.  Some of them  are 
<br/>working now with lighting, behind the scene we have seen a lot of work with the sound, that is all building 
<br/>talent  and  it  provides  a  lot  opportunities  for  young  Fijians  to  be  able  to  step  into  the  arts.    As  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister said, God willing one of these days we will see a Fijian winning an Academy 
<br/>Award and we have a lot of faith in our young people and they have an enormous level of hidden talents 
<br/>which we want to tap into.  So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairman and his Committee 
<br/>for this recommendation on these two Annual Reports for Film Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, honourable Faiyaz Koya and also other honourable Members who have 
<br/>spoken positively on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote to note  the  content of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report.
