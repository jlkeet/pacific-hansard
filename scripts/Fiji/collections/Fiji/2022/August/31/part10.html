<div><span>I welcome all Honourable Members to todayâ€™s sitting.  I also welcome all those joining us in the 
<br/>public gallery and those watching the live broadcast of the proceedings.  Thank you for your continued 
<br/>interest in the workings of your Parliament.

<div><span>This morning, we have members of the Australian High Commission who are here in the public 
<br/>gallery, visiting us.  I trust that you will have an educational and an enjoyable time, although it is never 
<br/>enjoyable in here sometimes.
