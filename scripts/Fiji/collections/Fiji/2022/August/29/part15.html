<div><span>ELECTORAL (AMENDMENT) BILL 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 (Bill No. 49/2022) be considered by Parliament without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must not be referred to a standing committee or other committee of Parliament; and 
<br/>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 1</span><span>st</span><span> September, 2022 with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 2018 General Elections was held on 14</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>November, 2018.  The final results of the Elections were announced on 18</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2018.  Thereafter, 
<br/></span><span>the Electoral Commission and the Supervisor of Elections produced a Joint Report for Parliament (that is 
<br/>the Joint Report).  The Multinational Observer Group (MOG) also presented its Report that was annexed 
<br/>to the Joint Report.   The Joint Report and the MOG Report suggested various  recommendations for 
<br/>Parliament, the Electoral Commission, the Fijian Elections Office (FEO) as well as the nation as a whole 
<br/>to consider going into the next Elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although  the  MOG  recommendations  were  considered  and  reflected  in  the  Electoral 
<br/>(Amendment) Act 2021 which was enacted on 7</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2021 the FEO has also identified other aspects 
<br/>of the elections laws to be refined to support the delivery of Elections in line with international best 
<br/>practice.  These amendments, Sir, are being proposed based on the experiences of the FEO in the build-
<br/>up to the preparation for the General Elections so far.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The introduction of the amendments earlier in the cycle in relation to the campaign period and 
<br/>the implication of campaign laws has brought about requirements for the FEO to have the powers to 
<br/>obtain  information  necessary  to  determine  issues  in  relation  to  campaign  complaints  prior  to  FEO 
<br/>determining whether or not a law has been breached, and exercising its powers pursuant to section 18 of 
<br/>the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also an internationally-recognised best practice to review and reform laws, following the 
<br/>conduct of Elections.  In terms of the electoral calendar, this is the ideal time to carry out electoral reforms 
<br/>before a general elections is in fact announced therefore, Sir, the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022 seeks 
<br/>to amend the Electoral Act 2014, to reflect these proposed amendments, to reflect better practical ways 
<br/>of implementing existing provisions of the Act.  These amendments are also supported by the Electoral 
<br/>Commission for the conduct of free and fair Elections in accordance with the laws in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  General  Elections,  as  we  all  know,  will  take  place  once  Parliament  is 
<br/>dissolved, and we do not know when Parliament will be dissolved therefore, it is necessary that such 
<br/>amendments are made expeditiously to avoid any potential procedural conflicts under the Act, viz-a-viz, 
<br/>the practical considerations on the ground, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  to  very  quickly  take  honourable  Members  through  this  particular  Bill, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 2 of the Bill amends section 2 of the Act by redefining the term “person”, to mean, and I quote:
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2057 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“a natural or legal person and includes a company, association  or  body  of persons, 
<br/>whether  corporate  or  unincorporated,  government  department,  non-governmental 
<br/>organisation, statutory authority or any other entity.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are various provisions of the Act that refer to person, however, it is also necessary to clarify 
<br/>that person, that it does not only mean a natural person but also means a legal person so as to extend the 
<br/>application of the provisions to incorporated and unincorporated, as well as other entities.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, this definition will also be useful in determining any contravention of the Act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 3 of the Bill amends section 6 of the Act to provide for the powers of 
<br/>the Supervisor of Elections necessary to carry out his or her functions under the Act, including the power 
<br/>to direct a person by notice in writing to furnish any relevant information or document.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without this specific power, the Supervisor of Elections is unable to make inquiries to obtain 
<br/>information necessary for the Supervisor of Elections to arrive at decisions, as required by the Act.  Such 
<br/>powers  are  also  extremely  important  to  allow  the  Supervisor  of  Elections  to  conduct  inquiries  into 
<br/>allegations of breaches of campaign provisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various  sections  of  the  Act  such  as  sections  116(4)(c),  118,  141,  144  and  144A  require  the 
<br/></span><span>Supervisor  of  Elections  to  make  certain  inquiries  in  order  to  be  satisfied  as  to  whether  or  not  a 
<br/>contravention under the Act has, in fact, occurred.  Therefore, for this exercise, Sir, it is necessary that 
<br/>the Supervisor of Elections has powers to obtain relevant information or, indeed, documentation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Clause 4 of the Bill amends section 36 of the Act, to allow the numbers used in the 
<br/>election of members of Parliament to be used in any future election of members of parliament.  So all of 
<br/>you who got elected had a number.  What this Act does, Sir, essentially it allows for those numbers to be 
<br/>used again because as at 28</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2022, there are nine registered political parties in Fiji.  The FEO is 
<br/>currently processing the application of another political party.  If the registration is approved, Sir, the total 
<br/>number of political parties contesting the 2022 General Elections will be 10. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Act, currently, each political party may nominate up to 55 candidates (being the 
<br/>total number of seats) as we have seen and therefore, the maximum number of candidates that can be 
<br/>nominated through political parties will be 550 candidates for the upcoming Elections.  The Electoral 
<br/>Commission has already approved, through a publicly conducted draw that the first number on the ballot 
<br/>paper will be 173.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In applying the provisions of the Act, the FEO assigns the numbers in series from 173 until all 
<br/></span><span>the candidates have been assigned numbers.  There is a likelihood, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the series will 
<br/>once again repeat the numbers from the 2018 General Elections.  If such repetition occurs and section 
<br/>36(7)  of  the  Act  is  not  removed  which  currently  we  are  trying  to  remove,  the  validity  of  the  entire 
<br/>Elections  is  at  stake.    One  must  consider  that  four  years  have  passed  since  the  last  Elections  and 
<br/>individuals will have likely forgotten the numbers from the last Elections so whatever number honourable 
<br/>Rasova had …
