<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI NATIONAL SPORTS COMMISSION  
<br/>AUGUST 2019-JULY 2020 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the review of Fiji National Sports Commission August 2019-July 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2020 Annual Report which was tabled on 4th April, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. G. VEGNATHAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  principal  activity  of  the  Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/>Commission  (FNSC)  is  to  guide  and  enhance  the  delivery  of  sports  programmes  in  Fiji  through  a 
<br/>coordinated approach at all levels of participation by Government statutory bodies and the community to 
<br/>ensure the development of sports in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sports  Commission  aims  to  enrich  the  lives  and  health  of  all  Fijians  through  physical 
<br/>activities and sports at all levels.  It was established under the Fiji National Sports Commission Act of 
<br/>2013, no significant issues were observed in the Sports Commission operations during the 2019-2020 
<br/></span><span>period as such, the Committee scrutiny focused primarily on the Sports Commission’s response to the 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time and how it re-strategize operations to adapt to these changes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 restrictions led the Sports Commission to develop its safe sports Fiji 
<br/>guidelines, the national sporting organisations were advised of the necessity to have their respective sport 
<br/>certified under this guideline.  The development of the guideline indicated that Fiji Sports people were 
<br/>working with their own sports framework and adhering to the necessary COVID-19 restrictions. There 
<br/>was also a committee established to formulate the guidelines with professional representative from the 
<br/>medical and the physiotherapy, legal, athletics and sporting sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The guidelines enforced 50 percent attendance at stadiums, the practice of social distancing, contact 
<br/>tracing,  hygiene  practices  such  as  handwashing  and  use  of  hand  sanitizers.    We  noted  that  the  first 
<br/>response to the certification requirement was substantial with 11 sporting associations out of 45 been 
<br/>certified with the first three weeks with rugby, football, rugby-league amongst the first to start playing 
<br/>again.  This was one of the Sports Commission’s most important achievement towards the second-half 
<br/>of the physical year working with the required restrictions but still finding a way to safely facilitate sports 
<br/>around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Sports Commission responded well to the changes imposed by the 
<br/></span><span>pandemic by reviewing its 2019-2023 Strategic Plan with the Commission’s four pillars, health and active 
<br/>nation, sporting nation, enabling environment and reaching nation, remaining unchanged.  The Sports 
<br/>Commission Strategic Plan is aligned with the National Developing Plan and Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I begin this contribution to the Fiji National Sports  
<br/>Commission Annual Report for 2019-2020 with an acknowledgement of their work and contribution to 
<br/>sports development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the leadership and management of the Fiji National Sports Commission 
<br/>was granted an unqualified audit report for 2019-2020 financial year.  This was achieved during a very 
<br/>critical period where COVID disrupted not only sporting but economic activities in Fiji.  I commend the

<div><span>Review Report – FNSC August 2019 - July 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  National  Sports  Commission  for  their  ability  to  still  able  to  deliver  commendable  results  on  the 
<br/>backdrop of a very challenging period, not only in Fiji but were also felt globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, the process of reopening sports participation after a sustained 
<br/>period of lockdown due to the challenges brought about by COVID-19 was deliberate and through the 
<br/>efforts of all key stakeholders, especially our front-liners in the fight against the pandemic.  The results 
<br/>of  those  efforts  allowed  Fiji  to  commence  hosting  international  sports  events  with  the  Super  Rugby 
<br/>Games and the participation of our teams in the Super Rugby competition being a prominent examples.   
<br/>This was only possible through and all of the government approach to the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strong leadership of the FijiFirst Government enables to make quick decision 
<br/>and laid the foundation for the quick bounced back and now growth in all sectors.  Sir, sports being 
<br/>an enabler plays a big part in economic development and growth in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  through  the  programmes  of  the  Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/>Commission acknowledged the challenges of our remote and rural athlete and we will continue to 
<br/>assist growth and development in these areas and through our talent identification, we will provide 
<br/>special programmes for talented athletes who need to move to urban sports training environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our up-skilling of training for sport leaders in both urban and rural communities means that 
<br/>sports  people  can  continue  to  train  wherever  they  are  and  everyone’s  talent  in  sports  is  accepted 
<br/>wherever they live.  This includes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, continued use of platforms a lot more in  our 
<br/>training and follow-ups in all communities and this has become one of the positive that came out of 
<br/>COVID.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  keeping  track  of  both  talent  and  athletes  continues  to  also  be  a  major 
<br/>challenge and the Fiji National Sports Commission is currently working on to keep track of our talent 
<br/>and is working with international organisation to establish a database and to set up an athlete tracking 
<br/>system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government in its five year and 20 year Development Plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises and 
<br/>acknowledges  the  needs  to  empower  youths  to  be  agents  of  change  and  promoting  sports 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Sports  Commission  continues  to  play  an  important  part  in  this  development 
<br/>programme and this has reach sporting rewards including goal medals at the Olympic Games for our 
<br/></span><span>Sevens Rugby athlete and the bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic of our Fijiana Women Sevens 
<br/></span><span>Team.  This is in addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the elevation after Fijian Drua to the Super Rugby 
<br/>competition  in  2020.  The  Fijiana  Women  headline  the  growth  of  women  sports  in  the  same 
<br/>competition by becoming champion of the competition in the inaugural year of participation.  More 
<br/>recently,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  Fijian  Men  and  Women  Seven  Teams  achieved  historic  double  silver 
<br/>medals at the 2022 Commonwealth Games. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the key stakeholder, we look forward to continue on a good governance 
<br/>and accountability in the organisation.  The Fiji Government will continue to provide support for the 
<br/>Fiji Sports Commission to continue to be the key stakeholder in growing sports in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
