<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - 2016–2017 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GOVERNMENT AND 
<br/>2016–2017 AGENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE MINISTRY OF ECONOMY 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  2016-2017  Financial  Statements  of 
<br/>Government and 2016–2017 Agency Financial Statements of the Ministry of Economy which 
<br/>was tabled on 5</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Public Accounts, moved a motion and take this opportunity to speak on the motion on the Review 
<br/>of  the  2016-2017  Financial  Statements  of  Government  and  the  2016–2017  Agency  Financial 
<br/>Statements of the Ministry of Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Review focused on 2016–2017 Audit Report on the Financial Statements 
<br/></span><span>of Government and the 2016–2017 Agency Financial Statements of the Ministry of Economy.  It is 
<br/>important to highlight that the severe devastation caused by </span><span>TC Winston </span><span>in February 2016, resulted 
<br/>in total damages and loss of estimated $2.85 billion to the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a result, Government designed the financial year of 2016–2017 Budget to meet the cost 
<br/>relating to the rehabilitation of public infrastructure including schools, health facilities and housing.  
<br/>It  was  anticipated  that  the  systematic  programming  of  rehabilitation  expenditure  through  the 
<br/>budgetary  process  will  smoothen  out  the  later  years.    The  refocusing  of  expenditure  was  also 
<br/>anticipated to have a positive impact on medium to long term macro-economic fundamentals of the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase in expenditure will stimulate economic activity across the number of sectors and 
<br/>in  turn  support  the  employment  creation,  raise  consumption  level  and  provide  further  impetus  to 
<br/>grow.    This  Report  summarise  the  committee’s  analysis  on  the  financial  position,  performance, 
<br/>sustainability and timeliness of quality and financial reporting for ministries and departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also includes the results on the internal control reviews in respective agencies.  
<br/></span><span>Additional, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that the deficiency’s detail in the audit report were 
<br/></span><span>identified during the time of the audit and it may have been subsequently resolved by the entity.  This 
<br/>had  been  included  in  the  audit  report  as  they  impacted  on  the  overall  system  of  control  of  the 
<br/>ministries and department, as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  had  issued  an  audit  opinion  on  the  agency’s  financial 
<br/>statement of 33 Ministries and Departments.  Out of 33, 64 percent representing 21 agencies were 
<br/>issued with unmodified opinion while remaining 36 percent, that would be 12 agencies, were issued 
<br/>modified opinion respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will briefly highlight some of the ministries that were issued with modified 
<br/>audit  opinion  and  their  responses  on  the  qualification  issues  that  were  raised.  These  Ministries 
<br/>comprise the:

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – 2016-2017 Financial Statement of Government  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2091</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Defence, National Security and Immigration  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  modified  opinion  was  issued  to  the  Ministry  of  Defence,  National  Security  and 
<br/>Immigration due to issues highlighted in the Auditor-General’s Report, including a variance 
<br/>of  $3  million  that  existed  between  the  Integrated  Border  Control  Management  System 
<br/>(IBMS) which records the Department of Immigration’s operating revenue and the FMIS 
<br/>general ledger.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of our finding, the Department of Immigration has managed to identify a solution 
<br/>in working closely with the service provider.  Information to factor both manual and system 
<br/>received with the provision to be created, the IBMS to cater for all payments, including 
<br/>Immigration-related revenues received from Foreign Missions effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 
<br/>2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations was 
<br/>issued a modified opinion. The Committee noted that the Ministry received $70,000 annual 
<br/>fees  from  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  under  the  shared  service  agreement  which  was 
<br/>deposited into the OHS Consultancy Trust Fund Account.  Consequently, an unreconciled 
<br/></span><span>variance of $381,087 was also identified that existed between the OHS Consultancy Service 
<br/></span><span>Workmen  Compensation  and  Wage  Dispute  Trust  Fund,  Cash  at  Bank,  Balance  and 
<br/>General Ledger.  The Committee was informed that necessary implementations have been 
<br/>put in place in ensuring that the issues do not repeat in future. With that being said, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has prepared an internal policy on the recording and utilisation 
<br/>of the shared service fee which has now been deposited in the consolidated fund account.  
<br/>The identified variance have been identified and sorted by the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Judiciary 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Judiciary  Department’s  reconciliation  for  Suitors,  Sundries  and 
<br/>Maintenance  Trust  Fund  were  only  prepared  up  to  January,  2015,  January  2000  and 
<br/>December 1994 respectively as at 31st July, 2017.  Due to the significant lapse in the years 
<br/>of reconciliation balance, audit was unable to ascertain the accuracy of closing balance for 
<br/>the year ended 31st July, 2017. Again, this backlog, the Department advised that once all 
<br/>reconciliations  are  updated  then  consideration  would  be  given  to  open  separate  bank 
<br/>accounts.  The  Committee  recommended  that  the  Department  should  maintain  separate 
<br/>bank  accounts  for  all  new  trust  accounts  created  and  submitted  separate  statements 
<br/>accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Justice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir a modified opinion was issued to the Ministry of Justice noting that the 
<br/>Ministry  did  not  maintain  a  detailed  breakdown  listing  of  companies  under  provisional 
<br/>liquidation and the individuals under the receivership.  The Ministry in its response had 
<br/>confirmed that it has an updated statement of individual debtors and their respective files 
<br/>while the Ministry is currently preparing a consolidated list for all debtors by checking 
<br/>individual  files.    Further  to  this,  the  Ministry  will  transit  to  developing  a  software  for 
<br/>recording and maintaining the Trust Fund Account.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Ministry of Rural and Maritime Development and Natural Disaster Management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is worth noting that the Ministry had put in place a paperless system to address this gap.  
<br/>The Ministry had given assurance that strict timeliness will be set for District Officers to 
<br/>submit the carbon copies of the receipt and related source documents to the Headquarters 
<br/>on a timely basis and appropriate action be taken for any non-compliance.

<div><span>Review Report – 2016-2017 Financial Statement of Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Republic of Fiji Military Forces   
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, auditors have reported that Engineers Trust Fund Account Statement of 
<br/>Receipts and Payments does not provide receipts and payments for each project undertaken 
<br/>by the Force. The statement only includes closing cash balance for each project.  As a result, 
<br/>audit was unable to determine whether any adjustment might have been necessary in respect 
<br/>of  the  Engineer’s  Trust  Fund  Account,  cash  at  bank  balance  at  year  end  and  any 
<br/>corresponding  adjustment  to  the  elements  making  up  the  statement  of  income  and 
<br/>expenditure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the RFMF had indicated that the Engineer’s Project Fund Account was operating 
<br/>as a private fund. This was an audit issue for the past three years.  RFMF regularised this 
<br/>in July of 2016-2017 Financial Year with the approval of the Ministry of Economy.  The 
<br/>account is operating under FMIS as a True Trust.  The final balances of each project were 
<br/>reconciled and recorded into FMIS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 7.   Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical  Services  had  an  unreconciled 
<br/>variance  of  $114,950  that  existed  between  the  bank  reconciliation  and  cash  at  bank 
<br/></span><span>General Ledger balances.  As a result, the audit was unable to substantiate the accuracy 
<br/></span><span>and  completeness  of  the  closing  balance  of  $338,925  reflected  in  the  Trust  Fund 
<br/>Account statement of receipts and payment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed that the Ministry had established and implemented the 
<br/>SOP for procurement and this includes control in obtaining any valuation of quotation 
<br/>receiving goods; check list for procurement and payments; and payments of goods and 
<br/>services.   Part of the reform was the review of the Ministry’s Financial Manual in 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>8.     Ministry of Agriculture  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  included  in  the  Land  Water  Resource  Management  Trust  Fund 
<br/>account, balance is retention fund of $329,148.  The Committee was informed that the 
<br/>Land Water Resource Management Trust Fund had been reconciled and closed with the 
<br/>balance of fund transferred to the Ministry of Waterways.  The Board of Survey team 
<br/>was appointed to look into the issue of expired drugs and this has been written off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.   Ministry of Land and Mineral Resources  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the highlighted audit issues, the Committee was informed that 
<br/></span><span>the  Ministry  has  strengthened  its  internal  process  through  daily  verification  and 
<br/></span><span>reconciliation of revenue received together with cash analysis against the CNS revenue 
<br/>records.  Concerning RFA, the Ministry had strictly adhered to appropriate procedures 
<br/>in issuance and clearance of accountable advance.  The Committee noted with concern 
<br/>that this was an ongoing issue from previous report and would encourage the Ministry 
<br/>to explore more avenues practicable to allow for timely collection of arrears. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10.   Ministry of Fisheries and Forests  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a modified opinion was also issued to the Ministry of Fisheries and 
<br/>Forests.    It  was  noted  that  the  Ministry  had  rectified  the  records  in  the  statement  of 
<br/>receipt and expenditure for the year ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2017 as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>SLG 84 account be reconciled and recorded accordingly; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry had requested the Ministry of Economy to write off the unreconciled 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accountable advances carried forward from the previous year;

<div><span>(c)</span><span> </span><span>The  Ministry  had  reviewed  their  accountable  advance  implementation  process  as 
<br/>they had implemented advance checklist for all advance less than $20,000.  This must 
<br/>be approved by the Conservator of Forest and Director Corporate Services; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Advance  over  $20,000  less  than  $50,000  must  be  approved  by  the  Permanent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secretary for Forestry; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>True  Trust  Fund  Account  for  one  third  subsidy  scheme  had  been  referred  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Fisheries; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(f)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry had improved their revenue collection strategies on scaling fees for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>native timber and miscellaneous revenues; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(g)</span><span> </span><span>The timber revenue system data have been implemented at headquarters accounts 
<br/>section whereby data send from the Division is reconciled with FMIS General Ledger 
<br/>account; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(h)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry has improved on the internal control environment and risk management 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategies to curb any anomalies; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11.   Ministry of Local Government and Environment  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was informed that the Ministry had undertaken stringent measures to 
<br/>improve in  maintaining the reporting of financial record.  As such, the Ministry has 
<br/></span><span>taken the following measures: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Maintain the general voucher to support adjustment recorded in the General Ledger; 
<br/>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Recruitment of more personnel to effectively and efficiently provide the financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support service to avoid anomalies in the future; 
<br/>Implementation  of  in-house  capacity  building  training,  coaching  and  monitoring 
<br/>programmes  to  educate  staff  on  procedure  and  process  pertaining  to  accounting 
<br/>records; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Reconciliation  exercise  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  in  2018:  This 
<br/>included the Drawing Account, Trust Fund Account, Operating Trust Account and 
<br/>RFA account.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span> </span><span>The  unsubstantiated  variances  arising  from  previous  years’  mis-posting  had  been 
<br/>submitted to the Ministry of Economy for book entry adjustment on 14</span><span>th</span><span> October, 
<br/>2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee acknowledges the progress made by relevant Ministries and 
<br/>Departments in addressing the issues identified during the audit with the written responses provided 
<br/>to clarify their position in relation to the audit queries.  Overall, the Committee commends the efforts 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Ministry  of  economy  in  taking  the  lead  role  in  the  stewardship  of  public  funds.    Most 
<br/></span><span>importantly, the Permanent Secretary should take serious consideration on all audit issues that were 
<br/>raised and take appropriate action and taking their cues from the Ministry of Economy so that the 
<br/>issues raised are addressed in a timely manner so that it is not reflected in the whole of government 
<br/>audited financial statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, as the Member moving the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. I. WAQAINABETE.- Sir, I thank the honourable Member and also the Members 
<br/>of the Committee for the Report.  Mr. Speaker, in the review of the Audit Report and follow up of 
<br/>higher risk ministries and departments provided by the Audit Report on Social Services Sector 2017, 
<br/>there were 16 things that were highlighted within our Ministry, the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/>Services.  I am pleased to say that eight of them have been fully implemented and eight have been 
<br/>partially implemented and we are hoping that we will be able to complete it in this financial year.  
<br/>We  have  fully  implemented  the  recommendations  on  finalisation  of  financial  statements,  internal 
<br/>control assessments, arrears of revenue, conflict of interest, procurement anomalies and variance in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>2094 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – 2016-2017 Financial Statement of Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pharmaceutical  stock  and  purchases  made  without  tender  board  approval  and  anomalies  in  the 
<br/>Sahyadri Trust Fund Account.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the three above - procurement anomalies and variance in pharmaceutical stock 
<br/>and also purchases made without tender board approval – have been helped by the fact that as we 
<br/>speak, there are now 51 sites in our 220 facilities all over Fiji that are now connected to our m-supply 
<br/>logistics digital program by which they are able to identify the stock that they need, that are available 
<br/>in the warehouse and their warehouse also knows how much is available in their site and this has 
<br/>happened because also of our investment into it and support through DFAT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, also as I speak at the moment, there are now 17 pharmacies all throughout Fiji 
<br/>specifically on Viti Levu at the moment that are now involved in the Free Medicine Programme.  
<br/>There are another nine pharmacies that are at the moment going through their period of assessment 
<br/>and we hope to have them also included.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the areas that we have partially implemented, the absence of risk management 
<br/>policy, incomplete board of survey and non-clearance of balances involving fund account and the 
<br/>fixed assets register which we are updating as I speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services acknowledges this is a unique and 
<br/>challenging time for our Ministry.  As you are aware that at the time of COVID-19, over the last two 
<br/>years,  we  have  also  involved  our  corporate  sector  in  the  work  around  COVID-19.    For  example, 
<br/>things such as the vaccination registration and supporting our technical staff.  So now they are back 
<br/>to normal in terms of the work that they do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I sit, the honourable Professor Prasad, who is not here, misled Parliament 
<br/>earlier today.  Mr. Speaker, he said that there was a complaint against the Minister for Elections made 
<br/>to the Supervisor of Elections.  He said we put a complaint against him and nothing happens because 
<br/>he is the Minister of Elections.  There has been a press release on this just recently by the Supervisor 
<br/>of Elections and the Elections Commission and I want to read it because it is important that we do 
<br/>not mislead Parliament leading up to Elections.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  they  have  said  that  the  Fiji  Elections  Office  has  not  received  any  complaint 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>against the Minister for Elections since the beginning of the campaign period until now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was one complaint on the 21</span><span>st</span><span> of March, it lacked any legal basis and could 
<br/></span><span>not be actioned.  The NFP was given a period to be able to look through it and appeal, they did not 
<br/></span><span>appeal the decision.  So please, Honourable Members on the other side, do not mislead Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  rise  as  a  Member  of  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee (PAC) to contribute to the motion before Parliament today which is the review 
<br/>of the 2016-2017 Financial Statements of Government and 2016-2017 Agency Financial Statements 
<br/>of the Ministry of Economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my contribution to this Report is that such reports on auditing of the Ministry 
<br/>of Economy needs to be submitted timely, in the sense to allow us to  resolve burning issues that 
<br/>would have been prevailing at a time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the report reflects on the audit that was undertaken five years ago which 
<br/>highlighted some of the burning issues that may have been resolved or some may have worsened over 
<br/>time. We have taken note of the responses from the Ministry of Economy but we would like to also state 
<br/>for the record Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Committee conducted its work through virtual mode without 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug., 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – 2016-2017 Financial Statement of Government  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2095</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>conducting face to face consultations with the Ministry of Economy officials because of the COVID-19 
<br/>restrictions that were in place during the Committee meeting process and we requested responses to be 
<br/>in writing and those were the responses that have been read out by the Chairman.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendations that were given here are somewhat repetitive to the 
<br/>other four Office of the Auditor General’s Report on the Whole of Government covering areas mainly 
<br/>the General Administration Services, Social Services, Economic Services and Infrastructure Services 
<br/>that  have  been  previously  discussed  in  this  august  Parliament.    What  should  have  happened  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is that this should have been brought together with this Report because they support 
<br/>each  other’s  findings  and  recommendations  and  do  not  need  us  to  repeat  the  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations within this Report over and over again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  all  know  the  Ministry  of  Economy  is  the  leading  Ministry  that 
<br/>provides  assurances  and  financial  support  to  the  whole  of  government  mechanism  and  it  is 
<br/>unacceptable that such delays in the submission of the Ministry of Economy Audit in Parliament is 
<br/>entertained.  In fact Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister should take his officials to task over 
<br/>disorganised,  disjointed  and  time  wasting  exercise  as  a  result  of  delayed  actions  and  I  urge  the 
<br/>Ministry  officials  never  to  allow  themselves  to  come  under  unnecessary  scrutiny.    It  is  the 
<br/></span><span>responsibility of civil servants that are paid to provide timely reports and to do so without fear of 
<br/></span><span>reprisal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I tend to think that a lot of delays are deliberate because civil servants often 
<br/>think that opening up this report for scrutiny will lead to the questions of their decisions and actions.  
<br/>If they did their jobs well, no matter how controversial their decisions are, they must be able to defend 
<br/>the  decisions  taken  if  it  is  based  on  the  motivations  behind  such  policies  implemented,  they  are 
<br/>justified for the greater good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the issues that were raised during this period may have continued 
<br/>to be raised in future audits and the current audits that we have been discussing in this Parliament 
<br/>especially in the judiciary system where the significant lapse in the years of reconciliation, audit was 
<br/>unable to ascertain the accuracy of the closing balances of $31 million disclosed in the Judicial Trust 
<br/>Fund Account Statement of receipts and payments for the year ended 31 July 2017.  This continues 
<br/>to be an ongoing audit issue that has been highlighted and we hope that the Ministry officials will 
<br/>continue to work on resolving these balances in the Trust Accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also in the Suitors Accounts, funds received on behalf of deceased person who do not have 
<br/></span><span>nominees at FNPF as required under Section 57 of the Fiji National Provident Fund Act 2011, the 
<br/></span><span>department does not maintain detailed breakdown listings of these funds received from FNPF.  Funds 
<br/>paid out to beneficiaries and balance of funds to be refunded to FNPF. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those that are entitled to these funds from FNPF who are not aware, have 
<br/>not accessed these funds, just imagine the status that they are in right now.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, also on 
<br/>the Ministry of Lands, this also has been an ongoing issue regarding the unreconciled variance of 
<br/>$673,811 in the Land and Property rent collected as recorded in the Crown Land Lease system of 
<br/>$12,745,771, compared to what is recorded in the General Ledger of $13,419,982.  Consequently the 
<br/>audit could not confirm the accuracy and completeness of land and property rent of $13.4 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issues  that  have  been  highlighted  we  have  noted  the  explanations  given  by  the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy officials and we hope, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that this will become a reality in terms 
<br/>of resolving this unreconciled balances.  Some of the findings that were also identified during the 
<br/>audit  was  the  absence  of  Risk  Management  Policies,  delay  in  preparations  of  reconciliations,

<div><span>anomalies  in  drawing  accounts  and  main  trust  fund  account,  expenditure  charged  to  incorrect

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  significant  deficiency  was  highlighted  in  the  security  bonds  of  the 
<br/>Department  of  Immigration  amounting  to  $25  million.  Hopefully  these  variances  would  also  be 
<br/>resolved  by  now  especially  when  it  involves  work  permits  and  the  likes,  that  are  handled  at  the 
<br/>Department of Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to, right now we can only hope that improvements have 
<br/>been made given the budgetary resources that have been provided every year along with the follow-
<br/>up  monitoring  by  the  relevant  authorities  which  would  have  compelled  the  Ministries  to  take 
<br/>necessary corrective measures.  I believe the delays will not allow us as Members of Parliament to 
<br/>gauge the full impact of decisions taken as commented by the Ministry’s official.  And it is time that 
<br/>the  Permanent  Secretaries,  as  Chief  Accounting  Officers  should  perform  their  roles  and 
<br/>responsibilities  without  fear  so  that  there  is  improvement  in  terms  of  accountability  on  the 
<br/>Government financial expenditures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.V. BAINIMARAMA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make a contribution to this debate.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>thank the Committee and the Chairman for scrutinising the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I would like to speak on the ministries under my portfolio. I have looked at some of 
<br/>the issues raised on the Fijian Immigration Department, specifically the internal control measures of 
<br/>the  Department.    It  is  natural  to  continually  identify,  evaluate  and  remedy  issues  that  hamper 
<br/>efficiency and we fully embrace that responsibility.  I would like to ensure this august Parliament 
<br/>that internal control measures have been strengthened with stringent policies and strategies devised 
<br/>to address some shortfalls in procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Department has since improved its adherence to the Finance Instructions of 
<br/>2010 and the Financial Management Act 2004.  The Fijian Immigration Department worked with the 
<br/>Ministry of Economy in 2019 to create separate revenue collection accounts in FMIS for the different 
<br/>types  of  revenue  collections  namely  the  passports,  permits,  citizenship,  visa  and  search  fees.  
<br/>Importantly, Mr. Speaker, the amendment of the Immigration Act of 2003 in 2020 ensured clarity of 
<br/>the  fundamentals  of  the  Immigration  Regulations  for  its  day  to  day  administration  with  the 
<br/>Department now seeing improved service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A generic issue that was raised in the Consolidated Audit Report is the management of various 
<br/></span><span>trust  fund  accounts  held  in  government  ministries  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forests, 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Local Government and Environment.  While the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General highlighted measures to address Trust Fund Accounts through the audit of agencies 
<br/>financial statements, the Ministry of Economy has embarked on a dedicated view of all trust fund 
<br/>accounts to determine eligible trust accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy has worked closely with the various 
<br/>ministries to ensure that they perform their reconciliations on a timely basis and to make certain that 
<br/>internal control mechanisms are in place.  Also Mr. Speaker, Sir, appropriate training on financial 
<br/>management  systems,  information  systems,  trust  accounts  and  procurement  to  name  a  few,  were 
<br/>provided to agencies by the Ministry of Economy to build capacities and to reduce the prevalence of 
<br/>adverse audit findings on agencies financial statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is encouraging to note Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the ministries have established a dedicated 
<br/>compliance review team to strengthen internal control environments and to drive business process 
<br/>within.  Through the Open Merit Recruitment and Selection System (OMRS), ministries were able

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2097</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to appoint highly qualified and competent individuals to positions of heads of finance and accounts 
<br/>officers.  Timely submission of accurate and quality financial statements are prioritised to the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General to address audit queries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to reassure this august Parliament that many of the 
<br/>issues  raised  in  the  Report  have  been  addressed.    Various  ministries  have  implemented  risk 
<br/>management  policies  through  the  prudent  Financial  Management  Act  and  embedded  these 
<br/>improvements in the individual ministerial strategic policies and operational plans.  The process of 
<br/>improving service delivery is never ending, the people we are here to serve, deserve no less.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on these remarks Mr. Speaker, Sir, I, therefore, support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Economy liaises with other 
<br/>government ministries and partners to ensure compliance with the reporting timelines or submissions 
<br/>of financial statements to the Office of the Auditor-General for audit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Economy understands the importance of timely reporting and making the 
<br/>financial statements available to the users of the government financial statements.  At the end of each 
<br/></span><span>financial  year,  the  Ministry  of  Economy  issues  a  closing  of  accounts  circular  to  all  respective 
<br/></span><span>permanent  secretaries  outlining  the  mandatory  procedures  and  timelines  that  ministries  and 
<br/>departments must follow to fully regularise all accounting transactions and close the financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry of Economy constantly monitors compliance of the circular and 
<br/>provides  guidance  and  advisory  services  to  all  ministries  with  matters  relating  to  accounting  and 
<br/>finance management issues.  Significant improvements Sir, in the submission of financial statements 
<br/>to the Office of the Auditor-General have been noted from ministries and departments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the Auditor-General is currently auditing the Financial Year 2019 – 2020 and 
<br/>2020 – 2021 accounts to ensure the backlog is addressed.  The Office of the Auditor-General has 
<br/>informed us that the audits for most of the ministries and departments for financial year 2019 – 2020 
<br/>and  financial  year  2020  –  2021  have  been  completed.    Most  of  these  reports  will  be  tabled  in 
<br/>Parliament (maybe not be in this session) but later parliamentary sittings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Economy will continue to work with the ministries and departments ensuring 
<br/>that  the  agencies  financial  statements  are  submitted  to  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  in  timely 
<br/>manner.  Both the Permanent Secretary for Economy and the Head of Treasury are discussing the 
<br/></span><span>same in the Permanent Secretaries and Accounting Heads Forum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a majority of the issues raised in the Auditor General’s Report to Parliament 
<br/>have been addressed and the Ministry of Economy will continue to work closely with ministries and 
<br/>departments to ensure proper internal controls are in place to prevent such issues from recurring in 
<br/>the future.  Some issues however, are legacy issues and locating information and sourced documents 
<br/>has been a major challenge for ministries and departments, causing delays in resolving audit issues.  
<br/>As these issues are highlighted in every audit report, we also need solutions from the Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General on the best way forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  regarding  internal  audit  and  good  governance  team,  internal  audits 
<br/>conducted  by  the  Internal  Audit  and  Good  Governance  team  (IAGG)  is  essential  to  maintain 
<br/>operational efficiencies and financial reliability and provide assurance to the permanent secretaries

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that  organisation  and  risk  management,  governance  and  internal  control  processes  are  operating 
<br/>effectively.    Not  only  the  IAGG  Team  but  other  departments  within  the  Ministry  of  Economy  is 
<br/>effectively contributing and addressing internal control weaknesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adequate  training  is  provided  to  ministries  and  departments  in  order  to  improve  the 
<br/>knowledge  and  skill  sets  of  the  employees.    Reconciliations  performed  by  the  ministries  and 
<br/>departments  are  reviewed  in  a  timely  manner  and  anomalies  with  corrective  measures  are 
<br/>communicated to the Accounting Heads and Permanent Secretaries. Ministries and departments have 
<br/>been encouraged to  develop  policies and procedures and have been advised to  maintain adequate 
<br/>supporting documents for an audit trail.  Furthermore, Sir, stringent monitoring and follow-ups are 
<br/>undertaken by the Treasury Department to ensure ministries and departments are in compliance with 
<br/>the requirements of the financial laws and of course the International Accounting Standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to thank all those honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members who have contributed positively towards the debate.
