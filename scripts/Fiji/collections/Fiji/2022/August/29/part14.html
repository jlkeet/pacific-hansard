<div><span> Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2051 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 
<br/>2004 amongst other things provides for the regulation and control of financial institutions in Fiji to 
<br/>prevent and detect money laundering, terrorist financing and other serious criminal activities.  The 
<br/>Act establishes the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) as an intelligence agency of the government, 
<br/>responsible  for  the  detection  of  money  laundering,  terrorist  financing  and  other  serious  criminal 
<br/>activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, Sir, Section 13 (1) which is the bulk of the subject matter of this amendment of 
<br/>the  Act  provides  that  a  financial  institution  must  report  to  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  any 
<br/>transaction that is deemed to be Cash Transaction Report of any amount exceeding $10,000 in cash.  
<br/>The cash transaction reports are a key data source for FIU as they provide critical information that is 
<br/>used to form intelligence of possible money laundering, terrorist financing and other serious criminal 
<br/>activities which is then disseminated to law enforcement agencies.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Analysis,  Sir,  of  banking  statistics  shows  that  a  large  number  of  transactions,  in  fact  75 
<br/>percent,  cash  and  non-cash  undertaken  by  customers  of  financial  institutions  in  Fiji  are  for 
<br/></span><span>transactions valued below $10,000.  So, they do not actually get reported.  Currently, Fiji has a 99 
<br/></span><span>percent reporting rate of cash transaction reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The threshold for cash transaction reports, Sir, is a requirement under the Financial Action 
<br/>Task Force (FATF) international standards on anti-money laundering, however, the threshold to be 
<br/>reported  is  at  the  discretion  of  each  country.    So  obviously,  the  country  has  got  a  number  of  its 
<br/>transactions more way above $10,000 then the threshold could apply.  But, if in our case, if 75 percent 
<br/>of it is below $10,000 then we are not capturing most of the transactions.  In fact what we are finding, 
<br/>Sir,  intelligence  reports showed that many people are just simply plugging the  figure just below 
<br/>$10,000, so it does not get reported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, Sir, the Financial Transactions Reporting Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Act 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to revise the threshold for cash transaction reports as follows -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to redefine cash to mean currency notes and coins only; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Reduce the threshold for cash transaction reports for all financial institutions from  
<br/>$10,000 to $5,000 or its equivalent in foreign currency;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)  Require the financial institutions such as commercial banks report all transactions, cash  
<br/>and non-cash transactions of $5,000 and above or its equivalent in foreign currency to 
<br/>the FIU; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)    Require  the  financial  institution  such  as  non-banks,  report  only  cash  transactions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>involving notes and coins of $5,000 and above to FIU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The revision of the threshold, Sir, for cash transaction reports will result in a wider data set 
<br/>for intelligence purposes and will strengthen the ability of the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service 
<br/>(FRCS) and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to be more efficient in profiling and investigating tax 
<br/>evasion  cases.    This  will  result  in  an  improvement  in  tax  revenue  collection  and  tax  compliance.  
<br/>Moreover, Sir, other law enforcement agencies such as the Fiji Police Force and the Fiji Independent 
<br/>Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) will have access to more data on transactions which will 
<br/>be useful in financial investigations linked to money laundering, terrorist financing and other serious 
<br/>criminal activities.

<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very important to note that the revision of the threshold for cash transaction 
<br/>report will not affect customers of financial institutions and members of the public.  It is all done at 
<br/>the backend.  The reporting is done by the banks themselves, Sir.  Widespread consultations have 
<br/>been held, indeed also with our international partners and that is the gist of the amendment being 
<br/>sought.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I kind of anticipated another Bill when the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General presented the first one.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I think this Bill before us 
<br/>and being pushed under Standing Order 51 has really not been thought out properly and there are a 
<br/>number of reasons for it. I mean the argument that the honourable Attorney-General is using, you 
<br/>have $10,000 threshold at the moment, he wants to reduce it to $5,000 threshold.  His argument that 
<br/>75 percent of the people now are sending transactions below $10,000 really does not make sense in 
<br/>terms of addressing the overall concerns that he might have with respect to terrorist financing and 
<br/>others. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure whether this requirement or the reduction in the threshold because we are always 
<br/>worried about illicit transfers and financing for other purposes which are illegal, but it also means 
<br/>that these transactions are for businesses, for things that matter to people and so we need to have a 
<br/></span><span>little bit more discussion on  this.  Whether reducing the threshold is actually going to address that 
<br/></span><span>because people can still send $4,900 below the $5,000 threshold and send it ten times.  So, it is not 
<br/>necessarily addressing the concerns that you might have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this needs more discussion with a wider audience, with other agencies, the businesses  
<br/>communities and those who might  be concerned with  this and we have seen this in  the past,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  that  even  minor  amendments  to  Bills  have  been  rushed  in  this  Parliament  under 
<br/>Standing Order 51 and what we found out later on is that, it was not well-thought out, it had wider 
<br/>implications.  People had not been consulted, people had not made their views known and this is 
<br/>precisely what is being done here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I do not see a big logic of this Bill at this point in time without any further and serious 
<br/>discussion in terms of what kind of transactions are there.  If it has been not reported, has there any 
<br/>study  been  done?    Are  the  banks  concerned  about  it?    Who  is  concerned  about  it?    Are  the  law 
<br/>enforcement agencies concerned about it?  We do not know any of those information and that is why 
<br/>it is important to put this to a Committee, so that all these issues are aired out in public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I have said this before, there are 
<br/></span><span>many laws that have passed through this Parliament hardly anyone knows about it.  It is all done and 
<br/></span><span>has no serious implications, the people do not understand it, and one of the reasons why these things 
<br/>go to the Committee is that, there is a wider public consultations, there is a wider debate on the merits 
<br/>or demerits of a change in a law and it is useful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In those Committees all these information will be shared, the law enforcement agencies can  
<br/>come there, the Financial Intelligence Unit can come there, the Reserve Bank of Fiji can come to the 
<br/>Committee, the banks can come to the Committee, the business community reps can come to the 
<br/>Committee and say whether it makes sense to reduce the threshold from $10,000 to $5,000. So, that 
<br/>is logic behind putting Bills to a Committee and not rushing it through Standing Order 51.  So, I do 
<br/>not support this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I echo the sentiments expressed by the honourable  
<br/>Professor Prasad, expressing my concern and the way the Bill has been brought to Parliament but I 
<br/>supposed, Sir, I am talking to a wall because this is the modus operandi for the Government of the 
<br/>day. We are here in Parliament for this last week and here we have this Bill has been brought in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2053 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way, I did not mind the FDB Bill saying we amend “servants” to “employees”.  I do not mind that, 
<br/>that is fine with me.  But what were we doing all these years that we did not see that and then we 
<br/>bring it in on the last week of sitting in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this one here, we have talked about the ease of doing business in this 
<br/>country and a Bill like this should be put to the community, in the Committee to have dialogue on 
<br/>this one.  I wonder if the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, Honourable 
<br/>Vijay Nath recommended this in his report because they scrutinised the FIU Report every year.  I do 
<br/>not think anything has been said about this. You can correct me, Honourable Vijay Nath.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, a Committee has been scrutinising the FIU Report all these years. I do not see anything 
<br/>like that coming through, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that would have come through consultation. Not in this 
<br/>manner and it is just sad that we continue to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji lacks behind in terms of ease of doing business. We 
<br/>have dropped significantly from where we used to be. This is another obstacle to do business in this 
<br/>country.  Maybe it is needed to put it out to the Business Community to discuss it. Not in this manner 
<br/>but like I said, it is talking to a wall.  I just wish the next Parliament to do better and I am sure it will 
<br/></span><span>be done better because leadership will be different next time, Mr. Speaker..  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, every time, I stand up to contribute, they are 
<br/>very excited about my presence. So, on this I support honourable Professor Prasad and honourable 
<br/>Gavoka in our concern regarding this being coming under Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.  TUISAWAU.-  For  example,  if  you  look  at  the  draft  Bill  which  is  being 
<br/>presented, when you read the Explanatory Note 1.7(a) to 1.7(d), they have serious implications.  For 
<br/>example, redefining cash to mean currency notes and coins only. What is this based on?  So, that 
<br/>needs to be clearly explained.  Also, that threshold from $5,000 to $10,000 and see the requirement 
<br/>of financial institutions, this has implications on their processes and procedures internally - forms to 
<br/>fill, reconfiguring their software systems, et cetera.  I mean, has this been taken into consideration?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  issue  here,  Sir,  is  remittances  is  now  a  major  income  earner  in  the  nation.  Has 
<br/></span><span>anything  been  done  to  assess  the  implications  of  this  on  remittances  -  those  who  are  sending 
<br/></span><span>remittances  into  the  country?  Those  issues  need  to  be  clear.    As  I  have  said,  this  has  serious 
<br/>implications.  It should not be just rushed through under Standing Order 51 and there needs to be 
<br/>wider consultation with various stakeholders, as I have mentioned and for those reasons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Since no one else is wishing to take the floor, I now give the floor to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Attorney-General to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members obviously did 
<br/>not hear the introduction.  If they knew slightly a little bit of information about how the system works, 
<br/>they would not be making such obtuse comments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, this is about reporting by the banks, it does not affect businesses.  Businesses will carry 
<br/>on their normal transaction, Honourable Professor Prasad, you should know this.  They will carry on 
<br/>with their normal transactions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>
<div><span>2054 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Transactions Reporting (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reporting, honourable Gavoka, you worked in a bank.  It is a reporting by the banks to FIU, 
<br/>nothing to do with businesses. There is a financial taskforce in place.  There is a constant consultation 
<br/>by FIU. They talked to accountants and lawyers because lawyers and accountants, for example, Sir, 
<br/>also have transactions.  Honourable Prasad,  you know this, when people buy a house or multiple 
<br/>houses, they actually go and put money into their trust account and the law firms actually have to 
<br/>report that. They all know that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka, went on about ease of doing business.  It has nothing to do with ease of 
<br/>business, it is all about the banks.  The banks have all agreed to that because the banks want to adhere 
<br/>to international standards.  Do not shake your head, you know nothing about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the banks do international transfers, the corresponding banks overseas will talk to our 
<br/>banks and ask, what is the bulk of your transactions?  If they say that the bulk of our transactions is 
<br/>below $10,000 and we are not reporting it to the FIU, they will put a red flag.  That is how their 
<br/>International Banking System works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you have 75 percent of transactions below $10,000, obviously there must be a reporting 
<br/>mechanism.    It  has  nothing  to  do  with  businesses.    Hundred  financial  institutions  that  have  been 
<br/></span><span>consulted including law firms, accounting firms, firms like Merchant Finance and everyone else; and 
<br/></span><span>they are all agreeable to that because they all want to adhere to international standards.  It is very 
<br/>simple, members of the public do not get affected.  Yes, if you are a member of the public and trying 
<br/>to bypass the system, trying to bring in money illegally and trying to do cash transactions, then you 
<br/>will be concerned.  But still, it has no implication on you in terms of your daily transactions, your 
<br/>ability to transact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  FIU  will  just  simply  pick  up  and  say,  “This  person  is  now  transacting  amounts  over 
<br/>$5,000 and look at that, there is a pattern.”  That is what they do.  When honourable Professor Prasad 
<br/>went on very obtusely saying, “I can go and do $4,900.”  Yes, if you continuously do $4,900, they 
<br/>will pick up the pattern.  The banks themselves without having a requirement to report everything 
<br/>over $5,000 will go to FIU themselves and say,  “Look, this person is doing $4,900 all the time.”  
<br/>They work in collaboration with FIU, they do not understand how the financial system works and so 
<br/>many times continuously.  Honourable Tikoduadua, as former Permanent Secretary for Justice, he 
<br/>sat on that Money Laundering Committee, he knows that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Lt. Col. P. Tikoduadua interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- You have now been polluted by the people sitting around 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is, if  Fiji  wants  to  maintain  a 
<br/>credible financial system recognised by International Banking System and not being red flagged, we 
<br/>have to carry out these amendments.  There is actually international collaboration.  We actually get 
<br/>red flagged and honourable Gavoka and honourable Professor Prasad stood up here, pontificating 
<br/>about Standing Order 51, not realising the seriousness about this particular measure.  It has absolutely 
<br/>nothing to do about businesses being affected.  It has everything to do with the financial institutions 
<br/>agreeing to report simply transactions over $5,000.  That is all I have to say for the time being.  Thank 
<br/>you, Sir.
