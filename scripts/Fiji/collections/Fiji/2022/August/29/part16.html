<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- 551. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  … 551, does not mean that people still think that 551 is him, 
<br/>because if 551 goes to honourable Gavoka, it does not mean they will think that he is honourable Rasova 
<br/>(people would have forgotten the numbers).  But we need to ensure that we have these numbers in place, 
<br/>otherwise we would be running into thousands if you want different numbers altogether, which would 
<br/>become very difficult for the general members of the public to follow.

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Clause  5  of  the  Bill  amends  section  100  of  the  Act  to  allow  the  Electoral 
<br/>Commission to approve the method of packing unused (I am talking about unused), used and spoiled 
<br/>ballot papers after the count of the ballot papers.  As mentioned earlier, in the event that there are 550 
<br/>candidates, the ballot paper size will be 420 millimetres by 528 millimetres.  You are looking at a massive 
<br/>ballot paper.  This will mean that not all the materials may fit into a ballot box after the count of the ballot 
<br/>papers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Logistically, the weight of a ballot paper will exceed 12.5 kilogrammes, making it difficult to 
<br/>carry by hand.  It is, therefore, necessary that the Electoral Commission be empowered to consider the 
<br/>practicality  of  the  operations  in  order  to  approve  the  best  means  for  a  transparent,  safe  and  variable 
<br/>mechanism  to  transport  the  ballot  material  from  the  polling  stations  after  they  are  counted  because 
<br/>currently, it is very restricted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 6 of the Bill inserts section 110A to the Act to empower the Electoral 
<br/>Commission to adopt and publish guidelines on opinion polls, surveys and research related to Elections 
<br/>as it deems fit for the conduct of free and fair Elections.  Therefore, to protect the integrity of the electoral 
<br/>process and the results of the General Elections, it is necessary that all public opinion polls in Fiji adhere 
<br/>to the international standards and guidelines which, under this amendment the Electoral Commission may 
<br/></span><span>adopt as part of its powers and functions under the Act.  The Electoral Commission is thus empowered 
<br/></span><span>to adopt the latest guidelines and standards to apply to Fiji and the Supervisor of Elections is further 
<br/>tasked to vet compliance by any public opinion poll published in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally, Clause 6 of the Bill provides that the Supervisor of Elections is 
<br/>required to verify compliance and take necessary action to ensure that the guidelines are fully complied 
<br/>with.  Any appeal against the decision of the Supervisor of Elections under section 110A of the Act can 
<br/>indeed be made to the Electoral Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir that is essentially the gist of what these amendments are all about. I am sure all the honourable 
<br/>Members  agree  that  there  is  time  imperative  in  respect  of  these  amendments.    There  are  some  very 
<br/>practical issues.  I think no one envisaged when the laws were drafted there will be 10 political parties, 
<br/>that there will be 55 seats, there will be 550 candidates potentially and then, therefore, we will also need 
<br/>to be able to, for example, reuse the numbers.  Otherwise, if you do not want to use any of those numbers 
<br/>we have used so far, we will be going to thousands, so that is a very practical issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other practical issue, of course, is about the size of the ballot paper, the weight impact it will 
<br/>have on the ballot boxes because the ballot boxes, once the votes are counted, they need to be on transport 
<br/></span><span>to a safe place.  How to transport that?  All of these need to be taken into account, given the size of the 
<br/></span><span>ballot papers and, of course, the public opinion polls are adopting international standard.  So that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in summary the introduction of the provision of this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.   At the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, again, this is highly irresponsible, apart from the 
<br/>practical  matters  that  he  talked  about,  for  the  honourable  Attorney-General,  who  is  the  Minister  for 
<br/>Elections, to bring this Bill into Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the history of the 2013 Constitution is well-known.  The history of the draconian 
<br/>electoral laws is well-known in this country.  We have talked about this before and we will continue to 
<br/>talk about it.  This is a government which has continued to empower the Supervisor of Elections.  The 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections is almost like a god now.  So much powers have been given to the Supervisor of 
<br/>Elections and a lot of the decisions that the Supervisor of Elections makes cannot even be challenged in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2059 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the court of law.  Where in the world, where in a democracy you are going to have that?  We have got all 
<br/>these stupid campaign laws for example in place.  We have got these stupid laws about manifestos.  In 
<br/>any democracy, the political parties make their manifesto.  It is not for the government to tell them, “You 
<br/>should cost this, you should do that.”  We have already had that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is stifling democracy to no end, Mr. Speaker, and apart from the practical matters, Clause 3 of 
<br/>the Bill again gives the Supervisor of Elections powers to harass not only candidates, supporters, agents 
<br/>but opposition political parties and we know why some of these laws have been made and that is why 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, it is highly irresponsible.  This is complete dictatorship for the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>to bring this Bill just before an elections is due.  I mean, some of the practical matters that he is talking 
<br/>about shows how stupid those laws initially were - the system and there has been no attempt over the last 
<br/>seven-and-a-half years or eight years to change those.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill, Mr. Speaker, should have been brought earlier so that we could have had a proper 
<br/>discussion, consultation.  I mean, we already Mr. Speaker, have all kinds of conflict of interest in this 
<br/>country including the honourable Attorney-General, who is the General Secretary of the FijiFirst Party, 
<br/>he is the registered officer of the FijiFirst Party, he is the Minister responsible for Elections.   The laws 
<br/>that are coming in, the laws that have been there, the Financial Management Act, requiring the political 
<br/></span><span>parties to engage in this stupid exercise which is highly and thoroughly impractical and it actually goes 
<br/></span><span>to the fundamental point about democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, political parties offer the moon sometimes but it is not for him or for the Government or the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections or someone in the Electoral Commission to ask and tell them how they are going 
<br/>to do it.  It is for the people whether they want to believe it or not.  That is an example of a stupid law that 
<br/>this Government has put in place to punish the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They want to continue with dictatorship in this country, Mr. Speaker, and that is why they are 
<br/>bringing all these stupid laws to gag the Opposition.  They are pushing the people, the political parties to 
<br/>the wall, Sir.  The onerous requirements of some of the laws - example and very evident of what of what 
<br/>he is trying to do.   He puts  a  complaint to the Supervisor of Elections, there  goes the Supervisor of 
<br/>Elections and there goes the Electoral Commission.  We put a complaint against him nothing happens, 
<br/>because he is the Minister for Elections.  He is responsible for the budget for the Elections Office.  He 
<br/>does not talk about all that conflict of interest and yet he does not want a Bill, a law change to go to the 
<br/>Committee to have more discussion on it.  These are things that, in a good democracy, a government will 
<br/>discuss with other political parties or at least the opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill should be withdrawn.  In fact, it is the job of Parliament 
<br/></span><span>and  I  urge  you,  I  know  you  will  say  this  is  the  Government’s  job  but  this  is  not  right.    This  is  not 
<br/>strengthening democracy in this country.  This is stifling democracy in this country and this is what this 
<br/>Government has done over the last seven years and I have seen the changes to the laws. They have not 
<br/>entered into any serious discussion with the Opposition Parties, the practicality of some of the laws that 
<br/>are there and so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot support this motion.  This Bill should be withdrawn.  I want 
<br/>to tell the people of this country, which we have been saying to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- It is too late. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We want to tell the people and the people of this country are fed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the arrogance and dictatorship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are fed-up and they have their backs against the walls and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are waiting for the date of the Election when they will kick them out.  That is what they will do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Dream on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They have been threatening and  I know.  I do not want to name 
<br/>the honourable Member but he was drunk somewhere in one of the hotels and he said to his friends, “Oh, 
<br/>we will win again like we won the last time because we rigged it.  We are going to rig it again.”  This is 
<br/>what a Government Member is telling his friends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Making up stories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is not a story. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will name that man when we debate this Bill, do not worry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- You do not have a name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have a name.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious issue.  They talk about 
<br/>stability, transparency, accountability and democracy and yet, they are making laws to entrench them in 
<br/>power.  That is why I am saying that this Bill should not be entertained, it should be withdrawn. I urge 
<br/>the Government to reconsider this Bill.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree entirely with what has been expressed by my 
<br/>colleague,  honourable  Professor  Prasad.    Actually  people  were  saying  publicly  that  in  this  sitting  of 
<br/>Parliament this week, some laws about the elections will be brought in by this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this with concern because elections is going to be happening very soon 
<br/>and this is not the time to be changing the rules.  This is not the time to be making new rules as articulated 
<br/>by my colleague; people are not sure any more about their democracy in this country. Democracy should 
<br/></span><span>be enjoyed by the people at least we celebrate it.  We have been campaigning since 26</span><span>th</span><span> April but we 
<br/></span><span>cannot talk about our policies.  We have close to 50 candidates now campaigning across Fiji (SODELPA), 
<br/>and when we get asked about our policies, we say “sorry we cannot share that with you right now because 
<br/>we have to meet certain stringent requirements by this government”.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, what kind of democracy is that - that our people cannot talk about policies because 
<br/>of some requirements that are quite (I like what you have said) stupid?  Where in the world do you have 
<br/>to cost your manifesto in order to campaign?  We do not know of any jurisdiction that does that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is truly stifling.  As Party Leader, one of my main concerns now is to keep our 
<br/>people motivated because really they do not have much to say, because of this silly requirement that 
<br/>whatever we put in our manifesto must have a cost to it; where are we going to get the money from; and 
<br/>how it affects the National Budget. Government has all the advantages because they have these figures 
<br/>with them. They have the Civil Service to provide these figures for them. For us political parties, the 
<br/>honourable Minister is saying there are nine political parties that have registered in this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2061 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tell me, Mr. Speaker, I would like to know and I know SODELPA can do it.  We are very close 
<br/>to finalising our manifesto and what about the other small parties.  Can they live up to the stupid standards 
<br/>being set by this Government?  Can they really be engaging themselves in democracy in the way we have 
<br/>settled all this?  I am sorry but I never thought I would use the word ‘stupid’ in this Parliament but it is 
<br/>coming to that now, Mr. Speaker.  I once used the word ‘clowns’ here and it is really mind boggling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would urge the Government to please take this back.  The people today are expecting elections 
<br/>to happen very soon.  I do not know why they are changing the electoral laws.  We are out of words in 
<br/>trying to make sense of how this Government operates. You know it has been like that all these years - 
<br/>dictatorship at its worst is what we see in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, they should take this back so that we bring some sanity into our electoral system. 
<br/>We are ready for elections. Do not bring in anything new to make it more complicated.  Like I said - I 
<br/>know I am talking to the deaf or having dialogue with the deaf, but let me register our concern and the 
<br/>SODELPA supporters will know this and punish FijiFirst accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- It is incredible the kind of rubbish we are hearing in this Parliament. The 
<br/>people of this country must listen to the sentiments that are being expressed here. The group on this side 
<br/></span><span>is telling the people of this country that there is no accountability for what they will portray in the next 
<br/></span><span>election. If they are saying we are going to do this, there is no accountability for them to tell the people 
<br/>of this country how they will fund what they supposed to do.  Are we supposed to treat the voters of this 
<br/>country like idiots? That is what you are saying.  That is what the honourable Gavoka is talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the big controversy with the kind of things that we are talking about here?  This debate 
<br/>currently, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is just about Head 51 - whether it goes to Head 51 or not. But the kind of 
<br/>sentiments that are expressed here look at the things that have been stated here by Clause 2.  It is just a 
<br/>definition of ‘person’. What is the big deal with that?  The aim of that is to eliminate any controversial of 
<br/>that.  What is the big deal with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- Clause 3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Then there have been sentiments here to say that any party in this country 
<br/>can stand up and say we will do this and that, but they have no responsibility to show how they will fund 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF B.C. PRASAD.- It is up to the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is what they are telling the people of this country that political parties 
<br/>should not be expected to show what is the rationale, how will they fund what they are supposed to do.  
<br/>Are you going to treat the citizens of this country like idiots?  This side of the Parliament says no!   The 
<br/>people in this country - before they vote for their party, they must know how those things will be funded.  
<br/>That is the expectation.  You are trying to build up a lot of conspiracy.  There is no conspiracy here - there 
<br/>is only one conspiracy; conspiracy on this side of Parliament is to make sure that the people of this country 
<br/>get the best government that treats people transparently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Remember transparent action on this side of Parliament when people do something that is deemed 
<br/>as wrong according to the law, people on this side of Parliament resign.  That is transparency, that is 
<br/>integrity and that is ethics.  That is what the FijiFirst Party stands for.  You stand up and you talk about it 
<br/>as if there is some kind of conspiracy, there is no conspiracy.  The only conspiracy that we have is to do 
<br/>the best for the people of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to tell the voters of Fiji, you have the right to expect when a political party comes to you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and says, we will do this and we will do that - they will show you how it will be funded because the 
<br/>people of this country have the right to expect that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- I rise to contribute to the debate on the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister who had previously spoke has just simplified the issue.  
<br/>He treats it lightly; it is not a light issue it is a serious issue because if you look at the 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 it is 
<br/>more than what he is saying; the amendment of definitions.  It involves quite substantial changes and the 
<br/>one I would like to comment on is 2.7 - to empower the Electoral Commission to adopt and publish 
<br/>guidelines on opinion polls. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this came about basically because the opinion poll is going against them.  That 
<br/>is the main reason; that is the truth.  The opinion poll in the </span><span>Fiji Sun </span><span>has been going against them and has 
<br/>been portraying them as maybe second or third.  That is why they are asking for this to be reviewed for 
<br/>standards to be put in or other guidelines to restrict opinion polls.  That is a hindrance on democracy - 
<br/>opinion polls are there for feedback not only for political parties but also for the voters and that is an issue 
<br/>where we do not agree that this be rushed through because that is another fundamental issue in terms of 
<br/></span><span>having a proper and practising democracy which we, up to today have seen Fiji is not, and that is why we 
<br/></span><span>emphasise  that  these  kind  of  changes  should  have  been  brought  in  earlier,  discussed  properly  and 
<br/>consultations made thoroughly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what I wanted to emphasise today.  The whole thing boils down to the 
<br/>2013 Constitution and the electoral methodology which is there and this methodology is imposed on this 
<br/>nation.    That  is  why  we  have  always  emphasised  with  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  the  need  for 
<br/>bipartisanship in terms of disagreements on the Constitution, and the legal frameworks in this country.  
<br/>But unfortunately that has fallen on deaf ears and it is too late for them because the voters will have their 
<br/>say and soon they will not be sitting where they are but they will be outside the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I would like to ask, when is the Election?  Why are they dragging it? Are we going to 
<br/>have the Elections or not?  People are beginning to doubt the whole process and people are being pushed 
<br/>against the wall so please make the decision and stop introducing laws which hinder democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. RASOVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to add a few more.  The Electoral 
<br/>(Amendment) Bill 2022, people are waiting for the Writ and they are ready to go to elections.  One thing 
<br/>I found in the 2014 Elections, there were only about five Parties that contested for the 50 seats.  Come 
<br/></span><span>2018 Elections, there were probably another five Parties and it surprises me now that for 2022, 10 
<br/></span><span>political parties have been approved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  amazing  to  know  how  these  people  got  their  5,000  signatures.    Did  the  Electoral 
<br/>Commission check the names of the signatures of these people?  For parties to qualify in the 2014 
<br/>Elections, there were only five parties and the rest could not because of the difficulty they had, and 
<br/>even  for  the  2018  Elections.    Now  in  2022,  because  of  the  opinion  polls  being  against  the 
<br/>Government, they have approved about 10 parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Justice, Law and Human Rights Committee had submitted (I think) 18 recommendations 
<br/>for this elections.  I take it that it is not in here that every name or every number will come with their 
<br/>party signs but that has not been mentioned here.  I do not know whether the 18 recommendations 
<br/>have been taken into account by the Supervisor of Elections.  Sir, maybe tomorrow they will change 
<br/>another Act, change the goal post towards the 2022 Elections.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope 
<br/>this is the last and we will debate it again on Thursday.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2063 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Since, no one else wishes to take the floor, I give the floor to the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Attorney-General for his Right of Reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  always  very  interesting  to  see 
<br/>honourable  Professor  Prasad  getting  a  fluster  which  obviously  he  was  not  in  a  fluster  earlier  on 
<br/>because generally his fluster situation stems from when knows he is not doing really well outside 
<br/>with members of the public, and he tries to come and vent it out here in this Parliament, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Talk about yourself! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to highlight a couple of things 
<br/>in response to what the other side said.  It would appear that honourable Professor Prasad’s objection 
<br/>to  this  Bill  is  only  on  Section  3,  in  respect  of  the  powers  essentially  being  elucidated  for  the 
<br/>Supervisor of Elections to carry out his work.  In that process, of course, he brought about everything 
<br/>else, his frustrations about how he essentially is not able to now hoodwink members of the public, 
<br/>with all sorts of gimmicks - that is what it is all about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, if you have a country that has the historical record where politicians have 
<br/></span><span>used ethnicity, where politicians have used false promises to try and win office, then laws have to be 
<br/></span><span>made to ensure that we provide a level playing field.  Laws have to be put in place to ensure that, that 
<br/>level of hoodwinking does not take place.  Honourable Professor Prasad said “let the public decide 
<br/>how it will be funded”.  When he goes out and talks to a group of farmers or people who may not be 
<br/>that  well  educated  and  says  “I  will  give  you  X,  Y  and  Z”  they  do  not  necessarily  have  all  the 
<br/>information available to themselves or necessarily sometimes the education qualifications to be able 
<br/>to question that. This is why, Sir, we need these laws in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you have true democracy being implemented in 2014 where we have one person, one 
<br/>vote, one value - it has never been done.  They always grunt and moan about this, but it has never 
<br/>been done in this country.  The British left us with an electoral system that was based on ethnicity.  
<br/>It was then perpetuated and ingrained in the 1990 Constitution  - purely based on ethnicity, forget 
<br/>about open seats.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 1997 again we had that still ingrained.   Here we have, and as 
<br/>a result of that we had to make a proviso to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
<br/>Discrimination.  We had a proviso as a result of our electoral system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau talked about the electoral system that was imposed.  Honourable Professor 
<br/>Prasad, honourable Tikoduadua and honourable Qereqeretabua actually do not acknowledge the fact, 
<br/></span><span>their Party got a piddly over 5 percent in 2014, yet they are in Parliament.  They got a piddly 7 percent, 
<br/></span><span>yet they  are in Parliament in  2018.   They  received 20 percent of the total  votes  cast in the previous 
<br/>elections, but did not get a single seat but this electoral system has allowed small parties like them to be 
<br/>represented in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- They do not acknowledge that, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  They do not 
<br/>acknowledge the fact that this electoral system has allowed all Members of Parliament to be accountable 
<br/>to every single Fijian, irrespective of where they live.  They do not acknowledge the fact that this electoral 
<br/>system has allowed more women to be in Parliament than ever before and more young people to be in 
<br/>Parliament than ever before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- That when we go to elections we do not stand along separate

<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lines, we all stand in one line as Fijians voting on policies and issues.  They do not acknowledge that fact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Honourable Gavoka joined this chorus of stupid, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  There is no creative thinking.  Stupid, because he loved the word, so he is now saying it.  A bit more 
<br/>finesse would have been obtuse, perhaps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point is this, what is wrong in saying what your policies are.  Not all policies 
<br/>actually have a cost factor.  You can announce those policies, but if you are going to say, “I am going to 
<br/>build a four-lane road”, then you need to say how much will it cost.  Honourable Gavoka said they do not 
<br/>have any statistics.  By law, we have to publish the fiscal update before elections.  It is all there, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is outdated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The Budget has also given the latest statistics.  He is saying it is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outdated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fact is, they have all the figures available and the fact is, they do not want to 
<br/></span><span>be accountable to members of the public.  They want to be able to go out and make false promises.  
<br/>Honourable  Gavoka  is  already  on  record  saying,  “I’ll  make  universities  all  free.”    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>absolutely, but no figures.  He does not know how much it will cost.  He does not take into account the 
<br/>fact that 65 percent of the population is below the age of 35, therefore, we will be getting more children 
<br/>being born.  Therefore, how will they be funded?  What is the sustainability of it?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, those 
<br/>are the kind of things.  If it is done, then that is great.  Present it!  Stop whinging, stop whinging all of 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- It’ll be done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. ADIMAITOGA.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- The whole issue is about creating a transparent level playing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>field, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other point that I wanted to also make is that, we have had now people, for 
<br/>example, going around saying, “We will bring down the price of flour” or “We will bring down the price 
<br/></span><span>of fuel” or “We will bring down the price of cooking oil.  This Government has put it up, we will bring 
<br/></span><span>it down.”  This is the level of obfuscation and lies that has been told to members of the public.  They 
<br/>know who we are talking about.  So here we have, one hand politicians saying that out in the field, yet 
<br/>they come to this Parliament and say that these laws are unfair.  It is completely unfair to hoodwink the 
<br/>members of the Fijian electorate.  Completely unfair! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  Everyone knows that Government does not control the price of 
<br/>fuel.  Everyone knows that we do not control the price of wheat globally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, yet, they are 
<br/>doing that and, yet, they come and complain about such laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Shameful! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, would it not be so stupid for a government 
<br/>that if we control the price of food, that we would put it up during election time?  Is that not stupid?  If

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2065 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we had our own way, we would make it 5 cents a kilogramme, just to win the elections.  So, logically, it 
<br/>does not follow. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have talked about all sorts of things, yet todate, NFP nor SODELPA nor 
<br/>any other Party outside – PAP or whatever has produced an alternative budget.  Not one of them has 
<br/>produced any alternative budget, nor have they made an effort to do so.  They have been there for eight 
<br/>years alternative budget, nor have they made an effort to do so.  They have been there for eight years.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Professor Prasad is getting all in a fluster hogwash, we know he gets caught 
<br/>out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- If you go to a matured democracy like Australia, you will find 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the opposition party will always produce an alternative budget, they always will do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. KURIDRANI.- That is Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  He is saying that that is Australia and here they go, then they 
<br/>call us dictatorship.  They use it so flippantly.  Here we have a Professor saying this is a dictatorship.  
<br/>What does the word “dictator” mean?  A ruler with total power over one country that is a dictator.  A 
<br/>dictatorship means that that one person has complete control over one country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament makes laws, there is an independent judiciary, there is an independent executive and 
<br/>that is how the government functions, and they say, “Oh that is nonsense.”  That is the most obtuse things 
<br/>you  have  said,  this  is  and  on  the  same  hand,  Sir,  they  said,  “Oh,  we  must  work  together,  we  have 
<br/>bipartisanship.”  You do not even agree on the fundamentals.  This man, honourable Tuisawau said in 
<br/>the last session that people must be appointed on ethnicity in government positions, in statutory positions; 
<br/>you said that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have the Point of Order, honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- That Point of Order, he is misleading Parliament because what I 
<br/></span><span>mentioned was based on the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, the percentage of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> who 
<br/></span><span>are poor and  Government should look at ways of uplifting because of their high percentage; 75 percent 
<br/>of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are in that category of poor, that is what I said.  I did not say that they should be appointed on 
<br/>ethnicity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.-  You said it, check the </span><span>Daily Hansard.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- If I said it then bring it to this Parliament and prove it.  I did not say 
<br/>that a person should be appointed because he is an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or any other race, I did not say that.  Stop 
<br/>misleading Parliament and portraying the Oppositions as racist. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F. TUISAWAU.- Stop doing that because you yourself is a racist and I can show it.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Electoral (Amendment) Bill 2022  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29</span><span>th</span><span> Aug, 2022 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Attorney-General you have the floor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he did say it.  It is in the same way he is getting 
<br/>in a fluster like honourable Professor Prasad.  He is getting worried about a Warid comment.  In the same 
<br/>way, the complete lack of impertinency of them, it took them three to four days to come back and make 
<br/>a comment on the comment made by this lady from People’s Alliance Party (PAP).  They are all going, 
<br/>“aww”.  That is actually what happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We made statements, the honourable Prime Minister made a statement on it, then they woke up 
<br/>from their coma or from being obsequious to his new leader, that is what it is all about.  This is the type 
<br/>of governance that is the alternative.  This is the alternative to Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if these people get 
<br/>into control or power.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  do not want to make  any  further comments, however,  we  have of  course 
<br/>digressed  in  respect  of  this  particular  Bill.    As  I  have  highlighted,  it  seems  like  section  3  is  what 
<br/>honourable Professor Prasad seems to be concerned about, there are some very practical issues in the Bill.  
<br/>We have a ballot paper that will be extremely large, we need to be able to have laws that will cater for 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Rasova asked, “Did they check the signatures?”  Of course they do.  It actually gets 
<br/>published.  Where have you been?  Certainly not in Kadavu.  Every signature gets verified.  People from 
<br/>your Party actually have resigned and gone there, and they signed on to other political parties.  They have 
<br/>to go through processes.  One of them actually, two parties, applied for registration, some of the signatures 
<br/>were not back because of what they called “double dipping”.  They have gone back for registration.  No 
<br/>one envisaged we will have 10 political parties, but they have registered, so there is a practical solution 
<br/>to it and there is a practical issue in terms of numbers.  What is your problem with having numbers being 
<br/>put  in  place?    It  is  for  the  betterment  of  the  conduct  of  the  elections.    Opinion  polls,  people  from 
<br/>SODELPA have complained to me about the opinion polls.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuisawau, you are obviously in a different political party from all the ranting and 
<br/>raving you have been doing in public press.  There are people in SODELPA who have commented, other 
<br/>political  party  members  have  commented  about  how  the  polls  have  been  published  and  there  is  no 
<br/>standard.  What is wrong with the Electoral Commission adopting international standards?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. SAYED-KHAIYUM.- What is wrong with that?  What is wrong in catering for the fact 
<br/></span><span>that the ballot papers will be large and will create  a very heavy weight, people will not be able to carry it 
<br/>so let us have alternative ways.  The law is limited in that sense.  So these are practical issues, Sir.  There 
<br/>is nothing sinister about it.  The other thing that none of them actually picked up upon because they are 
<br/>so overridden by Standing Order 51, we have got set no time limit.  Normally we say that the debate 
<br/>should be limited to one hour.  For all the three Bills today, we have said there is no time limit.  You can 
<br/>debate till morning come but let us debate it.   
<br/></span></div>
