<div><span> Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As your newly elected Speaker, first and foremost, I give thanks to the Almighty God for this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>great honour bestowed on me, for His blessings and favour.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, my sincere appreciation to the honourable Prime Minister for nominating me and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>having the trust in me to carry the duties and responsibilities that come with this high Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third, I sincerely thank the honourable Members of this Parliament for the confidence you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have placed on me to serve in this august assembly as your Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  deeply  humbled  for  by  trust  that  you  have  bestowed  on  me,  and  I  take  all  these 
<br/>responsibilities with the hope that I will be able to follow in the footsteps of the illustrious previous 
<br/>occupants of this Chair. I intend to listen to and to work with each one of  you to continue the work 
<br/>of my venerable  predecessor </span><span>Na Turaga Bale na Tui Cakau</span><span> in transforming our Parliament to be an 
<br/>effective and efficient instrument in serving our people and our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recognise and pay tribute to the indigenous Fijians, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, and the owners of this land, 
<br/></span><span>Tui Suva</span><span>, and the </span><span>vanua</span><span> on which this Parliament of Fiji is situated for their generosity and charity 
<br/>in allowing us to build, reside and to meet on this soil. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, allow me to congratulate you for the progress you have achieved in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your service to the people of Fiji in the last two years of the life of this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, allow me also to take this occasion to recognise the support and the backing provided 
<br/>by my family for me, and like all our families, they have remained pillars of strength and our never-
<br/>ending sources of support and inspiration to each of us to do good for this nation.  For me, I thank 
<br/>my family sincerely for their unwavering support, knowing that I will now be spending just a little 
<br/>bit more time in this Chamber and its precincts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my humble view, the seat I am now occupying is  one that is entrusted with the highest 
<br/>level  of  responsibility.  It  requires  a  vigilant  devotion  to  the  rules  and  principles  of  parliamentary 
<br/>democracy, guided by the three basic tenets namely that all members have equal rights and privileges 
<br/>as well as obligations; that the will of the majority prevails and must be carried out; and finally, the 
<br/>rights of the minority must be preserved. This position also in addition requires a progressive outlook 
<br/>to always constantly look for solutions and sustainable pathways to strengthen democracy in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not and have never been a politician and this environment I now find myself in is, while 
<br/></span><span>new, I consider it a challenge, but the basic rules of dispensing justice as was the objective in my 
<br/></span><span>previous calling, equally applies here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  with  this  appointment,  I  now  would  have  served  in  all  the  three  branches  of 
<br/>government - the Executive dealing with the enforcement of the law, the Judiciary dealing with the 
<br/>interpretation of the law, and now the Legislature, the supreme law making authority of this land. I 
<br/>could not have asked and wished for a more fulfilling life of almost 50 years of my public service to 
<br/>my beloved country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May  God  bless  us  all.  In  the  famous  words  of  our  revered  statesman  Ratu  Sir  Lala 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Vanayaliyali Sukuna: “Floreat Viti”.  May God bless Fiji. Thank you, honourable Members.
