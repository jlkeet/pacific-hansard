<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SECRETARY-GENERAL.-  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  for  nominations  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I call upon the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs for his nomination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  honourable,  Mr.  Justice  Filimone  Jitoko,  do  take  the  Chair  as  Speaker  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Secretary-General, I second the nomination.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SECRETARY-GENERAL.-  I  now  invite  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  give  a  brief 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>account of the nominee’s credentials.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Madam Secretary-General, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, 
<br/>honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, members of the public who may be watching us via television and livestream 
<br/>or listening to their radios.  </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Secretary-General,  I  rise  in  accordance  with  Standing  Order  17(4)  to  propose  the 
<br/>name  of  Mr.  Justice  Filimone  Jitoko  as the  new  Speaker  to  preside  over  this  august  House.   Mr. 
<br/>Justice Jitoko was born on 3rd October, 1949, in Kabara, Lau, to his parents, Mr. Isireli Rarawa and 
<br/>Mrs. Leba Wainise.  He is a proud husband of Mrs. Elina Senirewa Jitoko, and they are doting parents 
<br/>of two sons and two daughters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  his  humble  beginnings  at  a  District  School  in  Kabara,  and  later  attending  Ratu 
<br/>Kadavulevu  School  and  Queen  Victoria  School,  Mr.  Justice  Jitoko  has  become  a  distinguished 
<br/>Pacific Jurist, a diplomat and an academic. He is an outstanding son of Fiji.  A keen sportsman, he 
<br/>was a member of the Fiji Secondary Schools Rugby Team in 1969.  Prior to that, he captained the 
<br/>Queen Victorian School First XV Rugby Team, as well as the school cricket, hockey and athletics 
<br/>team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Justice Jitoko read law at the Victoria University of Wellington from 1972 to 1976. While 
<br/>there, he was a member of the cricket and rugby team of the University.  He was admitted to the New 
<br/></span><span>Zealand Bar and the Bar of the High Court of Fiji in 1978. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has had a storied legal career as a State Law Officer, rising to the position of Solicitor-
<br/>General and later, stints as Resident Magistrate and Puisne Judge of the High Court of Fiji.  Mr. 
<br/>Justice Jitoko also served as the Legal Advisor to the Bose Levu Vakaturaga from 1988 to1994.  
<br/>The apex of his professional career, most recently, is as President of the Fiji Court of Appeal and 
<br/>prior to that, as Chief Justice of the Republic of Nauru. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Diplomat, Madam Secretary-General, he served as Fiji’s Ambassador to the Court of St. 
<br/></span><span>James in the United Kingdom and also was accredited to the Holy See, Denmark and Israel.  He also 
<br/></span><span>served  as  Counsellor  at  our  Permanent  Mission  to  the  United  Nations  in  New  York  and  at  our 
<br/>Embassy to the United States in Washington D.C. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a senior and trustworthy civil servant, Mr. Justice Jitoko served as Secretary to Cabinet.  
<br/>He also briefly joined Academia as a Senior Lecturer at the School of Islands and Oceans as well as 
<br/>the School of Law in the University of the South Pacific.

<div><span> Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> Nov., 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Community  Service,  Madam  Secretary-General,  another  significant  highlight  is  Mr. 
<br/>Justice  Jitoko’s  fiduciary  service  to  his  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  and  community  in  giving  back  to  the  nation.    Mr. 
<br/>Justice Jitoko has served as Chairman of the Kabara Development Corporation from 1992 to 1996, 
<br/>as well as the Ratu Mara Education Trust Board.  He had also served as Governor on the Adi Cakobau 
<br/>School Board of Governors and President of Fiji Cricket Association as well as the Queen Victoria 
<br/>School Old Boy’s Club. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Madam Secretary-General, Mr. Justice Jitoko as an eminent Jurist, illustrious  
<br/>Diplomat, senior Civil Servant and Academic, is well regarded and well respected.  I have, no doubt, 
<br/>that his sense of fairness and commitment to uphold the parliamentary democracy in this land at all 
<br/>times will make him an excellent holder of this High Office. He will bring outstanding leadership, 
<br/>communication and strategic thinking credentials and gravitas to the Office of the Speaker in guiding 
<br/>parliamentary debate and ensuring that the people of this nation participate in their governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has an ambitious and intricate legislative agenda and his brilliant 
<br/>qualities  as  a  Jurist  will  ensure  that  Parliament  make  laws  that  are  user-friendly,  coherent  and 
<br/>navigable.  As  Lord  Bingham  had  said,  the  law  should  be,  and  I  quote:  “accessible  and  so  far  as 
<br/>possible intelligible, clear and predictable.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Justice  Jitoko’s  distinguished  national,  regional  and  international  service  as  an 
<br/>outstanding Jurist, illustrious Diplomat and Academic makes him eminently suitable to take the Chair 
<br/>as Speaker of this august House. Therefore, Madam Secretary-General, I commend his name to the 
<br/>House for election as our Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SECRETARY-GENERAL.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Opposition for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nomination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Secretary-General, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Mr. Ruveni Nadalo do take the Chair of Parliament as Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Madam  Secretary-General,  I  as  a  stand-alone  and  Independent 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member of Parliament, second the name of Mr. Ruveni Nadalo to be the Speaker of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SECRETARY-GENERAL.- I now invite the honourable Leader of the Opposition to give a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>brief account of the nominee’s credentials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Madam  Secretary-General,  I  rise  in  accordance  with  Standing 
<br/>Order  17(4)  as  well  and  as  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  I  have  announced  our  nomination  for 
<br/>Speaker of Parliament, Mr. Ruveni Nadalo, who was a former Deputy Speaker of Parliament as well 
<br/>during the term of Parliament from 2014 to 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Honourable Members, Mr. Ruveni Nadalo is a proud son of Batiri, Malomalo, Nadroga to the 
<br/>late  Isikeli  Nadalo.    A  long  serving  member  of  the  National  Federation  Party,  who  inspired  Mr. 
<br/>Nadalo’s  interest  in  politics  at  a  very  tender  age  and  Mr.  Nadalo  was  raised  in  one  of  the  most 
<br/></span><span>politically  active  families  in  Fiji  then  and  grew  up  instilled  in  the  values  of  public  service  and 
<br/></span><span>commitment to serving the interest of the people of Fiji.  His late father left behind a legacy as a 
<br/>champion for multiracial representation and regional interest which profound the influence of Mr. 
<br/>Nadalo in his approach to leadership.  He is also a distinguished leader in the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, particularly in 
<br/>his  </span><span>tikina</span><span>  of  Malomalo  in  Nadroga,  and  has  also  served  as  the  Chairman  of  the  Nadroga/Navosa 
<br/>Provincial Council from the years 2019 to 2022.  He has demonstrated during his term as Deputy 
<br/>Speaker of Parliament the capability to handle parliamentary affairs.  He has also during his term as

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Election of the Speaker of the Republic of Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a parliamentarian served as a Member of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, on the Business 
<br/>Committee,  the  House  Committee,  and  as  Deputy  Speaker  was  also  chair  of  the  Privileges 
<br/>Committee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  experience  as  Deputy  Speaker  helped  him  to  acquire  a  deeper  understanding  of  the 
<br/>procedures of Parliament, the capacity to preside over the passage of legislation and the ability to 
<br/>oversee  debates  in  an  impartial  and  effective  manner.    His  suitability  of  a  Speaker,  therefore,  is 
<br/>unquestionable.  He has also had various international engagements in serving under those capacities 
<br/>and this has put him in good stand to assume the position of Speaker.  In nominating Mr. Nadalo, we 
<br/>are very confident that he will not only continue the kind of leadership of Speakers before him, but 
<br/>also raise the level of service that Fiji requires of this critical position.  Mr. Nadalo is committed to 
<br/>fostering a culture of respect and inclusivity in Parliament and will lead Parliament with integrity and 
<br/>wisdom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SECRETARY-GENERAL.- Honourable Members, are there any further nominations? 
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Standing Order 17(7), the Parliament is required to undertake a roll call vote. Pursuant to Standing 
<br/>Order 17(8), the Secretary-General will ask each honourable Member separately how the honourable
