<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - 
<br/>ASSETS FIJI PTE LIMITED 2016-2019 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, as I have stated before, there are four speakers that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been listed by the two Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Civil Service, information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs ; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the recommendations made by the 
<br/>Standing Committee on the Assets  Fiji  Pte Limited Annual Reports for the period 2016 to  2019. 
<br/>Assets Fiji Pte Limited, established in 2015, is the Government’s asset holding company and it forms 
<br/>part of a broader divestment strategy aimed at securing public assets.  Currently, Assets Fiji Limited 
<br/>(AFL) holds the assets and leases the land on which the buildings for three entities are situated. These 
<br/>entities  are  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited,  Fiji  Ships  and  Heavy  Industries  Limited  and  the 
<br/>Government Printery and Stationery Department.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I really want to highlight this particular point, that the Report highlights the 
<br/>failure of the Chairman of Assets Fiji Pte Limited, who was the former Permanent Secretary in the 
<br/></span><span>Prime  Minister’s  Office,  who  had  no  time  to  acknowledge  or  even  respond  to  the  Committee’s 
<br/></span><span>request for a public meeting.  Sir, this is unacceptable.  I want to stress once again and I did that in 
<br/>the last Parliament session, that we must stop appointing Permanent Secretaries and CEOs to multiple 
<br/>Boards when they have failed to manage their own Ministry’s companies or are too busy to attend 
<br/>crucial meetings. This is really a disservice to the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL currently holds $57 million worth of assets, as we have heard from the 
<br/>Deputy Chairperson, ensuring that public property is not lost when shares are divested. This allows 
<br/>assets to be leased, generating revenue for the Government so that revenue comes from two sources 
<br/></span><span>- one is from the land that is leased and other one is from the shares and how well the company does.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let  us  not  forget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  AFL  was  an  initiative  of  the  Bainimarama-led 
<br/>Government  which  created  a  pathway  for  privatisation  without  losing  control  of  public  assets  to 
<br/>private interests, as we saw in the past. In our last parliamentary debate, which was just in the first 
<br/>week of September, as usual, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics made typical baseless claims, stating that 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we did nothing for 16 years.  He shamelessly claimed that only under this Government, there has 
<br/>been major reforms by public enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What reforms, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is he talking about? What we are witnessing now are quick 
<br/>fixes,  cosmetic  changes,  like  rebranding  bizFIJI  to  businessNOW.  Is  this  what  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government calls ‘reform’? The truth is that the Bainimarama-led Government spearheaded the real 
<br/>reforms with the enactment of the Public Enterprises Act 2019, which sets up the robust governance 
<br/>framework of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and this can be confirmed by the Asian Development 
<br/>Bank’s Report on co-funding balance 2023 which very clearly stated that Fiji’s SOEs performance 
<br/>was one of the best in the region for 2015 to 2020. That was largely due to the reforms that were 
<br/>undertaken.  Often, there is a misconception when we talk about privatisation. The misconception is 
<br/>that if we undertake privatisation, we will lose control of the Government companies and also the 
<br/>assets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reforms we introduced restored confidence in the governance of Public Enterprises by 
<br/>giving  opportunities  for  Public  Private  Partnership  (PPP),  for  example,  FNPF.    Sir,  FNPF’s 
<br/>investment in Fiji Ports Corporation Limited, for the first time in an infrastructure area as part of the 
<br/>PPP Programme, we have seen FNPF’s acquisition of 39 percent shares. It not only protected national 
<br/>interests, but also contributed towards high returns that FNPF members are receiving. That is what 
<br/>long-term investments look like. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must not forget the disastrous experiments with privatisations that took 
<br/>place during the SVT government. I want to emphasise because that was the era when privatisation 
<br/>and corporatisation took off. During that period, we saw several public assets sold off or lost forever. 
<br/>This is the stark reminder of what happens when privatisation is handled, not responsibly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first wave of Public Sector Reforms targeted key state enterprises in 1990, for example, 
<br/>the Post and Telecommunication Department was corporatised as Fiji Post and Telecommunications 
<br/>Limited which later split into Telecom Fiji Limited and Post Fiji Limited. What followed was the 
<br/>sale of majority shares in Telecom Fiji, again a big mistake.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  the  corporatisation  of  IKA  Corporation  and  National  Trading  Corporation 
<br/>collapsed soon after.  The Government Shipyard and public slipways which is also now under Assets 
<br/>Fiji  also  suffered  from  this  reckless  push  towards  privatisation.  Once  corporatised,  it  was  then 
<br/>privatised, only to be nationalised again when privatisation failed miserably.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government Shipyard had a very good ship building capacity. Building 
<br/>vessels for Blue Lagoon Cruises, Kiribati Government and even built </span><span>Reef Endeavour</span><span> for Captain 
<br/>Cook Cruises of Australia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building of </span><span>Reef Endeavour</span><span> became one of the biggest disasters in the history of shipyard. 
<br/>The Reef Endeavour Project started in 1989 with an initial cost of AUS$7.7 million ballooned to $22 
<br/>million  by  the  time  it  was  completed  in  1996.    This  disaster  lack  to  severe  financial  losses.  The 
<br/>Government decided to sell 51 percent of Government Shipyard to a $2 New Zealand company, a 
<br/>move that led to a disposal of public assets. Later the Government had no choice but to buy back the 
<br/></span><span>51 percent shares when the company went into receivership leaving the State with about $9 million 
<br/></span><span>in liabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji had to learn the hard way, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we have. All these disastrous privatisation 
<br/>happened when Fiji saw some of the most valuable assets lost for ever. Let us not forget, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, that under the same Government,  Fiji  lost its National Bank of  Fiji  (Fiji’s only  bank) due to 
<br/>mismanagement or corruption you can call it, at a cost of about $220 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2029 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government decided to sell 51percent of the National Bank of Fiji which was our only 
<br/>bank  to  Colonial  Mutual  Life  Assurance  for  only  $9.8  million  and  later  in  2005  the  Qarase 
<br/>Government sold the balance of the 49 percent stake for $28 million. We lost the bank completely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA. –Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the reviewed 
<br/>Report of Asset Fiji Limited (AFL). Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Premila Kumar has highlighted 
<br/>the background, I will go straight to the recommendations in the Report. The old recommendations 
<br/>are noted, and the Ministry of Public Enterprises undertakes to carry out  the necessary actions as 
<br/>recommended by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first recommendation, Sir, AFL should work closely with relevant authorities to expedite 
<br/>the vesting of pending  land titles  from  Fiji  Ports Corporation Limited (FPCL) and Fiji  Ships  and 
<br/>Heavy Industries Ltd, finalising this transaction to enable AFL to fully integrate these assets into its 
<br/>portfolio to increase the company’s overall value.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That recommendation is noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As alluded earlier and also highlighted by 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar, the land asset of FPCL and Fiji Ships and Heavy Industries Ltd were 
<br/>transferred to AFL following the divestment transaction.  The exercise commenced in 2016 and so 
<br/>far, 37 land titles have been vested to AFL.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  present,  only  five  land  titles  are  yet  to  be  vested.  During  the  vesting 
<br/>exercise, it was noted, that the original titles of these properties could not be located.  Thus, AFL is 
<br/>actively working with the management team of FPCL to coordinate the surveys of the properties  
<br/>before lodging the plans with the relevant authorities to issue new titles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL also conducts a valuation exercise of the land assets every five years.  
<br/>In fact, in 2017, the market valuation assessed the land assets at $57.3million. The land was re-valued 
<br/>in 2022 and noted the valuation of the land had gone to $84.3 million, which resulted in a revaluation 
<br/>surplus of $24.3million in 2022 financials.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second recommendation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rental income generated from AFL’s real 
<br/>estate portfolio is currently below expectations. So, AFL should consider renegotiating this rental 
<br/>agreement to ensure that the rental rates reflect their market value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While this is being done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the native landowners are also putting their hands 
<br/>up for the onward transfer of these land to the original owners. The Committee recommendation is 
<br/>noted and Mr. Speaker, Sir, AFL’s rental income is currently below the market rate as the company 
<br/>is constrained by the terms outlined in the lease agreements which permits rental increase up to 30 
<br/>percent every five years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It should be noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that many of these long term leases and lease agreements 
<br/>were inherited from FPCL, however, AFL is currently conducting its due diligence to resolve that 
<br/>challenge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a contribution to the motion that 
<br/></span><span>is before the Parliament and that is for Parliament to note the Committee Review Report on the Assets 
<br/></span><span>Fiji PTE Limited Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have nothing further much to say, rather the Committee has rather a limited scope of our 
<br/>debate given the layout of the Report has only two findings and most of the findings has been read 
<br/>by  the  mover  of  the  motion  herself  and  also  honourable  Kumar.  The  recommendation  has  been 
<br/>touched  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister.    I  suggest  that  probably  in  future  to  improve  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>2030 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – AFL 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information and to also improve the Report, if some verbatim too can be part of the Report to allow 
<br/>us, before we go into the debate, the information that actually, the questions and what was answered 
<br/>by  those  organisations,  so  it  gives  honourable  Members  to  prepare  for  debate.  I  also  noted  after 
<br/>checking with the Secretariat during lunch hour that the Committee was not even privy to a hard 
<br/>copy, and they only worked on a soft copy that was provided by this particular company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the reporting year is 2016 to 2019. To take you back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, given what  
<br/>honourable  Premila  Kumar  has  gone  back  over  the  years,  pointing  fingers  to  the  previous 
<br/>government. But again, this particular organisation was established in 2015 and you know very well 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  during  that  time  when  we  were  in  the  Opposition,  we  queried  this  question  of 
<br/>divestment  when  the  issue  of  Aitken  Spence  came  to  buy  our  ports  from  Fiji  Ports  Corporation 
<br/>Limited. We were not consulted, there was not much consultation done. We only heard about the 
<br/>divestment when it was brought into that particular budget in 2015 and 2016.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And probably over the years, now nearly nine years. I would suggest a review should be done 
<br/>to relook at the arrangements done then, given that we had to protect our sovereignty. Given these 
<br/>are our assets, the Fijian Government’s assets. It is now in this particular company the assets as per 
<br/>land but as divestment in terms of the commercial activities is run by those companies. Some of them 
<br/>are foreign companies from Sri Lanka. We only earn in terms of the leases that are there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Probably  we  should  review  some  of  those  arrangement  to  see  whether  we  are  getting 
<br/>maximum returns from  this  or we  can make other choices to  see that  we  can properly use those. 
<br/>Those decisions were done by the FijiFirst Government, but it is up to the Coalition Government to 
<br/>review this. Given it is about 10 years, we need to see if the arrangements still benefits us or those 
<br/>that are benefiting from it now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will also remember questioning this company called the Government 
<br/>Printery on how it was closed down or given out to some other private companies who are now doing 
<br/>government diverse, outsource to these private contractors like Star Printery et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  were  some  questions  during  that  time  about  political  association,  affiliations  and 
<br/>beneficiaries.  They were probably friends of some of the members of the previous government but 
<br/>some  of  the  things  that  could  be  revisited  and  reviewed  in  terms  of  relooking  at  these  assets, 
<br/>especially  government  printing  and  how  we  can  revive  this  which  could  lessen  government 
<br/>expenditure. Those are few things that I suggest to government to take on board, things that happen 
<br/>during the reported year as I had alluded to and also responding to honourable Premila Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  so  much  has  been  said.  Fingers  pointed  at  the 
<br/>previous  government.  The  government  before  that,  in  fact,  I  spent  some  time  in  the  Opposition 
<br/>pondering over this, and one of the issues that we were kind of confused with was in the way the 
<br/>motions were brought in, all the recommendations were brought in by the FijiFirst Government, and 
<br/>that is selling of shares and the divestment of shares. We were all informed in this august Parliament, 
<br/>we have not transferred any shares, we had just divested the shares.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Did  it  spoke  about  the  same  thing  or  is  it  different?    But  this  was  the  message  that  was 
<br/></span><span>provided to us when we queried, and that caused a lot of grey areas on our path as to how best we 
<br/></span><span>can understand what is happening to Government assets. So, that will be best answered by people 
<br/>who  know  best,  either  they  are  chartered  accountants  or  economists,  because  they  would  better 
<br/>understand these two different words and that even happened with the divestment of the shares in the 
<br/>FEA when it was sold in Singapore  or transferred. So, I wanted to add that so as to provide you, 
<br/>honourable Members, with some of the words that confused us a lot. So now, I open the floor to the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2031 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thank you for the opportunity  to 
<br/>provide some commentary on the Assets of Fiji Pte Limited General Reports from 2016-2019. But 
<br/>before I do, since a lot of points have been addressed, I will just spend a bit of time in addressing 
<br/>some of the comments frivolously made in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  was  by  my  colleague,  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  when  talking  about  the  National 
<br/>Pornography Taskforce in saying we are taking too much time and have not done much. Sometimes, 
<br/>I feel the other side of Parliament get forgetful very quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The reality with the 
<br/>National Pornography Taskforce and there are a few other major national issues when it comes to 
<br/>issues of national importance, that the other side of Parliament did very little with or even zero.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember, the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection begging at that time in 
<br/>Parliament,  that  something  be  done  about  national  pornography.  And  what  did  that  side  of  the 
<br/>Parliament do? Absolutely nothing! Some of these national issues need political whips, and all I can 
<br/>say to that side of the Parliament, be assured this side of the Parliament has the political whip and we 
<br/>will address all the problems that we have inherited because it needs political will to solve. And one 
<br/>of them is of course this issue that is in front of us, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is a structured approach 
<br/>and, oh, he is back! And we will deal with it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second commentary I would like to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always accusations 
<br/>about taskforces being created and I am one of the culprits.  I would just like to offer this counsel to 
<br/>my learned colleagues, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The difference between that side of the Parliament, that 
<br/>was run by two people, and this side is that we collaborate and we listen, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.– We collaborated and we listened, so that is the big change 
<br/>that is  happening  in  our  country, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We  actually  seek opinions.   If we look  at  the 
<br/>taskforce, it is very big, it is actually too big, but that is okay because that is the nature of what we 
<br/>are dealing with. It is a national issue, we need a national conversation and then move forward. So, 
<br/>collaborate and listen, you will learn something from it, honourable Ketan Lal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will address the business now, on the very flippant comment about business, now. Firstly, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we rebranded it to be fair, but it was an initial initiative by the FijiFirst Government 
<br/>which we have taken on. But the semantics when it comes to the rebranding. What is important is, 
<br/>we are actually moving forward with the business now. We have just launched the first automation 
<br/>of a business process in Government which is starting a business, the honourable Koya will know 
<br/>this very well and we are about to do the building permits. In terms of ease of doing business, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, these are very significant actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very briefly with regard to Assets Fiji Limited, the significant thing, I think 
<br/>that comes from the Report that was done by the Committee, is that the returns are low and that needs 
<br/></span><span>to be worked on. The honourable Prime Minister just mentioned that the property revaluation went 
<br/></span><span>from $57 million to $84 million.  So, in other words, if you take the $3 million return after tax as a 
<br/>percentage of the current valuation, we are looking at well below 5 percent return on assets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The challenge on this side of Parliament is, how do we unlock the potential of these large 
<br/>assets that sits within Assets Fiji Limited?  Of course, will be left to the Board and the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister who leads the public enterprise, I am sure will be very keen to ensure that we start to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>get better returns. An interesting point, the total assets right now for public enterprises is about $9 
<br/>billion. You have to ask the question, in that $9 billion, does every single asset in that $9 billion are 
<br/>they of the good returns? Probably the answer is, as with Assets Fiji Limited, no, and of course we 
<br/>wholeheartedly support the recommendations by the Committee and look forward to more returns 
<br/>being generated by Assets Fiji Limited. I thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I would like to thank all honourable Members  who 
<br/>have contributed  to the debate and we look forward to Assets Fiji Limited doing its part and taking 
<br/>necessary steps and actions in the implementation of the Report.  We also look forward to the Reports 
<br/>from 2020 onwards, with that, I thank you Mr. Speaker, Sir.
