<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>INVESTMENT FIJI 2019-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Investment Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report 2019-2020 and 2021-2022 which was tabled on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, I am honoured to present the overview 
<br/>of the Review Report for Investment Fiji Annual Reports 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investment Fiji was established in 1980 under the Economic Development Board Act Number 
<br/>11. It serves as Fiji’s Trade and Investment Promotion Agency, with the primary goal of promoting, 
<br/>stimulating and facilitating economic development in the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee acknowledges positive developments in the Reports and identified areas that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>require improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  commends  Investment  Fiji  for  successfully  developing  a  3-Year  Strategic 
<br/>Plan, that aligns with its new role, as outlined in the new Investment Fiji Act 2022 passed on 7</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>April, 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  expressed  its  concern  that  the  Annual  Reports  did  not  contain  any 
<br/>performance matrix alignment with the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), making it difficult to 
<br/>thoroughly assess the performance of Investment Fiji.  However, when requested, Investment Fiji 
<br/>did provide the performance matrix which could have been included in the Report from the outset.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  also  noted  that  Investment  Fiji  did  not  report  on  the  relevant  Sustainable 
<br/>Development  Goals,  which  is  a  mandatory  requirement  for  all  Annual  Reports  presented  to 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Committee recognizes the progress made in specific activities, such as the number 
<br/>of trade missions and investment promotions conducted, the Report lacks detailed information on the 
<br/>level  of  interest  these  activities  generated  and  how  these  interests,  if  any,  translated  into  actual 
<br/>investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the importance of tangible data and reliable statistics relating to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations of Investment Fiji, which hinders comprehensive evaluation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee expresses concern about the failure to report on the expected targets verses 
<br/>actual achievements, which is necessary to justify the budget reallocations provided to Investment 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>The Committee observed that Recommendation 6 of the previous Committee Report on full 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disclosure of data and key information is not fully implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to the Chief Executive Officer of Investment Fiji, Mr. Kamal 
<br/>Chetty, and his staff for their timely assistance in this inquiry on answering various questions raised 
<br/>by the Committee through face to face public hearing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank our Committee Members and Alternate Members who were part of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the team that produced this Report – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hon.  S. Tubuna - Chairperson; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hon. P.D. Kumar;  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hon. T.N. Tunabuna; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hon. A. Bia; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Hon. P. Ravunawa.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the Secretariat for their invaluable support in the preparation of this Report.  Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, I thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list with me provided by the Whips. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of External Trade, Cooperatives, Micro, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, because it is fairly late in the day, I will try and be 
<br/>short. In any event, Sir, I want to thank the Committee on the Report that has been tabled.  In terms 
<br/>of  the  recommendations,  at  first  glance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  fairly  innocuous  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>recommendations that have been given, but there are a couple of things that stand out and need to be 
<br/>vented so as that we actually make it better in the next time that we are reporting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  has  actually  reported  on  implementation  and  outcomes  of  the  three-year 
<br/>strategic plan that Investment Fiji has, and it has to come through the Annual Report.  I think we 
<br/>must also come to a realisation that this particular Report comes on the back of COVID-19. So very 
<br/>little activity and a lot may have gone on some things may have been missed.  I take my hat off also 
<br/>to the team led by Mr. Chetty   at Investment Fiji; very young team, they have done extremely well. 
<br/>We must always look at Investment Fiji as one of our premier most institution, Sir, because it is at 
<br/>the forefront of what we are trying to do in terms of Fiji being a premier investment destination.  The 
<br/>minute it had turned into an investment promotion agency, there are certain things that we need to 
<br/>make sure that we keep a check on, and these reports are vital in terms of getting that done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am grateful that the performance matrix was actually handed in and now they have learnt a 
<br/>lesson.  It ought to have been given in the first place. In terms of SDGs, I think it is also every other 
<br/>institution  has  actually  put  in,  whether  they  are  compliant  with  SDGs  and  that  is  important  to 
<br/>Government also as a whole and in Fiji we do that. I think Investment Fiji should ensure that actually 
<br/>that gets done in all the reports that we do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things that we need to realise, Sir, is that one of the only tools that 
<br/></span><span>Investment  Fiji  has,  is  actually  trade  missions  and  investment  promotions,  et  cetera  that  they  do.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>2042 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When they do that, because this is a taxpayers’ money, we need to ensure that we report back.  There 
<br/>is the back to office report to find out how good it is, what has actually transpired, have we been able 
<br/>to ensure that it was effective, and all these activities need to be evaluated.  With the information that 
<br/>is provided, it allows us to closely monitor what actually is good for us and what is not.  When we 
<br/>do  these  missions,  the  data  and  the  level  of  interest  generated,  et  cetera  needs  to  be  quantified 
<br/>somewhere so that the Committees that look at it say, “well this is worthwhile, that is not worthwhile” 
<br/>and it can be openly discussed in Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said all that, Sir, because it was post-COVID, I think they may have been a lot of 
<br/>budgetary restrictions that Investment Fiji had. I know the honourable Minister for Finance is not but 
<br/>I will plead with the Minister responsible that in order for Fiji to be promoting itself as a premier 
<br/>destination for investment purposes, I think the Minister may need to also see if we can actually get 
<br/>Investment  Fiji  more  money  to  be  able  to  do  their  activities  that  is  designed  to  do.    I  know  that 
<br/>previously it was a bit difficult because of COVID-19 but I think we are in a better and healthier 
<br/>position to be able to do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as an investment promotion agency also, we need to be making sure that 
<br/>we are accountable for everything that we do, the trade missions are going overseas.  Most recently, 
<br/>I think the honourable Minister took a mission up to North America which I understand was fairly 
<br/>successfully, but we would love to see the data on that at a later stage obviously. These are things 
<br/>that need to be included in the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Glaring amiss, as I said earlier was the misnomer one in terms of SDGs, it is an important 
<br/>tool.  Mr. Speaker is always ensuring that we actually do that but in short, I think it is a fairly good 
<br/>report that actually come out, but I would urge the Government to see if we can give Investment Fiji 
<br/>a whole lot more dollars for it to be able to succeed and do what it does.  It stands at the forefront, 
<br/>and I have been on these trade missions myself, just post-COVID especially with Expo 2020 and also 
<br/>out in Portugal with respect to the outsourcing industry. In terms of Government doing all that it can, 
<br/>in terms of diversification, this is the agency that needs to be empowered to be able to sell Fiji in 
<br/>terms of all that we need to do to become bigger and better.  With those few words, I totally agree 
<br/>with the Report, and I wish the Investment Fiji team well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide comments in terms of the 
<br/>debate on the Investment Fiji Annual Reports for 2019 to 2020 and 2021 to 2022.  Firstly, Sir, as the 
<br/>Minister responsible, it is obvious that there was one year that was missed from the tabling which is 
<br/>the  2020  to  2021  reports.    So,  I  will  take  that  on  myself  to  ensure  that  that  is  tabled  in-house  as 
<br/>quickly as possible, to ensure that we keep in train with the tabling of reports in a timely manner but 
<br/>also make sure in a complete sense as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for providing the consolidated report 
<br/>after conducting a review of the relevant Annual Reports.  I think stepping back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>just in terms of the economic climate that we are currently facing, you would have heard the remarks 
<br/>of the honourable Gavoka about the revision upwards of the economic growth in the country.  It is 
<br/>now  at  3.4  percent  which  is  very  positive.  I  suspect  if  we  keep  on  doing  what  we  are  doing,  we 
<br/>probably might go to 4 percent, but certainly into next year, all going well, I am expecting a much 
<br/></span><span>stronger economic growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is also on the back of a very strong investment  pipeline, and it is a 
<br/>credit to  Investment  Fiji in terms of following up on investments.  As has been mentioned in the 
<br/>House, the Fijian pipeline is now at $6 billion, and there are more opportunities coming at us. It is 
<br/>about 185 projects in total and what the other side of the House will start seeing is a roll out of these 
<br/>projects.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2043 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sofitel Vatutalei Project has started already, they are now starting to build up, so that will 
<br/>create a lot of momentum. There is also another hotel that is going to be announced shortly Sir, in 
<br/>the West.   These are the types of projects that are coming at us, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and augurs well 
<br/>for the economy, augurs well for the country and of course, I do not need to talk about the Google 
<br/>entry, I do not need to talk about commercial agriculture ventures of Fiji Water.  These are type of 
<br/>diversification initiatives that are coming through Investment Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Reports themselves, I think it is fair to say that over this period there was a 
<br/>transition in Investment Fiji and that probably explains why there was a bit of a paucity of information 
<br/>apart from COVID-19 as eloquently articulated by the honourable Koya. There was also the fact that 
<br/>they were, credit to FijiFirst, we were transitioning Investment Fiji from being a regulatory agency, 
<br/>in other words, more policing focussed, to an investment promotion agency. That happened on 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August, 2022, and I am certain that going forward, the reports that will come from Investment Fiji 
<br/>will be a lot more comprehensive and detailed in terms of the information that was lacking from the 
<br/>Reports that were mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  terms  of  what  the  Committee  alluded  to  regarding  trade  missions, 
<br/>understanding what interest was there in terms of investments, you would have heard me updating 
<br/>the House about the hundreds of millions that have been generating through the trade missions.  That 
<br/>will actually find its way into the reports hopefully, Mr. Speaker so that we get a bit more granularity 
<br/>in terms of what we actually see in terms of the reporting from Investment Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also concur with the reporting on SDGs and that was a fair comment. I know that the Chief 
<br/>Executive and his team will actually ensure that the future reports actually do have SDGs mentioned.  
<br/>One  of  the  things  that  I  thought  I  would  just  share  with  the  House  as  well,  some  of  the  positive 
<br/>changes that we brought into being. When we started, there was something called the Investment 
<br/>Facilitation Committee that was in existence, but perhaps not operating fully fledged and this, Sir, is 
<br/>a conglomeration of all the agencies that are important for investment.  We are now meeting at least 
<br/>at the minimum once every two months, it is chaired by either myself or the Permanent Secretary.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  we  are  doing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  actually  drilling  down  on  key  investment 
<br/>opportunities and try to unlock bottlenecks.  We are doing this, Sir, because right now as we know, 
<br/>we are still in the process of trying to improve the ease of doing business in Fiji.  So, this is being 
<br/>done and we are starting to see a lot of good results from it, a lot of positive comments.  Everyone is 
<br/>on the same page, from the FRA, to EFL, to FRCS.  We are all in the same room together, so there 
<br/>is the ability to resolve a lot of issues regarding investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have given the Investment Facilitation Committee a challenge, Sir, we will get to a stage 
<br/>and I am hoping that the Committee will no longer have to meet because we will have a fully digitised 
<br/>systems and so the need to actually have committee meetings to try and fix things will ultimately go 
<br/>away.  That is kind of where we headed, Sir, in terms of Investment Fiji and its performance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, there is a lot of work going on with Tourism Fiji.  As we know tourism in our 
<br/>country is very hot at the moment and there is a lot of hotel projects that are on the cusp of going to 
<br/>breaking ground.  You will see the honourable Prime Minister getting very busy with some of the 
<br/></span><span>openings; one in Nadi very shortly.  These are the types of opportunities that are there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Google is on its way to Fiji, Sir, and there will be some exciting announcements later this 
<br/>year.  These are the types of opportunities that we are starting to unlock through Investment Fiji and 
<br/>the future, Sir, for the country from an economic perspective, if I do say so myself is rather bright 
<br/>and with the right disciplines, we continue with the focus that we are focusing on, there are some 
<br/>very good times ahead.

<div><span>C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, for the first time in the country, the Prime Minister’s Business Awards that will 
<br/>be done annually, we will have a category for the iTaukei Provincial Councils; first time.  What does 
<br/>that mean, Sir?  There is a pivot to ensure that over the next few years, the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> economy starts to 
<br/>grow.   If  we unlock that potential, Sir, our country will grow in  leaps and bounds.   We own the 
<br/>resources; we just need to match that up with the right capital mix and we will be on our way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a lot of positive things happening, Sir, I congratulate Investment Fiji for their reports, 
<br/>we do note that there are some things that they need to do better, which I will ensure as their line 
<br/>Minister that are done, but I thank the Committee once again for the Report and I fully support the 
<br/>motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I very briefly contribute to the debate, I think 
<br/>few  minutes  ago  our  baby  Flying  Fijians,  our  Under  18  have  won  their  second  game  against  the 
<br/>Australian Under 18.  Certainly, congratulations to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee for the Report, and I certainly concur with the sentiments that has been 
<br/>expressed already.  Yes, Investment Fiji is an important institution for Fiji.  I had the honour to Chair 
<br/>it for two years when it was the Fiji Trade and Investment Bureau, I think it was called then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just would like to look at the issue of the labour force and the correlation 
<br/>connection that the labour force has with, trying to get companies and people to come and invest into 
<br/>the country.  Reading through the review Report, trying to find that connection, we have been talking 
<br/>about brain drain in this Camber in past sittings, and it is a reality that the fluidity and movement of 
<br/>our mobile labour force is really on the go.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important for Investment Fiji as they go out and try and attract investors to come to Fiji, 
<br/>to  ensure that they coordinate with  all the other agencies that are watching this movement  of the 
<br/>labour force, to ensure that when they come to Fiji to invest, they are not faced with the shortage of 
<br/>labour where they do not have the exact skill sets that they would love to employ in order to set up 
<br/>their business in Fiji.  It is just a minor point or perhaps a major point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I would 
<br/>like to add to this debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee for the Report and certainly some very worthwhile recommendations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the Ministry in the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my contribution to the debate on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Consolidated Review Report of Investment Fiji Annual Report  2019-2020 and 2021-2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to acknowledge the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for 
<br/>its deliberation on the Annual Reports. As an investment arm of Government, Investment Fiji plays 
<br/>an extremely critical role in the health of our economy.  No matter what sector we stand to represent 
<br/>in  this  august  House, we recognise the imperative of having  a driving body that not  only  attracts 
<br/>interests from potential investors but ensures that they are realised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the weekend at the Fiji Tourism Convention, the CEO of Investment 
<br/></span><span>Fiji highlighted that Investment Fiji is supporting 185 projects at the moment; 83 are in construction, 
<br/></span><span>35 in trade development and 67 in conceptual stages.  As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications noted, 
<br/>because they are at a very young stage, their realisation on the ground too varies.  I ask everyone for 
<br/>their support and ensure the completion of all these projects.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2045 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, let me highlight some of the opportunities and issues in tourism, 
<br/>relative to investments.  We all know that tourism is one of the leading sectors, and although driven 
<br/>by  accommodation,  it  is  a  mix  with  other  tourism-related  offerings  -  retirement  villages,  medical 
<br/>tourism, sports tourism and glamping. These are excellent opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 45 projects that once realised, will bring in 3,500 rooms.  
<br/>Some of these are already under construction.  With Fiji Airways now expanding rapidly, this is very 
<br/>much welcomed.  As you know, Mr. Speaker, there is a mismatch between the Airline inventory in 
<br/>terms of number of seats and the ground inventory in terms of rooms - hotel beds. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Fiji Tourism Convention, we noted that, firstly, for domestic investors, 
<br/>one of the hardest things is to get approvals on investment. However, Investment Fiji’s role now as 
<br/>an investment promotion agency and the establishment of the Investment Facilitation Committee, I 
<br/>know has helped a lot in navigating bottlenecks. Also, the Sub-Committee is doing exceptionally 
<br/>well in these areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the Convention, there was the usual concern about immigration, and 
<br/>the RESET Sub-Committee is doing quite a great job on this.  And the numbers that was shared by 
<br/>the Chairman of the RESET Sub-Committee, kind of, blown us away. I do not remember the exact 
<br/>number, but it was something like 800 applicants or work permits almost every month. When you 
<br/>look at figures like that and the backlog that we have which has improved now, you just begin to 
<br/>wonder, something must be happening in this country that is attracting all these applications.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium 
<br/>Enterprises  and  Communications  has  indicated,  the  economy  is  growing  very,  very  well,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, and the 3.4 could actually become much higher come the end of the year. So, when you see 
<br/>all those applicants for work permits, it is a good sign - it is positive for the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, land and resource owners want to play a great role, calling for equity partnerships 
<br/>and the Coalition Government has a range of facilities to encourage this. This came out very strongly 
<br/>during the Convention, Mr. Speaker, the resource owners want to play a part in equity’s involvement 
<br/>in tourism. Bodies such as the Fiji Indigenous Business Council (FIBC) and the Resource Owners 
<br/>Council, play a big role in facilitating meaningful partnerships.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this body is being revived under the Coalition Government. You may recall 
<br/>the FIBC used to be a very robust body back in those days and it was badly impacted over the last 
<br/>couple of years, reducing the membership quite drastically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Advocacy is critical to resource owners who really want to invest in the tourism industry, and 
<br/>they need to be industry ready. We will be preparing them, as many have the aspiration but not the 
<br/>know-how.  There is a lot of interest from resource-owners.  It was quite welcomed to see the number 
<br/>of resource owners who participated in the Convention, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The need for investment in supporting infrastructure.  As we build more rooms, the pressure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on other sectors - infrastructure and utilities, increases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stakeholders raise the supply chain issue and cost remains a challenge for outer islands and 
<br/>remote areas. In agriculture, I have asked my colleague, the honourable Minister for Agriculture, for 
<br/>more intense involvement in tourism.  We have about a million visitors forecasted to arrive this year, 
<br/>and  in  the  future  years,  so  we  need  to  feed  these  million  visitors,  and  we  can  do  that  from  local 
<br/>producers.

<div><span>C/Review Report – Investment Fiji 2019-2022 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Limitation in investment was another matter. Concerns were raised on whether we should 
<br/>allow for 300 room hotels in the outer islands. I think some people are concerned about building 
<br/>resorts in the outer islands, but to combat such questions, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the ability of tourism 
<br/>to reverse the migration from the outer islands to the urban areas.

<div><span>As we know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been publicly noted that some islanders are now street 
<br/>dwellers and most live as squatters in informal settlements, creating all sorts of social challenges. 
<br/>Tourism is largely rural based, and those idyllic islands can be home to some well-planned exotic 
<br/>resorts.  Such developments can provide economic opportunities for islanders who will visit the cities 
<br/>only to shop and the likes, instead of relocating wholesale as we currently see today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  had  an  international  guest  speaker  from  SCAF  Advisory,  a 
<br/>Canadian company, who shared, based on their research, tourism and hotel investors having a great 
<br/>deal  of  choice  in  which  destination  they  will  risk  their  capital.  But  Fiji,  is  doing  well,  attracting 
<br/>investors as we see today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A phenomenon, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that he shared with us was the Saudi Arabia phenomena. 
<br/>Saudi Tourism is investing up to trillions in the tourism industry, effectively pulling many investors 
<br/>away from other parts of the world into Saudi Arabia. This Canadian gentleman said even in Canada, 
<br/>they feel this. Such is the impact of the trillions that the Saudis are spending on their tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those who play golf will know that now Saudi Golf, has virtually taken over from other 
<br/>established golfing fraternity worldwide. If you watch boxing, most of the big bouts now are staged 
<br/>in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Such is the pull of Saudi Arabia in developing its tourism and sports. So, it 
<br/>is a phenomenon that we need to understand. It could play a big role. It could impact on the  way 
<br/>investors move around the region also.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>` 
<br/>I concur with the Committee’s findings on ensuring we set concrete KPIs and continuously 
<br/>report on our performance. Every statutory body should, but you should also recognise the fast-paced 
<br/>environment we are in, and the rigid matrix may not capture all forms of success.  So, the road ahead 
<br/>is quite long.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  I  would  like  to  conclude  by  thanking  the  Investment  Fiji’s  Chairperson,  Ms.  Jenny 
<br/>Seeto, and CEO, Mr. Kamal Chetty, for their continued efforts in positioning us as an investment 
<br/>destination of choice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you,  once  again,  to  the  Committee  for  your  deliberations.    I  am  certain  under  my 
<br/>colleague, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications’ guidance, that Investment Fiji will continue to progress 
<br/>as an agency so critical for Fiji. Thank you and </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Deputy  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic Affairs to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been well expressed how important Investment 
<br/></span><span>Fiji is to the economic growth. I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his commitment to improving, 
<br/></span><span>not only the Annual Report, but ensuring that Investment Fiji is robust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism 
<br/>and Civil Aviation also for sharing the different opportunities that lay out there and specifically in 
<br/>tourism. I  would like to  thank other honourable  Members for their  contributions, and  I hope that
