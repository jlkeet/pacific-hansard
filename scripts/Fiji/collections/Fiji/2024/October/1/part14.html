<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I am honoured to present 
<br/>the overview of Assets Fiji Pte Limited 2016 to 2019 Annual Report.  The Standing Committee on 
<br/>Economic Affairs tabled its Consolidated Review Report on Assets Fiji Pte Limited on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> September, 
<br/>2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee commends Assets Fiji Pte Limited (AFL) for the handling of its assets during 
<br/>the period under review.  The Committee acknowledges the successful vesting of 35 land titles, which 
<br/>are strategically located near Lautoka, Levuka and Suva Port areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  independent  valuation  of  assets  underscores  AFL’s  ability  to  manage  its  real  estate 
<br/>portfolio.  While reviewing AFL’s Reports, the Committee identified some pertinent issues which 
<br/>were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee expressed concern on the low rental yield generated from the asset portfolio 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>valued at over $57 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>While  some  were  compensated  by  higher  dividend  provided  by  Fiji  Ports  Corporation 
<br/>Limited, the Government Printery and Stationery Department has been a non-performing 
<br/>entity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted that an independent external valuer conducted a valuation of all land 
<br/>vested into the company on 10</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2017.  The valuation was based on market value, 
<br/>however, land title spending was not included in the fair value assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee noted that Government grants were continuously issued to AFL from 2016 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 2019 to support its operations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Committee strongly suggests that AFL should work closely with relevant authorities 
<br/>to expedite the vesting of 10 pending land titles from Fiji Ports Limited and Fiji Ships and 
<br/>Heavy Industries Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finalising these transactions will enable AFL to fully integrate these assets into its portfolio 
<br/>to increase the company’s overall value.  I would like to thank the honourable Assistant Minister in 
<br/>the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  honourable  P.D.  Kumar,  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways, honourable A. Bia, and the Secretariat staff for their invaluable support 
<br/>in preparing this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>I have a list with me that has been supplied by the honourable Whips.  Before I go straight to that, I 
<br/>would like to just allow this time for the undertaking of housekeeping matters.  For the purpose of 
<br/>complying with Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now call upon the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion. 
<br/></span></div>
