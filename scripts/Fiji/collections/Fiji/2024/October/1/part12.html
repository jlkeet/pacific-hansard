<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to give 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate  Change, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environment, Climate Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Cooperatives, Micro, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministers  may  speak  for  up  to  20  minutes.    After  the  Minister,  I  will  then  invite  the 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. 
<br/>There will also be a response from the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to speak for five 
<br/>minutes.  There will be no other debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development of the Foreign Policy White Paper (FPWP) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- </span><span>Ni sa bula vina’a</span><span> and a very good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, Sir, may I also greet those who are watching us on livestream and those listening 
<br/>in  on  the  radio.  I,  together  with  you,  Sir,  also  acknowledge  the  presence  in  the  gallery  of  the 
<br/>Honourable  Leone  Bignall,  Member  of  Parliament  and  Speaker  of  the  House  of  Assembly  and 
<br/>Member for Mawson in the Parliament of South Australia; the Deputy High Commissioner of the 
<br/></span><span>Australian High Commission, Ms. Clair McNamara; and Ms. Rebecca Brown, First Secretary in the 
<br/></span><span>Australian High Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  apologise  to  honourable  Tunabuna  for  cutting  in  on  his  question  on  this  subject.  I 
<br/>believe, Sir, that the Ministerial Statement would answer his question better, so I have asked that this 
<br/></span><span>Ministerial Statement be made instead of his question.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the important steps that the Coalition Government took since coming into office is to 
<br/>put in place important rebuilding blocks that provide clarity, direction and certainty for Fiji and its 
<br/>people. Foreign policy is one of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier in the year, I mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs wants to produce Fiji’s 
<br/>Foreign Policy White Paper, to develop a document that will articulate Fiji’s Foreign Policy priorities 
<br/>and  guide  its  international  engagements  in  the  next  decade.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the 
<br/>formulation,  a  whole-of-Government  process  was  activated  and  the  views  of  the  Ministries  and 
<br/>agencies and entities outside of the public sector were also incorporated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  reference  group  was  also  engaged,  comprising  renowned  persons  who  are  current  and 
<br/>former diplomats, former Permanent Secretaries, former Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministers and 
<br/>diplomats, leaders and scholars in foreign relations with longstanding experience at national, regional 
<br/>and international levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Steering Committee, also led by the Permanent Secretary for Foreign 
<br/>Affairs, was established with the support of a technical advisor who was engaged to provide expert 
<br/>support.  The expert, Professor Peter Varghese, is the Chancellor of the Queensland University, a 
<br/>former diplomat and a former Secretary of Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and External 
<br/>Trade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs allocated six months for this project.  I am 
<br/>pleased to inform the House that the project was completed on time that culminated on Monday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>September, 2024, when I launched Fiji’s Foreign Policy White Paper at the Grand Pacific Hotel, with 
<br/>invitations extended to all Members of this august House.  This is a first for Fiji and the launch was 
<br/>a landmark occasion in Fiji’s history, and I thank all honourable Members who came to that launch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I elaborate on the White Paper, I would like to take this opportunity 
<br/>to  welcome  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Finance,  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for 
<br/>Foreign Affairs, the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc, on their return after representing 
<br/>Fiji to the 79</span><span>th</span><span> United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).  I know that having returned from their 
<br/>respective engagements at the high level forums of UNGA, they would be pleased with Fiji’s first 
<br/>ever Foreign Policy White Paper.  Very soon, Fiji’s Permanent Representative to the UN (PRUN) 
<br/>will be visiting the country and will be available for briefing for all Members of Parliament who are 
<br/>interested in the functioning of the various organisations under the United Nations for our general 
<br/>education and information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I had mentioned during the launch, the White Paper outlines the path that Fiji will follow 
<br/>to  meet  the complex foreign  policy landscape and its challenges that we face  as a nation.  It  is  a 
<br/>definitive statement of the Government’s foreign policy and Fiji’s place in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the White Paper explains how Fiji sees itself and how we wish to present 
<br/>ourselves  to  the  world.    It  also  outlines  Government’s  foreign  policy  initiatives,  including  the 
<br/>promotion of the Pacific as an Ocean of Peace, which is the single most significant contribution that 
<br/></span><span>Fiji has made to peace and security in our neighbourhood and the broader Indo-Pacific region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also reaffirms the central position of the Pacific region in our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>foreign policy calculations and that in all we do, we will put the Pacific family first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  foundation  of  this  White  Paper  is  a  whole-of-nation  approach  that 
<br/>integrates  all  elements  of  policy,  domestic  and  external,  and  recognises  that  our  security  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="14">Page 14</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1997 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prosperity ultimately depend on a clear-eyed view of our national interests and values and how best 
<br/>to advance them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The White Paper is also reflected on Chapter 3 of Fiji’s National Development Plan and is 
<br/>the proposed response to the current National Security and Defence Review.  Together, these forms 
<br/>the foundation of the Government’s strategy to advance Fiji’s strategic and economic interests and 
<br/>strengthen  its  social  cohesion.  What  follows  builds  on  the  three  interconnecting  themes  of  Fiji’s 
<br/>foreign  policy  -  sovereignty,  security  and  prosperity.    These  are  the  traditional  pillars  of  foreign 
<br/>policy, but the context in which we must pursue them has profoundly changed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The White Paper states Fiji’s identity and values.  It states where we stand on issues.  While 
<br/>some areas may not be popular to some, I had remarked in an earlier speech in this House that the 
<br/>Government stands for what is right for Fiji, not necessarily what is popular.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  White  Paper  is  made  up  of  three  complementary  elements,  namely, 
<br/>analysis,  policy  positioning  and  the  machinery  of  delivery.    The  White  Paper  comprises  eight 
<br/>chapters.  I will expound each of the chapters briefly.  I ask that we peruse the document, to enable 
<br/>us to understand its contents and draw informed conclusions through the following lenses - the White 
<br/>Paper: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is different from all others; 
<br/>is a headline document; 
<br/>comprises of high level statements; 
<br/>is not a checklist of all we are doing in our foreign policy; and  
<br/>is not a catalogue of all our bilateral and multilateral relationships and activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the White Paper: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sets out the underlying principles of Fiji’s foreign policy, our overarching objectives and our 
<br/>broad priorities. 
<br/>captures the way in which domestic and foreign policies are intertwined. 
<br/>allows flexibility to work on issues without being constrained by specificity. 
<br/>allows for context and nuance to be made for circumstances that Fiji might find itself in.  
<br/>is further unpacked into the 2024-2027 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that 
<br/>guide its operationalisation through its operational and business plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The White Paper, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is also the basis for Ministries to connect and coordinate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>across the Government system and in areas touching external interactions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Chapter 1 of the White Paper examines sovereignty, with a focus on identity 
<br/>and values.  It defines who we are and what we believe in.   It  presents  Fiji 
<br/>the  world  and 
<br/>emphasises the characteristics that define our society, that define our values.  This is central to how 
<br/>we engage with the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further,  the  Chapter  delineates  our  interests,  our  international  relationships,  the  ideas  we 
<br/>bring to building a stronger region and the bilateral and multilateral investments to be undertaken to 
<br/>protect the Fijian society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, focuses on security with the preamble on Fiji’s physical security 
<br/>and border protection, economic security, environmental sustainability and the capacity to address 
<br/>non-traditional  threats  and  challenges  to  social  cohesion.  It  highlights  Fiji’s  leadership  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>1998 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stewardship roles in the Pacific - the leverage we have as a regional hub, the influence on regionalism, 
<br/>broader multilateral cooperation and the Ocean of Peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Chapter  3  examines  transnational  security  issues  and  poses  strategic 
<br/>remedies  to  the  transnational  challenges  which  have  the  potential  to  erode  social  stability,  wreak 
<br/>havoc on livelihoods, threaten the health of our community and sustainability of our environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, addresses Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change.  The Chapter 
<br/>proposes the need for national  policy  setting and unremitting  advocacy for action at  regional and 
<br/>global  level.  This  is  in  addition  to  the  grounds  set  on  the  importance  of  comprehensive  climate 
<br/>governance, the green economy, SDGs, the National Oceans Policy and investments in sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Chapter 5 examines Fiji’s approach to bilateral relations, bearing in mind that 
<br/>there are no neat distinctions between bilateral and multilateral diplomacy, and that the success in 
<br/>one helps build success in the other. It singles out that the texture and priorities of our relationships 
<br/>are inevitably shaped by Fiji’s geography, history and values. The  ‘family first’ approach for the 
<br/>region and the links with key strategic and traditional partners beyond the region are important to 
<br/>foster familial bonds and shared prosperity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter  6  on  prosperity,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  stresses  the  importance  of  centrally  advancing 
<br/>Fiji’s  economic  interests  for  all  Fijians.  It  highlights  the  importance  and  quality  of  our  domestic 
<br/>economic policy settings, the enterprise of Fijian businesses, the hard work of Fijian labour and our 
<br/>ability to effectively navigate the regional and global economies and their underpinning institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  states  what  the  backbone  of  Fiji’s  economy  is,  and  the  need  to  empower  enterprises  is 
<br/>fundamental  for  fostering  inclusive  growth  and  reducing  income  inequality.  The  Chapter  further 
<br/>expounds the importance of an open economy, trade and investment liberalization, the growth of the 
<br/>Fijian diaspora around the world and their economic importance to our country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Foreign Policy and Developmental Assistance in Chapter 7, Mr. Speaker, Sir, highlights 
<br/>the  important  support  of  our  international  partners  and  the  need  to  manage  these  relations  across 
<br/>Government.  It places importance on the work of diplomatic missions, honorary consuls and trade 
<br/>commissions, to promote Fiji’s economic interests and attract foreign investment. There is emphasis 
<br/>on the need for robust systems for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating development support and 
<br/>outcomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter  8,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sets  out  the  Government’s  approach  to  implementing  Fiji’s 
<br/>foreign policy and the systems and resources required to drive the whole of Government machinery. 
<br/>The Chapter also looks at policy stewardship, coordination and management, and the governance 
<br/>structure to churn out professional cohorts with appropriate skillsets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I conclude with thanks to all the officials and expertise under the 
<br/>leadership of the Permanent  Secretary for  Foreign  Affairs, in  the formulation of this document. I 
<br/>acknowledge the wise counsel of the Reference Group, which helped guide its preparation. I sincerely 
<br/>thank the White Paper’s principal author, Mr. Peter Varghese, Officer of the Australian Order (AO).  
<br/></span><span>I acknowledge the honourable Ministers and their Permanent Secretaries, the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span><span>the Opposition, the Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, former Ministers, Senior Officials and 
<br/>Fijian  diplomats,  Academia,  industry  representatives,  regional  organisations  and  members  of  our 
<br/>community, who came forward and shared their knowledge and skills during the formulation of our 
<br/>policy paper.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I 
<br/>stand to provide a response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Prime Minister on Fiji’s 
<br/>Foreign Policy White Paper.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, thank you for the invitation to support His Excellency and our 
<br/>Permanent Representative in the United Nations (PRUN) in the most recent United Nations General 
<br/>Assembly  (UNGA).  As  you  are  well  aware,  UNGA  is  hectic,  but  we  have  to  shoulder  the 
<br/>responsibility, its national duties and a lot of learnings as well. It is interesting to see how the world 
<br/>is  developing  and  trying  to  cope  and  adapt  to  the  challenges.  I  know  that  there  will  be  more 
<br/>opportunities later to discuss on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Fiji’s  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  congratulations  to 
<br/>Government. I know that all these while, we have always been guided by a Foreign Policy Statement 
<br/>rather than a Foreign Policy White Paper. I think I have that small document with me. This was what 
<br/>was guiding us.  But, of course, our principles and national interests remain important, and I would 
<br/>like to speak on it as well during the course of my response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  honestly,  I  have  not  read  the  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper  in 
<br/>detail. I contributed, and most of what I had raised during my discussions with Mr. Varghese is what 
<br/>I will share today. It is not criticising, but it is more of constructive dialogue on some of the issues 
<br/>because  we  discussed  the  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  without  the 
<br/>National Development Plan and, of course, that has been launched. I took a copy with me, but I did 
<br/>not read it as well.  Of course, the Defence Policy is pending because of the National Defence Review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  in the limited time this morning, I want to go quickly into Chapter 5 of the 
<br/>Foreign Policy White Paper which is on bilateral relations, including the major powers.  For Fiji, 
<br/>multilateralism and the region are, of course, foreign policy force multipliers. I had a bit of interest 
<br/>in  the subsequent paragraph, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, particularly, on our start  point.   The 
<br/>Foreign Policy White Paper says that there is no neat distinction between bilateral and multilateral 
<br/>diplomacy, but geography, history and values, inevitably, shape texture and priorities of our bilateral 
<br/>relationships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On relationships with fellow members of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), for example, are 
<br/>of a different order to our relationships with countries outside the Pacific Region.  I do agree with 
<br/>that but with the word of caution, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you are well aware of the incidents 
<br/>of 1987 - we went North, because our traditional partners had issues with us, and the same in 2000.  
<br/>That led the current relationships that led to the Vuvale Partnership and the Pacific Reset.  Hopefully, 
<br/>we will anchor on respect for sovereignty, equality, independence and, of course, common interests. 
<br/>These are very, very important because we know for a fact from previous, and I hope that this will 
<br/></span><span>not  restrict  us,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir.  I  know  that  you  very  well  understand  what  I  am 
<br/></span><span>talking about because of how we were treated when we had our own internal issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, on sovereignty, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, how does this align with not having 
<br/>sovereign capabilities to manage our nation as a sovereign State?  It is not only about our defence 
<br/>set-up, but we are looking about the brain-drain, issues of governance and our industrial, economic 
<br/>logistical research and educational capabilities. These are requirements for us in order to achieve our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2001 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategic sovereignty and, of course, includes safety  and health, defence wellbeing,  food security, 
<br/>energy, key material supplies, infrastructure security and environmental sustainability, which are all 
<br/>dependant on development partners and foreigners. That is why SDG 17 is very, very critical, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On security, of course, the Ocean of Peace or the zone of peace has prominence but, of course, 
<br/>I did raise then, Mr. Speaker Sir, how it aligns, and I have been listening. I attended the Alliance of 
<br/>Small Island States (AOSIS), I attended the Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) Meeting, 
<br/>and how these aligns with the 2050 Strategy as you are well aware of but, again, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sir, for us, we cannot give something that we do not have and that is why sorting out the 
<br/>issues in Fiji is so important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are governance issues and honourable Prime Minister, Sir, I hope that you will take 
<br/>responsibility for the issues that are arising in the papers, to sort out these issues because these all 
<br/>contribute to this Ocean of Peace and, particularly, for the long-term security of the region. I hope 
<br/>that there will not be interference in the way things are dealt with but, of course, we must make sure 
<br/>that good governance, institutional integrity as raised by honourable Naupoto, are part of all these, 
<br/>so that we can have that peace first within Fiji before we take it into the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On prosperity, I am thankful that the National Development Plan is out, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, Sir, that we, of course, have to address.  This is not only Government, but we take equal 
<br/>responsibility on the issues that we have, such as inflation, cost of living, unemployment, brain drain, 
<br/>housing, government debt, all these things, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Of course, let me assure you, honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, and all Fijians that we, the G-16 Bloc in the Opposition, will always work together 
<br/>in the common interest for Fiji. This document is going to contribute and, of course, with the Defence 
<br/>Policy that we are waiting for and the National Development Plan, they will all be important for Fiji 
<br/>in terms of the way forward.   Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Leader of the G-9 Bloc?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  </span><span>ni  bula  vinaka</span><span>.  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  for  the  presentation  of  the  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper,  and  I  think  it 
<br/>articulates very clearly the areas that we should focus on, given the huge challenges ahead of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this point, I just wanted to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world is changing, and changing very, 
<br/>very fast.  There are things that you and I can control and there are things that we cannot control. It 
<br/>is our ability to identify our area of influence, the areas of responsibility, and above all, the areas of 
<br/>our operations. Our area of operations is basically the whole wide world, our ability to influence what 
<br/>particular areas in our engagements and our greatest area of responsibility is really here, in the Pacific 
<br/>and, of course, our home here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me, I have not really studied the document itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said in one 
<br/>of my earlier contributions on the floor, our ability to thread together key guiding documents for our 
<br/>nation, one of it which is this one here, the other one was launched - the National Development Plan, 
<br/>and  the  Security  and  Defence  Review  are  critical  documents  which  will  help  to  give  us  a  better 
<br/></span><span>understanding on how we relate with the world and  how things that we engage with, and the ability 
<br/></span><span>to identify what we should do first and what comes second in order of priorities, given the limited 
<br/>resources that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I always view the foreign policy work as our ability to fight the forward battles effectively, 
<br/>and that is the key, in my view.  How we do it, given the amount of work that needs to be done here?  
<br/>And this is why I am saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our ability to see the security defence issues, national 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development plans, et cetera, and how we thread all these together to be able to relate to the outside 
<br/>world and tell them, through our networking, through our relationship and through our engagement, 
<br/>what we really need to do here in Fiji to take us forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I draw the attention of the floor this morning to the National Development Plan (NDP), our 
<br/>vision on Chapter 10, it is an honourable and a noble articulated 2050 vision on how we can prosper, 
<br/>how our nation can be inclusive and, above all, sustainable. And I think that is a very important part 
<br/>in how we engage the whole wide world out there through our networks with them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to take note, at this point, of the importance of the role of the military, our 
<br/>police and correctional officers, and how, at the earlier stages of shaping our engagement with the 
<br/>whole wide world and how their books shaped our foreign policy. They are basically our foreign 
<br/>policy tool.  There is some importance too, at this point, of sports tool which is also a very important 
<br/>part of how we are going to shape our foreign policy tool. And this is very well articulated in Chapter 
<br/>2 of our Foreign Policy White Paper - the foreign or soft face of our engagement with the whole wide 
<br/>world.  Sports and our cultural identity, those are important aspects of how we can engage with the 
<br/>whole wide world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the G-9 Bloc, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will study the document, but I stand this morning to 
<br/>assure  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Government  that  we  look  forward  to  the 
<br/>implementation of the Foreign Policy White Paper to achieve the noble objectives that have been set 
<br/>by Government.

<div><span>Update on the National Taskforce to Address Pornography 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>Na Turaga na Tui Cakau</span><span>, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>and  fellow  Members  of  Parliament;  I  stand  before  you  today  to  provide  an  update  on  the  efforts 
<br/>undertaken by the National Taskforce to Address Pornography, and the complementary efforts by 
<br/>the Coalition Government in actioning the commitment made in this very august Parliament when I 
<br/>took the floor late last year.  This important National Taskforce was approved by Cabinet earlier this 
<br/>year to better understand the societal risks of pornography in Fiji and to provide recommendations to 
<br/>effectively address these risks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, keeping our people safe, both in offline and online spaces, is of paramount 
<br/>importance  to  the  Coalition  Government.  Therefore,  to  demonstrate  this  and  to  ensure  we  are 
<br/>effectively  understanding  and  addressing  the  societal  and  technical  aspects  of  this  issue,  this 
<br/>Taskforce is jointly chaired by the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection 
<br/>and myself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased to inform you that the Taskforce held an introductory meeting earlier this year 
<br/>at its first official meeting in August, with active participation and contributions from the Opposition 
<br/>represented  by  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  various  Government  Ministries  and  agencies, 
<br/>telecommunication companies, NGOs, civil society organisations, academia, as well as religious and 
<br/>community organisations, each of them providing a unique and important perspective during these 
<br/></span><span>discussions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are all aware, the internet, which is a tool of immense potential for 
<br/>progress, has, unfortunately, furthered the reach of cyber criminals and has become a breeding ground 
<br/>for predators who exploit the innocence of our children, and online sexual abuse is an extension of 
<br/>the existing threat of child sexual abuse. As we delve into the stark realities of these issues, we are 
<br/>confronted with alarming statistics that highlight its pervasive nature and the profound impact it has  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2003 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last time I took the floor when we discussed this issue, I had shared that 
<br/>when we talk about the web traffic to pornographic sites, for one network provider in Fiji, over a 
<br/>period of three months, the download of about 626TB of data consumed ranking in one of the top 10 
<br/>most used data traffic by that operator in Fiji. To put this into context, 626TB is approximately equal 
<br/>to a 100 million books. Imagine, having a collection of movies that would take over 150 years to 
<br/>watch non-stop, even if you watched one movie every single day. This shows how large this traffic 
<br/>data is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For a period of one month, another network provider found that the total adult content was 
<br/>92TB or 1.6 percent of their total data volume for one month. We can see that the adult content and 
<br/>pornography  have  carved  out  a  significant  presence,  consuming  a  substantial  portion  of  network 
<br/>traffic. The numbers do not lie. Although it is impossible to put any realistic numbers on how much 
<br/>of the internet is made up of adult content, we can be assured that the industry is huge. It is a silent 
<br/>epidemic, shaping our digital world and impacting countless lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, this is a global and regional issue. Last year, 245 electronic service 
<br/>providers  made  over  35  million  reports  of  suspected  Child  Sexual  Abuse  Material  or  commonly 
<br/>known  as  CSAM,  on  their  platform.  According  to  the  Association  of  Internet  Hotline  Providers 
<br/>(INHOPE), in 2023, 83 percent of child abuse victims reported to it were between the age of 3 and 
<br/>13 years old.  Sir, INTERPOL’s Child Sexual Exploitation Database showed that in 2018, 65 percent 
<br/>of unidentified victims were girls and 93 percent of visible offenders were male. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  establishment  of  this  National  Taskforce,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  not  merely  a  symbolic 
<br/>gesture, but a powerful demonstration of the Coalition Government’s commitment to action. It is a 
<br/>tangible  step  towards  safeguarding  our  communities  and  protecting  our  most  vulnerable  citizens. 
<br/>Which  is  why  the  Taskforce  has  agreed  that  the  first  work  stream  of  the  Taskforce  should  be  to 
<br/>combat child pornography, now being referred to as Online Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse 
<br/>(OCSEA). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  CyberTipline  of  the  United  States  National  Centre  for  Missing  &amp; 
<br/>Exploited  Children  (NCMEC)  serves  as  United  States  national  clearinghouse  for  leads  on  child 
<br/>exploitation crimes as electronic service providers in America are mandated by law to report. These 
<br/>reports are then referred to law enforcement for prosecution.  Sir, 99 percent of the cyber tips are 
<br/>received from electronic service providers such as </span><span>Meta</span><span>, </span><span>Google</span><span> and </span><span>TikTok</span><span>. A small number are 
<br/>also received from the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023 alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, NCMEC received 3,638 suspected CSEM reports from Fiji. 
<br/>One key action item is for our law enforcement to investigate the CyberTip reports which we are 
<br/>already in  discussions  with  NCMEC and the Fiji Police Force on, with  the support of the United 
<br/>States Government to provide the needed training to our law enforcement. This is an addition to the 
<br/>earlier training sessions that have been held.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  urge  parents,  guardians  and  communities  to  be  vigilant  about  the 
<br/></span><span>images and videos of our children that we share online. It is critical to avoid uploading pictures or 
<br/></span><span>videos of our children when they are not appropriately clothed. Once these images and videos are 
<br/>online, they can be exploited by perpetrators in unimaginable and harmful ways.  Let us work together 
<br/>to safeguard our children in both, the physical and digital worlds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had spoken about the complementary efforts that we are progressing to 
<br/>ensure our people, in particular, our children and vulnerable groups are protected, and I would like

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  share  these  as  well.  In  June,  we  deposited  our  Instruments  of  Accession  to  the  Budapest 
<br/>Convention.  The  Budapest  Convention  also  has  a  dedicated  article  for  offences  related  to  child 
<br/>pornography and to modernise criminal laws to more effectively address the use of computer systems 
<br/>in the commission of sexual offences against children. This is also captured in our Cybercrime Act 
<br/>2021, and we have also commenced capacity building sessions for our criminal justice authorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In August, as a member of the UN Ad Hoc Committee and after three years of negotiations 
<br/>that we were actively participating in, the UN concluded a landmark treaty against cybercrime, which 
<br/>also  included  provisions  for  the  protection  of  our  children  in  online  spaces.  We  are  also  having 
<br/>discussions with the Council of Europe on the Lanzarote Convention, which is the Convention on 
<br/>the  Protection  of  Children  Against  Sexual  Exploitation  and  Sexual  Abuse.    These  strategic 
<br/>partnerships  ensure  that  we  holistically  address  this  evolving  threat,  build  capacity  and  foster 
<br/>international cooperation with stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Online Safety Commission also collaborates with NCMEC on the Take it Down online 
<br/>reporting  service  and  with  the  Australian  E-Safety  Commission  and  the  Cyber  Safety  Pasifika 
<br/>initiative,  through  our  law  enforcement,  to  distribute  information  on  options  for  reporting  abuse, 
<br/>protecting accounts and personal information, including blocking people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are in the process of finalising a Cabinet paper for the Fiji Government, 
<br/>through  the  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Cooperatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications and also jointly with the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection, to 
<br/>join the WeProtect Global Alliance - the Global Taskforce on Child Sexual Abuse Online.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Global Taskforce is a governmental grouping which focuses on creating a coordinated 
<br/>global approach to online sexual abuse, promoting collaboration among governments, and addressing 
<br/>critical issues such as child exploitation, online grooming, sextortion and harmful content on digital 
<br/>platforms. The Online Safety Commission is already a member of the WeProtect Global Alliance 
<br/>and important work is already being done with digital safety initiatives in schools and communities. 
<br/>The two Ministries joining the Global Taskforce of governments will further enhance Fiji's capacity 
<br/>to address the issue of online child sexual abuse effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to the work of the National Taskforce, during the inaugural 
<br/>meeting, the Taskforce explored the importance of international collaboration and strengthening legal 
<br/>frameworks  to  protect  children  from  online  sexual  exploitation.  The  members  discussed  existing 
<br/>child  protection  laws  and  the  need  for  more  comprehensive  policies  to  address  the  evolving 
<br/>challenges in the digital landscape.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A significant part of the first meeting involved the validation of the Terms of Reference for 
<br/>the National Taskforce and the Terms of Reference of the Working Groups. There are three working 
<br/>groups,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  established  with  specific  objectives  related  to  the  overall  goals  of  the 
<br/>Taskforce.  Their  mandates  are  clearly  defined  in  the  Terms  of  Reference  -  to  develop  concrete 
<br/>strategies and implement tangible solutions that align with our overarching mission.  Each working 
<br/>group will focus on a thematic area and operate under the guidance of a designated working group 
<br/>Chair. This ensures that we have an  action-oriented approach  (not a top  first) in the work we are 
<br/></span><span>doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first Working Group will focus on Policy, Legislation, Governance and Criminal Justice, 
<br/>and  is  chaired  by  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection.  The  second  Working 
<br/>Group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is chaired by the Online Safety Commission which focusses on Survivor 
<br/>Support,  Empowerment,  Society  and  Culture.  The  third  Working  Group  will  be  the  Industry  and 
<br/>Technology Response and is chaired by the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji. Each Working

<div><span>Group consists of different stakeholders who have their main expertise to actively participate in these 
<br/>Working Groups. The Working Groups have started to convene meetings with their stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the effectiveness of our initiatives, the Taskforce will implement 
<br/>robust  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and  evaluation.  We  will  establish  feedback  channels  for  the 
<br/>community to provide input on our efforts, ensuring that we remain responsive to the needs of our 
<br/>citizens.  The  next  meeting  of  the  National  Taskforce  will  be  conducted  this  month,  where  the 
<br/>Working Groups will present their findings, and we will continue to engage in discussions to address 
<br/>the issue of pornography use in Fiji comprehensively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been saying in this august Parliament that we are very serious in what 
<br/>we are doing, to the extent that we are actually looking at even banning some sites, if necessary.  On 
<br/>that note, I would like to personally thank the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection as we are standing shoulder to shoulder together as part of this Taskforce and to address 
<br/>this  issue  comprehensively;  all  the  stakeholders  who  are  part  of  the  workforce;  and  the  Working 
<br/>Groups, for their contributions. I also invited more members of the Opposition to come and be part 
<br/>of this Working Group, given the importance of the work that we are doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, the fight against online child sexual abuse and pornography requires a collective 
<br/>responsibility  from  all  sectors  of  society.  We  urge  each  stakeholder  to  take  an  active  role  in  this 
<br/>national effort. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we remain committed in our resolve, and I am more than happy to 
<br/>provide further updates as we move along. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL. - Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today as a member of the National Taskforce on 
<br/>pornography and as a voice for the many victims who have suffered in silence due to the proliferation 
<br/>of  explicit  content  on  social  media  platforms.  While  I  appreciate  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s update on the work undertaken by the Taskforce, I must emphasise that the Government’s 
<br/>efforts to-date have been largely bureaucratic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of the Taskforce was, indeed, a step in the right direction. However, we 
<br/>must acknowledge the realities that our people, especially our young, and women continue to face 
<br/>everyday. Victims of online sexual harassment, cyberbullying and non-consensual sharing of nude 
<br/>images  have  been  long  calling  for  stronger  legislative  measures  and  more  robust  enforcement  to 
<br/>protect them. Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Taskforce has far produced more discussions and reviews 
<br/>than actual results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that we do more than just talk. Our people are losing trust 
<br/>in  processes  and  commissions  that  make  grand  promises  but  deliver  little  to  no  outcomes.  The 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  mentioned  that  this  Taskforce  aims  to  better  understand  the 
<br/>societal risk of pornography in Fiji, but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do we need another review to tell us what 
<br/>we already know? We are aware of the devastating impact that unregulated access to pornography is 
<br/>heavy on our society, contributing to increase cases of online harassment and violence against women 
<br/>and children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to prioritise the implementation of practical solutions 
<br/>that  are  already  within  our  reach.  Strengthening  our  cybercrime  laws,  improving  reporting 
<br/>mechanisms and increasing resources for our law enforcement to track and prosecute offenders are 
<br/>essential first steps. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also need to work closely with social media companies to ensure that 
<br/>they have robust policies for removing harmful content swiftly and efficiently. Furthermore, we must 
<br/>stand united as a Parliament in condemning the perpetrators who use these platforms to exploit and 
<br/>humiliate others. There are too many instances where victims, especially young women, have had 
<br/>their dignity stripped away online while authorities have remained either powerless or too slow to 
<br/>act.  The  taskforce  should  not  only  be  focussed  on  preventative  measures,  but  also  on  providing 
<br/>support systems for victims, psychological, legal and emotional. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Government  is  very  fond  of  establishing  taskforces,  conducting 
<br/>research  and  forming  committees.  But  the  real  test  is  whether  these  initiatives  can  bring  about 
<br/>meaningful change. The real change that they promised. It is easy to announce yet another review or 
<br/>report,  but  it  is  far  more  challenging  to  implement  real  reforms  that  can  safeguard  our  people.  I 
<br/>sincerely hope that the recommendations of this taskforce will not gather dust on the shelves of their 
<br/>cabinet, but rather be translated into concrete actions that will make our online spaces safer and more 
<br/>secure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, on this side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-16 Bloc, stand ready to work together 
<br/>to ensure that our children, our sisters, our mothers and all Fijians are protected from the behaviours 
<br/>that  thrive  on  these  platforms.  We  need  less  bureaucracy  and  more  action!  Less  talk  and  more 
<br/>decisive  moves!  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  high  time  this  Government  moves  beyond  taskforce  and 
<br/>research  and  start  showing  us  results.  I  call  the  taskforce  to  expedite  its  work  and  to  focus  on 
<br/>outcomes  that will restore faith and the Government’s ability to  tackle these pressing issues.  Our 
<br/>people deserve no less. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you and I also want to congratulate my friend on the 
<br/>other side, the honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services, for 
<br/>becoming the new Deputy Leader for the People’s Alliance Party. I hope that he will do his work 
<br/>very well and also fix the potholes on our streets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  You  started  off  well,  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  but  you  ended  up  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potholes again.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or their designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  allowing  me  the  space  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respond to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  an  independent  Member  of  Parliament,  I  am  tasked  with  the  privilege  of 
<br/>offering a distinctive view to this conversation, one that is shaped by my  Christian faith and rich 
<br/>depository of the faith-based community I am part of.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  establishment  of  the  National  Taskforce  to  tackle  the  societal  risks  associated  with 
<br/>pornography is a reaffirming parallel to the views and the values, I and thousands across Fiji resonate 
<br/></span><span>with, rooted in respect of human person and a sanctity of relationship. These challenges are more 
<br/></span><span>than a societal issue, it is about the preservation of our moral fabric, the essence of human dignity 
<br/>and a concern that is central to our people and our faith. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Fijian citizen, deriving our strength from faith, we understand the harms of pornography, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not only in terms of societal risk, but also as a moral concern that negatively impacts 
<br/>relationships, our family values and individual growth. We acknowledge that pornography is harmful 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the materials that objectifies individuals, distorts the healthy understanding of human sexuality 
<br/>and the impacts on mental and spiritual wellbeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst we applaud the Taskforce’s effort, the Christian faith and the faith-based community 
<br/>would like to ensure that our actions are holistic, not only centred merely on punitive measures, but 
<br/>develop a regulation that will play a role, so does the education of our community.  The teaching of 
<br/>Christ moves us towards understanding empathy and rehabilitation over punishment and judgment, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. We should strive to foster an environment where the inherent dignity and word of 
<br/>each person are respected, human sexuality are not degraded. This involves an open conversation 
<br/>and a comprehensive education about the impact and the explicit content with digital safety consent 
<br/>and healthier relationships.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this discussion, it is crucial to remember the </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse, Matthew 18:6, 
<br/>reminding us that leading children astray brings great moral responsibility. We must ensure that our 
<br/>children and vulnerable population are offered the utmost protection with wisdom to make sound 
<br/>morale upright and instil decisions in the cyberspace.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, as protectors of individual freedom, we must find a balance between safeguarding 
<br/>morale standards and protecting privacy rights. This delicate balance necessitates the inclusion of 
<br/>legal, ethical and spiritual consideration in our decision-making process, aligning the State’s affairs 
<br/>and resources with our moral compass as a guiding light.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our pursuit to curtail the adverse effect of pornography, we must 
<br/>be  reminded  to  uphold  the  principle  of  compassion,  understanding  and  forgiveness  that  our  faith 
<br/>teaches us. The pathway we propose in this Parliament should inspire transformation and healing, 
<br/>rather  than  stigmatisation  and  shame.  I  trust  that  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>Taskforce and each one of us in this room uphold this principle close to our hearts. I stand with them 
<br/>in  their  fight  against  the  societal  risk  of  pornography,  echoing  our  faith,  call,  dignity,  respect, 
<br/>responsible freedom and a holistic approach in addressing this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, it is almost 12.30 p.m., so I would like to adjourn 
<br/>Parliament now. We will resume at 2.30 p.m., and we will continue with the Statement made by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry. Thank you.

<div><span>Causes of Fish Poisoning in Fiji and the Pacific Islands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page – </span><span>ni sa yadra 
<br/>vinaka</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I am pleased to deliver a Statement on the Ministry of Fisheries 
<br/>work on managing fish poisoning in Fiji and the research undertakings on ciguatera fish poisoning, 
<br/>one of the common causes of fish poisoning in Fiji and the Pacific Islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, fish is an important protein rich food source which contributes significantly to 
<br/>the health and economic livelihood of our people. Fish consumption in Fiji is estimated at between 
<br/>15  and  113  kilogrammes  per  capita  and  there  is  a  higher  per  capita  consumption  in  rural  coastal 
<br/>communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  presence  of  toxins  in  fish  will  significantly  impact  the  economy  and  public  health  of 
<br/>Fijians,  especially  when  it  involves  our  export  market  and  the  hospitality  industry.  In  Fiji,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, fish poisoning affects health, trade and livelihood. Fish poisoning can be caused by:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improper fish handling; 
<br/>fish not chilled and refrigerated properly; and 
<br/>eating reef fish that have accumulated naturally occurring toxins called ciguatoxin. The 
<br/>ciguatoxin is produced from small sea plants called dinoflagellates and as it enters through 
<br/>the food chain, it becomes progressively more concentrated affecting humans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  to  address  improper  fish  handling  and  the  maintenance  of  fish  quality,  the 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries has established 24 Fisheries Centres across the country. These Centres supply 
<br/>ice to fishers to preserve fish, maintain freshness and prevent the release of enzymes from fish which 
<br/>speeds up the fish’s spoilage rate and causes fish poisoning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, our Extension and Advisory Division serves in the four Divisions and provides 
<br/>post-harvest  training  to  licensed  fishers  on  how  to  maintain  seafood  freshness  and  quality.    The 
<br/>training  includes  the  proper  use  of  ice  and  adequate  hygiene  during  harvesting,  processing, 
<br/>distribution and marketing of the fish product.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  commends  the  tremendous  support  the  Government  of  Japan 
<br/>provides through the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Foundation in  installing and monitoring ice 
<br/>machines in the 24 stations, including ongoing training and capacity building of our technical services 
<br/>staff in operating and servicing the ice machines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, ciguatera fish  poisoning  is primarily prevalent during the warmer months or 
<br/>cyclone seasons from November to April. However, with the frequent changes in weather patterns, 
<br/></span><span>increased natural disturbances and climate change impact, the occurrence is frequent and varies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Fiji,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  management  of  ciguatera  fish  poisoning  depends  mainly  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) which is not adequately documented. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, since 2002, the Ministry of Fisheries has conducted a baseline questionnaire 
<br/>survey  to  identify  major  hotspots,  seasons  and  fish  species  implicated  in  ciguatoxin,  including

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2009 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>treatment and traditional remedies.  This work documented the effort to manage, prevent and reduce 
<br/>the incidence of fish poisoning, especially given the impact of climate change that may contribute to 
<br/>the spread of ciguatoxin. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the work on ciguatera fish poisoning is included in the Ministry workplan with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the following objectives: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve  the  reporting  mechanism  for  ciguatera  incidence  in  coastal  and  maritime 
<br/>communities; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)  Assess the environmental and ecological presence of marine biotoxin-identified hotspot 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas in Fiji and provide recommended adaptations strategies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  has  created  awareness  through  community  outreach,  talkback 
<br/>shows, trade shows, journal publications and public awareness materials. News alerts and awareness 
<br/>are published through the Ministry of Fisheries </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page and other media outlets during the 
<br/>cyclone season.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016, Mr. Speaker, and with  the support of our local  institutions, the University  of the 
<br/>South Pacific and the Fiji National University, the Ministry undertook a validation research approach 
<br/>to investigating the hotspots identified through traditional ecological knowledge and the scientific 
<br/>process  to  determine  the  occurrence  and  accumulation  in  seafood.    The  study  discovered  some 
<br/>unknown knowledge and confirmed some of Fiji’s fish poisoning traditional science.  The sampling 
<br/>was conducted in Kadavu, Nadroga, Navosa and Tailevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the Fiji National University, 
<br/>the village nurses, village headmen and community workers were trained to collect data on ciguatera 
<br/>fish  poisoning  incidents  using  a  specifically  designed  fish  poisoning  notification  book.  The  pilot 
<br/>project was conducted in Tailevu and Kadavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry appreciates and acknowledges the support of the United Nations 
<br/>Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (UNFAO)  for  assisting  in  setting  up  a  mini  laboratory  in  the 
<br/>Ministry by donating laboratory equipment and providing capacity building for staff to enhance their 
<br/>field sample collection, identification and preservation skills.  Because of the need to undertake a 
<br/>comprehensive  research  approach  to  manage,  prevent  and  reduce  the  incidence  of  ciguatera  fish 
<br/>poisoning in Fiji, the Ministry is in the process of entering into a Memorandum of Understanding 
<br/>(MOU) with the Fiji National University. The focus is to undertake a complete research approach 
<br/>based on the impact of health, environment, socio-cultural, food security, livelihood and trade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  would  like  to  acknowledge  and  appreciate  the  Government  of 
<br/>Japan’s  instrumental  roles  in  developing  Fiji  fisheries  sector.    Last  Wednesday,  as  Minister  for 
<br/>Fisheries, I signed a MOU with the Ambassador of Japan for funding projects for our provisional 
<br/>fisheries research vessel and ice making machines.  These infrastructures will continue to support 
<br/>managing and preventing fish poisoning in Fiji by enabling research and ecological assessment in 
<br/>remote maritime areas and assisting maritime communities with access to ice, proper fish handling 
<br/>and better markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the work on managing, reducing and preventing fish poisoning needs a multi-
<br/>local 
<br/>disciplinary  collaboration  between  Government  agencies,  research 
<br/>communities.  As we approach the cyclone season, the Ministry will intensify public outreach and 
<br/>release  awareness  materials  on  ciguatera  fish  poisoning.    I  urge  the  public  to  remain  vigilant 
<br/>especially in identifying and avoiding fish associated with ciguatoxin.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for her Ministerial 
<br/>Statement. Of course, we are all concerned about the safety, health and well-being of our people and 
<br/>providing them information in advance, our taking pro-active measures is a good initiative to ensure 
<br/>that our people, of course, do take heed particularly when it is in season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by the honourable Minister, I will not go into detail on it but perhaps an advice 
<br/>to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for Trade, “if you want to avoid fish poisoning, why not go 
<br/>for </span><span>kaikoso</span><span>?  Perhaps a better alternative.  It is safe and of course you will enjoy your long life as 
<br/>well.  That is perhaps a recommendation to the other side of the House, there is an alternative to fish 
<br/>for those of you who do eat fish.  The honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and 
<br/>I, we abstain from eating fish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what is important, perhaps to what the honourable Minister has stated is 
<br/>how people can realize or identify the symptoms when they are affected.  This is particularly relevant 
<br/>for those in the outer islands where they do not have easy access to health facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remembered my days as an officer in the RFMF, we had exercise in Nabukavesi and the late 
<br/>Dr. Ifereimi Buaserau shared to us his experience in Lau.  Because of the implications, they usually 
<br/>lie to the doctors about what they ate and when it gets worse, then that is where they revealed things, 
<br/>especially,  Sir,  in  the  first  three  hours  and,  of  course,  in  the  first  72  hours  as  well.    This  is  very 
<br/>important, particularly, for our people to know the symptoms and differentiate between the symptoms 
<br/>as they go through the pain or whatever we may call it during the first three hours and the first 72 
<br/>hours  as  well.    Of  course,  prevention  is  better  than  cure.    The  season,  we  need  to  also  avoid 
<br/>particularly those that do feed on coral reefs and organisms that live on our reefs because this is a 
<br/>common problem in sub-tropical and, of course, tropical countries as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the season, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a means of prevention as well, one is avoiding 
<br/>reef fish particularly  the recommended sizes according to  science is  fishes over 2.7 kilogrammes 
<br/>because of probably, it is related to their eating patterns.  The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is apart 
<br/>from the fillet, the flesh itself, people need to avoid eating the liver, intestines, head and the roe of 
<br/>small reef fish.  Roe is another name for fish eggs.  Those are the things that are also recommended 
<br/>for us to avoid if we do happen to choose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the Ministry for the work that they do in terms of awareness.  We need to have 
<br/>these aggressive campaign on awareness, so that we can also ensure that the message reaches out.  I 
<br/>am particularly pleading for those in the rural areas and the outer island communities, if we can use 
<br/>all the arms of Government, not only Ministry of Fisheries, to reach out to our people and, of course, 
<br/>the  involvement  of  academia,  is  important.    That  is  my  contribution  but  once  again  there  is  an 
<br/>alternative, go for </span><span>kaikoso</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, you have tonnes of knowledge about fish.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The G-9 Bloc, or their designate? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you honourable Minister for the Statement 
<br/>this afternoon.  Very important on fish poisoning; ciguatera poisoning is something that I am very 
<br/>well versed with; not as a scientist but for someone who suffers from it a lot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From my  island, Sir, years ago all the fish were poisoned with  ciguatera.  We know very 
<br/>much the symptoms when you get it, one of them is temperature reversals, so the hot things get cold 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2011 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and cold things feel hot.  So, if you put your hand under the tap, you think it is hot, so you put it 
<br/>away.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The problem with ciguatera poisoning is that you cannot test the fish beforehand, you will 
<br/>only know it after you eat it.  One of the preventative measures, I think, is for people to understand 
<br/>which fish and the season when fish are usually the prevalence of ciguatera is there which is coming 
<br/>up now - October (</span><span>Vula i Balolo Lailai</span><span>) and November (</span><span>Vula i Balolo Levu</span><span>) is when fish poisoning 
<br/>occurs.  Generally, we know the fish species that are easily poisonous at this time.  I think the Ministry 
<br/>puts out some awareness material on fish.  The problem is not so much for those who live in the 
<br/>islands, they know the season, they know the fish that they should avoid.  The problem is with us in 
<br/>the urban areas where our fish identification is very bad. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Generally,  you  will  not  be  able  to  differentiate  between  the  two-spot  red  snapper  and  the 
<br/>normal mangrove jack which is a nice eating fish.  The two spot ones are poisonous one in Fiji.  I 
<br/>think the Fijian name for it is </span><span>bati</span><span>.  They look very familiar but the </span><span>bati</span><span> is the one that usually is 
<br/>poisonous.  I know in Natewa Bay, Udu Point, no fish is poisonous that side.  They think they are all 
<br/>good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fish identification, this is something that is almost disappearing now.  Our children do not 
<br/>know the Fijian name of our fish and even trees.  I think that area is also the same.  If the Ministry 
<br/>can put out public awareness during seasons like now, when ciguatera poisoning would be high, the 
<br/>risk for it is high, the types of fish to avoid, I think that will help a lot because in some cases, people 
<br/>die from fish poisoning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have on a few occasions, when lining up to buy fish and there is someone who is picking up 
<br/>one of these species that I know that are usually poisonous, I will lean across to them and tell them, 
<br/>“Do you know what that fish is?” And no, so at this time, </span><span>Bati</span><span> is not a safe fish to buy, oh okay and 
<br/>they will change. But that comes from the experience of getting fish poisoning a lot of the time and 
<br/>I was on the island, but it is an important aspect of fisheries work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, perhaps if the enforcement officers could go around and look at the fish that has been 
<br/>sold and if you see those that we should be avoiding during this time where the ciguatera poisoning 
<br/>where the chances of it is high. We should tell them that you should not be selling these types of fish. 
<br/>But it is a good initiative from the Ministry, and I think awareness is the key, because you do not see 
<br/>it, you will learn only after you eat it. And perhaps, some education on the symptoms that you get so 
<br/>that you know that when you get fish poisoning, you can go to the hospital and get the right treatment.
