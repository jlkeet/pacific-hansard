<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts 2018-2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  privileged  to  present  the  Report  of  the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  concerning  the  consolidated  review  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education, Heritage and Arts for years 2018 to 2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in accordance with Standing Order 109(2)(b), our Committee is tasked with 
<br/>scrutinising issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture and media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through our comprehensive review, we have identified several key concerns and challenges 
<br/>affecting the education sector and, we have put forward a series of recommendations to address these 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise and commend the Ministry of Education’s ongoing efforts to 
<br/>enhance the education sector through its current policies and procedures. Nevertheless, we believe 
<br/>that a thorough review of the Education Act 1966 is essential for further advancement. Additionally, 
<br/>appointing  the  Education  Commissioners  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  continued  improvement  and 
<br/>effectiveness of the Ministry’s services.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of our duties under Standing Order 110, the Committee conducted 
<br/>site  visits  to  schools  across  the  Western  and  Central  Divisions.  These  visits  highlighted  several 
<br/>concerns which we subsequently raised with the Ministry Officials during their public submissions 
<br/>to  the  Committee.  Our  Report  details  these  concerns  and  offers  actionable  recommendations  to 
<br/>address them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Permanent Secretary and her team for their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>valuable contributions to this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to acknowledge the outstanding leadership and guidance of the former Chairperson 
<br/>of  the  Committee,  honourable  Alitia  Bainivalu.  My  gratitude  also  goes  to  the  former  Committee 
<br/>Members - honourable P.K. Bala; honourable K.K. Lal</span><span> </span><span>(Alternate Member); and honourable P.K. 
<br/>Ravunawa (Alternate Member); and the current Committee Members, for their dedicated efforts in 
<br/>finalising this Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this 
<br/>Report to  Parliament and encourage all Members of this august House to review its findings  and 
<br/>recommendations.

<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report –  
<br/>Ministry of Women and Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to present the Report of the Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Social  Affairs  on  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Ministry  of  Women  and 
<br/>Poverty Alleviation 2019 to 2020 and 2020 to 2021 Annual Reports.  As mandated under Standing 
<br/>Order 109 (2)(b), the Committee looks into issues related to health, education, social service, labour, 
<br/>aviation, culture and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  period  under  review  was  during  the  time  that  Fiji  and  the  world  were  hit  by  a  global 
<br/>pandemic, COVID-19, which resulted in changes to the normal standard operating procedures.  In 
<br/>light  of  this  development,  the  Ministry  continued  to  provide  service  to  its  clients  through  the 
<br/></span><span>deployment of staff in areas that were on lockdown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through its mandatory role stipulated under Standing Order 
<br/>110, conducted a visit to the Golden Age Home and the St. Tabitha Orphanage Home in Lautoka.  
<br/>The Committee noted concerns from the visit, which were also raised with the Ministry Officials 
<br/>during their public submission to the Committee.  Moreover, the Committee highlighted concerns 
<br/>raised during the visit and identified possible recommendations.

<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  former  Chairperson  of  the

<br/>Members for their constructive input and tremendous teamwork - honourable P.K. Bala, honourable

<div><span> HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a

<div><span>HON. A. A. MAHARAJ. - Mr. Speaker Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.-  Mr. Speaker, I stand before this august House as 
<br/>the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to report back on the 
<br/>Committee’s work that had been entrusted to us by this august House.  Sir, I would like to begin by 
<br/>giving a brief background of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 was formulated to provide the legal framework for 
<br/>the establishment of the Drug-Free Sport Fiji (DFSF) as a National Anti-Doping Organisation. The 
<br/>Bill also establishes and mandates the DFSF to formulate, draft and implement proper frameworks, 
<br/>rules and educational curriculum on anti-doping in sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the main objective of DFSF is to ensure the proper implementation of, and compliance 
<br/>with, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code on creating a more accountable framework, 
<br/>which will provide strategic direction, guide and monitor the development of clean sports in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  Fiji’s  geographical  size,  the  sudden  influx  of  doping  in  sports  has  increased 
<br/>significantly  amongst  athletes.  Unless  a  National  Anti-Doping  Organisation  is  established,  it  is 
<br/>certain that Fiji will remain vulnerable to doping in sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The DFSF will be the overarching body established through the legislative frameworks of the 
<br/>UNESCO Convention against Doping in Sport and the WADA Code, which converges on all efforts 
<br/>to promote clean sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  DFSF,  Sir,  will  be  an  independent  body,  free  from  the  influence  and  interference  of 
<br/>government and sports federations. It will provide a clear and national regulatory, law enforcement, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1991 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policy and programme delivery response to doping in sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The setup of the organisation will ensure Fiji is in compliance with the world anti-doping 
<br/>standards  and  frameworks.  It  will  also  allow  Fiji  to  participate  in  future  internationally  world-
<br/>sanctioned sports events. The organisation will work in close collaboration with international anti-
<br/>doping  agencies,  sporting  bodies,  and  relevant  stakeholders  to  ensure  that  our  anti-doping  efforts 
<br/>align with global practices and uphold the principles of fair play.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee also notes that failure to comply with the Convention may result 
<br/>in the ineligibility of Fiji to bid for and host international events, forfeiture of offices and positions 
<br/>within the WADA and any other consequences pursuant to the Olympic Charter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is something we learnt during the review. The South African Rugby Team 
<br/>faced a similar consequence, whereby team they were almost sanctioned from WADA due to non-
<br/>compliance with the latest World Anti-Doping Code. Two days before the match, the South African 
<br/>Team was advised by WADA that their rugby team will not be allowed to raise their national flag or 
<br/>sing the national anthem during a rugby world cup match.  Fortunately, Sir, South Africa managed 
<br/>to appeal and had their penalties reverted. As for Fiji, the Committee is adamant that the Bill, in its 
<br/>current  amendment  form,  is  compliant  with  international  standards  and  does  not  pose  any  risk, 
<br/>especially, to our athletes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will now go into the actual work of the Committee, beginning by covering the 
<br/>process followed by the Committee for the review. The Committee, firstly, examined the Bill Clause 
<br/>by Clause and a briefing was conducted with the Drafters and the Ministry of Youth and Sports, on 
<br/>the technicalities of the Bill.  At the outset, Sir, there were miscommunications along the way that 
<br/>led  to  the  delay  of  the  review,  and  this  was,  we  were  having  two  separate  legislations  that  were 
<br/>proposed for adoption.  However, the Committee conducted its own deliberation on the Bill and noted 
<br/>the following issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to Clause 2 on the definitions of “local sports entities”, the Committee was of 
<br/>the view that there has to be some degree of inclusivity, and clarification was sought on the definition 
<br/>of ‘local sports entities’ and how other sporting bodies in Fiji are included or involved. The rationale 
<br/>was that the non-inclusion of other sports would pose risks of breach of anti-doping conditions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee further noted in Clause 2 that there was no definition classified for the term 
<br/>“athlete” in the Bill. The Committee understands that leaving the term undefined would pose an open 
<br/>field of recruitment for a person with any sporting background to be an eligible member to the DFSF 
<br/>Board. The Committee suggested that the person with limited sporting background with experience 
<br/>would be an eligible member of the DFSF Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  relation  to  Clause  21(2)(e),  the  Committee  observed  that  an  individual  committing  an 
<br/>offence could face a fine of $10,000 or a two-year prison term.  Additionally, it was noted by the 
<br/>Committee that there is no existing legislation that permits the Minister to criminalise an athlete for 
<br/>offences  committed.  The  Committee  believes  that  an  athlete  should  not  be  criminalised  for  such 
<br/>offences but should, instead, face fines or a lifetime ban if they violate anti-doping regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Clause 23, the Committee was of the view  that there should not be further inclusion of 
<br/>personal officers as suggested by the public, given that the more people involved, the more risk it 
<br/>poses on the tampering of evidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, there were other matters noted from this initial deliberation, which included the:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issue concerning the player welfare within the Bill; 
<br/>issue whether there are sufficient facilities available to conduct anti-doping testing in Fiji;  
<br/>issue whether there is an association of players established in Fiji; 
<br/>absence of appeal process to cater for athletes that have tested positive, and the Committee 
<br/>noted  in  the  current  drafting  of  the  Bill  that  the  DFSF  stands  as  a  judge,  jury  and  the 
<br/>executioner; and 
<br/>rationale of the Fiji Police Force’s involvement in the investigation process when the DFSF 
<br/>already has the mandate to investigate on matters relating to anti-doping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee was fortunate to be invited to the Annual National Sporting 
<br/>Organisation Conference that was held at the Grand Pacific Hotel in June this year. The Committee 
<br/>capitalised on the opportunity and reserved a session for public consultation on the Bill. There were 
<br/>a total of 43 sporting bodies present at this meeting whereby various suggestions and opinions were 
<br/>raised,  and  the  Committee  gave  due  consideration  to  these,  by  having  extensive  deliberation  and 
<br/>seeking legal clarification on all issues, so as to ensure that these were properly considered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the final stage of the review, the Committee resolved to make changes to the Bill, which 
<br/>could contribute to the achievement of its objectives and also comply with the World Anti-Doping 
<br/>Standards.  I will not take much time, but will just highlight a few key changes that the Committee 
<br/>recommended to be made to the Bill, and these include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>providing a broad definition of sports entities that includes a broader spectrum of sports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>federation; 
<br/>a provision to mitigate the risk of abuse of office for any person intending to assume the 
<br/>membership of the advisory council; and 
<br/>including a provision that provides responsibility to the Minister in ensuring that proper 
<br/>funding is appropriated to the functions of this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  would  like  to  thank  the  members  of  the  public  and  the 
<br/>sporting bodies that participated in the public consultation, the Permanent Secretary for Youth and 
<br/>Sports and his Team, and that provided their input on the Bill, which greatly assisted the Committee 
<br/>in its review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I wish to express my gratitude to the honourable Members of the Committee for their 
<br/>thoughtful deliberations and contributions. I also acknowledge the former members of the Committee 
<br/>who  started  off  with  the  consideration  of  the  Bill,  namely,  honourable  Koya  and  honourable 
<br/>Niudamu,  and  thank  them  for  their  insightful  contributions  in  the  initial  stages  of  the  Committee 
<br/>deliberations; and the honourable Naupoto and honourable Matasawalevu, who stepped in when the 
<br/>Substantive Members were unavailable. We thank you, Sirs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee, through this bipartisan Report and consensus, commends 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 and its amendments to Parliament.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/></span><span>20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, the Standing Committee has now tabled its Report accordingly.  The Bill will be 
<br/>debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to table his second Report.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report on the National Disaster Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I stand before this august House as 
<br/>the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights to report back on the 
<br/>Committees’ work that had been entrusted to us by this august House.  Sir, similar to my speech I 
<br/>made earlier this morning, I would like to begin with giving a brief background of the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Natural  Disaster  Risk  Management  Bill  2024  seeks  to  repeal  the  Natural  Disaster 
<br/>Management  Act  1998  and  to  make  provisions  for  disaster  risk  management  governance 
<br/>arrangements to ensure clarity and efficiency in response to new hazards and disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amongst the key changes to the Act is the expanded mandate for the disaster legislation to 
<br/>not only cover natural hazards, but now focus on all hazards that have the potential to cause disasters, 
<br/>with the exception of civil unrest and terrorism.  This is in line with all the hazards approach for 
<br/>disaster and disaster risk management that is the global best practice, and which is promoted under 
<br/>Fiji’s  National  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Policy  and  the  Sendai  Framework  for  Disaster  Risk 
<br/>Reduction,  the  global  framework  guiding  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  (DRR)  and  Disaster  Risk 
<br/>Management (DRM) across the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also places emphasis on disaster risk reduction and its practical application in the 
<br/>form of disaster risk management measures, due to the growing recognition of the role that early 
<br/>mitigation and prevention of risk plays in the alleviation and avoidance of disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that regard, the Bill will now be known as the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 
<br/>2024 as opposed to its former title of Natural Disaster Management Act 2024, reflecting its expanded 
<br/>scope on all hazards rather than just natural phenomena and its focus on disaster risk management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same vein, Mr. Speaker, the Act amalgamates the functions of the current Preparedness 
<br/>and Mitigation  Sub-Committees  to  form  the Disaster Risk  Reduction Sub-Committee, which will 
<br/>now  be  responsible  for  all  disaster  risk  management  activities,  except  those  for  disaster  and 
<br/>emergency response, which remains the mandate of the Emergency Sub-Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  formalises  and  legislates  the  Fiji  Cluster  System  for  better  coordination  of 
<br/>humanitarian actors in the country.  The Fiji Cluster System will foster collaboration and partnership 
<br/>across mechanisms and institutions for the implementation of instruments relevant to disaster risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the subnational disaster risk management arrangements, the Bill allows for the 
<br/>establishment of the Disaster Risk Management Committees at Divisional, Provincial, District and 
<br/>Community  levels.  This  will  strengthen  coordination  for  preparedness,  response,  disaster 
<br/>management, and climate change adaptation at all levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also provides for the establishment of subnational offices of the NDMO to be headed by 
<br/>Divisional  Disaster  Risk  Management  Officers,  which  will  ensure  the  mainstreaming  and  the 
<br/>coordination  of  activities  and  provision  of  advice  to  Divisional  Commissioners  on  subnational 
<br/>activities related to disaster risk management, disaster risk reduction and disaster management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  strengthens  the  role  of  Disaster  Service  Liaison  Officers  (DSLO),  who  are 
<br/>government agency focal points for disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management across all 
<br/>Government  Ministries.    The  DSLOs’  role  was  provided  for  under  a  single  provision  in  the  Act.  
<br/>However, past experience and the feedback from consultations, have demonstrated the critical role 
<br/>that  DSLOs  play  for  the  implementation  of  disaster  risk  management  through  all  Government 
<br/>Ministries.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also encompasses the regulation of international aid, featuring provisions designed 
<br/>to  mitigate  any  adverse  consequences  stemming  from  unsolicited  bilateral  donations  to  oversee 
<br/>assistance that could potentially contribute to the issue of disaster-generated waste. Additionally, it 
<br/>includes the establishment of Single Window International facilitation teams.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (IMEWS) is developed and functional 
<br/>across all levels. There are provisions in the draft Bill that establishes an Integrated Multi-Hazard 
<br/>Early Warning System at the national level by linking the existing various early warning systems that 
<br/>exist  in  various  sectors  and  institutions.  The  technical  capacity  for  hazard  monitoring  and  early 
<br/>warning is proposed to be housed in the National Emergency Operations Center and be linked to all 
<br/>key institutions issuing early warning in real time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regards  to  Disaster  Risk  Management  Volunteers,  this  provision  requires  volunteer 
<br/>organisations to formally register their intentions to engage disaster volunteers. The aim is to provide 
<br/>a protective framework for volunteers, safeguarding them from any potential violations during their 
<br/>participation in disaster response efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I will now go into the actual work of the Committee, beginning by covering the 
<br/>process followed by the Committee for the review. The Committee, firstly, examined the Bill Clause 
<br/>by Clause and a briefing was conducted with the Drafter and the Ministry of Rural and Maritime 
<br/>Development on the technicalities of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  the  Committee  conducted  its  own  deliberation  on  the  Bill  and  noted  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>With respect to Clause 28, the Committee noted that the Ministry of Health, the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in coordination with NDMO, have specifically 
<br/>confined  their  roles  to  facilitate  international  assistance  for  the  purpose  of  providing 
<br/>assistance  to  victim  identification  and  mortuary  services.  With  regard  to  international 
<br/>assistance to other needed services required in disaster recovery, clarification was sought 
<br/>in removing certain words from the Clause that could possibly address this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>With regards to Clause 30, the Committee noted that the Disaster Service Liaison Officer 
<br/>established in the Bill has significant roles and functions, and clarification was sought on 
<br/>the due process in situations whereby the person holding the position is absent from the 
<br/>office. Who, in this case, does take up the role as per the establishment of this particular 
<br/>provision? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In relation to Clause 33, the Committee noted there were two actions specified in the Clause 
<br/>which provides for international assistance to waive quarantine requirements, specifically 
<br/>with regards to rescue dogs. Thus, in the same provision, it states that this assistance should 
<br/>comply  with  quarantine  requirements,  which  led  to  the  Committee  to  seek  clarification 
<br/>from the Ministry, particularly regarding the intent to bypass the 14-day quarantine period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, there were other matters noted from this initial deliberation, which included the 
<br/></span><span>undefined terminology that are listed in the Bill and the issue of drafting on certain Clauses of the 
<br/></span><span>Bill that were not clear.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the final stage of the review, the Committee resolved to make changes to the Bill, which 
<br/>could contribute to the achievement of its objectives. Some of these recommendations, Sir, have been 
<br/>reflected in the amendment to the Bill.
