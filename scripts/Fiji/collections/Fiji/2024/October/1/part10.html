<div><span>Honourable Speaker - South Australian Parliament

<div><span>Establishment of Sub-Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  having  discussed  the  audit  issue  which  was  tabled  by  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee in the last sitting period with the Business Committee, please, take note of the 
<br/>unresolved  issues  reported  by  the  honourable  Chairperson.  You  have  done  a  wonderful  job, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Chairperson, by fully reporting all that you are supposed to be reporting, even the missing 
<br/></span><span>files and those that have disappeared, to be interviewed.  We are grateful that the honourable Speaker

<div><span>Communications from the Speaker 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1987 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from  Adelaide,  the  Deputy  High  Commissioner,  together  with  the  First  Secretary  –  Ms.  Rebecca 
<br/>Brown, are here to witness this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am invoking Standing Order 20 for the purposes of ensuring oversight and scrutiny in this 
<br/>serious matter.  I hope you are all listening.  In that regard, pursuant to Standing Orders 20, I am now 
<br/>calling  for  the  establishment  of  a  Sub-Committee,  under  Standing  Order  122,  and  that  Sub-
<br/>Committee will further investigate the unresolved issues and report back to my Office.  My Office 
<br/>will determine the membership of the Sub-Committee, as well as issue a Terms of Reference, and 
<br/>the Sub-Committee will report back to my Office as per the deadline that will be issued to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all, honourable Members, </span><span>vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a point of clarification, this is with regards 
<br/>to your ruling this morning.  For the information of honourable Members in this august House, quite 
<br/>interestingly, this Report was initiated by a former Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Housing  Authority  was  always  audited  by  KPMG.    This  special 
<br/>investigation was done as per the official request coming from the Minister to the Board, and then a 
<br/>special investigation was carried out.  Just because the Office of the Auditor-General was involved 
<br/>in carrying out this special investigation, this particular Report ended up in Parliament as per Audit 
<br/>Act 1965.  Had the Minister back then used any other audit agency, for example, BDO, that Report 
<br/>would not have ended up in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, can we first identify as to how this Report ended up in Parliament in the first place?  If it 
<br/>was BDO, that Report would not have come here because after that Report itself, KPMG did another 
<br/>report and a special investigation into Housing Authority on the same case and that Report was never 
<br/>tabled in Parliament.  So, there are certain clarifications, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that need to be made well 
<br/>before we can go into what you have recommended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is no issue in forming a Sub-Committee, Sir, but for the sake of clarification, I thought 
<br/>of bringing this  to  the floor of Parliament, that  there was another report  which was  not  tabled in 
<br/>Parliament.  This was initiated by a Minister, and it should have been reported back to the Minister 
<br/>because the Minister initiated that particular investigation.  It was not something that was done or 
<br/>initiated by the Office of the Auditor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although the law says that any audit carried out by the Office of the Auditor-General should 
<br/>be tabled in Parliament, however, this was a very special case, Mr. Speaker.  That Report should have 
<br/>been dealt with by the Board and the Minister, rather than it coming to Parliament and then referred 
<br/>to the Public Accounts Committee.  The honourable Attorney-General is here and he can provide 
<br/>clarification at a later stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no, it is not for the honourable Attorney-General to rule on this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No, the ruling is definitely from you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am ruling on this based on the content of the Report that was elaborated 
<br/></span><span>upon by the honourable Chairperson of the Committee, and based on his Report, things should have 
<br/>ended there.  But, again, there are very serious issues highlighted by the Chairperson based on the 
<br/>Performance Audit Report that we need to look into; one is the disappearance of files, secondly, those 
<br/>who were supposed to be interviewed are no longer there.  Taxpayers’ money, honourable Member, 
<br/>has been used. We need to go through this with a thorough investigation.

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since we have the powers that we have taken on board after the trip down to Melbourne and 
<br/>Canberra,  it  is  only  proper,  honourable  Member,  that  we  kick  in  the  powers  to  scrutinise  and  do 
<br/>oversight  on these particular areas, so we dig  more into that.  That  is  why we had discussed this 
<br/>thoroughly in the Business Committee.  The powers are with me, and I am invoking those powers to 
<br/>the establishment of the Sub-Committee and a Terms of Reference be provided also, and then we 
<br/>will take it from there.  That is all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that second report is still there with you, then we will see because we are working on a 
<br/>Performance  Audit  done  by  the  Auditor-General.    Again,  the  honourable  Attorney-General  has 
<br/>provided the audit review which we will be conducting sometimes this week and maybe you can 
<br/>bring that in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ. - That was exactly my point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we are going 
<br/>to debate a Bill that is supposed to amend the Audit Act, in future, if any Minister or anyone conducts 
<br/>a special investigation which is not done by the Office of Auditor-General, that Report also needs to 
<br/>be presented in Parliament. That is all I am saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Well, it was not  presented by the honourable Chairperson.  We are just 
<br/>working  on the report that  was tabled here by the  honourable Chairperson, and that is  all we are 
<br/>doing.  If you want to bring that in, then you can bring that in through the Sub-Committee. Am I 
<br/>clear?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to be moving forward, honourable Member, and we need to try and utilise these 
<br/>powers that we have - the powers of scrutiny and oversight, so that not only are we at par with our 
<br/>counterparts in Australia and New Zealand, but at the same time, we are gearing towards something 
<br/>that will bring out the best in whatever we do. People can have faith and continue to trust in what our 
<br/>Parliament is doing.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There will be no further questions on that.   I have made my ruling, honourable Members, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>let us abide by that.  
<br/></span></div>
