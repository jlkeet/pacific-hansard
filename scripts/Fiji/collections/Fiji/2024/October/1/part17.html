<div><span>REVIEW REPORT ON FIJI MEAT INDUSTRY BOARD 2018-2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. KIRAN. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  the  Parliament  debates  the  review  report  for  the  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Reports 2018 to 2022 which was tabled on 4</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Cabinet  Ministers,  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, Members of Parliament, I am honoured to present the review report of Fiji Meat Industry 
<br/>Board 2018 to 2022 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Meat Industry Board (FMIB) was established under the Fiji Meat Industry Act 237 
<br/>of 1970.  In 1976, Suva Abattoir was established at Nasinu 9 miles to provide slaughtering services 
<br/>in the Central Division. The Suva property sits on 35.4 hectares of State land, the land has a 75-year 
<br/>Crown lease granted on 1st July, 1976. The Vuda Abattoir was established later at Vuda Point in 
<br/>1983, it caters for the Western Division and sits on 7.35 hectares of Native land with a land tenure of 
<br/>75 acres Native lease granted on 1st January, 1982.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pertinent issues identified by the Committee are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The Fiji Meat Industry Board incurred losses from 2018 to 2021 except in 2022 when it 
<br/>recorded  a small profit  of $108,134 This profit is largely attributed to  a  reduction in the 
<br/>number of employees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The ongoing losses have been driven by low throughput and the rising cost of operation.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Currently the Abattoir is not working at full capacity due to decline in livestock numbers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>resulting in low number of livestock going to the abattoir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The livestock numbers have steadily declined over the years. The decline poses a broader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are several challenges affecting FMIB, I will just mention a couple: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>An urgent need for investment to modernise facilities to meet new requirements for food 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>handling hygiene and security; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>A review of the Meat Act is urgently needed to address the current issues facing the meat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>The  Board  has  $31.9  million  worth  of  investment  property,  primarily  consisting  of  land 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is yielding no returns for the company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend my appreciation to the Chairperson of the Fiji Meat Industry Board, Dr. 
<br/>Kenneth Cokanasiga, and his staff for the timely assistance in this inquiry.  I would also like to thank our 
<br/>Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this Report: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister, Office of the Prime Minister – Chairperson; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister, Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A. Bia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also thank the Secretariat for their invaluable support.

<div><span>     Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have just been 
<br/>given the list of speakers, four have been identified by both the Whips, and the batting will be led off 
<br/>by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Nand; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprise and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before the House.  I 
<br/>thank the Members of the Standing Committee for their work on the Report.  As the mover of the 
<br/>motion had already said, the Fiji Meat Industry Board was established in 1976 via under the Fiji Meat 
<br/>Industry Act 1970.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Report, there are three main issues that has been identified: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Aging equipment and set up. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Lower throughput.  The Abattoir, at the moment, is operating below 50 percent capacity.  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Economic viability of the Abattoir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They have always recorded a loss, except 2022, and this was attributed to staff reduction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that all three issues can be solved by vertical integration. Vertical 
<br/>integration  refers  to  FMIB’s  strategy  of  controlling  multiple  stages  of  sourcing,  processing, 
<br/>marketing and distribution within the meat industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  do  not  see  any  reason  why  Yaqara  Pastoral  Company  and  Fiji  Meat 
<br/>Industry Board needs to operate under two separate entities, two different boards, two separate CEOs 
<br/>and two separate fully  functional  offices.  This  can be integrated to  bring about  efficiency in  the 
<br/>system and there is no reason why both the entities cannot operate under one board and one CEO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Fiji Meat Industry Board, vertical integration is possible in the following ways: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Supply Chain control – Fiji Meat Industry Board merges with Yaqara Pastoral Company to 
<br/>ensure consistent supply of animals.  This helps in managing the cost, ensuring the quality 
<br/>and  ensuring  availability  of  animals  for  slaughter.    This  can  be  supplemented  by  the 
<br/>Government’s  beef  schemes  which  I  understand  should  be  a  multiplication  centres  and 
<br/>distributed around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Processing  and  Packaging  –  FMIB  already  has  two  abattoirs  that  can  be  upgraded  with 
<br/>Government’s assistance and the money is saved by removing one set of overheads.  The 
<br/>second is FMIB can get into value adding products, expanding production into sausages, 
<br/>cured meats and ready-to-cook cuts.  This can diversify the income streams and enhance 
<br/>profitability of the organisation.  FMIB already has an established distribution mechanism 
<br/></span><span>and this can be further enhanced to increase efficiency; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Retail operations – I believe the last part of vertical integration is ensuring you meet your 
<br/>customers  from  farm  to  fork.    FMIB  can  operate  a  retail  butcher  and  operate  their  own 
<br/>butchers, allowing them to sell directly to the consumers and enhance profitability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Waste management - FMIB already has a rendering plant.  I am sure that with little  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2035 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   more  investment,  its  efficiency  can  be  enhanced.    This  can  generate  more  income  by 
<br/>selling the by-products of the rendering plant to the other industries.  However, I have 
<br/>heard a lot of complaints from residents around that area of the foul smell.  Probably they 
<br/>should  start  working  on  the  foul  smell  coming  out  of  the  rendering  plant  and  be 
<br/>eliminated somehow.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  benefits  from  the  vertical  integration  or  merging  the  three  elements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would be: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Cost  control  -  we  will  be  able  to  reduce  the  cost  of  all  the  various  stages,  ensuring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>profitability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Better price to suppliers – the supplier farms can get a better price for the animal supplied 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the abattoirs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Market  stability  –  by  merging  with  Yaqara  Pastoral  Company,  FMIB  can  stabilise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operations against market fluctuations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Customer  trust  -  direct  involvement  in  all  stages  of  production,  FMIB  can  build  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consumer-supplier trust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Ensure quality - greater quality control in the supply chain can improve the quality and 
<br/>safety of the meat products.  Currently most of the animals going through the abattoirs are 
<br/>mostly  culled  animals  from the cane  belt areas or  culled  animals  from the  dairy  farms.  
<br/>Because of that, FMIB fails to supply quality that the consumers frequently look for or 
<br/>demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the tourism sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a huge demand of premium cuts and most of 
<br/>it is supplied through imported meat.  If you are not able to maintain that quality and supply, we will 
<br/>be able to hit the hotel industry.  This industry wants two things: quality and consistency, and that is 
<br/>where we fail.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  doing  this  needs  commitment  from  the  industry,  and  more 
<br/>specifically from the Government. It requires capital investment and expanding operation requires 
<br/>significant investment of resources.  It also requires investment in training so that you can cross-train 
<br/>staff in all aspects, from rearing, processing and selling.  It will also require a significant investment 
<br/>in enterprise and management software, so that it is easier to maintain all stages of the process.  The 
<br/>most important  one, it requires  amendments  to  the legislation to  ensure that  both  the  entities can 
<br/>operate under one umbrella.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  believe  vertical  integration  will  be  able  to  solve  most  of  the  issues 
<br/>identified in this Report.  If this Government is interested in ensuring sustainability of FMIB and the 
<br/>meat industry in Fiji, I am sure it will act sooner than later.  With those words, I support the motion 
<br/>before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Chairperson  for 
<br/>presenting  the  Report  and  honourable  Sachida  Nand  for  his  contribution.    I  also  thank  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for the work they have put in, 
<br/>in  compiling  this  Report.    As  I  have  done  with  the  various  reports  dealt  with  previously,  as  line 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Public Enterprises, I will go straight into the recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree with what the honourable Sachida Nand had said.  He is sure and I am committed that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the recommendations will be carried out by the FMIB.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1 
<br/>The Committee commends FMIB for developing its 5-year Strategic Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>2036 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  preparation  of  the  five-year  strategic  plan  from  2024  to  2028  was  launched  in  2021. 
<br/>While the pandemic delayed the progress on the development of the plan, FMIB’s five-year strategic 
<br/>plan was successfully completed in 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Various stakeholders had also been consulted throughout the drafting process including the 
<br/>Fiji Crop and Livestock Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Finance, private sector and 
<br/>farmers involved in the livestock industry for their feedback on the plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as the honourable Nand had alluded to, consistent and quality supply of animals 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will continue to be a problem with FMIB when we rely on hobby livestock farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The strategic plan focuses on four important things including business model and commercial 
<br/>sustainability, legal framework and governance, aged facilities and suitability of location and quality 
<br/>standards of people and processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have right now a group of young men and women who have gone to 
<br/>New Zealand and Australia and many of them work in meat industries. I am sure that when they 
<br/>come back, if there are opportunity available for them to be employed in the Fiji Meat Industry, they 
<br/>would perform very well and would raise the quality of workmanship in those facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2 
<br/>That,  Fiji  Meat  Industry Board include  a performance matrix aligned with  the KPIs in all 
<br/>future annual reports to justify budgetary allocations, demonstrate accountability and ensure 
<br/>a thorough and transparent assessment of its performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  recommendation  is  noted.    It  should  also  be  noted  that  while  FMIB  is 
<br/>collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture in terms of increasing supply of animals to its abattoirs, 
<br/>it does not have direct control over the said supply. In view of these external factors hindering FMIB’s 
<br/>performance may not be accurately reflected in the performance matrix. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That being said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it should also be noted that FMIB’s recent annual reports 
<br/>particularly the 2021 – 2022 Report comprise of not only the background and financial statements of 
<br/>the  entirety  of  the  entity,  but  also  has  specific  sections  on  its  finances,  its  operations,  quality 
<br/>assurance, its achievements and its challenges, human resources and future plans. The finance section 
<br/>of the Annual Report includes a high level comparative financial analysis between the current and 
<br/>prior financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FMIB will take into consideration the Committee’s recommendation and 
<br/>determine the best method to enhance accountable and transparent reporting of its performance in its 
<br/>future annual reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 3 
<br/>That,  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board  should  report  on  relevant  SDGs  in  its  annual  reports  as 
<br/>required by the Parliament, to align with Fiji’s commitment to the international goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  recommendation  is  noted.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board 
<br/></span><span>recognizes the importance of environmental sustainability and adopts values that promote responsible 
<br/>resource-use waste reduction, energy efficiency and eco-friendly practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  fact,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Board  quality  assurance  team  monitors 
<br/>environmental related issues and assist in addressing the same, so that Fiji Meat Industry Board is 
<br/>operating  in  a  more  environmentally  friendly  manner.  Fiji  Meats  Industry  Board  had  also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>     Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2037 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>concentrated  its  efforts  in  modernizing  its  abattoirs  to  move  towards  more  cost  efficient  and 
<br/>environmentally friendly operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 4 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  the  Review  of  the  FMIB  pricing  strategy  that  is  needed  to 
<br/>mitigate  ongoing  losses.  Additionally  operational  efficiency  should  be  explored  to  reduce 
<br/>costs without compromising service quality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That recommendation is noted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  accordance with  the  Fiji  Meat  Industry  Act  of 1969, the Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture  may  prescribe  levies  or  charges  in  respect  of  the  slaughtering  of  animals.  Therefore, 
<br/>FMIB slaughter fees are regulated, and the entity does not have arbitrary control over its fees. Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  FMIB  slaughter  fees  were  last  reviewed  and  increased  in  November  2023,  after  18 
<br/>years. Therefore, FMIB pricing has increased but the impact will be seen in the 2024 financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 5  
<br/>The Committee recommends addressing the underutilisation of the Abattoir as mentioned by 
<br/>the  honourable  Nand.  It  is  recommended  that  FMIB,  in  collaboration  with  relevant 
<br/>stakeholders,  particularly  with  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways,  implement 
<br/>strategies to increase livestock numbers. This includes providing targeted support to farmers 
<br/>to boost livestock production to not only break even, but to make profits and to make FMIB 
<br/>self-sufficient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That recommendation is also noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FMIB are jointly working to identify solutions for the decrease in supply of livestock.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  regard  to  current  initiatives  employed  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the  Ministry  is 
<br/>providing  assistance  to  farmers  around  Fiji  in  terms  of  breed  research,  pasture  management  and 
<br/>providing grants for fencing kit support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  know  that  many,  many  years  ago,  we  copra  producers  used  to  have 
<br/>assistance. But mostly from our </span><span>lavo musu </span><span>ni </span><span>iTaukei,</span><span> where we would put our deduction or the funds 
<br/>into the iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>Affairs. I do not know whether they can continue to do that, but many of the coconut 
<br/>growers we have in the islands can easily be developed with pasture grown to produce quality animals 
<br/>for the abattoirs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the Review 
<br/>Report for the Fiji Meat Industry Board 2018-2022 Annual Reports.  I want to begin by thanking the 
<br/>Committee for putting the Report together and their ability to critically analyse and identify the issues 
<br/>at the Fiji Meat Industry Board, is commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  noted  that,  honourable  Nand  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has 
<br/>covered most of the items highlighted in the recommendations and in the findings. I will therefore 
<br/>touch on one or two parts of the investigation and some recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost we must acknowledge that FMIB has faced significant 
<br/>financial difficulties, incurring losses from 2018 to 2021 with only a small profit recorded in 2022 
<br/>due to what the Report stated as workforce reductions. The core issues of low through put and high 
<br/>operating costs remain consistent challenges that we must confront head on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the underutilisation of our abattoir is alarming. This decline is largely driven by  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>2038 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decreasing  livestock  numbers  compounded  by  an  increase  in  diseases  like  tuberculosis  and 
<br/>brucellosis, as well as the decline in the sugarcane farmers engaging in livestock rearing. The poor 
<br/>pasture management and rising feed costs further complicates this issue. The truth is, if we do not act 
<br/>swiftly, we risk undermining our meat industries viability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the facilities require urgent modernisation to meet contemporary food handling 
<br/>and hygiene and security standards.  It  is  unacceptable that our infrastructure lags behind  current 
<br/>requirements and we must prioritise upgrading these facilities to ensure safe and efficient operations. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, we cannot look or overlook the need for comprehensive review of the 
<br/>Meat Industry Act. The legislation must be updated to address the ‘my right’ challenges facing the 
<br/>industry today. So, without this critical step, we will continue to hinder progress and innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cooperation is essential, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Currently, the partnership between FMIB and the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture, according to the Report is not functioning effectively. We must foster better 
<br/>cooperation, not just with the Ministry but also with stakeholders like Yaqara Pastoral to announce 
<br/>livestock production and maximise the abattoirs operational capacity. To that end Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I strongly support the Committee’s recommendations which include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>FMIB must review rising strategies and explore operational efficiencies to ensure financial 
<br/>stability.  FMIB must get back to its feet and explore ways and means to grow in its financial 
<br/>capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Collaboration  with  stakeholders  is  crucial  to  increase  livestock  supplies  to  the  abattoir 
<br/>which  is  not  operating  to  its  full  capacity  at  the  moment.  The  equation  is  simple,  no 
<br/>livestock, no abattoir work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The relocating and modernisation facilities will enable FMIB to meet food hygiene and 
<br/>safety standards.  The market flavour and attraction depends on standards offered by FMIB. 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>A thorough review of the Meat Act is essential to address the current challenges we face. 
<br/>The principle is clear, if products and its quality are to be enhanced, then processes and 
<br/>systems demands a review.  Obviously, in this case, the Act must go back on the table for 
<br/>review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>We must put to an end bush slaughter practices which compromise meat safety and quality. 
<br/>It is a sensitive issue to some level but if we are serious about standards and quality, we 
<br/>must take immediate and prompt action on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Revising the farmers payment process to include offer way is a necessary step towards 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fairness and transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, merging the operations of FMIB and Yaqara Pastoral and make them report 
<br/>to  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  can  create  a  more  cohesive  strategy  for  livestock 
<br/>production. FMIB will lead to reliable and consistent livestock supply, something they can manage 
<br/>and control and that is only possible on the involvement of the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, introducing a meat grading system will enhance the quality and marketability of meat 
<br/>products in Fiji. To conclude Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FMIB is at a crossroad. The decisions we make 
<br/>today will shape the future of our meat industry and livelihoods of countless farmers. I urge each of 
<br/>you honourable Members to prioritise these recommendations and work collaboratively to revitalise 
<br/></span><span>the  FMIB  and  secure  a  prosperous  future  for  Fiji  Meats  Industry.  With  all  that  being  said,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now offer the floor to the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways. The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>floor is yours.

<div><span>     Review Report – FMIB 2016-2019 Annual Reports  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2039 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Standing Committee 
<br/>for  the  analysis  of  those  reports  from  2018  to  2022.    All  in  all,  the  major  challenge  across  our 
<br/>livestock numbers, formerly slaughtered was the COVID-19 pandemic. Cattle numbers decreased 
<br/>after  the  COVID-19  pandemic  due  to  restrictions  of  movement,  however  this  had  gradually 
<br/>improved, and it is better than pre-COVID-19 days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For pigs, the numbers drastically reduced due to the closure of hotels, high-end restaurant and 
<br/>outlets during COVID-19. The breeding stock in commercial farms also  reduced and some farms 
<br/>ceased their operations. Breeding stock takes time, we expect high numbers now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For goats, it increased in number, having been the impact of government assistance where 
<br/>farmers  were  also  encouraged  to  supply  formerly  to  the  abattoir.  Sheep  hazard  made  challenges 
<br/>during COVID-19 due to restrictions of movement where farmers held on to their stock however, the 
<br/>average rate of animals supplied has increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  government  consistent  support,  farmers  have  recovered  and 
<br/>bounced  back  stronger,  contributing  to  high  production  levels.  Programmes  planned  in  the  2023-
<br/>2024 financial year and now in the 2024-2025 financial year has targeted to boost the livestock sector 
<br/>and ensure that we utilise the capacity of our abattoirs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a list of programmes that is currently being implemented by the Ministry, notable is 
<br/>the Beef Breeding Programme which is $1.04 million; the Beef Revitalisation Programme of $1.5 
<br/>million; and the upgrade of the Nasinu and Vuda abattoir with an allocation of $400,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, large scale intensive technology is a proposed solution that enables farmers 
<br/>to raise up by numbers and quality to the abattoirs. The rapid multiplication that is currently underway 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  through  artificial  insemination  and  embryo  transfer  will  contribute  to  the 
<br/>improvement in the throughput to the abattoir over the next few years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the experiences that we have gone through is the failure 
<br/>of farmers to re-invest into their operations locally. This has been a long-standing issue where we 
<br/>have tried to encourage our local livestock, even dairy farmers to re-invest into their operations, but 
<br/>very little has been done.  I think the offer of assistance year in, year out by the Ministry, farmers are 
<br/>sort of getting  used to  being  assisted all the time. But  then the commitment must come from  the 
<br/>farmers  themselves,  from  the  industry  themselves  to  see  that  they  re-invest  into  their  farming 
<br/>operations before government comes in with its assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we are upgrading the abattoir facilities, plans and consultations are 
<br/>also underway between government and stakeholders on the relocation of the Nakasi abattoir given 
<br/>the expanding residential and business lots in the area. Having said that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support 
<br/>the motion before Parliament, and I thank you for the opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is obvious that the Fiji Meats Industry Board (FMIB) 
<br/>is a crucial entity for the value chain of livestock and availability of quality meat for our consumers.  
<br/>I thank the honourable Minister for sharing in-depth, the processes in place for improving the work 
<br/></span><span>of FMIB, and I would like to thank all honourable Members who have contributed.  We hope that 
<br/></span><span>the  Board  will  take  this  into  consideration,  and  we  look  forward  to  the  implementation  of  the 
<br/>recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, I thank you, Mr. speaker.
