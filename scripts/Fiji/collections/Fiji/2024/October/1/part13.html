<div><span>Oral Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Honourable members, this is the first oral question for today and I have 
<br/>approved the request from the Government Whip for Oral Question No. 228/2024 to be asked on 
<br/>Thursday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 228/2024 deferred) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  second  Oral  Question  for  today,  honourable  Members,  please,  take  note  that  Oral 
<br/>Question  No.  229/2024  has  been  adequately  addressed  through  Ministerial  Statement  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister earlier today, even though the honourable Prime Minister has insisted that 
<br/>the question continue.

<div><span>Questions  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, I would like to bring to your notice, honourable Members, that I will be 
<br/>very strict next time around.  Once the author of the question is not present, then that question lapses.  
<br/>So, we are kind of going back to the old ways when we deal with those who are not present, and they 
<br/>have questions under their name to be asked. So, for this one here, the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>has stated or has alluded in his Statement that he would like to see that this question is raised. So, 
<br/>that is your question, honourable Tunabuna. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.-  Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like to withdraw my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 229/2024 withdrawn) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Grants for Persons with Disabilities 
<br/>(Question No. 230/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform 
<br/>Parliament  as  to  the  types  of  grants  provided  to  organisations  for  persons  with 
<br/>disability? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to wish all Members a Happy 
<br/>Pinktober Month.  As we raise awareness  on the issue of breast  cancer,  I would like to invite all 
<br/>honourable  Ministers  and  ministerial  departments  and  Opposition  Chambers  as  well  to  host  their 
<br/>morning  tea  to  raise  funds  for  the  Fiji  Cancer  Society,  as  is  usual  practice  during  the  month  of 
<br/>October.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question  regarding  the  types  of 
<br/>grants  provided  to  organisations  for  persons  with  disability.  I  give  credit  to  the  former  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government for initiating the grants to organisations for persons with disabilities in 2017, during a 
<br/>face-to-face  budget  consultation  organised  by  the  then  Ministry  of  Economy  that  was  done  in 
<br/>Lautoka and Suva and where the organisations requested for grants to help with operations and capital 
<br/>purchases  from  the  Government.  That  request  was  approved  in  the  same  financial  year  and  $1.1 
<br/>million was allocated for the grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government continues to fund organisations for persons with disabilities, 
<br/>but over the years, due to the low utilisation as a result of various things including lack of audited 
<br/>reports and acquittals, as well as deregistration issues, the fund has been reduced to $300,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  inception  of  this  grant,  Government  tries  to  provide  capacity 
<br/>building  on  the  financial  requirements  of  the  grant,  and  at  the  same  time,  ensuring  that  these 
<br/>organisations  are  assisted,  and  we  have  had  good  technical  assistance  from  the  Pacific  Disability 
<br/>Forum, as well as our donor and development partners. So, this is provided to these organisations 
<br/>who are the recipients of the grant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  course,  we  conduct  an  analysis  on  those  that  need  this  grant  and  so 
<br/></span><span>recipients are chosen through the usual process. We do want to acknowledge our core partners, such 
<br/></span><span>as DFAT, UNFPA, AUSFACILITY, MFAT, UNICEF and others, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this measure is a priority area for the Ministry. Now, while we look after 
<br/>the human resources and operating costs for these organisations, the development partners help to 
<br/>fund their other various activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2013 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had alluded earlier about the need for a continued capacity building for 
<br/>these organisations to account back and to acquit on what they use, as well as the need to generally 
<br/>have more activities by these organisations for our people with disabilities and more engagement in 
<br/>the community, we encourage the SMEs in the hope that this will improve, which would mean more 
<br/>funding  requests  and  more  funding  allocated  in  the  budget  for  these  organisations.    But  we  are 
<br/>committed, Sir, as a Ministry to attend to the needs of our disability service providers, as well as our 
<br/>persons with disabilities, to improve social inclusion and access to these services. Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  a  very  simple  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Women;  for  future  developments,  how  is  your  Ministry  promoting  and  ensuring 
<br/>disability inclusive infrastructure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a very good question. As we look across the 
<br/>Ministries  and  their  programmes,  there  is  certainly  a  need  for  disability  mainstreaming  in  other 
<br/>Ministries. I am happy to share in this Parliament that even programmes are now moving towards 
<br/>disability  inclusion,  including  the  Ministry  of  Housing,  where  they  currently  have  a  budgetary 
<br/>allocation for disability retrofitting. So, retrofitting of housing for people with disabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what they are committing to in moving forward as we are looking 
<br/>at the affordable housing scheme for low-income earners, is also to have allocation for people living 
<br/>with disabilities, especially accessibility on the bottom floor, to ensure that across development of 
<br/>projects, that there are disability inclusive access. As far as working with the Town Councils  and 
<br/>City  Councils,  there  is  also  an  opportunity  in  terms  of  disability  parking,  as  well  as  making  our 
<br/>restaurants and buildings to conform to a building code which needs disability access as well, and 
<br/>that is something that we are also working on with the line Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  hope  that  that  will  be  realised.    Of  course,  it  takes  budget  allocations,  but  there  is  a 
<br/>commitment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the  Coalition  Government  to  ensure  that  there  is  disability 
<br/>inclusion and mainstreaming across the Ministries. Our Ministry is committed also.  As we deal with 
<br/>people with disabilities, hopefully, there is a department under the Ministry dedicated towards people 
<br/>living with disabilities which is also our commitment under the Convention on the Rights of People 
<br/>with Disabilities, so we hope to move towards that as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Thank you.  I have a question, is it already part of the building code?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA - Yes, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There should be provisions made for people that are suffering from some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kind of disability, for example, wheelchairs and all that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA - Yes, as I understand it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is part of the building 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>code. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for what 
<br/>has  already been mentioned about  the allowances  that people with  disabilities    are receiving. My 
<br/></span><span>question is, are people with disabilities receiving the same allowance or it depends on the type of 
<br/></span><span>disability that they have? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe the question is related. This is about our 
<br/>people  with  disabilities  receiving  the  disability  allowance  under  Social  Protection.  Yes,  there  are 
<br/>certain  disabilities  that  are  certified  by  doctors,  that  are  accepted  by  the  Ministry.  It  is  not  all 
<br/>disabilities, but certainly the ones where we receive from a doctor a certificate, that qualifies them to 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to receive disability allowance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  her 
<br/>responses.  We want to ensure that no one is left behind and, particularly, the physically challenged 
<br/>are not deprived of such assistance. My question is on data. Do we have data that captures those who 
<br/>come under your list? And if so, how current is it? The other part to the question is, what would you 
<br/>expect from us and stakeholders in order to assist in this regard?  I ask this question because as a 
<br/>former Commissioner, we would go around and they would ask for wheelchairs, crutches, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition. Yes, data is always 
<br/>important, as we formulate policies, for our people living with disabilities. I want to acknowledge 
<br/>the  support  of  DFAT  in  assisting  the  National  Council  for  Persons  with  Disabilities  (NCPD)  in 
<br/>collecting data, so that is what they are currently undertaking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The difficulty they are facing is, of course, accessing data from Ministries and Departments, 
<br/>as well as the Fiji Bureau of Statistics.  We have constantly been reminded by our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister that we should be able to access data across Ministries, that we do not necessarily need an 
<br/>MOU to be receiving data from each other. I think that this is something that we trying to improve 
<br/>on in terms of sharing data across Ministries. But, as far as going outside to a stakeholder, like NCPD, 
<br/>there is still that process they need to follow in order to access the data, but DFAT in assisting NCPD 
<br/>has been very helpful.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we are also using this data to formulate our National Disability Policy, which is in draft 
<br/>form at the moment, so it is informing that Policy which is yet to come to Cabinet. We are finalising 
<br/>that as well because there were some issues that we had as a Ministry towards reviewing the Policy. 
<br/>I thank Dr. Helen Tavola, who is the consultant from DFAT and has been spearheading that, working 
<br/>with NCPD, but the collection of data is crucial to formulating the Policy, so that certainly helps us 
<br/>in our work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As far as the data within the Ministry’s database, as you know, we are digitising our database 
<br/>but, yes, there is still the need to be able to have proper data when it comes to informing our policies. 
<br/>We hope that with this National Disability Policy, which will be evidence-based data inform, then 
<br/>we will be able to have that data.  We also hope that across the Ministries, things like village profiling, 
<br/>now we are doing informal settlement profiling, that there will also be a collection of that data in the 
<br/>process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Honourable  Minister,  it  is  really  hard  to  believe  that  the  budget 
<br/>allocated for the disability-related NGOs has reduced from $1.1 million to $300,000, when you take 
<br/>into consideration the population of disabled people have increased due to NCDs. My question is, 
<br/>what are you doing about that? People do need help, the number is going up, funding has come down, 
<br/>so  how  are  we  providing  this  assistance?  Are  we  creating  enough  awareness  to  the  disability 
<br/>organisations that this is where the fund is, this is what the criteria is, and this is how you can access?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, the allocation has come down, as I explained. It is dependent on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the utilisation as well as reporting back, so that is something we need to build capacity on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues we face with our disability recipients is the increasing demand for assistive 
<br/>devices and retrofitting of their homes to enable them to move around in their homes. It is usually 
<br/>bathroom fittings which is very susceptible to slipping and you can have injuries, as well as ramps 
<br/>and walkways to access their homes back and forth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2015 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In villages, it is difficult to get around in a wheelchair, so the need for more footpaths, so 
<br/>disability access  is  certainly  something that can  be done  across  the Ministries. The allocation for 
<br/>disability  housing  for  the  need  to  retrofit  that  does  not  sit  within  our  Ministry.  It  sits  within  the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government and Housing.  Yes, I believe they could certainly do with more funds 
<br/>because of the increasing demand for the need to retrofit housing. I thank Public Rental Board who 
<br/>have now allocated their bottom flats for disability access, and they have actually put on Ramps, as 
<br/>well  as  easy  access,  and  this  is  from  your  Government  taking  these  initiatives.    This  is  really 
<br/>important as we move forward for our people with disabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the issue with transport - moving around in buses, we still have buses that are not 
<br/>disability  friendly,  even  if  they  make  the  choice,  it  is  difficult  for  them.  Again,  we  need  to  keep 
<br/>talking to our bus operators to bring in disability friendly buses, it is a cost for them. We are still 
<br/>trying to sort the e-ticketing system, but I believe it is work in progress and it is for the Ministry to 
<br/>continue  to  advocate  and  speak  to  our  line  Ministries  and  stakeholders  to  assist  our  people  with 
<br/>disability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we move on to the fourth Oral Question for today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand that the honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister, I do not know 
<br/>whether he forgot or got stuck during his visit to the United States.  So, that question has now lapsed 
<br/>because he is not present.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 231/2024 terminated) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget Utilisation - Coastal Erosion Protection 
<br/>(Question No. 232/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament 
<br/>on the work that has been undertaken to utilise the $1.5 million allocation for Coastal 
<br/>Erosion Protection in the 2023–2024 financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition for the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question regarding the utilisation of the $1.5 million 
<br/>allocation  for  Coastal  Erosion  Protection  in  the  2023-2024  financial  year.  Several  key  project 
<br/>locations were identified under this allocation to mitigate the impacts of coastal erosion and protect 
<br/>vulnerable communities from the threats posed by rising sea levels and erosion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coastal erosion protection works are essential for ensuring the safety and resilience of our 
<br/>coastal communities. The allocation and budget for these initiatives in the 2023-2024 financial year 
<br/>were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Salevukoso Village in Macuata- $200,000; 
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Tubou Hospital in Lakeba, Lau - $240,000; 
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Ovea Village, Bau, Tailevu - $750,000;  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Nawaisomo Village, Beqa - $200,000; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>In-house Nature Based Projects - $110,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all projects were mandated to follow a transparent and competitive tender 
<br/>process in compliance with Government’s financial regulations, thereby, ensuring accountability and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>effective governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Evaluation for tenders were carried out for coastal erosion protection works that was required 
<br/>to  safeguard  the  Tubou  Hospital  in  Lakeba  with  150  metres  of  coastal  protection  works.    In 
<br/>Nawaisomo Village in Beqa, it was 310 metres.  Unfortunately, the tender for Salevukoso Village in 
<br/>Macuata  that  requires  200  metres  of  work  was  withdrawn  as  the  bid  substantially  surpassed  the 
<br/>engineer’s financial estimate as to the cost of the lowest bid which was 20 percent more.  Plans are 
<br/>in place to re-tender that project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ovea Village project in Tailevu was advertised for a tender, the contract 
<br/>was awarded in the third quarter of the 2023-2024 financial year, following a contract duration of six 
<br/>months.  Construction commenced in 2023 and is expected to extend into the 2024-2025 dinancial 
<br/>year.    This  involves  470  metres  of  erosion  protection  works  for  Ovea  Village.    This  should  be 
<br/>completed by the end of this month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  allocation  of  $110,000  for  the  in-house  nature-based  projects  was 
<br/>designated  specifically  for  the  procurement  of  construction  materials  intended  for  nature-based 
<br/>seawalls located in Navunievu Village in Bua, where 450 metres of coastal erosion protection works 
<br/>have been completed and in Namatakula Village, Nadroga, where 100 metres out of the 400 metres 
<br/>of coastal protection works have been completed.  These initiatives are designed to offer sustainable 
<br/>low impact coastal protection by utilising local materials and environmentally friendly technologies, 
<br/>thereby,  strengthening  the  resilience  of  these  communities  against  coastal  erosion  and  saltwater 
<br/>intrusion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is an additional support and funding of $1.7 million from the Kiwa 
<br/>Initiative through the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and collaboration with 
<br/>the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways which has identified six sites for nature-based solution 
<br/>seawalls, and they are as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Navolau in Ra - 400 metres of seawall; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Navola Village, Nadroga – 450 metres of seawall; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Somosomo Village, Taveuni - 425 metres of seawall; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Nakawaga Village, Mali Island, Macuata - 420 metres of seawall; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Ligaulevu Village - 200 metres of seawall; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Vesi Village – 150 metres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The nature-based  seawalls  in  Navolau,  Navola in  Nadroga and Somosomo  in  Taveuni are 
<br/></span><span>anticipated  to  begin  this  month.  The  support  of  the  Kiwa  Initiative  through  IUCN  is  much 
<br/>appreciated, and it takes a shorter process before the work can start on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite our diligent efforts, the delays encountered in the tender approval 
<br/>processes resulted in the Ministry’s inability to execute all the coastal protection works for the 2023-
<br/>2024 financial year. This will be completed in the current financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  the  delays,  the  Ministry  was  compelled  to  re-evaluate  its 
<br/></span><span>intervention plans and redeployed a portion of the budget to improve the utilization of funds for the 
<br/></span><span>coastal erosion protection works for the 2023-2024 financial year.  As a result of this redeployment 
<br/>of  funds,  $329,000  was  allocated  for  the  reinstatement  of  the  Drainage  Boards  for  the  Central, 
<br/>Western  and  Northern  Divisions.  The  funds  were  allocated  to  set  up  office  space,  recruit  staff, 
<br/>equipment  purchase, vehicle and selected machinery,  as  well as  for the maintenance of approved 
<br/></span><span>drainage schemes. Some of these activities will commence in this financial year.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2017 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, although the coastal erosion protection project experienced setbacks, the 
<br/>redeployment of funds effectively addressed other critical needs for the Waterways Division during 
<br/>the last financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  the  Ministry  is  steadfast  in  its  dedication  to  advancing  the  coastal  erosion 
<br/>protection activities and is working closely with the Government Tender Board and the Ministry of 
<br/>Finance to accelerate the approval processes in this financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the honourable Minister for the 
<br/>response and the work undertaken as well. This is very critical for us in terms of our adaptation and 
<br/>resilience  programmes.  The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  this  morning,  talked  about  our  Foreign 
<br/>Policy  White  Paper  and  one  of  the  key  elements  within  that  is  our  bilateral  and  multilateral 
<br/>connections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am interested honourable Minister in the costings that you may, I hope, already have for the 
<br/>other projects.  Sir, COP29 is a finance COP, and it is expected of, particularly, small island countries 
<br/>to come up with their plans.  Has there been scoping done on how many or all the projects that you 
<br/>have?    Unfortunately,  I  did  not  include  riverbank  protection.    If  you  can  highlight  to  the  House 
<br/>because this is very important for the protection of our people and, particularly, linking up to COP29 
<br/>- the finance COP?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition for raising that point. For coastal protection works, we have done scoping for 156 sites, 
<br/>that is, 80 sites in the Central Division, 29 sites in the Western Division, 30 sites in the Northern 
<br/>Division and 58 sites in the Eastern Division.  The total cost comes to around $100 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  watershed  management,  we  have  identified  eight  sites;  seven  in  Ba  and  one  in  Nadi. 
<br/>Those eight sites, the scoping we have come up with amounts to $24 million.  Having said that, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, there is also the dredging of our major rivers, drainage and the flood protection which 
<br/>we have already done. All in all, the total cost would be about $464.5 million.

<div><span>Sustainable Water Management Practices 
<br/>(Question No. 233/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice.

<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament 
<br/>on  the      measures  being  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  to  ensure  the  implementation  of 
<br/>sustainable water management practices among farmers, particularly, with the increasing 
<br/>impacts of climate change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question. The increasing impacts of climate change continue to challenge agriculture production and 
<br/>food system in Fiji.  Sustainable Water Management is a concept with deep historical roots, having 
<br/>been practised  by our ancestors  over time.    It  has been refined  and developed into contemporary 
<br/></span><span>methods such as advanced irrigation technologies, innovative farming systems and effective water 
<br/></span><span>retention and utilization methods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Waterways Division within the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/>manages a project focussed on supporting irrigation systems for agricultural development. Recipients 
<br/>are selected through an Expression of Interest process which is followed by on-site verification.  The 
<br/>irrigation systems have the aim of improving the use of limited water supply in dry farming areas to

<div><span>improve farm production.  A weir with 1.2 million cubic metres water storage volume was built by 
<br/>the then Land Water Resource Management Unit across the Nawaka River in Nadi in 2010.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the objectives of constructing this weir: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Flood mitigation for food security, to manage water levels effectively thereby reducing the 
<br/>likelihood of flooding in adjacent regions. By regulating floodwaters, it protects agricultural 
<br/>land which in turn supports uninterrupted crop production and secures food resources for the 
<br/>local population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Irrigation support during dry season.  In terms of droughts and insufficient rainfall, this weir 
<br/>serves  as  a  dependable  water  source  for  irrigation.  This  guarantees  the  continuity  of 
<br/>agricultural operations thereby preserving crop yields and sustaining livelihoods even during 
<br/>the dry season.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fishing for food security, the weir establishes a more stable aquatic ecosystem that enhances 
<br/>freshwater  fish  habitats  thereby  offering  a  reliable  food  source  for  the  community.    This  plays  a 
<br/>significant role in ensuring long-term food security for the villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  integration  of  flood  management  dependable  irrigation  systems  and improved  fishing 
<br/>prospects are designed to enhance the resilience of the local communities while fostering sustainable 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a young student at Queen Victoria School, I used to spend a lot of my 
<br/>school holidays in Nawaka.  I was asking Tui Nawaka when I went there lately the existence of this 
<br/>weir, but he said that it is all now under a lot of shrubs.  We will try to clear all the debris so that it 
<br/>is functional once more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those of you who do not know or may not be clear with what I am talking about, these 
<br/>are  in  iTaukei,  </span><span>na  tore.    Na  tore  o  koya  dau  vagolei  tani  ga  na  uciwai,  qai  dua  na  tamani  tobu 
<br/>vakaitamera.  O ira na tobu oqo, mai Nawaka ena gauna oya, e caka tu kina na siwa.  Era dau siwa 
<br/>maleya kina, era nunu</span><span>.  It was so big that if you were fishing on this side of the weir, you will not 
<br/>know the other person on the other side.  That was how big it was but, unfortunately, it has not been 
<br/>maintained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All we need is to clear up the debris.  It is a direct answer to the flooding that happens in 
<br/>Nawaka.  I told Tui Nawaka, “If we are going to clean the weir once again and make use of it, it is 
<br/>going to be a source of food security for you and also, it is a flood mitigation method.”  This is what 
<br/>I have talked about here, I hope it is clear.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Land Use Division of the Ministry has established two demonstration 
<br/>sites  for  rainwater  harvesting  in  Namuka-i-Wai  Island  in  the  </span><span>Tikina  o</span><span> </span><span>Dogotuki</span><span>  and  Nagugu 
<br/>Settlement in the </span><span>Tikina o</span><span> </span><span>Naduri</span><span>; both in Vanua Levu. This initiative is part of the Climate Smart 
<br/>Agriculture  Programme  and  was  established  in  the  2023-2024  financial  year  and  is  currently 
<br/></span><span>implemented in collaboration with the Live &amp; Learn NGO. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In both demonstration sites, water tanks are being installed to collect rainwater.  These tanks 
<br/>are linked to drip irrigation system that supplies water to vegetable gardens.  The concept of water 
<br/>harvesting  involves  a  collection  of  rainwater  occurring  in  a  specific  location  and  its  subsequent 
<br/></span><span>transfer to another area.  This process enhances the availability of water for sustainable use in regions 
<br/></span><span>where  water  resources  are  limited.    The  garden  serves  as  a  source  for  nutritious  food  for  the

<div><span>community that depend on an irregular water supply from the mainland for their daily sustenance in 
<br/>the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  given  Fiji’s  susceptibility  to  climate  change,  the  implementation  of 
<br/>sustainable water management practices is also essential for livestock production.  Some of the key 
<br/>strategies include efficient water use, forest management, legume-grass mixtures, silos production 
<br/>and livestock management through genetic selection, and the development of livestock breeds that 
<br/>exhibit greater resilience to drought conditions, including heat tolerant breeds for those with reduced 
<br/>water needs such as the Droughtmaster breed in cattle.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  has  adopted  Climate-Smart 
<br/>Agriculture as one of its strategic priorities and this includes activities to reforest watershed areas to 
<br/>ensure sufficient and good quality water is available to farmers.  The inclusion of agroforestry will 
<br/>ensure water loss from the soil is reduced and integrated farming system will ensure water is utilised 
<br/>efficiently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me enlighten the House that in certain areas in Fiji that are separated by 
<br/>mountains, we have areas where you have an abundance of water on the other side.  But then, directly 
<br/>on  the  other  side,  there  is  a  big  difference  of  no  water.    You  just  have  to  go  along  the  coast  in 
<br/>Nakorotubu and have a look at the Bureiwai area where there is no water.  But up in the mountains, 
<br/>on  the  other  side,  there  is  abundant  of  water,  </span><span>ia  rau  tikina  vata  tikoga</span><span>.    So,  that  requires  big 
<br/>infrastructure projects, and I hope that it can be part of the infrastructure vision for Fiji - to get water 
<br/>from those areas and channel it to other areas that do not have water.  It is  a challenge for Parliament, 
<br/>it may be very costly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have stated earlier in my answer to the honourable Leader of the Opposition’s question, 
<br/>infrastructure is a costly thing. If we spend peanuts on our infrastructure, we will get monkeys! We 
<br/>spend money, we throw money into the infrastructure, it will last us a lifetime. These infrastructures 
<br/>that are here that are now falling to pieces were infrastructure from the 1960s, so I hope the Ministry 
<br/>is given the money to fix all these infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, be assured that we will fight for the money to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>get it from Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- For you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, this is a very interesting topic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Where is the money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- It is with the Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They have to get it. 
<br/>Otherwise, as I have stated, that is why COP29 is so important and your Inter-Parliamentary Union 
<br/>(IPU), the consistency in our messaging, given our special circumstances and challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Minister,  for  the  </span><span>tore</span><span>  (weir)  concept,  if  you  cannot  just  look  at  Nawaka  in 
<br/></span><span>isolation but the whole area that is being included already under the Nadi River Strategy, that is very 
<br/></span><span>important. That is my first question, is that something that you are going to consider? And, I will 
<br/>have more questions as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU .- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is included in the plans. We want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revisit that area.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just combine the next two questions 
<br/>together; honourable Minister, you are aware of the Sigatoka Valley.  You also have the irrigation 
<br/>system, but it has also been neglected for ages.  I hope you can consider that.  If you can state an 
<br/>answer to that as well.  You have talked about the irrigation system from rainwater harvesting. What 
<br/>is the Ministry’s plan for drip systems from underground water sources, like boreholes? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the saltwater intrusion phenomenon is  real. 
<br/>When you go up the Sigatoka Valley, saltwater has intruded right up to the upper valley, and the 
<br/>same goes for the Rewa River.  If you happen to stand beside the Rewa River up in Kabara, an estate 
<br/>in Naitasiri past Nabaitavo Village, you stand beside the river at Kabara, you can smell the sea. So, 
<br/>it means that saltwater intrusion has gone right up to those places.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Definitely, we have to be serious about the irrigation systems that the honourable Leader of 
<br/>Opposition is talking about, whether it is a drip irrigation or rainwater harvesting, all these will help.  
<br/>Likewise, we must not forget the big infrastructure projects to take care of - our national needs, as I 
<br/>have talked about earlier. It may cost us a fortune, but it is a necessity.  I say that it is a necessity 
<br/>because our survival depends on it, water is a basic need. We have to fix it, otherwise farming or 
<br/>agriculture will suffer, and we will become a country that will keep importing food up to the extent 
<br/>where we become a net-food importing country, and surely, we do not want that. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, my question is 
<br/>in regards to water management and utilisation, and is in terms of the risks - some of the irrigation 
<br/>support mechanisms that farmers are facing. For example, if a farmer is given the borehole system 
<br/>or  the  irrigation  system,  then  of  course,  due  to  some  mechanical  failures,  the  system  is  now  not 
<br/>functioning anymore, and the farmers are not in the capacity to get it fixed. Does the Ministry come 
<br/>in and assist these farmers, or do they have to wait for the next budget?  What is the process like, just 
<br/>for the information of the farmers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The simple answer is, yes, we can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>assist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in regards to the dredging in 
<br/>the Rewa River. There is dredging along the other end of Nausori Town, and there is soil erosion on 
<br/>the highway that is connected.  There is civic lot where there is Mosque and a Church seated. Also, 
<br/>there is commercial lot on that end of Nausori Town that is eroding fast due to the dredging. My 
<br/>question is, who monitors the dredging because dredging should be in the middle of the river rather 
<br/>than on the side where soil erosion will just continue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dredging is monitored by the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways Officials, from our Waterways Division, so I will find out if what you 
<br/>are saying is true.

<div><span>Accountability in the Distribution of Social Pension 
<br/>(Question No. 234/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  measures  in  place  to  ensure  accountability  in  the  Government’s 
<br/>management and distribution of social pensions?

<div><span>2021 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so, I would be remissive, and I apologise for missing this out in my previous response, it does cut 
<br/>into  my  answer  for  this  question.  To  acknowledge,  PhysioNet  UK,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  who  are 
<br/>collaborating  with  the  Vodafone  ATH  foundation  in  a  huge  donation  they  made  yesterday  to  the 
<br/>National Council for People with Disabilities, donating $1.2 million worth of assistive devices, and 
<br/>these includes motorised scooters, multiple wheelchair types in designs, hospital beds, both electronic 
<br/>and manual, commodes, shower chairs… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.– That was not my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA .- …crutches, medical consumables, adult diapers, gloves, face masks 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and sanitary pads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.– Just answer my question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, it does relate to this question, because of course 
<br/>these organisations and the donations they make are not just limited to people living with disabilities, 
<br/>in fact, there are donations also made accessible to people who are on social pension. So, our elderly 
<br/>who  are  also  accessing  these  assistive  devices  as  well.  So,  I  acknowledge  their  support  to  the 
<br/>Government to assist our people… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA,- ...living on pensions. And on that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish 
<br/>to respond to honourable Ketan Lal because I see him throwing his hands up in terms of his response 
<br/>to the Anti-Porn Taskforce, please, I urge him to attend the meetings because he cannot just come 
<br/>and bark here and not attend our working group meetings, not informed of the progress of the work. 
<br/>So, please attend the meeting then come and report correctly to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the research and studies have found that income inequalities is prevalent in 
<br/>old age, and most of us are almost in that category. So, we do need to be concerned about what is 
<br/>available for us as we go into this age category. Rapid population growth, combined with lack of 
<br/>adequate  social  security,  will  likely  increase  poverty  amongst  older  persons.  The  latest  statistics 
<br/>released  by  The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific 
<br/>(UNESCAP) clearly indicated... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Irrelevant!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- ...that 10 percent of our total population are under the older persons 
<br/>category and it is also forecasted to increase to 15 percent by 2050. So, what is the relevance to this 
<br/>answer?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  The  Ministry  is  in  the  process  of  formulating  its  Ageing  Policy 
<br/>because 15 percent of our population, we do need to do a deep dive into how we can make our people 
<br/></span><span>with older persons have a more meaningful quality of life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is committed to our people living with an older 
<br/>persons in this category who are accessing the social pension. Our social pension scheme is one of 
<br/>the  best  in  the  Asia-Pacific  region  and  this  was  acknowledged  recently  during  our  Regional 
<br/>Conference on population ageing in Bali, Indonesia, where our Director Social Protection was asked 
<br/>to be part of the panel discussion on how we can enhance old age financial security in the emerging

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Asia Pacific and using Fiji as an example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we have got to recognise as there is an ongoing evolution of social assistance, looking 
<br/>at a comprehensive life cycle approach. So, just because you turn 60, does not mean everyone forgets 
<br/>you, it happens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They may forgotten... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to correct honourable Premila Kumar stating that 
<br/>there is no bus fare assistance for 65 and under. They are receiving bus fare assistance, 65 and under. 
<br/>And her concern about them not receiving it, I think she has been misinforming Parliament. They 
<br/>continue to be on bus fare assistance, but the only thing that has changed is that those that are turning 
<br/>60 after 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, yes, they will not be receiving it.  Why? Because the retirement age has increased 
<br/>to 60! They continue to work to 60. That is what the Coalition Government brought about. There is 
<br/>financial security until 60. There is a buffer zone of five years to 65 where they have the ability to 
<br/>support themselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- When it was 55 retirement, they started from 60. So, what happened 
<br/>to the five years there? Why could we say, why did it not start from 55? Same logic! So, please just 
<br/>reflect a little bit, reflect a little bit. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to acknowledge the previous government 
<br/>from 2013 where the Social Pension was implemented in terms of the amount given for age 70 and 
<br/>above, and then it was reduced to 68, then to 66 and now it is 65. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I reiterate the Coalition Government, increased the retirement age, 
<br/>so in fact, under the previous government from  55 to 65, they were on their own. They were not 
<br/>entitled to a Social Pension Scheme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Those who are over 60... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  They  were  not  taken  care  of,  in  fact,  their  FNPF  balances  were 
<br/>deteriorated. So, it created poverty amongst those who had retired at 55. We have breached that gap 
<br/>to 60 and given financial security for our older persons, and, yes, they can sustain themselves for bus 
<br/>fare assistance to 65 where they then get the cash transfer. And with the cash transfer, they are not 
<br/>limited to the bus, which is what they did not do. Now they can travel in the fibre, they can travel in 
<br/>a minivan, in a taxi, gives them the quality of life and ability to travel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under our reformed agenda, we continue to try to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure that monitoring of the Social Pension Scheme is done properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- This Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is committed to digitising our 
<br/>records, it has been a nightmare trying to digitise these manual records, missing records. Trying to 
<br/>bring in to digitise has taken a long time.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Under 60, relevance. She is wasting everyone’s time. I have asked a 
<br/>specific question, so I need a specific answer. Do not go beating around the bush! Come to the point!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, continue, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, can  I remind  honourable Premila Kumar of her 
<br/>question?  Can  the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament  on  the  measures  in  place  to  ensure 
<br/>accountability in the governance, management and distribution of the social pension?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we are digitising our records, we are making it mainstream so that we can ensure those who 
<br/>are not supposed to be on the programme, what scheme of the programme, for example, when we 
<br/>have manual records, Mr. Speaker, Sir, members of the family are accessing this pension because we 
<br/>do not have the manual records, it goes to someone’s M-PAiSA or mobile phone and we have lost 
<br/>record of that. So, it is manually recorded, and we cannot trace back that information.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  digitising,  we  can  ensure  that  it  is  tagged  to  the  person’s  Birth 
<br/>Registration Number and I thank the Births, Deaths &amp; Marriage Registry (BDM), the Ministry of 
<br/>Justice who have come on board, so that through the digitising process, we are now talking to the 
<br/>BDM, we are now talking to the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), we are now talking to other 
<br/>stakeholders like Fiji Revenue &amp; Customer Services (FRCS), so we are ensuring we are identifying 
<br/>that this is the one same person.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what happens, is that we lose track of an older person, and we are trying to 
<br/>find  that  person,  what  we  do,  and  it  works  every  single  time,  we  stop  the  payment,  because  the 
<br/>payment is going to another family member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Listen, we stop the payment and sure enough Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>family member who has been receiving, comes to us to ask, “We have not been receiving the money,” 
<br/>So  we  ask  them,  “where  is  the  person,  who  is  receiving  these  funds?  Please,  give  us  the  contact 
<br/>details.” Oh! my grandfather has moved to another village. We need to trace that person down, so we 
<br/>find that person, so that the person is receiving the benefit and not a family member. That is what we 
<br/>are trying to fix for better management and accountability of our social pensioners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last budget, the Minister for Finance made the 
<br/>announcement that anyone turning 70 will be receiving $150, and there are people who have been 
<br/>complaining that they have not been receiving the $150.  First of all, in the month of August, they 
<br/>did not receive timely pension, and this question I had actually requested for August, but anyway, it 
<br/>came now, but whatever it is, they did not receive $150. And I had simply asked those members to 
<br/>go  to  the  Ministry  and  sort  it  out.  So,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is,  what  specific 
<br/>measures are in place to track and resolve complaints from pensioners about underpayment and is 
<br/>there a dedicated system in place to handle these complaints and grievances and track it? Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  she  answers,  honourable  Minister,  let  me  make  it  very  clear 
<br/></span><span>honourable members, the delay in payments, that is an occurrence that has happened in the past. It 
<br/></span><span>depends on the cash flow of the government of the day. If there is enough money to cater for all these 
<br/>commitments, et cetera, then payment will be timely. Otherwise, the usual thing happens and at times 
<br/>it will be late, but it will still be forthcoming. Yes, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to answer your question, honourable Kumar. Yes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we will always receive complaints, we want anyone who’s not receiving to file the complaint with

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Ministry through our offices, through our phone numbers that we have available, and we do attend  
<br/>to it to ensure that they do receive their money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Honourable  Premila  Kumar  is  saying  that  we  do  not  pick  up  the 
<br/>phone.  Please, file the complaint, honourable Kumar; file it directly with me.  We will ensure that 
<br/>the person who is not … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Unbelievable, Mr. Speaker, Sir! We come here to Parliament to make 
<br/>this, but not one of them has come directly to me, except honourable Virendra Lal and honourable 
<br/>Sharma and I thank them.  Come to me and we will take care of it.  Our people are important and the 
<br/>services to them are important. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Women that because of the increase in VAT and cost of living, more people are on social welfare 
<br/>pensions.  The complaint by many senior citizens that if they get $125 and they go to the bank and 
<br/>withdraw this  money, they are not  able to  withdraw $125.  Somehow the bank is  holding the $5 
<br/>maybe for maintenance fee, activity fee, I am not too sure, but this is what I have been hearing when 
<br/>I visit the communities. How are you going to make sure that the people receive $125? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Again this is the first time I am hearing of it from honourable Sharma.  
<br/>We meet every time at morning tea, afternoon tea, but now, he chooses to bring it out here to the 
<br/>public.  Please, get a formal complaint and provide the evidence.  If the banks are doing that, then 
<br/>we need to deal with the banks.  However, it is important for our people to receive the money, yes, 
<br/>on time.  Sometimes, it does not happen and, yes, we had apologised for that occurrence, honourable 
<br/>Kumar, and we have dealt with it internally.  But what we need to do, as we prioritised our older 
<br/>persons, we need to work together in the House to do so.  If you have complaints, please, file them 
<br/>formally, then we can act, and we will ensure that we do serve our people with older persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Just tell the people to file the complaint. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We seem to be engaged in a running commentary all the time.  I think the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interest is there.  Please, lodge your complaints directly with the honourable Minister.
