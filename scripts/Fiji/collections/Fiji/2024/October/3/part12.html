<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The honourable Member is standing under what Standing Order? You are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rising on a Point of Order, Sir, but I need to... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, it is on a personal explanation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is a personal explanation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Standing Order 80 â€“ Personal Explanation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I apologise, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, we have not heard you yet.  I will give you the clearance, then you will 
<br/>elaborate. You are standing on a Point of Order - Standing Order 80.  I am giving you the leeway to 
<br/>do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to apologies to this august House for any 
<br/>language that I have made or used in this Parliament which may have offended individual Members 
<br/>of this House.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  It  really  gets  on  to  my  nerves,  honourable  Members.    He  is  seeking  a 
<br/>personal explanation on something he has stated which is not clear because he mumbles his words 
<br/>most  of  the  time  when  he  gets  angry.  The  only  thing  I  heard,  honourable  Members,  was  another 
<br/>explanation given by honourable Bala and referring to what he said. And that made him wrong for 
<br/>him to say, I can also say this.  That is the only part that I heard, but it is great that you have taken it 
<br/>upon yourself, honourable Minister, on the personal explanation to give your apology here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  likewise  under  Standing  Order  80,  I  would  like  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apologise if I have hurt any individual using unparliamentary words. Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I would like to implore on you honourable Members of this august House, 
<br/>let us always keep the decorum. You may notice that school children are here not only to watch us, 
<br/>but also hear us and see you, honourable Members, participate heavily in debates.  As such, I only 
<br/>seek your indulgence, please, continue to uphold the dignity of the House. That is all I ask. </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you very much, honourable Bala.  Honourable Minister, you seem to take off on a very 
<br/></span><span>speedy pace when you are cool to when you blow up your position. Maybe, you have been counting 
<br/></span><span>your money a lot, that is why, anyway, thank you for that.   
<br/></span></div>
