<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think,  through  that  question,  the  honourable  Minister  has  really 
<br/>challenged  the  Fijian  diaspora  to  see  how  best  it  can  retain  this  very  much  important  part  of  our 
<br/>identity, and that is our language. Whilst  we were seeking  the official  language to  be part of our 
<br/>language to confirm what is in the Constitution and what we practice, we took a leaf out of India.  
<br/>They have 20 official languages and about 7,000 languages, and yet still speak their languages in 
<br/></span><span>their very own Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  prefer  to  speak  in  English,  some  begin  with  their  own  vernacular,  and  then  they 
<br/>suddenly change to English. But for us, it is a whole new challenge, and with respect to what the 
<br/>Ministry is undertaking. For me, my tribe originated from Vanualevu, we still have our links there. 
<br/>We still have our </span><span>yavu</span><span> there. But in Taveuni, the dialect sounds funny now because we are speaking 
<br/>most of our communication in the Bauan dialect and that is unbecoming.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we say tomorrow in the real Cakaudrove dialect, we say </span><span>se bogi caca ni sou bogi</span><span>, in 
<br/>the Bauan dialect it is just </span><span>ni mataka</span><span> and our young children are speaking that.  Road is </span><span>wa’olo</span><span>, in 
<br/>the Bauan dialect it is </span><span>gaunisala</span><span>. So, there is a big mix there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since we were relocated to Taveuni, we confronted the Lauan, upper Lauan and the Laucala 
<br/>dialect and that gives us a very difficult time, especially when we try and reintroduce our own genuine 
<br/></span><span>dialect. It is quite difficult, but I think we will push ahead with that and that remains a challenge for 
<br/></span><span>us to undertake.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Participation of Women and Youth in Co-operatives 
<br/>(Question No. 251/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament how the 
<br/>Ministry  is  working  towards  increasing  participation  of  women  and  youth  in  Co-
<br/>operatives? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Vocea  for  his 
<br/>question. Of course, I had spoken about co-operatives in terms of overall registration and the positive 
<br/>impact it has been having in terms of rural livelihoods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we all know, the  co-operatives are ideal  as well for women  and youth  participation  in 
<br/>economic activities and is actually quite a valuable tool when it comes to empowering women and 
<br/>youth by creating income generating activities. Of course, the Ministry of Trade is very committed, 
<br/>Sir, to fostering inclusive economic growth and specifically focusing on expanding the role of women 
<br/></span><span>and youth in co-operatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just by way of some data, Sir, in the West alone, we witnessed in terms of membership, an 
<br/>increase  of  about  148  percent  for  women,  female  membership,  raising  the  proportion  of  women 
<br/>cooperatives in total from 12 percent to 24 percent over the last year. This growth has been the result 
<br/>of  some  comprehensive  outreach  campaigns,  tailored  training  programmes  and  financial  support 
<br/>systems  that  have  started  encouraging  more  women  participation,  and  I  refer  particularly  to  the 
<br/>Ministry of Women, who have been advocating strongly for women in business and of course, other 
<br/>multilateral organisation as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise that Fiji's youth represent a tremendous opportunity 
<br/>as well for cooperative growth. I would like to specifically call out the honourable Minister for Youth 
<br/>who has communicated a message to all our young men and women and where they want to set up 
<br/>business  initiatives,  that  they  do  them  through  cooperatives.  And  so  similarly,  we  are  seeing 
<br/>encouraging  signs  in  terms  of  the  growth  of  cooperatives,  youth-based  cooperatives,  and  we  will 
<br/>continue to focus on that. As we know, young people bring fresh ideas and entrepreneurial spirit that 
<br/>comes with youth, Sir, that can propel cooperatives going forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just sighting some examples of where we have collaborated, in terms of 
<br/></span><span>women, and also youth. I will just pick two examples, Sir. I think we all have heard of Rise Beyond 
<br/>the Reef. This is a very innovative and excellent women empowerment programme. They have just 
<br/>opened their first shop in Denarau, I think. Before they used to supply through Amazon and supply 
<br/>on an order basis. I believe they are also in Tappoos in terms of selling their products. Recently they 
<br/>have opened their shop, and we have been assisting them on and off for some time, including during 
<br/>honourable Koya’s time. The models, Sir, and the way it is setup, the ladies are sewing in their various 
<br/>homes and then they bring their product together to a central location, and then it is delivered to the 
<br/>distribution centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the team came up with the idea of actually helping fund the sewing machines for these 
<br/>ladies. So, right now, we have just recently funded up to 14 members of the Rise Beyond the Reef 
<br/>women to the amount of $11,988 and the bulk of that money has been used to buy sewing machines 
<br/>and you could say, producing more in terms of income. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2165 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Ministry for Youth, we are moving around with the Ministry for Youth in 
<br/>terms of some of the programmes that they are doing. One of the ones that comes to mind is the 
<br/>recent  Yasayasa  Moala  Youth  Festival  in  Lau,  where  we  conducted  cooperative  awareness  and 
<br/>registration for participating youth groups. Later this month as well, Sir, we will be visiting Kadavu 
<br/>to conduct awareness sessions and registration to enable them to effectively participate in economic 
<br/>activities.  Of course, Sir, with the challenges of drugs that we are facing, these initiatives are ways 
<br/>of addressing the challenge with drugs and trying to encourage our youth to be productive members 
<br/>of our society and move away from the vagaries of drugs Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  course,  the  Ministry  also  works  very  closely  with  the  Ministry  of  Women,  as  I  have 
<br/>mentioned, and  currently we are also working  with  the United Nations Development  Programme 
<br/>(UNDP)  through  a  programme  called  Markets  for  Change  to  empower  and  formalise  successful 
<br/>women groups into co-operatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through some of these targeted approaches we have been able to register about 60 successful 
<br/>women led co-operatives. Formalisation of these women groups as co-operatives has opened up new 
<br/>opportunities  such  as,  easier  access  to  grants,  particularly  The  Integrated  Human  Resource 
<br/>Development Programme (IHRDP) which is very popular, which is facilitated by the Ministry. There 
<br/></span><span>is  a  later  discussion  about  access  to  finance  Bill  later  today,  and  that  again  will  increase  the 
<br/></span><span>opportunity for our co-operatives and MSME’s to actually access capital which is one of the biggest 
<br/>challenges when it comes to Micro, Small to Medium Enterprises and Co-operatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, looking ahead, the Ministry is committed to both, Women and Youth in co-
<br/>operatives, through more gender and youth sensitive policies. Over the last 3 years, a total of 398 
<br/>women and youth have been appointed to Board positions in respective co-operatives, so that is an 
<br/>interesting and positive development as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of other initiatives, we are partnering with the International  Labour Organisation 
<br/>(ILO) and the United Nations to continue to align our initiatives to global best practices on gender 
<br/>equality  and  youth  empowerment.  This  will  certainly  allow  us  to  implement  new  programmes, 
<br/>enhance existing ones, ensuring that the Fiji co-operative sector is not only inclusive but sustainable 
<br/>as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  success  that  we  have  seen  so  far,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  a  testament,  of  course,  the 
<br/>effectiveness of the prior Government initiatives and all we are doing is continuing to fine tune them. 
<br/>As I have mentioned in my previous speech, we do have a grant now that is specifically targeted to 
<br/></span><span>co-operatives, and we shall be utilising that. We are about to advertise that programme soon and this 
<br/></span><span>of  course,  will  ensure  that  the  co-operative  movement  continues  to  grow  and  hopefully  directly 
<br/>address issues such as poverty alleviation in Fiji. </span><span>Vinaka saka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR. –Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister spoke at length about what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>women co-operatives, I would like to hear a little bit more about the youth co-operatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I thought I had covered both adequately,  I guess just some 
<br/>statistics that I did not read out. In the last couple of months, we have launched about 10 youth-based 
<br/>co-operatives from the awareness programmes that we are doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are trying to do is encourage more youth to actually look at things such as farming 
<br/>opportunities  within  their  respective  areas  because  there  are  some  successful  youth  co-operatives 
<br/>from the Tailevu area that came from the previous administration and that is working well. There are 
<br/></span><span>good co-operatives both in women and the youth currently in play and I am happy to provide more 
<br/></span><span>information if you need it.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I do understand that some of the most successful 
<br/>co-operatives are women co-operatives currently on the books at the Ministry, but in terms of the 
<br/>youth,  will the Co-operative Department,  if it has not  already, tried  to  see if we  can tap into our 
<br/>school leavers and get into the education system to educate them regarding the co-operatives and 
<br/>how beneficial it can be?  I say this, not lightly, honourable Minister, but because you build very 
<br/>good bonds whilst you were at school and those bonds can be taken through into business, et cetera, 
<br/>especially targeting the rural areas where the education system can incorporate maybe sessions with 
<br/>our cooperative people so the school leavers can see that there is an avenue to make some decent 
<br/>dole out of cooperatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker,  I thank honourable Koya for that question.  
<br/>There is a move afoot to move down the awareness and education for co-operatives and MSMEs into 
<br/>education. You will recall that I think the TELS actually is launching an entrepreneurial university 
<br/>level entrepreneurial programme in this Budget. The allocation is about half a million, so that is a 
<br/>start.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are really keen to move the education of entrepreneurship into the education curriculum 
<br/>and we have been talking to the Ministry of Education. There are some service providers that are 
<br/></span><span>talking to the Ministry of Education at the moment in terms of moving the entrepreneurship down to 
<br/></span><span>education level. Generally, at the moment, entrepreneurship seems to be a vocation when we hit our 
<br/>forties and fifties like a pre-retirement vocation, but we believe from what we are seeing, there is 
<br/>massive entrepreneurial spirit with our youth and with our young and with the right encouragement 
<br/>and the right policy settings, we will create a more vibrant sort of entrepreneurial movement at that 
<br/>age level.  It is a work in progress, education system, the curriculums being developed right now, and 
<br/>I  certainly  have  had  meetings  with  the  service  providers  who  are  keen  to  provide  education  and 
<br/>training in that space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is  more  related  to  youth 
<br/>unemployment, and from your presentation we hear that there are not many youth co-operatives as 
<br/>compared to women and women cooperatives are there because it is out of necessity.  They have to 
<br/>run their families, et cetera.  How do you intend to really engage the youth so they can go into co-
<br/>operatives and make things better for themselves and for their families?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- One of the things that we are doing right now is actually 
<br/>engaging a lot with the Ministry of Youth, particularly when they do festivals, we have a massive 
<br/>youth converging on a location. We are using that as the main opportunity to try and encourage youth, 
<br/></span><span>to sort of get involved in co-operatives. That is the main principal way that we are dealing with the 
<br/></span><span>co-operatives for youth at the moment. We are finding some success, and we will continue with that 
<br/>and then look at other modalities. I think, certainly the education will probably encourage more young 
<br/>men and women to get involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister. My question will be very specific due to the women co-operatives that used to work with 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries for Mother Pearls Project.  One is in Somosomo in Taveuni, one is in Raviravi 
<br/>in Macuata (next to Nakalou Village) and one is in Yaroi in Savusavu.  They make pearls out of 
<br/>mother pearls after the pearl has been actually taken out.  I want to know because these ladies had 
<br/>been established by NGOs and the Ministry of Fisheries went and built extra buildings for them to 
<br/>create.  I just wanted to  know about  the project  and how it is  going  especially  with  Justin  Hunter 
<br/>having containers of mother pearls that have never been used and are just stored in containers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- To be honest, I do not have the data with me at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will get that information and provide that to honourable Koroilavesau, but it is a good question.  I

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will check on that particular co-operative group. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The one in Somosomo is running very well, run by women.  They do not 
<br/>operate  under  a  co-operative  system,  it  is  just  loosely  established  by  an  NGO  and  then  with  the 
<br/>support of the Government.   They have been provided with machines in how to make earrings, et  
<br/>cetera, but nothing beyond that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That would be a good opportunity, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, Sir.  We will take a break now, honourable Members for tea and when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we resume, we will continue with the tenth</span><span> </span><span>Oral Question.

<div><span>Managing Village and Community Affairs 
<br/>(Question No. 254/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the role of the Great Council of Chiefs being pivotal to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people, 
<br/>especially in the rural village and </span><span>tikina</span><span> communities, can the honourable Minister for 
<br/>iTaukei  Affairs  and  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts  inform  Parliament  on  how  will  the 
<br/>Government  be  able  to  manage  village  and  community  affairs  with  the  universal 
<br/>individual freedoms espoused to by the international bodies, like the United Nations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, balancing traditional village and community governance 
<br/>with the principle of universal individual freedom in Fiji is a delicate and sensitive task.  We are 
<br/>navigating  our  way  between  protecting  groups  rights  through  customary  law  and  upholding  the 
<br/>Constitution,  but  generally  there  is  a  friction,  and  we  want  to  set  the  tone  of  changing  the  laws, 
<br/>regulations and by-laws.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  the  GCC  was  reinstated  in  2023,  it  was  entrapped  between  the  evolving  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>community moving with the wind of change versus protecting the fabric of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> society that is 
<br/>rooted  in  communal  living.    With  guidance  from  the  research  that  the  Ministry  is  doing,  we  are 
<br/>looking at are few options.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Please, allow me to highlight a few possible areas that could be adopted by Government in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>order to manage the issue raised by the honourable Koroilavesau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The  customary  law  within  Constitutional  limits,  where  the  Government  can  allow 
<br/>customary law and village governance system to operate as long as they do not infringe the 
<br/>Constitutional rights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Clear  guidelines  could  be  established  to  ensure  that  traditional  practice  align  with  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>national law. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Education and awareness - promoting awareness and educational programme can be rolled 
<br/>out to emphasise the importance of respecting individual rights while maintaining the value 
<br/>of community cohesion to reduce potential conflicts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Consultative  dialogue  -  continuous  dialogue  between  the  Government,  chiefs  and  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>community members can ensure that issues are resolved amicably.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Cultural sensitivity in policy implementation - when introducing new laws or reforms that 
<br/>promote individual freedoms, the Government should consult with local communities to 
<br/>make sure they understand the rationale and can adapt this reform without feeling that their 
<br/>traditional are under threat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>The legal mechanism for conflict resolution - establish a clear legal framework and special 
<br/>court that can help resolve conflict between individual rights and customary practice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>The  gradual  reform  where  village  laws  or  tradition  appears  to  infringe  on  individual 
<br/>freedom.  Gradual reform might be preferable to allow for adaptation and reduce the risk 
<br/>of resistance.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2169 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Empowering  of  local  leaders  -  traditional  leaders  can  be  empowered  through  training 
<br/>programmes  that  highlights  both  human  rights  and  leadership  in  traditional  context,  to 
<br/>ensure that they become advocates for both cultural preservation and individual freedom. 
<br/>This is already proven through the </span><span>sausauvou</span><span> and </span><span>sauvaki ni vanua</span><span> training programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Clear guideline on autonomy - the Government could outline areas where village council 
<br/>and customary law have jurisdictions and where the rights guaranteed by the Constitution 
<br/>must prevail.  For instance, matter like land tenure or traditional ceremony might remain 
<br/>under village control while issues concerning individual rights, movement, education or 
<br/>political expression are managed by national law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the whole machinery of Government must respond to managing  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>community affairs.  The reports of the review of GCC and the iTaukei Administrations have moved 
<br/>into  these  issues  in  more  detail.    In  summary,  the  areas  I  have  mentioned  above  will  set  the 
<br/>foundational limits of Government’s effort to managing the issue raised by the honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  There  being  no  further  questions  and  my  apologies  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Members that have already registered their questions, that is, from Question 252/2024 to Question 
<br/></span><span>No. 253/2024.  I will now revert back to that, and I hope you will accept my apologies.

<div><span>Engagement of Learning at School - Students and Teachers  
<br/>(Question No. 252/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on how the Ministry 
<br/>ensures that Early Childhood, Primary and Secondary students and teachers are engaged 
<br/>in learning at school for the minimum required number of hours in a term? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  think  the  question  is  intended  to  be  provided 
<br/>answers in two prongs.  One is relating to resources and the other is probably related to processes 
<br/>within the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will just provide some indications on the monitoring of teachers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we 
<br/>all  know,  close  to  900  schools  are  located  around  Fiji,  given  their  geographical  location  and 
<br/>advantages and disadvantages of their location, reachability and connectivity.   How we monitor the 
<br/></span><span>schools,  one  is  through  the  Head  of  School.    They  are  qualified  and  also,  they  know  the  basic 
<br/></span><span>teachings and learning plans that they should set out in terms of preparing for their respective classes 
<br/>in their respective schools, despite how far they are from the main centres and main headquarters, 
<br/>they are expected to perform; a very crucial role in the monitoring and assisting the teachers and 
<br/>students in their respective schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the teaching hours of the respective schools for early childhood, 
<br/>a minimum of 20 hours is required per week, primary school 36 hours per week and secondary school 
<br/>is 37.5 hours per week as expected too with all the teachers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every  school  has  its  own  unique  ethos  and  programmes  in  place  and  their  programmes 
<br/>revolve around learning and teaching. We place a lot of emphasis on the trust that we give to the 
<br/>respective Heads of School and the teachers given the very crucial role that they play in nurturing 
<br/>the students in their respective schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the early childhood level, the Ministry has taken pro-active measures to provide early

<div><span>childhood children with a stimulating learning environment and encourages exploration, creativity 
<br/>and  social  interaction.  Also,  by  promoting  play-based  learning  and  personalised  attention,  the 
<br/>Ministry aims to keep our youngest learners engaged and excited about coming to school each day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For primary and secondary levels, the Ministry recognises the importance of maintaining a 
<br/>conducive  learning  environment  that  fosters  academic  growth  and  personal  development.  The 
<br/>curriculum is designed to be inclusive, engaging and relevant to catering the diverse needs and the 
<br/>interest of our students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  Ministry  understands  the  very  crucial  role  that  the  teachers  play  in  shaping  the 
<br/>education of our students and we are committed to give the necessary support also. Some of these 
<br/>include  cluster  organised  professional  development  sessions,  collaborating  with  teacher  training 
<br/>institutions in the specific areas of STEM subjects through the provision of resources and training to 
<br/>keep them motivated and engaged in their profession. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  the  honourable  Minister  remains  very 
<br/>positive, I and the parents feel that there is some sort of disconnect with his Permanent Secretary and 
<br/>his staff because in the issue of appointment of new teachers, the students are suffering.  The question 
<br/></span><span>to the honourable Minister is, parents have raised their issue of teachers resigning by the day and re-
<br/></span><span>appointments are not happening.  How is the honourable Minister going to mitigate this to ensure 
<br/>that teachers are there, our children get their education they deserve because this is about the future 
<br/>of this country. What are you going to do about it, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure what is the question that has been 
<br/>raised by the honourable Member, but as I said, there are challenges in terms of resources, maybe 
<br/>that is the intention of the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education is working towards mitigating those challenges in providing the 
<br/>necessary teachers.  Some of the changes that were made in the previous government, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, is first they change the classification of schools from small, to medium to large, therefore, they 
<br/>allocated teaching resources accordingly which till to-date the teachers in their respective schools are 
<br/>still complaining because of the lack of teaching resources. For example, Dogotuki Primary School, 
<br/>it is a boarding school right in the interior of Macuata. They only have four teachers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Boarding accommodates from ECE level. This is an ongoing issue that we are wanting to 
<br/>resolve.  Without executive teachers and this is something that we wanted to address, by appointing 
<br/></span><span>executive teachers in these respective schools to address these teacher shortages and the minimum 
<br/></span><span>hours required to operate in a school environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  there may be certain fields or subject areas where there 
<br/>are  shortage  of  teachers  and  due  to  which  the  students  are  not  taught  for  the  minimum  required 
<br/>number of hours.  How is the Ministry addressing this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- These are inherited issues which he  was responsible for when 
<br/>he was in charge of Human Resources. The honourable Member is fully aware of the situation. Do 
<br/>not worry, we are working towards improving that by providing the necessary teachers as per needed 
<br/>by the respective school. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You are asking a question, you want the reply and then all are talking. So,

<div><span>Actions Taken to Alleviate Water Supply Shortage 
<br/>(Question No. 253/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport update Parliament on what actions were taken to alleviate shortage of water 
<br/>supply to consumers during dry conditions and in which areas?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  yes,  water  is  a  serious  issue  and  I  do 
<br/>understand how frustrating it can be.  As I have already explained, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy 
<br/>considers  an  outcome  of  sustainability  moving  forward.    But,  of  course,  we  face  the  ravages  of 
<br/>climate change, and the Coalition Government is committed to addressing water issues, not only in 
<br/>terms of infrastructure but, of course, given the various challenges faced by climate change and the 
<br/>recent dry weather.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the affected areas included the Tamavua System which impacted on Princess Road, 
<br/>Tovata, Deuba, Navua, Korovou and Vunidawa.  In the Western Division, 15 water sources have 
<br/></span><span>been impacted and six critical levels.  The 15 water sources include - Narara Dam, Nakasia, Nalau, 
<br/></span><span>Nasici, Balevuto, Waiwai, Varaciva, Vareqe, Vaturu and Sigatoka. Some critical ones in terms of the 
<br/>dry weather include - Narara, Nakasia, Balevuto, Babau and Varaqe. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Northern  Division,  areas  impacted  are  Taganikula,  Vunika,  Nabouwalu,  Bulileka, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dreketi and Seaqaqa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  mitigation  measures  taken  and  immediate  actions,  the  water  rationing  and 
<br/>scheduling  have  been  introduced.  This  included  structure  water  rationing  and  scheduling 
<br/>programmes to assist communities in managing water shortages in the areas I had mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we have the free Water Tank Scheme. These have been distributed to various rural 
<br/>areas and also the affected areas and that scheme is still open.  This Scheme enables residents, of 
<br/>course, to store water during water shortages and another temporary measure was the construction of 
<br/>temporary cofferdams.  In the Western Division this was done at Varaciva, Nadrou and Qalau, and 
<br/>in in the Waimanu intake in the Central Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  continue  with  public  awareness  and  advisories  in  these  various  areas  and  the  need  to 
<br/></span><span>conserve water in terms of the dry weather.  Of course, there have been close consultation with the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Rural Development and Maritime.  I thank the Commissioners in the various Divisions, 
<br/>given their close monitoring of the situation and close consultation with the Water Authority of Fiji, 
<br/>which enabled us to quickly move in terms of alleviating these issues.  Some of the areas include 
<br/>Yanuca, Vatulele and Yasawa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of moving forward, of course, I had mentioned the leak detection.  That is an ongoing 
<br/>work  and  long-term  actions,  which  I  will  not  repeat  in  terms  of  the  investment  of  the  water 
<br/>infrastructure I had mentioned yesterday.  This is ongoing in terms of addressing the nation’s water 
<br/>issues, and of course moving forward with the upcoming cyclone season, we will continue to monitor 
<br/>and work closely with the Ministry of Rural Development and Disaster Management to ensure that 
<br/>our citizens are adequately catered for, whatever the situation may arise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  With respect to the closure 
<br/></span><span>of Water Authority of Fiji’s water supply, certain times we have received complaints from citizens 
<br/></span><span>that WAF needs to think about the people, think about the children, the hospital workers and even

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just like today, we are notified that tomorrow our Parliament will be closed due to  Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji doing its maintenance work.  Similarly, we have called the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Education to close the schools tomorrow, there could be situations where parents will be affected, 
<br/>and I thank the honourable Minister for listening to me.  But he did not close the schools yet he is  
<br/>still contemplating but I urge the Government …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There are certain areas only that we have been advised that there will be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>closure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- I hope in future….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, you listen when I am talking, honourable Member.  I think they caught 
<br/>on to the sickness coming from this side.  They are firing questions and all the explanations going 
<br/>on, it is so difficult.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been advised that there will be closure and that is where it ends on the precincts of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament.    We  have  taken  the  liberty  to  do  all  that  we  can  to  ensure  that  you  are  comfortable, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members.  The closure for the education, that is none of our business in Parliament.  That 
<br/>is the honourable Minister’s and the Government of the day.  You have been talking for quite long, 
<br/>what is your question, or you forgot your question now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I think in terms of the water disruption, the actual work itself, 
<br/>the 900mm Viria to Waila connection, the work which will be done is part of the servicing strategy 
<br/>plan for the Viria Water Supply System to build the resiliency of the Suva-Nausori Water Supply 
<br/>System.    The  Waila  System  currently  operates  four  major  lift  pumps  to  provide  flow  into  the 
<br/>Wainibuku  Reservoir  which  in  turn  supplies  Tovata,  Kalabu,  Flagstaff,  Nasinu,  Nagatugatu, 
<br/>Dokainaisavu and Colo-i-Suva Reservoirs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The service delivery risk that currently exist for the Waila System is the lack of backup for 
<br/>the existing pumping system, should a major failure of assets such as the switchboard transformer et 
<br/>cetera,  occur  reducing  the  pumping  capacity.    The  risk  has  the  potential  to  impact  supply  to 
<br/>approximately  40  percent  of  the Suva,  Nausori  population.    The  900-millimetre  connection  to  be 
<br/></span><span>connected this weekend  is  an important  resiliency work  as it provides the opportunity  to  provide 
<br/></span><span>additional supplementary flow to maintain service delivery, as much as possible, should any major 
<br/>fault occur in Waila.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, once the Viria Treatment Plant capacity is expanded to 80 million litres per Day 
<br/>(MLD) from the existing 40 MLD, more flow will be available to be pushed into the Suva System 
<br/>via Waila through this connection which will be done through this weekend, ensuring capacity to 
<br/>meet current and future depends.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have a question for the honourable Minister, we seem to be 
<br/>promoting rainwater harvesting many in the rural areas.  What is the plan for urban areas, rainwater 
<br/>harvesting system? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- We are encouraging that too in terms of backup and we have 
<br/></span><span>allocated funding in the Water Authority of Fiji.  Anyone who wishes to apply can apply for that.  
<br/></span><span>They will need to have a base and the piping system or the connection to the guttering.  For me, it is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>always good for you to have your backup at home because we never know what will happen, climate 
<br/>change and the extremes in the weather systems.  If the water flow improves, anything can happen.  
<br/>During the cyclones, there can be a landslide which disrupts the waterpipe infrastructure or flood or 
<br/>anything.  We have seen what happened in Northern Carolina, USA in last weekend, that is the most 
<br/>developed and richest nation, I suppose, but close to a million people are affected.  My message to 
<br/>the nation, always have a backup in terms of rainwater harvesting.

<div><span>Review of the Trade Policy Framework 
<br/>(Question No. 255/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on what 
<br/>the Ministry’s plans are on the Trade Policy Framework that is due for review next year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  Trade  Policy  Framework  is 
<br/></span><span>approaching its expiry.  The last one was prepared by the former government from 2015 to 2025.  
<br/>Obviously, the plans are afoot to review it for its effectiveness, its impact, provide recommendations 
<br/>for future trade policies that will ensure that we continue to drive Fiji’s economy, its development 
<br/>and also encourage more trading relations or healthy trading relations, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Trade, Sir, will be working with the Australian Government to develop the 
<br/>new trade policy. I guess, given what we are seeing in the economy and the myriad of significant 
<br/>opportunities  that  are  approaching  Fiji  and  underpinned  by  the  global  dynamics  that  continue  to 
<br/>happen, technological advancements and, of course, climate change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The next Trade Policy will be quite critical.  When I say exciting things coming at us, Sir, for 
<br/>example,  the  </span><span>Google</span><span>  investment  will  create  a  massive  surge  in  ICT  development  in  Fiji.  We  are 
<br/>seeing some of it already, I had a meeting at 8.30 last night with someone from United Kingdom, 
<br/>that is the type of interest that has been generated in the last few months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commercial  agriculture,  Sir,  you  have  got  Fiji  Water  in  the  country  looking  at  serious 
<br/>commercial agriculture, there are few others that are coming through.  These are the types of exciting 
<br/></span><span>opportunities that are coming, starting to emerge some serious interest in commercial aquaculture, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, and these are the things that the trade policy needs to address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the things that will be key with the new Trade Policy Framework will be the newly 
<br/>launched  National  Development  Plan  and  the  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper  launched  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  recently.  Of  course,  we  will  ensure  that  the  private  sector  is 
<br/>comprehensively consulted, we feel that the private sector needs to be at the centre of any of these 
<br/>initiatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at, not only the current economic architecture, Sir, but also when those industries 
<br/>that are very successful for us at the moment but also looking at new industries. There is a question 
<br/>on medicinal cannabis coming up so soon, probably answer it in the next session, but these are the 
<br/>types of things that are happening and, of course, as expected need to account for the relevant laws 
<br/>and regulations and particularly international agreements that we need to look at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Sir, for example, we have had a bit of a brief discussion on PACER, so hopefully that 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will come through in the next trade policy. There is the Interim Economic Partnership Agreement 
<br/>(IEPA) which we have just initialled for execution, so how does that translate into the trade policy, 
<br/>and also looking at some of the other trading destinations? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  we  all  agree  that  we  have  not  really  looked  at  Southeast  Asia  in  any  close  detail.  
<br/>Southeast Asia, Sir, has 750 million humans or souls.  It is a large market there, and of course, we 
<br/>would have all noticed that the UAE and Saudi are starting to look at the Pacific. These are some of 
<br/>the things that we will probably have to look at in terms of the policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, this Parliament is now aware of, that will continue 
<br/>to be part of the policy and how do we use that to maximise our opportunities.  It is always important 
<br/>that in these policies we ensure that inclusivity is factored in - to the youth, women, civil society, and 
<br/>ensuring  that  resourcing  requirements  are  identified  as  well  to  ensure  that  the  policy  is  well 
<br/>articulated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plan is to table the policy next year at some point once it is ready for 
<br/>tabulation. We have a whole year next year, but it should be in my view, quite an exciting document 
<br/>given the type of things we are seeing emerge in our economy and it certainly augurs well for how 
<br/></span><span>we try and continue to ensure that we diversify the Fijian economy and also attract investment as 
<br/></span><span>well to our shores.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, a question to the honourable Minister; in light of the fact 
<br/>that this is going to be our guiding document, with respect to any trade agreements and all the ones 
<br/>that  you  have  spelt  out  now,  what  kind  of  assistance  are  we  actually  getting  with  respect  to  the 
<br/>diagnostic work that needs to be done in order to get us to where we want to in terms of a new trade 
<br/>policy  framework?    The  last  time  we  had  engaged  with  Hub  and  Spokes  (H&amp;S)  out  of  the 
<br/>Commonwealth, there were some other people that were engaged to do the diagnostic works. Are we 
<br/>going to engage, or do we have our own people doing our own diagnostic work on it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA. - Thank you, honourable Koya, for the question. As I had 
<br/>mentioned in the answer, we are leveraging off Australia. As you know, there is a certain expert out 
<br/>of  New  Zealand  that  we  use  quite  regularly  as  well,  and  he  is  probably  going  to  be  part  of  that 
<br/>exercise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the good things about our trade team is that we are quite experienced, there has not 
<br/>really been any significant movement in that team for the last, probably eight years, I think, for those 
<br/></span><span>that have left Fiji. There is a lot of knowledge retention, at the moment, within the trade team, and 
<br/></span><span>so that will come to the fore when we develop the policy and we overlay that with the assistance that 
<br/>we  generally  get  from  some  of  our  consultants  that  we  use  quite  regularly;  and  together  with 
<br/>Australia, I am sure we will have that adequately covered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Sir, I have a question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister on 
<br/>South East Asia. This is something that probably has fallen off the rail. I asked with your investment 
<br/>team when we came to touch on the budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been some discussions with China about agriculture and fisheries products, apart 
<br/>from what we are going into China, and you will know the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules 
<br/>and we are a middle-income country, we are no longer a Least Developed Country (LDC) but huge 
<br/></span><span>opportunity, we have already sent </span><span>dalo</span><span> to China.  They love our </span><span>dalo</span><span> and they use it for so many 
<br/></span><span>things. The problem is when it lands. We are pleading with China as a big brother, give us something, 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2175 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>apart from the WTO regulations. Is that something that we are going to pick up again and please 
<br/>check with the team?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition, he does make 
<br/>a good point. There are some non-tariff barriers that we have to contend with when we deal with 
<br/>China. So, it is a work in progress, we actually have a team in China at the Trade Consulate, that 
<br/>specifically tries to handhold when companies come through to get approvals. It is something that 
<br/>we continue to work on. That rule applies to everyone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will notice that the honourable Prime Minister had signed an MOU with China recently.  
<br/>That  will  hopefully  create  some  positive  movement  in  our  direction  and  certainly  the  level  of 
<br/>engagement that the honourable Prime Minister had, he met the top three in China when he was there. 
<br/>These things will hopefully translate into some more favourable disposition when it comes to China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  agree  China  is  a  major  market  potential  for  us,  we  only  need  to  get  1  percent  of  their 
<br/>population, and we will be very happy.  I know the honourable Minister for Agriculture is doing quite 
<br/>a bit of work with a few Chinese farmers already in the country.  One, his doing </span><span>noni; </span><span>that we feel is 
<br/>quite  a  big  opportunity  and  there  are  some  other  opportunities  that  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/></span><span>Agriculture is working on, more vegetable production for export to China. So, these are some of the 
<br/></span><span>things that are being worked on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Kava,  we  feel,  is  an  opportunity  as  well.   At  the  moment,  there  is  kava  sent  to  China  for 
<br/>production as well, so these are some of the things.  Then, of course, you have got cosmetic care 
<br/>products, even Fiji Bitter, Fiji Rum, these are some products that have some traction in China, and 
<br/>we are continuing to work on those but, yes, I agree.  Regarding China, it is a big opportunity so 
<br/>when I talk about Southeast Asia, that involves China as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Establishment of a Cancer Treatment Hospital 
<br/>(Question No. 256/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  the  Minister  for  Health  and  Medical  Services  inform 
<br/>Parliament if the Government has any plans to establish a cancer treatment hospital in 
<br/>Fiji to address the surge in cancer patients? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, yes, he is correct that there is a surge 
<br/></span><span>in cancer diagnosis.  It is being increasingly noted here in Fiji and it spares not any particular section 
<br/>within the population, it affects both adults/children, male/female, high/low socio-economic status.  
<br/>Cancer is also amongst the leading cause of NCDs causing illness and mortality as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the current management we have at the moment, it extends from prevention right 
<br/>up to the avoidance of the risk factors - vaccination, early diagnosis treatment, medicine, surgical 
<br/>procedures and radiation therapy, rehabilitation, and that includes chronic pain management. Most 
<br/>treatment  modalities  that  I  have  mentioned  are  available  at  our  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary 
<br/>healthcare facilities around the country.  However, radiotherapy treatment is still not available in the 
<br/>country, and for that, someone to be seeking radiotherapy treatment will have to be referred overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per your question, are there any plans to establish a specific cancer treatment hospital </span><span>per 
<br/>se</span><span>?  At  the  moment,  no,  because  most  of  the  treatment  modalities  are  incorporated  in  the  various 
<br/></span><span>settings that I have mentioned. But nevertheless, our Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with Aspen 
<br/></span><span>under Government and Health Care Fiji Limited for Lautoka and Ba Hospitals, they were supposed

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to provide radiotherapy services at the tertiary hospitals in Lautoka Hospital in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, establishing a radiotherapy centre is a fairly costly exercise, that is why through the 
<br/>PPP  arrangements  that  I  mentioned  that  Lautoka  and  Ba  Hospitals  were  supposed  to  establish  a 
<br/>radiotherapy  centre,  but  it  does  not  move  away  with  what  the  current  treatment  modalities  are.  
<br/>Nevertheless, not only cancer therapy, but we are also anticipating construction soon of a heart and 
<br/>kidney treatment that will be coming under the Super Speciality Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  now,  in  addition  to  the  treatment  modalities,  the  Ministry  is  working  with  Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) towards a Radiotherapy Treatment 
<br/>Centre project at Lautoka Hospital that I have mentioned. Also, work is currently undertaken for the 
<br/>multisectoral team to review the Radiation Health Act 2009 to be able to allow the introduction of 
<br/>radiotherapy services in Fiji.  That is the pre-requisite in order to have the radiotherapy services in 
<br/>Fiji that our legislation has to align with international standards before.  We are doing that as we 
<br/>speak.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit, I wish to remind everyone, as honourable Ketan Lal has mentioned, this month 
<br/>is breast cancer awareness month.  As Members of this august Parliament, I wish everyone if they 
<br/></span><span>can take the opportunity to advocate for cancer awareness in terms of advocating for screening and 
<br/></span><span>treatment and asking people to come on board and have a screening to be identified for treatment, if 
<br/>need be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister  for  the  answer  to  the  question.    Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, in terms of radiotherapy, I believe they all have to go abroad to get it.  There are some 
<br/>with  insurance  or  are  financially  capable  of  going  there.    What  about  people  who  cannot  afford 
<br/>insurance or are not financially stable?  What kind of assistance are there for these kind of patients 
<br/>to go up and get treated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  a  budgeted 
<br/>allocation  on  overseas  referral.    Should  a  patient  be  referred  by  their  doctor  or  specialist  for 
<br/>radiotherapy treatment and they cannot afford, then they can always contact the Ministry, and if they 
<br/>are eligible for the overseas referral abroad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest costs when it comes to cancer 
<br/>treatment  is  chemotherapy.    Recently,  Solomon Islands  has  actually  signed  an  MOU  with  Indian 
<br/>Pharmacopoeia  (IP)  from  India.    If  people  travel  from  Fiji  to  India,  they  are  given  IP  standard 
<br/></span><span>medication and if we compare the cost of IP medication – cytotoxic, that are actually available in 
<br/></span><span>Australia and New Zealand, it might be ten-folds more.  What you can obtain for $20 in India, would 
<br/>be $200 out of Australia.  Are there any plans to have selective categories of medications such as 
<br/>cytotoxic, antiretrovirals to allow IP standard to be brought into Fiji so that we can reduce the cost 
<br/>of chemotherapy and antiretrovirals for viral protection such as AIDS, et cetera?  Are there any plans 
<br/>with the Ministry of Health because that will significantly reduce the cost?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of IP, that is something 
<br/>that the Ministry is looking into.  I am sure you are aware that when you were in India, our team from 
<br/>the Fiji Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Services (FPBS) was also there.  They went and did some 
<br/>research on equipment and medication and had a brief idea of the Indian Pharmacopoeia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are correct in terms of the Indian Pharmacopoeia and the medications for chemotherapy 
<br/>and ARV.  The Ministry, through their return from India, have briefed the Ministry on a way forward 
<br/></span><span>on identifying certain groups of medications that you have rightly mentioned.  Upon the return of the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>team, they had briefed me and said, “yes, we can look into IP”, ensuring that while we try to maintain 
<br/>our standards, we can still adopt the IP system in India.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in light of the fact that we know that there is a 
<br/>surge in cancer patients, are we currently doing the research to find out why there is a surge? And it 
<br/>is twofold, Sir, if  there is a surge and we know the reasons why in terms of getting a new hospital 
<br/>specifically for cancer patients, will it incorporate doing research at the hospital? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, in terms of the research component 
<br/>of why there is a rise or surge in cancer cases within Fiji, that is something, I believe, not only as a 
<br/>Ministry  but  together  with  our  local  tertiary  institutions  are  looking  into  and  which  also  our 
<br/>development partners are assisting us in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, I can say that most are under Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) and in terms 
<br/>of the cancer that are currently on the rise here in Fiji it has to do with infections and lifestyle.  That 
<br/>is  a  proven fact  and  also  that is  why, as the research continues,  we are also  making sure that we 
<br/>strengthen the primary healthcare space - the preventative part of it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know the causes, that has been clearly identified and I suggest putting out the word 
<br/></span><span>that prevention is still better than cure, and at the same time, continuing with the research data from 
<br/>our own local tertiary institutions and overseas as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Exams - Re-Introduction of Scaling  
<br/>(Question No. 257/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  update  Parliament  on  the  re-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>introduction of scaling in the National Examination Process? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  just  wanted  to  inform  Parliament  that  the 
<br/>process  of  the  re-introduction  of  scaling  has  just  been  given  the  approval  from  Cabinet.    Public 
<br/>consultation will be undertaken in terms of the re-introduction of scaling of the national examination.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would like to share with us this morning the rationale in terms of the reasoning 
<br/>behind the need to re-introduce the scaling system in the national examination system.  We tend to 
<br/></span><span>raise the scaling system to  be introduced subject to  Cabinet’s endorsement  in the 2025 education 
<br/></span><span>year, after the completion of the consultation, policy adjustments and policy preparation at the school 
<br/>level to ensure the transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why  the  introduction  of  the  scaling  system?  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  is,  it  makes  a  fair 
<br/>representation of student performances.  As it was introduced, most of us have come through the 
<br/>scaling system before it was disbanded in 2015.  It helps normalise examination scores to account 
<br/>for varying degrees of difficulty across subjects and exams.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, it addresses disparities. If you see, Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the schools that are in 
<br/>the rural and maritime areas, they seen to have lessen in terms of number of schools because they 
<br/>tend  to  migrate  towards  the  schools  in  towns  and  cities,  thinking  the  school  system  here  would 
<br/>provide them better opportunities. That is the reason why we are trying to re-introduce the scaling 
<br/>system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Alignment with international standards, many countries use a form of scaling in their national
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>examination  system  to  ensure  consistency  and  fairness.    Therefore,  by  re-introducing  the  scaling 
<br/>system in Fiji, it is in alignment with international best practices in students’ assessment, ensuring 
<br/>that students results are credible and comparable at the global level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have just been given the approval to conduct the public 
<br/>consultation  exercise  and  hopefully  we  will  capture  all  the  information  that  is  shared  in  the 
<br/>consultation process to be taken into consideration once it is re-introduced.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Data on School Dropouts – 2019-2023 
<br/>(Question No. 258/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are circumstances due to which some children are compelled to drop out of 
<br/>school. Can the honourable Minister for Education inform Parliament on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>what  is  the  Ministry  doing  to  identify  these  students  and  how  is  the  Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>planning to assist these children; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>how many students dropped out in the last 5 years (2019 to 2023) before completing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>primary education; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)   how many students dropped out in the last 5 years (2019 to 2023) before completing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 10? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I table my  response in  accordance  with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1</span><span>
<br/>Standing Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, take note that there will be four Bills today. 
<br/>One will be moved under Standing Orders 51, two will be for debate, vote and enactment and one 
<br/>for first reading.
