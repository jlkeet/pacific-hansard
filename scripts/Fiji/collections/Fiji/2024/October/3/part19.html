<h3>NATIONAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>NATIONAL DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of  Parliament on 
<br/>Thursday 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy  Prime Ministers, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/>at  the  outset,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  commendable  work  done  by  the  Chairperson  and 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Justice Law and Human Rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  National  Disaster  Risk  Management  Bill,  as  you  see  today,  is  a  manifestation  of  the 
<br/>thorough consultation and verification process.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part one, of the Bill provides the 
<br/>short title and outlines when the Bill will come into effect. It also includes the interpretation of key 
<br/>terms used throughout the legislation, ensuring clarity and consistency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the application section defines the scope of the Bill specifying where and how

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2191 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the provisions apply.  Most importantly, this part establishes the objectives of the Bill which aims to 
<br/>enhance Fiji’s preparedness, resilience and response to disasters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It also sets out the guiding principles that will underpin our disaster risk management efforts, 
<br/>ensuring a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable approach. With these foundational elements in 
<br/>place,  we  are  equipped  to  move  forward  with  a  strong  and  effective  Disaster  Management 
<br/>Framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 2 of the Bill focuses on disaster risk governance. This Bill is designed 
<br/>to build a more resilient Fiji. At the heart of this framework as a National Disaster Risk Management 
<br/>Council,  which  is  all  the  Permanent  Secretaries  for  Government  Ministries  and  key  Government 
<br/>statutory bodies. The Council will serve as a central body responsible for overseeing disaster risk 
<br/>governance across the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To complement this effort the establishment of the Disaster Risk Reduction Committee, the 
<br/>merger of the two committees from the previous Act would be pivotal in driving our national agenda 
<br/>on disaster mitigation, prevention and preparedness. This Committee will lead our efforts in raising 
<br/>awareness, training our communities and ensuring the Disaster Risk Reduction becomes an integral 
<br/></span><span>part of our development planning. By enhancing our disaster preparedness, we are not just reacting 
<br/></span><span>to crisis, but proactively reducing the impacts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, equally important is the role of the emergency committee, which is tasked 
<br/>with  coordinating  our  immediate  response  when  disasters  occur.  Under  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary responsible for Disaster Management, this Committee ensures a swift, efficient, 
<br/>well-coordinated response minimising the damage and loss often caused by disasters.  Additionally, 
<br/>the Committee has the authority to convene and make recommendations to Cabinet in the event that 
<br/>National Disaster Risk Management Council is unable to convene. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Part  2,  also  defines  the  roles  of  the  National  Controller  and  National 
<br/>Coordinator who will have broad oversight and operational powers to lead and coordinate disaster 
<br/>management efforts across the country. These roles will ensure that our systems are agile and capable 
<br/>of adapting to any emergency that may arise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Disaster Risk Management Office  (NDRMO) 
<br/>will serve as a cornerstone for our Disaster Governance Framework formally known as the National 
<br/>Disaster Management Office. This rebranded entity reflects a strategic shift towards managing risks 
<br/></span><span>before they escalate into disasters. With a dedicated team and strong leadership the NDRMO will 
<br/></span><span>oversee the coordination of all aspects of disaster management from preparedness and planning, to 
<br/>response and recovery, ensuring a more proactive and efficient approach to safeguarding our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we proceed with part 2 of the Bill, I would like to highlight several key 
<br/>components  that  are  vital  to  strengthening  our  Disaster  Risk  Management  Framework.  This  Bill 
<br/>retains the Clause regarding the Disaster Service Liaison Officer from the previous legislation.  This 
<br/>officer  will  play  a  critical  role  in  coordinating  disaster  management  efforts  among  stakeholders 
<br/>within the respective agencies ensuring effective communication and collaboration during times of 
<br/>crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  the  establishment  of  the  Single  Window  International  Facilitation  Team  is  a 
<br/>critical step forward. This Team will streamline and manage international assistance during disasters, 
<br/>ensuring  that  legal  and  logistical  challenges  are  addressed,  and  that  aid  can  be  received  and 
<br/></span><span>distributed efficiently. By formalising this process, we guarantee that international support is swiftly 
<br/></span><span>mobilised when needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>2192 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of the Fiji Cluster System will further enhance our disaster management 
<br/>capacity  by  coordinating  sector  specific  responses.  This  System  encourages  collaboration  across 
<br/>various sectors such as Health and Nutrition, Education and Communications, ensuring a cohesive 
<br/>and integrated approach to disaster response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also provides for the registration and regulation of humanitarian actors and disaster 
<br/>risk  management  volunteers.  These  actors  will  be  recognised  through  a  formal  registry  and  clear 
<br/>standards will be established to ensure accountability and effectiveness roles in their contributions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This structure also allows for the deregistration of actors or volunteer organisations that fail 
<br/>to meet the required standards thereby maintaining the integrity of our disaster response efforts. The 
<br/>Bill introduces a system for eligible actors with a formal registry that ensures all entities contributing 
<br/>to disaster risk management are properly recognised and regulated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we advance to Part 3 of this significant Bill, I would like to highlight the 
<br/>provisions concerning the sub-national administration. This section elevated from the 1995 National 
<br/>Disaster Management Plan, establishes the Divisional Disaster Risk Management Office as a vital 
<br/>entity in our efforts to address disaster risks at the Divisional level. The functions of the Divisional 
<br/></span><span>Disaster Risk Management Office are clearly defined, ensuring that each Division is equipped with 
<br/></span><span>the necessary leadership to implement effective disaster risk management strategies tailored to the 
<br/>specific needs and circumstances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  establishment  of  Disaster  Risk  Management  Committees  recognises 
<br/>membership  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  municipal  level  and  community  level.  The  National 
<br/>Coordinator,  in  consultation  with  the  responsible  Divisional  Commissioner  is  tasked  with 
<br/>establishing these committees at the following levels provincial and state levels, municipal level in 
<br/>consultation with the responsible Special Administrator or Mayor, community level in collaboration 
<br/>the responsible Turaga ni Koro or District Advisory Council. The membership of these sub-national 
<br/>Disaster Risk Management Committees is clearly defined in the respective schedules. Schedule 5 
<br/>outlines members for Provincial and District Levels. Schedule 6 details members for municipal levels 
<br/>and schedule seven specifies members for community levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  structured  approach,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ensures  that  the  Disaster  Risk  Management  is 
<br/>effectively addressed at every level of our society, fostering a coordinated and proactive response to 
<br/>potential disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we proceed to part 4 of the Bill, I would like to emphasise the financial arrangements that 
<br/></span><span>are crucial for our disaster disk management efforts, this part outlines the provisions for the budget 
<br/>dedicated to disaster risk management, ensuring that adequate resources are allocated to support our 
<br/>initiatives and response strategies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part  5,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  establish  the  Disaster  Risk  Management  Fund.  This  fund  is 
<br/>designed to provide the necessary financial support for disaster preparedness and response activities, 
<br/>including loss and damage. The purpose the fund, along with its application processes, procurement 
<br/>guidelines and the requirements for accounting audits are clearly defined to ensure transparency and 
<br/>accountability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, the fund will be subject to an annual report, and we have included provisions 
<br/>for  income  tax  exemption  to  encourage  contributions  and  investments  in  our  disaster  risk 
<br/>management efforts.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2193 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 6, which focuses on disaster risk reduction. This section includes the 
<br/>establishment of a multiple hazard warning system, ensuring that there will be effective mechanisms 
<br/>in place to provide timely warnings to our communities. The responsibilities of the various agencies 
<br/>involved in issuing warnings, arrangement of this warning and the communication systems that will 
<br/>be utilised are all outlined in this part.  Furthermore, Sir, we also address the need for evacuation 
<br/>centres,  recognising  the  critical  roles  in  ensuring the safety  and well-being of our  citizens during 
<br/>emergencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 7 focuses on disaster risk management plans. This section introduces 
<br/>the National Disaster Risk Management Plan detailing its contents and the process for regular reviews 
<br/>to ensure its effectiveness. It also mandates the creation of Divisional Provincial and District Disaster 
<br/>Risk Management Plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 9 of the Bill, outlines the provisions regarding emergency operations. 
<br/>Details  of  the  process  for  declaring  national  state  of  disaster  including  public  dissemination  and 
<br/>duration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 11 focuses on relief and early recovery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 12 addresses international assistance, here we outline the processes for 
<br/>assessing the need for international support, making requests and coordinating efforts. It clarifies the 
<br/>responsibilities of assisting international actors, ensuring effective collaboration with global partners 
<br/>during crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Part 13, it discusses international deployment, establishing a national emergency response 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>team, tasked with mobilising resources and expertise during emergencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Part 14 of the Bill, I would like to outline the miscellaneous 
<br/>provisions is essential for the effective implementation of the National Disaster Risk Management 
<br/>Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill represents a comprehensive approach to disaster risk 
<br/>management, equipping our nation with the tools and frameworks necessary to effectively respond 
<br/>to and recover from disasters. Thank you, </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span> and </span><span>dhanyavaad.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Honourable Members, the floor is open for debate on the motion. I also 
<br/></span><span>have a list with me and like the other Bills that has been passed. This one here will be debated to one 
<br/></span><span>hour only. The Secretary-General will pass the timely note and speaking times will be limited to five 
<br/>minutes each.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For that we have made some changes as well and the batting will be led by the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  who  will  be  speaking  for  17  minutes.    Then  the  Minister  for  Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection will follow, she will be speaking for seven minutes.  Then it will be 
<br/>followed  by  honourable  Deputy  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics, who will be speaking for seven minutes.  Followed by the Minister for 
<br/>Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services who will also speak for seven minutes, and 
<br/>that will round off the participation on the debate. That comes to one hour. So, the floor is yours, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first allow me to thank the honourable Members 
<br/></span><span>of  the  Opposition,  including  the  G-9  Bloc,  Sir,  for  allowing  me  to  perhaps  just  take  up  the  time 
<br/></span><span>allocated to us.

<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me congratulate the honourable Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management and his team, past and present, and partners for having worked so hard for the past years 
<br/>to arrive at this point where we now have the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 being 
<br/>tabled in this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must say, that today brings me, personally, a sense of satisfaction considering that I was a 
<br/>part of this journey in the efforts to review the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998 and in the 
<br/>initial phases of the review, which has resulted in the Bill now tabled for debate. Having served us, 
<br/>as  Divisional  Disaster  Coordinator,  as  National  Disaster  Controller,  and  as  the  line  minister  for 
<br/>National Disaster Management, I can attest to the need for the review of the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also need to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister because the Act was in 1998 and, 
<br/>of course, the National Disaster Management Plan was also of 1995, which had his signature on those 
<br/>documents. But as time progressed, and given the phenomenon’s that we went through, there is a 
<br/>need, because of the so many actors coming into the country, the overlap and the duplication in roles 
<br/>and of course the need for us to align as well. So that we can accommodate and facilitate our partners 
<br/>when they do come into the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  main  purposes  of  the  review  of  the  Act,  Sir,  was  to  pave  the  way  forward  to 
<br/></span><span>overcome the overlapping roles in the administrative, boundaries and to create a stronger sense of 
<br/>shared  responsibility  within  government,  communities  and  with  partners  throughout  the  disaster 
<br/>management cycle for mitigation to preparedness, response and recovery. I am happy to note from 
<br/>my very quick browse through this Bill that most of the review objectives have been covered in the 
<br/>Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, Sir, first was </span><span>TC Pam</span><span> of 2015. We deployed, and we just utilised our experience 
<br/>in  the  Military  deployment  and  of  course  have  to  seek  Cabinet  approval.  We  learnt  a  lot  from 
<br/>Vanuatu,  particularly  with  the  arrangements  that  they  have,  together  with  the  team  and  when  we 
<br/>looked at the lessons learned, we then had </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2006.  We were overwhelmed and we had 
<br/>a lot of support, and that led to the serious discussions, not only here but regionally as well.  Together 
<br/>with  the  Australia’s  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  honourable  Julie  Bishop,  we  talked  about  the 
<br/>region, and we talked about Fiji as well. One is the Act and then the regional arrangements as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will make a few comments, not that they are there, but probably something 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that can be looked into as well for consideration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  shift  in  the  focus  of  the  Act  from  natural  disasters  to  multi-hazard  approach  marks  a 
<br/></span><span>significant step forward in terms of development in Fiji as this brings our disaster legislation up to 
<br/>par  with  current  global  practices.    Before  it  only  covered  natural  disasters,  not  man-made 
<br/>phenomenon and that, sort of, restricts us in so many ways.  If we talk about oil spill but, of course, 
<br/>does  not  involve  terrorism,  that  is  under  a  separate  Act  altogether.    But  we  were  only  limited  to 
<br/>natural disasters.  Now, the multi-hazard approach, that has been addressed in the Bill and I wish to 
<br/>thank the honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has talked about the national administration covered in Part 2.  I just 
<br/>wish to comment very quickly, honourable Minister, on Division 6 - Humanitarian Actors, on the 
<br/>registration of all the actors and volunteers. This is very, very critical because a lot of times, after a 
<br/>disaster, there is a lot of funding around.  And then all of a sudden, there is a group that comes in 
<br/>saying, “We have been in the Western Division for all these while”, and we do not know where they 
<br/>come from.  It is usually the Fiji Council of Social Services (FCOSS), but then even some do not 
<br/></span><span>come under the umbrella of FCOSS, particularly the Human Rights.  This is why we need to have 
<br/></span><span>this register, Sir.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2195 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly too, Sir, on the international assistance, we have found out that with all due 
<br/>respect  to  the  good  work  that  they  do  and  this  is  why  we  need  to  rest  and  thank  you  for  the  de-
<br/>registration  because sometimes when they come for containers, they come up with a list of what is 
<br/>coming in the container, but there is a different thing altogether in the container.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we go now to Walu Bay, there is a Nissan patrol vehicle (SUV).   It is rusting there at Walu 
<br/>Bay.    That  came  in  a  container  -  outboard  motor  engines,  brush  cutters,  computers  -  almost 
<br/>everything, but it was for other purposes. That is why organisations need to be registered and, of 
<br/>course, volunteers as well.  So, this is very positive in the Bill.  Probably some organisations will not 
<br/>agree,  but  I  think  in  terms  of  transparency,  accountability  and  interoperability,  we  need  to  put  it 
<br/>together, particularly when we are answerable as well to those that do provide us with assistance and 
<br/>donations when it comes to our responses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am happy to note as well, Sir, the provisions of the Bill in Part 3, that brings clarity to the 
<br/>roles of the different levels of administration, from Minister to National Disaster Controller, and to 
<br/>the Divisional and Provisional Administration, and to the communities, and recognises the critical 
<br/>role that Divisional officers and community members play in disasters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  establishment  of  Disaster  Management  Offices  to  support  divisional  operations  is  a 
<br/></span><span>positive  development.    And  I  have  noted  in  the  Bill,  Sir,  municipal  councils  are  now  included.  
<br/>Previously,  it  is  only  national  government  and  right  to  the  community,  but  municipal  councils, 
<br/>particularly  for those who are living  within the town boundaries have an obligation because they 
<br/>collect rates from the ratepayers and they, unfortunately, do not have any emergency response plan 
<br/>at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go to Wellington, they have an emergency response plan.  If you go to Auckland, they 
<br/>have an emergency response plan.  Here in Fiji, perhaps, honourable Ministers, this is something that 
<br/>we also need, but the municipal council has to be within that.  Both, in the Sendai Framework and 
<br/>the Paris Agreement, I will talk about the role of the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation and 
<br/>the Chamber of Commerce as well later on in the Bill because in the towns and cities, this is where 
<br/>majority of the people live and, particularly, in terms of the economy.  This is where our DRR also 
<br/>needs to focus because resilient cities is a top priority under  both, the Sendai Framework and the 
<br/>Paris Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is why the role of the municipal council is so important and I am glad that they are now 
<br/>part of that.  From my first experience in Labasa when there is flood, I asked, “Where is the Lord 
<br/></span><span>Mayor?”  They said, “He does not come to the meeting.” I asked, why?  They said, “No, he is not 
<br/></span><span>part of the it.”  That should change.   We know what Lautoka and Nadi went through in </span><span>TC Evans 
<br/></span><span>and that is why we need their participation.  Of course, a lot of people use your civic facilities and 
<br/>your town halls for evacuation purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill establishes a single window for the facilitation team, which will 
<br/>coordinate and expedite the legal requirements.  The only thing that I noted, honourable Minister, it 
<br/>does not matter, it is now headed by the team from Trade, but usually it is Foreign Affairs and, of 
<br/>course, Procurement Office as well in there, but can be easily coordinated regardless of who is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we need that focal point as well because national coordinator and the rest will be 
<br/>so busy with all other things.  If we delegate these responsibilities with clear demarcation, it will 
<br/>really help a lot but because a lot of assistances are coming in, we need to have the single window 
<br/>facilitation, and I have talked about how we monitor as well.   I have talked about the experience 
<br/></span><span>with containers and so many other things because in the end, we will always be accountable.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Sir,  past  experiences  called  for  some  alignment  in  the  work  of  Government, 
<br/>international  partners  and donors in  the disaster  management  efforts. This  is  addressed through  a 
<br/>system  established  under  Part  12  of  the  Bill,  which  is  extremely  necessary  to  ensure  better 
<br/>coordination in the disaster management, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister has talked about international response.  When we have the systems 
<br/>in place, if the ADF comes in, in the planning group, in whatever, everything will gel, Sir.  This is 
<br/>why we need this coordination, and I am thankful that that is in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a few observations, honourable Minister, that I wish to raise. On the title of the Bill, I am 
<br/>still  concerned  about  ‘National  Disaster  Risk  Management’.    It  might  take  the  focus  on  risk 
<br/>management rather than just the National Disaster Management Act, because risk management is 
<br/>part of the disaster management cycle.  So, I just want to make that contribution.  Although I have 
<br/>noted in Part 6 of the Bill that it focuses on national disaster reduction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I wish to raise, honourable Minister, is whilst the Bill has adopted a multi-
<br/>hazard approach to national disaster management, I am of the view that for purposes of clarity, the 
<br/>role of other agencies responsible for hazards that is put under Schedule 8 and Schedule 9, must be 
<br/></span><span>made clear, and should the hazards in their areas of control advance, to become national disasters.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to raise on Schedule 3, if you can consider including the Chamber of Commerce 
<br/>in Suva.  The Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation already have their own team, and they have 
<br/>been part of our council, we have been inviting them in previous years. I have talked about the role 
<br/>that they play in disasters because they will help us a lot.  When we gave containers to Tonga for the 
<br/>response, most of the containers were provided by them because they were part of the team already. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The donations that came were mostly from them, sponsorship, et cetera, and even releasing 
<br/>their employees to come and help us. That is why the Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation is 
<br/>so important to the team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Schedule 4 on Divisional, perhaps, if respective Town Council Chamber of Commerce can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be part of that Divisional Team. That is an observation, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been some mention too about the Climate Change Adaptation Bill.  I think when 
<br/>we had the Meteorological and Hydrological Services Bill 2024 that was passed here a few months 
<br/>ago, I did mention about these overlaps because climate change is also related to disasters, as well as 
<br/></span><span>with the Environmental Management Act.  What is important, and the Agency should know this that, 
<br/></span><span>once an activity or an event becomes a hazard (hazard is defined in the Act), then it falls into the 
<br/>responsibility of the Disaster Management area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I also say here, Sir, in terms of the multi-hazard approach, I have also mentioned this 
<br/>previously, after COVID that was another experience, probably then we will have to get in all the 
<br/>other  emergency  frameworks  because  the  Environmental  Management  Act  comes  under  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we had a spill from a broken sewage pipe in Nabua a few years back.  There was a big 
<br/>chaos because they have never been activated to respond.  So, everything has to be handled again. 
<br/>That was why we need to probably bring in the emergency responses together later on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  note  that  the  Bill  formalises  the  establishment  of  the  cluster  system.  Honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister, the cluster system in Part II, Division 5, only states that we are going to establish the cluster 
<br/></span><span>system. I am suggesting if cluster systems already established after </span><span>TC Evans</span><span> in 2012 can be put in.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2197 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We already have nine cluster systems in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is saying, “I do not know which cluster system is that”, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but I am going to tell you the disaster cluster, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Safety and Protection Cluster;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>WASH Cluster (which is on water, sanitation and hygiene);  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Logistics Cluster; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Shelter Cluster; 
<br/>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Infrastructure Cluster; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Communications Cluster; 
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Health and Nutrition Cluster; 
<br/>(8)</span><span> </span><span>Education Cluster; and  
<br/>(9)</span><span> </span><span>Food Security and Livelihood Cluster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clusters are run together by both, government and non-government agencies. So, in terms of 
<br/>ownership because it will also bring commitment, it would be good to include the clusters in there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Sir, I think just a small one – minor, but I think it important as well. There appears to 
<br/></span><span>be some confusion in the terminology. People are used to our set up that was put by our colonial 
<br/>masters.  When you talk ‘sub-national’, people are used to ‘division’ and whatever because most of 
<br/>the boundaries that we have too in the country that the Bureau of Statistics work on is still based on 
<br/>this. You would know this, Sir, as a Valuer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those observations, I, again, thank the honourable Minister and his team for the efforts. 
<br/>I wish you well in the application of the Bill and, of course, there will be opportunities for us too and 
<br/>we will always offer our assistance and help to contribute and, of course, the cyclone is coming up, 
<br/>Sir, and let us prepare well to minimise the damages and the costs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of the Bill and I wish to congratulate 
<br/>the honourable Minister for such a time as this that this Bill has been really overdue. I want to just 
<br/>shift our focus to the human faces that need to deal with disasters and how this law that is before us 
<br/>is gender and vulnerable groups responsive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, we face unique challenges in Fiji and because of this legislation, it does need to address 
<br/>the  unique  challenges  that  our  vulnerable  groups  face.    Mr.  Speaker,  this  is  in  line  with  our 
<br/></span><span>commitment in our National Development Plan, in strengthening the policy and legal framework for 
<br/></span><span>gender equality and social inclusion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Act  has  explicitly  incorporated  inclusiveness  provisions  which  concerns 
<br/>vulnerable  groups  -  our  women,  our  children,  our  people  living  with  disabilities  and  our  older 
<br/>persons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in reviewing this Bill, the following are just some provisions that I would like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to highlight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, in Clause 9 of the Bill - Powers of Chairperson of the Council, Subclause 
<br/>(b) has specifically mentioned ‘he’ or ‘she’, whereas in the previous Act, it just mentions ‘he’. So, 
<br/>obviously, Mr. Speaker, this is being gender responsive and inclusive, and we thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  considering  this,  the  Standing  Committee,  as  well  as  the  consultations  that  were 
<br/></span><span>undertaken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="78">Page 78</a></div>
<div><span>2198 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, as the Chair for the Safety and Protection Cluster, our Ministry is the 
<br/>Chair, I would like to acknowledge the establishment of the Fiji Cluster System in the Bill. It plays 
<br/>a crucial role in coordinating disaster response efforts across various sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, by incorporating gender responsive and vulnerable group strategies within the 
<br/>cluster system, we are ensuring that there is better preparedness for response and recovery for our 
<br/>vulnerable groups. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specifically, under Clause 66(2)(a) to (i), it has recognised the need for our evacuation centres 
<br/>to be retrofitted for the ease of access to our vulnerable groups.  I thank the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition  for  raising  the  very  important  issue  of  our  evacuation  centres  in  our  towns  and  cities 
<br/>where, Mr. Speaker, if do look at our informal settlements, especially with the number of people who 
<br/>live in informal settlements and the sizes of the halls, I do not think they will cater for such a big 
<br/>number as an evacuation centre. So, as we prepare to cope for our vulnerable groups especially, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, this needs to be looked at. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  also,  in  reference  to  Part  7  -  Disaster  Risk  Management  Plans,  it 
<br/>specifically  recognises  the  representation  of  vulnerable  groups  to  be  part  of  the  consultations  in 
<br/></span><span>formulating the National Disaster Risk Management Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it is also important in upholding an evidence-based approach and intervention 
<br/>with  relevant  data,  Part  8  of  the  Bill  under  Clause  82  has  provisions  in  upholding  data  which  is 
<br/>inclusive of vulnerable groups during a disaster.  It includes requirements to collect, analyse, monitor 
<br/>and publish such data, to ensure that the response is inclusive and targeted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Probably, just a point of validation, Mr. Speaker, under Clause 99(b), it mentions the </span><span>Turaga</span><span>
<br/></span><span>ni Koro</span><span> from the 14 Provinces, but there are also </span><span>Marama ni Koro</span><span> in the Provinces. I am sure this 
<br/>will  be  validated  by  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  in  recognition  of  women's  leadership  and 
<br/>decision-making in our village settings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the membership in the DRR Committee is impressive, compared to the 1998 
<br/>Act. It ensures that gender is mainstreamed when it comes to disaster risk management, mainly, the 
<br/>Director responsible for women is included in the Committee, Mr. Speaker, and we acknowledge 
<br/>that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, under Schedule 7 (Section 50), it has provided for having representatives of women, 
<br/></span><span>youth and vulnerable groups.  Also, in Schedule 4 (Section 47), there is specific mention also on 
<br/></span><span>representatives of vulnerable groups in the Municipal Disaster Risk Management Committees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, women, children and marginalised groups often bear the brunt of natural 
<br/>disasters. They are usually the most disproportionately affected, facing greater risks and challenges.  
<br/>But I do wish to, again, congratulate the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management, and his Ministry Team, as well as to thank the Chairman of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights and honourable Members of the Committee, and the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Solicitor-General,  for  their  hard  work  in  bringing  this  Bill  to  the  House.  The  main 
<br/>objective is  to  ensure that  our vulnerable groups are supported and assisted in  times of risks  and 
<br/>disaster, and to ensure that no one is left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>explaining the Bill in detail and the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable Minister 
<br/></span><span>for Women, Children and Social Protection.  I think this is a very important Bill, in that, it establishes 
<br/></span><span>a framework to guide the preparedness and response to disaster risks, including health emergencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2199 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  this  Bill  is  timely  because  more  and  more,  Fiji  is  becoming 
<br/>vulnerable to the speed, the frequency and the intensity of natural disasters and which, as we saw, 
<br/>has proven catastrophic in terms of livelihoods, damage to infrastructure, impact on public finances, 
<br/>the economy in general and the overall socio-economic landscape.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, actually provides a framework to respond effectively to issues, 
<br/>such as immediate humanitarian support rehabilitation, the construction works and income support 
<br/>to those who get affected in a big way. The honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable 
<br/>Minister both pointed out that the Bill actually establishes an institutional and legislative framework 
<br/>to deal with the number of things that are required and are done during a disaster to make it more 
<br/>effective.  It  ensures  that  there  is  a  proper  decision-making  structure  that  is  transparent  and 
<br/>accountable,  and  clearly  lays  out  the  powers  and  responsibilities  of  respective  committees  and 
<br/>agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is similar to other legislative reforms that we had undertaken, and 
<br/>the proposed National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 was also part of the policy reform actions 
<br/>for  our  Joint  Budget  Support,  like  the  Bill  presented  today  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  and 
<br/>Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  want  to  thank  all  our  partners,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  particularly,  the  World  Bank,  Asian 
<br/>Development Bank, Australia and New Zealand and European Union, because we have received a 
<br/>lot of support towards the Bill too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Finance’s  initiatives  in  support  of  Disaster  Risk  Response  is  in  line  with 
<br/>international best practice and the anticipation of some of the key provisions of the Bill. The Ministry 
<br/>of Finance has already undertaken several new initiatives to support Disaster Risk Preparedness and 
<br/>Response.  And let me very quickly just talk about the recently negotiated $75 million Disaster Fund 
<br/>Facility with JICA.  This will help us with quick disbursement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the finance has 
<br/>already been negotiated and approved, prior to the disaster and will be disbursed upon request from 
<br/>Government, once a State disaster is declared by Cabinet. Apart from the quick disbursement, this is 
<br/>also a very highly concessional financing facility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, apart from the JICA Standby Facility, Fiji has also taken up what we call 
<br/>Catastrophe  Deferred  Drawdown  Option  (CatDDO).    These  are  part  of  the  two  World  Bank’s 
<br/>financing loan operations.  In simple terms, what that means is that in the event of a disaster and a 
<br/>Declaration of State of Natural Disaster by Cabinet, Government will have access to about US40 
<br/></span><span>million in immediate financing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from this, Government has also bought its first signed-off, of what we call, parametric 
<br/>insurance from Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance Company (PCRIC) and, again, the sum insured, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, was around $27 million at a premium cost of about $2.5 million.  So, this premium 
<br/>of $2.5 million will get us $27 million, if there is a natural disaster because the insurance will kick 
<br/>in.  So, we are also looking at future development partners, to ensure that, that is also increased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also setting aside a contingency budget for disaster which is directed to the Disaster 
<br/>Trust  Fund  with  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO).    Apart  from  that,  there  are 
<br/>discussions with ADB on other infrastructure related to disasters, like bridges, and the Nadi River 
<br/>Project  is  the  largest  Climate  Adaptation  Project  to  reduce  flood  in  that  area.    As  I  have  said  in 
<br/>Parliament the other day, we have received the Technical Report and we are on target to actually 
<br/>progress the project by next year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have another two minutes, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  On the Bill itself, the financial arrangement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>2200 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>aspect of the Fund is clearly provisioned in Part 4 of the Bill, which is also a very good innovation.  
<br/>So, Clause 52, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allows the Permanent Secretary to, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…ensure  that  an  allocation  is  provided  within  the  Ministry’s  annual  budgetary 
<br/>estimates to finance disaster risk management, including – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(f)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disaster risk reduction, preparedness, prevention and disaster mitigation; 
<br/>emergency response; 
<br/>rehabilitation long-term recovery; 
<br/>related activities; 
<br/>running costs of NDRMO; and 
<br/>running  costs  of  disaster  risk  management  councils,  committees  and  technical 
<br/>working groups established under this Act.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  those  provisions  in  the  Bill  will  also  allow  us  to  ensure  that  the  finance  is  available,  and  the 
<br/>management of finance is provided very clearly in the Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last one that I wanted to make, Mr. Speaker Sir, is that in the establishment of the fund 
<br/></span><span>under the Act, the annual report on the activities and expenditure of the fund, including financial 
<br/></span><span>statements, will be reported to Cabinet and to Parliament thereafter.  So, the Bill from the financial 
<br/>point of view, Sir, is quiet an innovation.  It will ensure better transparency and accountability during 
<br/>times of disaster, and what we are also ensuring is that the funding is available so that we are not 
<br/>scrambling for funding when we are hit by a major disaster.  So, apart from the budgetary allocation, 
<br/>we are also having this provision as a standby loan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Usamate, Mr. Speaker, is not here, otherwise, I would have told him that we are 
<br/>also dealing with disasters from 2006 to 2022 on a number of fronts as well.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill before us,  and 
<br/>I  thank  the  honourable  Minister,  especially  his  officers,  and  the  NDMO  Office  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>formulation of this Bill, the wide consultations done and the input in terms of the formulation of the 
<br/>Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  would  like  to  mention  that  within  the  Bill,  the  term  ‘coordination’,  as  in  the 
<br/>“coordination  of  multiple  hazard  approach  and  multiple  hazard  early  warning  and  early  action 
<br/></span><span>systems  at  the  national,  sub-national  levels,  et  cetera”,  is  mentioned  36  times,  approximately  36 
<br/></span><span>times.    Of  course,  in  the  Schedules,  you  will  note  that  the  Director  Meteorological  Services  is  a 
<br/>member in nearly all the Committees and that phrase is mentioned at the various levels in terms of 
<br/>the  administration  of  the  Act  from  the  National  Management  Council,  Disaster  Risk  Reduction 
<br/>Committee,  Emergency  Committee,  National  Controller  and  Coordinator,  right  up  to  the  Sub-
<br/>National Administration and Functions of the Divisional Disaster Risk Management Office. So, it 
<br/>emphasises the role of coordination function, as I have already mentioned, of multi-hazard approach 
<br/>and multi-hazard early warning early action, which is the role of the Fiji Meteorological Services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you recall, we had formulated and passed the Meteorological and Hydrological Act 2024 
<br/>in  this  Parliament, which provided  a legal framework which enhances the role of Meteorological 
<br/>Services and which is also a key critical part in terms of National Disaster Risk Management, which 
<br/>is why it is a key role in the Act.  Some of the functions in terms of the Fiji Meteorological Services 
<br/>is  to  establish,  maintain,  upgrade  and  overlook  the  renewable  networks  for  meteorological  and 
<br/></span><span>hydrological observation and collection of meteorological and hydrological data. Again, which is 
<br/></span><span>critical in terms of the functioning of this Committee.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2201 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, forecasting weather oceans conditions and the state of the atmosphere and routine 
<br/>issue of public weather forecasts.  Issue impact-based forecasts that contributes to Fiji's multi-hazard 
<br/>early  warning  systems  and  contribute  to  the  safety,  regulatory  and  efficiency  of  air  navigation 
<br/>between the Nadi Flight Information Region and selected airdromes in the Southwest Pacific Region, 
<br/>as Fiji is the regional specialised meteorological centre. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the functions of the Meteorological Services in collaboration with the National 
<br/>Disaster  Management  infrastructure  and  offices,  some  of  the  areas  where  there  has  been  close 
<br/>collaboration include the recently installed community-based flood early warning systems and flood 
<br/>gauges in the Central Division through the current funding of the Government of Korea and New 
<br/>Zealand.  Also, contribution to the development of Fiji's Early Warning for All (EW4ALL) Concept 
<br/>Note to the Green Climate Fund, strengthening of our collective response to disaster by enabling Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological Service staff in attending District, Divisional and Tikina Council Meetings to create 
<br/>awareness on weather hazards and the importance of disaster preparedness for early action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  the  Fiji  Meteorological  Services,  the  Ministry  is  currently  working  with  the 
<br/>Government of Japan on the construction of a state-of-the-art Meteorological and Disaster Awareness 
<br/>Regional  Centre  for  the  Pacific,  which  also  houses  the  Regional  Training  Centre  and  Regional 
<br/></span><span>Instrument  Centre.  As  we  are  about  to  enter  into  another  tropical  cyclone  season,  the  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Meteorological  Service  is  currently  retraining  and  upskilling  operational  officers  to  improve  its 
<br/>operational  performance  with  regards  to  the  severe  weather  which  will  be  coming  our  way.  
<br/>Upskilling  of  staff  involves  seconding  guest  lecturers  and  training  from  various  Meteorological 
<br/>Centres  of  the  World  to  work  with  the  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  and  immediate  support 
<br/>personnel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  state  at  this  point  that  we  have  an  issue  with  high  staff  turnover,  so  it  is  quite  a 
<br/>challenge at this moment, and it is something that we will need to continually address as we move 
<br/>forward.  Unfortunately, most are moving to regional organisations. There might be a need to relook 
<br/>at that, maybe to have a MOU with regional organisations so that they are given leave, but they can 
<br/>still come back to our national organisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Bill before us will enable the Meteorological Office to work closely with the National 
<br/>Disaster  Management  Office,  in  addressing  the  needs  which  will  evolve  in  changing  weather 
<br/>conditions, which supports the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the adverse 
<br/>effects of climate change by providing a legal framework to protect our communities. Sir, I support 
<br/>the motion on the National Disaster Risk Management Bill 2024. </span><span>Vinaka!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vina’a valevu!</span><span> I now call upon the Minister to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have much to say but I just want to, first of 
<br/>all, thank everyone involved in the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/>Rights, the honourable Members of the Committee, and all the hard work that you have done, staff 
<br/>of the Office of the Solicitor-General and all members of this august House who have participated in 
<br/>the consultations, as well as members of the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  thank  our  team  at  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management, and I specifically mention the outgoing Director for Disaster Management, Ms. Vasiti 
<br/>Soko, who, at the moment, we are preparing to farewell her once we return to our office.   At the 
<br/>moment, they are all watching on TV with bated breath to see how things pens out. But we thank 
<br/>everyone involved, all our international partners, and we thank you for all the commitment that has 
<br/></span><span>been shown. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>.
