<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the Chairperson of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on  Natural  Resources,  I  hereby  present  the  Committee’s  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Waterways 2017-2018 Annual Report.  The Committee has undertaken its scrutiny of the Ministry’s 
<br/>Annual Report for the period under review and noted the Ministry’s achievements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reporting period was transformative and a challenging one for the Ministry. The existence 
<br/>of  outdated  or  backdated  reports  reflects  the  challenges  posed  by  staff  turnover  and  the  need  for 
<br/>accurate record-keeping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  the  lack  of  direction  for  the  Ministry  in  its  engagement  with  the 
<br/>Divisions in terms of its programmes and projects. The Ministry of Waterways encountered several 
<br/>significant  challenges  that  impacted  its  operations  and  programme  deliveries.  Addressing  these 
<br/>challenges  required  sound  executive  directives,  innovative  solutions,  robust  planning  and 
<br/>collaborative efforts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the above, the Committee noted that there was a lack of collaboration with other 
<br/></span><span>Government Ministries and other relevant partners. Working in isolation affected their programme 
<br/>delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Committee noted the Ministry’s inability to utilise the budgeted funds which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>considerably affected the work carried out during the year 2017-2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  a  significant  number  of  unfilled  positions  within  the  Ministry  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identified inconsistencies in the reporting of staff numbers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my appreciation to the executives and staff of the Ministry of Waterways for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their effort and dedication.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members who were involved 
<br/></span><span>in  the  production  of  this  bipartisan  Report,  namely,  honourable  T.R.  Matasawalevu  (Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Chairperson), honourable I. Tuiwailevu, honourable K.V. Ravu and honourable S. Nand.

<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby 
<br/>move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A motion, without notice, that a debate on the content of this Report is initiated at a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- I second the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report -  
<br/>Accident Compensation Commission Fiji 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased  to  submit  to  Parliament  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Accident  Compensation 
<br/>Commission Fiji 2019, 2020 and 2021 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Accident  Compensation  Commission  Fiji  (ACCF)  was  established  by  the  Fijian 
<br/>Government  through  the  introduction  of  the  Accident  Compensation  Act  2017,  to  pay  no-fault 
<br/>compensation to Fijians who suffer personal injury or death as a result of an accident in Fiji as of 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>January, 2018.  From 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2019, the ACCF has been providing compensation for injuries and 
<br/>deaths  as a result of accidents  arising  in  the course of employment as well as in  school premises 
<br/>during working hours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Act  provides  for  a  scheme  through  which  victims  of  accidents  can  be  compensated 
<br/>without having to prove fault or negligence, subject to meeting the Act’s requirements. Coverage of 
<br/>the no-fault scheme is broader than the previous law, as it extends beyond third parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that ACCF collaborates well with key organisations, like the Ministry 
<br/>of  Health  and  Medical  Services,  Ministry  of  Employment,  Land  Transport  Authority,  Fiji  Police 
<br/></span><span>Force and Legal Aid Commission, to deliver their services effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Committee noted that there are two sources of funding - the Motor Vehicle 
<br/>Accident Levy and 40 percent of the 1 percent  Fiji National University (FNU) Levy.  Both these 
<br/>levies are deposited in the Accident Compensation Fund Account and are used solely for the purpose 
<br/>of paying compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2017.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Board informed the Committee that the Act excludes the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>driving under the influence of liquor;  
<br/></span><span>failing or refusing to permit a breath test or a specimen of blood to be taken;  
<br/>not holding a valid driving license and failure to comply with all the conditions of the 
<br/>driving licence;   
<br/>any injury or death that did not directly arise from the accident;  
<br/>being convicted for any act or omission that directly caused accidents; and 
<br/>personal injury or death as a result of an accident arising out of/and in the course of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank our Committee Members who were part of the team that produced this

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs,  I  commend  the  Consolidated

<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  motion,  without notice, that a debate on the content of the Report is  initiated at  a

<div><span>Motion agreed.

<div><span>Review Report - Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs submits 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament the Review Report on the Sugar Cane Growers Fund 2021 Annual Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Sugar Cane Growers Fund (SCGF) is a lending institution established under the Sugar 
<br/>Cane Growers Fund Act 1984 (Act No. 9/1984), enacted by the Parliament of Fiji on 26</span><span>th</span><span> July, 1984. 
<br/>Its core business is to provide loans to registered sugarcane growers.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, SCGF also 
<br/>has a subsidiary company, namely South Pacific Fertilizers Limited which is primarily engaged in 
<br/>the sale and distribution of fertilizer and weedicides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SCGF aims to build sustainable value for stakeholders and for the sugarcane farmers and other 
<br/>industry players.  </span><span>The principal activity of the Fund as outlined under  section 4 of the Sugar Cane 
<br/>Growers Fund Act 1984 is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide loans to sugarcane growers to increase the production of sugarcane; 
<br/>improve efficiency in the planting, growing and transportation of sugarcane; and  
<br/>rehabilitation of farms, farm buildings and other installations that were damaged, destroyed 
<br/></span><span>or affected by floods or other natural disasters. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Personal Explanation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware of the various challenges that SCGF has been facing which 
<br/>include the need to review the </span><span>Sugar Cane Growers Fund</span><span> Act, the need to diversify sugar production 
<br/>to agriculture and non-agriculture, lack of subsidiary diversification, Government dependency and 
<br/>loan defaults. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that the Annual Reports presented by the SCGF lacked essential Key 
<br/>Performance Indicators (KPIs). Sir, SCGF did not have any set targets during the period under review 
<br/>which could have enabled the Committee to make more informed recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted some of the challenges faced by SCGF under the review period which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Uncertainty of lease renewal, ageing farmers, rising prices of fertilizers, damage to farm 
<br/>infrastructure due to flooding and rural to urban drift. 
<br/>The Russia-Ukraine war has had a significant impact on the availability and prices of 
<br/>raw materials, particularly fertilizers. 
<br/>At  the  same  time,  </span><span>TC  Yasa</span><span>  and  </span><span>TC  Ana</span><span>  caused  devastating  impacts  to  the  farming 
<br/>community, especially in the Northern Division, causing massive structural damages to 
<br/>crops,  dwellings  and  roads,  Seaqaqa  and  Labasa  districts  being  the  worst  impacted. 
<br/>Therefore, </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> loan was developed to provide instant relief to affected cane farmers 
<br/>through priority and specialised loan assistance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  would  wish  to  extend  our  appreciation  to  all  the  stakeholders  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>valuable input.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report  -  the  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  S.  Kiran;  honourable  P.D.  Kumar, 
<br/>honourable T.N. Tunabuna, and honourable A. Bia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  behalf  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs,  I  commend  the  Sugar  Cane 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Growers Fund 2021 Review Report to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
