<div><span> Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the Ministers may speak for up to 20 minutes and after the Minister, I 
<br/>will then invite the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more 
<br/>than five minutes.  There will also be a response from the Leader of G-9 Bloc, or his designate, to 
<br/>also speak for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the only thing I was trying to seek your indulgence on is, please, when 
<br/>it is five minutes, the light goes on and that is where it ends.  Some go beyond for another one or two 
<br/>minutes. The  Secretariat is  trying to  get  you to understand that  because  when you go abroad and 
<br/>participate in international meetings, it is this similar kind of House rules that we adhere to. When 
<br/>you are given five minutes, it is five minutes. Try and teach yourself on how best you can speak by 
<br/>sticking to the time.  If it is three minutes, it is three minutes, if it is 10 minutes, then it is 10 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, I was asked by some of the honourable Government Members that the 10 minutes 
<br/>is too long, we should cut it down to five minutes. But I said, “No, we have heard a lot from the 
<br/>honourable Members on the Opposition side and the Government side, that the time to speak is being 
<br/>clipped off all the time. Every now and again, it is 10 minutes, now it is five.”  You would like to 
<br/>speak for long, but if you start repeating yourself, then that long speech becomes just a sounding 
<br/>board. That is all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  now  call  on  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development and Statistics to deliver his Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.–  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  2023-2024  National  Budget,  the 
<br/>Coalition Government announced the formulation of a new National Development Plan (NDP). The 
<br/>preparatory  works  on  the  NDP  began  in  November  2023  with  consultations  amongst  respective 
<br/>Ministries and Government agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 16th January, 2024, Cabinet approved the Framework and approach for the formulation 
<br/>of the new NDP.  Following a very consultative and inclusive process, the National Development 
<br/>Plan  2025–2029  and  Vision  2050  was  prepared  and  launched  on  17th  September,  2024  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade  and  Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is an outcome 
<br/></span><span>of an inclusive and participatory approach. It was developed through inputs and feedback received 
<br/></span><span>from meetings of 11 thematic working groups based on key themes in relation to the economy and 
<br/>our people, a nationwide public consultation, consultation with civil society organisations, political 
<br/>parties and faith-based organisations, as well as written submissions received from the general public.  
<br/>Recommendations from the 2023 National Economic Summit, Fiscal Review Committee Report and 
<br/>the National Education Summit also provided valuable inputs into the formulation of the NDP.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP was prepared under the overall guidance of the Strategic Planning 
<br/>Office of the Ministry of Finance, and I take this opportunity to thank each and every one for their 
<br/>contributions to this major national document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is founded on 
<br/>the vision of  “Empowering the People of Fiji through Unity”. The honourable Prime Minister has 
<br/>talked about this since we came into Government. To lay the groundwork for achieving the vision, 
<br/></span><span>the  NDP  contains  policies  and  strategies  across  three  pillars  -  Economic  Resilience,  People 
<br/></span><span>Empowerment and Good Governance. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The goal of the NDP is to bring greater prosperity to the nation, reduce poverty and improve 
<br/>the social and economic wellbeing of our people. Our people will be at the centre of development 
<br/>and the NDP, therefore, is a plan for the people. The NDP is also aligned with our global and regional 
<br/>commitments  such  as  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs),  the  United 
<br/>Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 2050 Strategy for the Blue 
<br/>Pacific Continent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP puts in focus a new plan that has been translated into goals, policies 
<br/>and strategies with a clear set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each identified sector. The 
<br/>five-year plan and the long term 25-year vision sits on the three broad pillars.  The overall focus of 
<br/>the new plan is on – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>building microeconomic confidence; 
<br/>sustainable management of natural resources;  
<br/>categorising economic growth and diversifying the economy;  
<br/>uplifting the socio-economic wellbeing of our people, including our indigenous people;  
<br/>developing public infrastructure;  
<br/>protection of the environment; and  
<br/>a commitment to good governance and institutional reforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDP also presents Fiji’s vision 2050 which offers an opportunity to 
<br/>charge our own destiny, to determine what we want as a nation, how we see ourselves and where we 
<br/>want to be in 25 years - a prosperous, inclusive and sustainable nation.  The vision outlines the long-
<br/>term development goals based on the aspirations of the people and will guide the short and medium 
<br/>term plans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji and our people aspire to be a high-income country by 2050, bringing a 
<br/>better  quality  of  life  for  all.    Achieving  this  vision  will  require  ambitious  reforms  and  tackling 
<br/>longstanding issues that have held us back from economic and social progress.  A business-as-usual 
<br/>approach will not achieve this vision.  Some of the key issues the NDP  identifies that we need to 
<br/>address include labour productivity, infrastructure deficit in transportation and health sectors, female 
<br/>and youth labour force participation rate, investor and business confidence, ongoing skills mismatch 
<br/>and political stability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  call  for  commitment  to  prudent  and  effective  planning  in  the 
<br/>implementation of the NDP in achieving the KPIs identified in the plan.  There is a need to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that  this  Plan  is  based  on  availability  of  resources  (aligning  resources  with  revenue  forecasts  to 
<br/></span><span>maintain  financial  stability)  and  guarding  against  the  pitfall  of  over-ambitious  projections  and 
<br/>underfunded priorities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is focusing on developing a detailed implementation plan with 
<br/>clear  resource  allocations.  We  urge  all  for  effective  coordination  and  collaboration  between 
<br/>Government and development partners to maximise resource allocation and utilisation. We believe 
<br/>that the silo approach towards service delivery has persisted and limited the intended purpose of the 
<br/>programme approach to planning and implementation in the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process of implementation is anchored on a result-oriented, transparent 
<br/>and accountable Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation  (IME) mechanism.  Monitoring  will 
<br/>involve  regular  gathering  of  data  to  assess  progress  towards  the  desired  outputs  and  outcomes, 
<br/>reporting  of  the  progress  based  on  set  timelines,  and  timely  intervention  to  undertake  corrective 
<br/></span><span>measures, where necessary.  Therefore, Sir, Chapter 9 of the NDP lays out the IME Framework and 
<br/></span><span>processes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  State  capacity and coordination are also  crucial in  ensuring an  effective 
<br/>implementation and achieving the outcomes of the NDP.  The Government is committed to building 
<br/>and expanding capacity in the Civil Service towards policy planning and execution for the effective 
<br/>implementation and achieving of NDP outcomes.  The annual National Budgets, Sir, will be based 
<br/>on the development priorities set out in the NDP and will provide the financial resources to support 
<br/>the implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am happy to note that a number of strategies outlined in the NDP have already been factored 
<br/>in the 2024-2025 National Budget.  For example, an allocation of $5.75million has been provided 
<br/>for in the 2024-2025 budget for Groundwater Assistance Programme, which will increase access to 
<br/>safe  and  affordable  drinking  water  in  large  and  smaller  islands.  I  am  very  pleased  to  inform 
<br/>Parliament that the Taskforce, led by the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, is 
<br/>working very diligently because we want to ensure that we are able to deliver, as much as possible, 
<br/>for our rural people and those in the maritime islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government greatly appreciates inputs received from members of the 
<br/>public who attended the public consultations held around the country.  They did it freely without fear 
<br/>and provided excellent inputs, not only on the short-term basic things, but also in the medium and 
<br/></span><span>long-term on what the country ought to do.  Technical support from the World Bank is greatly and 
<br/></span><span>rightfully acknowledged with special recognition to the team that is based here in Fiji and covering 
<br/>Fiji.  Special  thanks  are  extended  to  Permanent  Secretaries  and  senior  leadership  of  the  Fiji 
<br/>Government Civil Service for the partnership and guidance in preparing the NDP.  I want to,  Sir, 
<br/>once  again  reiterate  and  thank  all  the  Permanent  Secretaries.    I  think  they  played  a  significant, 
<br/>important and critical role in the formulation of the NDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we have now  commenced on  a transformative national  journey.    In this 
<br/>journey, the National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050 is going to be a guiding light.  
<br/>We are on the shared journey together.  We will remain united and progress together to rebuild this 
<br/>country and realise its potential for all our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to take this opportunity, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister, to thank all the 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  this  Parliament  for  their  contribution;  my  colleagues  on  this  side,  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers, towards the formulation of the Plan and I also 
<br/>want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition and all the Opposition Members who attended 
<br/>the launch of the NDP last month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I want  to  emphasise this  because the attendance from  both  sides of the 
<br/></span><span>House  at  such  an  important  national  event  actually  sent  a  very,  very  strong  signal  on  the 
<br/>bipartisanship that we are building in this House.  I can tell you, Sir, that with confidence, it has 
<br/>contributed  to  building  confidence  amongst  our  people,  the  private  sector  and  the  development 
<br/>partners, in particular.  It helps bring the nation together, which is critical to our development and 
<br/>prosperity, which is exactly what the vision of the  Plan, “Empowering the People of Fiji through 
<br/>Unity” says.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have clearly seen the impact of the bipartisanship and the overwhelming 
<br/>support, including that from the Opposition, towards our recent 2024-2025 Budget on the economy, 
<br/>and we are very pleased with that support.  With the strong support for the  Budget and the major 
<br/>policy measures, including the pay rise for civil servants, increase in the national minimum wage, 
<br/>Government capital projects and the slightly higher fiscal deficit, had boosted confidence and helped 
<br/>raise economic activity.  It has clearly reversed the economic slowdown that we had noted in the 
<br/></span><span>months just prior to the Budget, which actually led us to revise the growth forecast from 3 percent to 
<br/></span><span>2.8 percent in the Budget.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, since then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>have  been  closely  monitoring  the  economic  developments,  and  we  have  noted  with  a  lot  of 
<br/>satisfaction some significant positive developments thereafter.  All major indicators for aggregate 
<br/>demand,  including  private  sector  lending,  VAT  collections  (adjusted  for  the  impact  of  the  rate 
<br/>changes)  which  is  a  key  indicator  for  domestic  spending),  20  percent  increase  in  Government 
<br/>expenditure  in  the  last  seven  months,  pick  up  in  import  of  investment  goods,  higher  electricity 
<br/>consumption, increased vehicle sales, and improvement in income indicators like PAYE collections 
<br/>and remittances, have all seen a significant pickup. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the same time, our tourism industry, as has already been outlined by the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation, has continued to do 
<br/>even better than our earlier expectations, and over and above the record levels of last year.  While we 
<br/>were forecasting initially a growth of around 3 percent in visitor arrivals for this year, the arrivals to-
<br/>date shows that visitor arrivals have actually grown by close to 7 percent in the first eight months. 
<br/>We have, in fact, seen record arrivals month after month, and we are now anticipating that visitor 
<br/>arrivals will be just either below one million, or it could go above a million for 2024, and that will 
<br/>be another year of record tourist arrivals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  also  seen,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  turnaround  in  all  major  sectors  and  a  pickup  in 
<br/></span><span>investments which is expected to improve further. In here, Sir, I want to acknowledge the leadership 
<br/>of the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Co-operatives, Micro, Small 
<br/>and Medium Enterprises and Communications for the reforms and the advocacy that have gone in, 
<br/>in terms of building confidence and attracting investors in all the sectors of the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The low interest rate environment has helped investments and compared to Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  low  interest  rate  environment  has  actually  helped  us  in  our 
<br/>investments,  and  we  are  continuously  working  across  Government  agencies  to  improve  service 
<br/>delivery and ease of doing business. There are still some bottlenecks, but as a government, we are 
<br/>very clearly working on unravelling some of those obstacles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, our resource sectors are still not doing as well as we would want 
<br/>them to and are definitely below their potential.  But that is also another area that is clearly enunciated 
<br/>in  our  NDP,  and  the  Government  is  working  on  them.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  all  these 
<br/>preliminary  data  and  trends,  we  are  clearly  looking  at  an  upgrade  to  the  2024  growth  forecast  to 
<br/>around  3.5  percent  or  even  higher  now.    However,  the  Macroeconomic  Committee  is  currently 
<br/>reviewing these projections, and an official and independent forecast will be released next month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, as a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and as we envisage in the NDP to become a high-
<br/>income country by 2050, the economy needs to grow at a consistent rate of 4 percent to 5 percent 
<br/>every year. Therefore, for everyone, including Government, the private sector, development partners, 
<br/>landowners, farmers, entrepreneurs, students, teachers, professionals, religious bodies, civil society 
<br/>organisations, and in fact, every family and every individual including the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, who has given very strong support to the NDP, has to help us raise our growth and help 
<br/>realise the vision of our NDP. Only together, Sir, as the honourable Prime Minister has always said, 
<br/>since coming into Government, we can realise our collective vision and aspirations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  brief  this  august  House  on  the  National 
<br/>Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050. The NDP is available through the Ministry's website 
<br/>and </span><span>Facebook</span><span> platform, and I urge everyone to take time to read through this very important national 
<br/>document and contribute towards its implementation. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.22 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate, to make their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics for 
<br/>his Ministerial Statement.  I was listening to him very carefully on what he was trying to tell us.  He 
<br/>was trying to sell the National Development Plan (NDP) in a very convincing way that the economy 
<br/>is doing so well, everything is all rosy, but the question here is, whether that is felt by the people on 
<br/>the ground?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- How do they feel?  That is the main question.  How do they feel when 
<br/>they go to the supermarkets to buy their groceries?  How do they feel when they go to the pharmacy 
<br/>to get their medicine? How do they feel when they go to different service providers - whether they 
<br/>are engaging a lawyer or engaging a doctor? How much fees are they paying? They also feel it when 
<br/></span><span>they  pay  their  electricity  bill,  their  water  bill,  et  cetera.  Sir,  on  one  hand  we  can  talk  about  the 
<br/></span><span>economy doing so well, but is it felt by the people? How is it trickling down to the people? Everything 
<br/>matters when the people feel the economic growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the Plan, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a utopia that promises development but does not 
<br/>do anything to address the current challenges which I have just mentioned. None! There is a section 
<br/>that talks about, as a challenge, just a small couple of lines, ‘challenges cost of living’, and that is it.  
<br/>We expected that the current issues faced by our people will be addressed, but people are wanting 
<br/>that solution now. In fact, during consultation, people ask, when are you going to reduce the cost of 
<br/>living? When are you going to reduce the cost of food? Plan is not going to provide that solution 
<br/>right now, plan is long-term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  seen,  not  just  the  high  cost  of  living,  there  is  lack  of  jobs  for 
<br/>graduates,  exodus  of  skills  and  professional  workers,  lack  of  capital  projects,  deplorable  state  of 
<br/>health services, terrible road condition, water not in the tap, so tomorrow we would not be having 
<br/>our Parliament, rising drug issues, substance abuse, high rate of sexual violence and robberies,  so 
<br/>where is safety? Where is safety? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has called the Plan ‘the people’s plan.’  Really? People spoke during that 
<br/></span><span>consultation, they pleaded, “increase the wages so that we can survive in this difficult situation”. He 
<br/>increases the wages by 50 cents, what does 50 cents do?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is just a small fraction, 
<br/>, it does nothing for the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  issue  with  this  Plan  is  that  it  is  not  a  reader  or  user-friendly.  It 
<br/>appears that this Plan was written by a novice as an academic exercise. There is a complete mismatch 
<br/>between policies, programmes, and strategies with the KPIs, and we can see that this Plan is going 
<br/>to lead our country into disaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Government stick to its plan? That is the main question. Can the 
<br/>Government stick to its plan, its values and principles, when they cannot uphold the rule of law - 
<br/></span><span>good governance, transparency and accountability – the key principles which underline and is the 
<br/></span><span>bedrock of this particular Plan? If that is not upheld, there is no way we are going to make any

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics also stated that the vision is to make this 
<br/>country  a  high-income  country.  We  have  delivered.    The  Bainimarama-led  Government  has 
<br/>delivered.  From low income, we moved to a middle-income country, Sir, in less than 16 years.  He 
<br/>wants more than 25 years to take us to high income.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has to up his game, he cannot be relying on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so-called ‘National Development Plan’, which I have said is not even reader or user-friendly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I should share this story with you.  When I was doing my Masters, when I 
<br/>wrote my thesis, my professor said to me, “If you want people to pick up your document and read 
<br/>your thesis, make sure it is not black in colour, make sure it is colourful, it is exciting, people can 
<br/></span><span>look at the cover and will go for that document”.  Look at this cover, what kind of document is this, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Your time is up, Madam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the G-9 Bloc, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition  and  honourable  Members of Parliament,  I rise  today as an independent 
<br/>Member  of  Parliament,  not  bound  by  any  party  obligation,  but  committed  to  the  service  to  our 
<br/>citizens,  to  provide  a  response  to  the  Statement  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister for Finance  and Strategic Planning, National  Development  and Statistics  on the recently 
<br/>published National Development Plan 2025-2029 and Vision 2050.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  commend  the  Coalition  Government  for  proposing  such  an 
<br/>ambitious Plan, one that aims to address growth and development across multiple sectors over the 
<br/></span><span>next several years.  The fact that a detailed roadmap has been laid out for the future will, undoubtedly, 
<br/></span><span>bring  about  some  level  of  confidence  and  reassurance  both,  domestically  and  on  an  international 
<br/>stage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a plan is only as good as its execution. While the presentation of 
<br/>such an extensive development plan is commendable, the success lies heavily in its implementation.  
<br/>It is on this point that I wish to focus my response as an independent Member of Parliament.  We 
<br/>have  a  unique  position,  providing  unbiased  and  constructive  criticism,  a  role  we  embody  for  the 
<br/>progress of our beloved nation. My main concern lies with the practical enactment of this Plan.  We 
<br/>must consider practical challenges that potentially stand as hurdles in the path of progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  crucial  that  we  ensure  that  no  Division  or  Province  is  left  behind.  Our  country  is 
<br/>beautifully diverse in our culture, our tradition and our religion.  This diversity must be reflected in 
<br/>our national development strategies.  As we move forward, Mr. Speaker, with this Plan, we must 
<br/></span><span>ensure  that  every  initiative  is  as  inclusive  as  possible,  providing  for  the  needs  of  every  citizen.  
<br/></span><span>Tangible benefits, as alluded to, must be realised on the ground.

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, let us not forget that formulating a plan and executing it are two different tasks.  
<br/>A balance needs to be struck between an ambition and its feasibility. It is prudent to be optimistic, 
<br/>but  it  is  absolutely  mandatory  to  be  realistic.    The  current  economic  climate  of  our  budgetary 
<br/>restriction calls for a need to measure each initiative and positive impact against its cost and prioritise 
<br/>accordingly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, accountability is central to the success of  any plan. It is good to 
<br/>note that Chapter 9 of the National Development Plan is dedicated to a comprehensive monitoring 
<br/>and  evaluation  framework  that  will  allow  progress  and  initiatives  to  be  accurately  measured  and 
<br/>assessed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we stand on the threshold of an exciting and transformative era, let 
<br/>us remember that the road to development is not a race, but a journey. It is not about who we surpass, 
<br/>but who we uplift and bring with us.  As we advance towards a prosperous 2050, let us leave no one 
<br/>behind. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the floor to respond to the Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, let me acknowledge the presence 
<br/>of the Special Advisor to the Australian High Commission who is sitting here, Ms. Bale.   Welcome, 
<br/></span><span>Madam. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will move on. I now call on the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Cooperatives, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Trilateral Meeting with Australian and New Zealand Trade Ministers 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  Na  Tui  Cakau</span><span>,  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; before I begin my Ministerial 
<br/>Statement, I thought it would be appropriate to pay tribute to a great son of the Province of Ra.  We 
<br/>probably would say he was a Lion of the Province of Ra – Mr. Tomu Vuetilovoni. He was called to 
<br/>rest a few days ago, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, Mr. Vuetilovoni was firstly a captain of industry in our country.  He led the 
<br/>Colonial Bank for so many years profitably. He groomed and mentored so many of our young men 
<br/>and women, one of which is the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance here today.  After the 
<br/>2000 </span><span>coup</span><span>, he was asked to become a Minister of that Interim Government and was later a substantive 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Commerce, Business Development and Investment, before their untimely removal in 
<br/></span><span>2006.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He was also a passionate rugby advocate, Sir.  His shadow looms large when it comes to the 
<br/>formation of the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) in all those formative years. He spent, I am sure, not only 
<br/>a lot of his resource but his own personal resources to support the FRU at that time. Sir, with those 
<br/>few words and on behalf of a grateful nation, I wish to pay tribute to Mr. Tom Vuetilovoni for his 
<br/>service to Fiji and may his soul rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  thank you for giving me the opportunity to  share some insights into the 
<br/>high-level visit to New Zealand which was held from 19th September, 2024 to 24th September, 2024, 
<br/>and to inform this august House of some of the positive outcomes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit served as a crucial platform for strengthening and continuing to 
<br/></span><span>form  stronger  trade  economic  ties  with  New  Zealand  and  Australia.  For  the  first  time,  Sir,  and 
<br/></span><span>probably in the history of Fiji, the first Trilateral Trade Meeting was held in Rotorua between the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2137 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Trade Ministers - the honourable Todd McClay of New Zealand, Senator Don Ferrel of 
<br/>Australia and myself, to discuss our trade opportunities which I will delve into a bit further. Because 
<br/>the  honourable  Senator  Ferrel  was  also  the  Minister  for  Tourism,  I  had  the  honour  of  meeting 
<br/>honourable Matt Doocey from New Zealand in a three-way discussion with Fiji on matters regarding 
<br/>tourism  and  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation for providing some information for that meeting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Trilateral Trade Meeting was organised by the Government of New Zealand through its 
<br/>Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade  (MFAT)  and  we  had  four  Government  representatives 
<br/>accompanying me from Fiji. The meetings, Sir, included ministerial meetings and networking events 
<br/>in three locations, namely, Auckland, Rotorua and Christchurch.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the opportunity to have a very cordial and very fruitful meeting 
<br/>with  the  new  Deputy  Prime  Minister  of  New  Zealand,  honourable  Winston  Peters,  where  we 
<br/>discussed  potential  opportunities  for  Fiji  and  New  Zealand  and  the  need  to  explore  more  value 
<br/>addition in exports and, particularly, economic diversification of our natural resources. To start the 
<br/>trip, I did have a briefing from the Trade Commission in New Zealand and suffice to say, Sir, that 
<br/>we are doing some very things in New Zealand which is helping the current growth in trade between 
<br/></span><span>Fiji and New Zealand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Ministerial Meeting, Sir, of course, the meeting initially focussed on PACER 
<br/>Plus where both, New Zealand and Australia, heard Fiji’s position. We did highlight, Sir, that whilst 
<br/>PACER Plus does present opportunities, it does have some potential threats as well. We are currently 
<br/>in discussion, trying to actually establish a further deep dive into these risks to further understand the 
<br/>benefits and the risks of PACER Plus to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  had  a  discussion  on  something  that  is  being  led  by  Fiji  at  the 
<br/>moment, which is a coalition against overcapacity and over-fishing. This is to build on the momentum 
<br/>of  the  discussions  at  the  WTO’s  13</span><span>th</span><span>  Ministerial  Conference,  to  further  strengthen  disciplines  on 
<br/>harmful  fisheries subsidies that contribute to  overcapacity or overfishing  (OCOF).  The proposed 
<br/>coalition would simultaneously increase the capacity of the Pacific to be allowed a voice in terms of 
<br/>the preservation of its natural resources and hopefully in time to come, Sir, create an opportunity to, 
<br/>perhaps, create our own tuna industry in the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, Sir, we did talk about some of the ambitions of Fiji, namely the potential to 
<br/>pivot towards Southeast Asia, our ambitions to join APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) at 
<br/></span><span>some point, and all parties agreed, Mr. Speaker, that there are opportunities to collaborate further as 
<br/></span><span>Fiji  embarks  on  its  diversification  progress  in  areas  such  as  commercial  agriculture,  aquaculture, 
<br/>tourism and ICT.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in terms of the site visits, I will talk very briefly about the targeted site visits 
<br/>that we did, in summary, just to give this august House a feel for what we were trying to do on this 
<br/>opportunity in New Zealand. What we did, Sir, is we went and visited the University of Waikato's 
<br/>Aquaculture  Research  Facility  in  the  University  of  Waikato.    We  also  visited  the  New  Zealand 
<br/>Research Centre for Forestry called Scion in Christchurch, and we also visited Lincoln University, 
<br/>just to look at their research expertise in terms of trying to improve our horticultural and agricultural 
<br/>sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I can say, Sir, is that there is great potential for collaboration in these areas with Fiji. 
<br/>The advancements that are being made in terms  of breeding of seaweed,  in terms of horticulture, 
<br/></span><span>trying to plant more varieties, for instance, of avocado to make it more resistant to cold weather, so 
<br/></span><span>those are the types of things that are happening in New Zealand.  We all agreed from those three 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>2138 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>meetings that there is quite a significant opportunity to work with these two countries and I will be 
<br/>referring some of the contacts to the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, as well as 
<br/>the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry very soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also visited Zespri International Limited which is the largest marketer 
<br/>of kiwifruit, and they are a co-operative model.  Their revenue, I think, is about NZ$4 billion at the 
<br/>moment and climbing, and they are the most successful model for cooperatives in New Zealand with 
<br/>about 50 percent of ownership of Zespri being owned by the farmers. The reason why we went to 
<br/>visit Zespri was to actually look at how we can maybe replicate some of that in Fiji and I think of the 
<br/>kava  industry,  ginger  industry,  turmeric  industry,  </span><span>dalo</span><span>,  cassava  and,  perhaps,  over  the  next  few 
<br/>months, we will be exploring some of these opportunities in that regard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also visited a very interesting Māori village on our way down to Rotorua. We visited the 
<br/>Tuaropaki Trust in Mokai - an indigenous land organisation representing 297 families with a robust 
<br/>asset  base  of  NZ$1billion.  The  visit  focussed  on  looking  at  what  they  were  doing  and  what  was 
<br/>interesting in that Trust, Sir, was they focussed on their resources and from their natural resources, 
<br/>they leverage the ecosystem that now sits around the whole area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They discovered that they could supply hydrogen power.  They have a hydrogen power plant 
<br/></span><span>that is now selling electricity back to the grid in New Zealand. It is also powering up their own milk 
<br/>farm on the same area, it is powering up their vegetable greenhouses and it is just a wonderful way 
<br/>of, perhaps, demonstrating that there is hope with our indigenous.  If we can leverage up the resources 
<br/>that they have, they can create other industry wherever they are located.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Sir, we visited Rag Stag Timber, which is a largest timber company in the Southern 
<br/>Hemisphere.  It is huge.  Just to go and look at the technology, what they were doing, and the reason 
<br/>why I went there was to actually look at it in the context of what we are trying to do with mahogany 
<br/>and see what  technologies are  out  there. That  was  part of the reason  I also  went  to  the Research 
<br/>Institute in New Zealand.  Again, Sir, there are opportunities for further collaboration in that area.  I 
<br/>hope in the not-too-distant future, we can unlock the mahogany opportunity.  When we talked to 
<br/>those who know, they said it is a billion-dollar opportunity for Fiji, so I am hoping that very soon, 
<br/>we can unlock that opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, also in the final visit we visited some chocolate importers in Christchurch.  
<br/>It is called the She Chocolate.  They are actually buying a lot of chocolate from the Pacific right now.  
<br/>They expressed an interest in trying to restart the cocoa industry in Fiji.  There are some ongoing 
<br/></span><span>discussions by the honourable Minister for Agriculture with two particular Provinces in Fiji, with 
<br/></span><span>some input from the GCC as well.  If that endeavour takes off, we can start rebuilding our cocoa 
<br/>industry.  We are currently producing only about 100 tonnes of cocoa, if I am not wrong, and Samoa 
<br/>is now at 500 tonnes.  They have gone through a rehabilitation exercise.  The potential also is huge 
<br/>for that, and we are working very closely with the Ministry of Agriculture to try and ensure that, that 
<br/>opportunity grows legs as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as you can see from the visit, I hope I have demonstrated that the visit was not a junket 
<br/>just to go and have a holiday in New Zealand, but it was a serious attempt to try and continue this 
<br/>endeavour to diversify the Fijian economy, look at opportunities that are available, and then come 
<br/>back and work on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to convey my deepest appreciation to the Government 
<br/>of New Zealand for coordinating this visit and making it a success. Particularly, I would like to thank 
<br/></span><span>her Excellency the High Commissioner of New Zealand, Charlotte Darlow, and the First Secretary, 
<br/></span><span>Finlay Fraser Milne, for coordinating the visit and making it a resounding success.

<div><span> Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, as I have mentioned, we will ensure that this visit is just not a visit </span><span>per se</span><span>, 
<br/>but that we can target some of the opportunities that we have seen and ensure that we continue to 
<br/>diversify the Fijian economy, so that our people, as mentioned by honourable Kumar, can see some 
<br/>benefits on the ground.  I thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition, or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications on 
<br/>the high-level visit to New Zealand, and the first, as he says, the Trilateral Trade Meeting between 
<br/>the Ministers from Australia and New Zealand.  I think one of the most important things for any 
<br/>country is to ensure that we have the right agreements in place with respect to trade so that there is 
<br/>facilitation that can happen for all our goods and services that need to go overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues that he has raised was with respect to PACER Plus. I think because Fiji is a 
<br/>small island developing State similar to Papua New Guinea, we have difficulties with it, and that is 
<br/>why we were not signatories. All the other Least Developing Countries signed it, so we had to be 
<br/>looked at in a different manner and in a different tone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the areas, and I have spoken to the honourable Minister about this, and he agrees with 
<br/>me also, is that we cannot have interference in our policy space when it comes to these agreements. 
<br/>So, it is a slow approach, not to say that it is not going to be done at all, but that kind of approach is 
<br/>needed  because  we  all  must  remember  and  we  all  must  think  like  this,  that  we  are  a  developing 
<br/>economy. So, there are a lot of things that we need to be able to do ourselves as a sovereign country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, part of the agreement also has a lot of positive issues in it regarding capacity-
<br/>building  which  is  really  good  for  us.  I  think  it  is  also  important  at  this  particular  stage  of  our 
<br/>development because we have had a lot of mass migration of our skilled workers that are leaving, so 
<br/>that is something else that needs to be constantly discussed.  Modernising our systems is also a part 
<br/>of  it,  our  customs  and  processes,  less  red  tape,  et  cetera,  that  needs  to  happen,  our  sanitary  and 
<br/>phytosanitary measures, standards and regulations that help us with respect to market access. Also, 
<br/>supporting our regulatory reform that needs to happen, Mr. Speaker, which is also a glaring issue that 
<br/>needs to be looked at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know for a fact that the World Bank and International Finance Corporation have given us 
<br/>positive reports on this agreement but, at same time, we must not look at them and say that they are 
<br/></span><span>the gospel truth. It is us that need to deal with it and our sovereignty, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Asian Development Bank has also supported it.  What it truly does, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 
<br/>terms of PACER Plus, if you look at it, Fiji and Papua New Guinea cover about 80 percent of the 
<br/>Pacific’s economic output.  So, the major players in this agreement is Fiji and Papua New Guinea, 
<br/>and until they sign, that agreement falls short in a lot of things. So, a lot of work still needs to be 
<br/>done. I have spoken to the honourable Minister about this, and he also agrees with me that we need 
<br/>to move forward and get this done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, our private sector here needs to have a huge contribution on it and I know for a fact that 
<br/>he  has  been  consulting  with  them.  Some  of  them  are  still  a  bit  wary  about  actually  getting  the 
<br/>signatures done with respect to getting PACER Plus off the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir from a perspective of what actually is good for us and what actually is bad 
<br/></span><span>for us, in terms of the disadvantages of PACER Plus, we did not sign because earlier on as I have 
<br/></span><span>said, it was very lopsided.  To us it was lopsided, and it did not actually meet our development needs. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone needs to understand, Sir, that this agreement is not a normal free trade agreement, it was a 
<br/>trade agreement which had development aspirations in it for countries like Fiji, Papua New Guinea, 
<br/>et cetera, and that needs to be at the forefront of the discussions when we had it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had difficulties right at the beginning with it, even with the Office of the Chief Trader 
<br/>Advisor, who was actually doing all these stuff for us.  But in a nutshell, Sir, I think it is a good 
<br/>opportunity that the honourable Minister has taken up with respect to trying to see what can be done 
<br/>in terms of PACER Plus. We have a lot of potential in our country but at the same time, we must not 
<br/>lose sight and track of what we have and what we can do in other markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also very happy to hear that Fiji has led the negotiations regarding fisheries subsidies at 
<br/>the WTO. So, I know, and he knows also, and I am glad that it has been taken up as a Pacific issue 
<br/>and something is actually being done about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there are many other things that we can talk about but due to shortage of time, 
<br/>Sir, I support the Minister’s trip, and I think it has been worthwhile to get it done and it is something 
<br/>that needs to continually happen and we certainly should not put our foot off the gas on this particular 
<br/>agreement. Thank you very much, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.– I now call upon the Leader of G-9 Bloc, or their designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.–  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for  his  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement this morning and certainly, lend support to the sentiments expressed by honourable Koya 
<br/>in  his  response.  In  your  Statement,  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  you  mentioned  that  this  problem  of 
<br/>overfishing  and  overcapacity  is  important,  given  that  we  do  share  the  same  piece  of  ocean  with 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand, and we are partners in that regard also on maritime security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just want to echo what was mentioned yesterday on this agreement under the Law of the Sea 
<br/>Conservation  and  Sustainable  use  of  Marine  Biological  Diversity  of  Areas  beyond  National 
<br/>Jurisdiction (BBNJ). I think Fiji was the first country to sign, and the need for Fiji to ratify. It needs 
<br/>to come to Parliament and to come to our committee so that we can go ahead with the ratification 
<br/>process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  the  Government  for  enhancing  that 
<br/>relationship that we have with the two countries. They are big partners and big contributors to our 
<br/>tourism economy, as well as big assistance in terms of maritime security.  I think they are not only 
<br/></span><span>partners, perhaps, they are </span><span>vuvale </span><span>(family), and it is the relationship that we want to enhance and I 
<br/></span><span>urge the Government to continue to build and enhance this wonderful - very fruitful relationship that 
<br/>we have with these two countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Mission to Indonesia Under the Australia and Indonesia Trilateral Agreement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, I rise today to inform Parliament about a critical trilateral 
<br/>initiative  that  is  currently  being  developed  between  our  Government  and  the  Governments  of 
<br/>Australia and Indonesia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  presence  this  morning  of  the  Counsellor  for 
<br/>Infrastructure  and  Climate  Resilience,  Ms.  Louise  Scott,  and  Ms.  Skye  Bale,  Counsellor  in  the 
<br/>Political Division of DFAT in the Australian High Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This proposed partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be a major step towards advancing regional 
<br/></span><span>stability, fostering resilience and promoting shared development across the Pacific in line with our

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>common  goals  for  sustainable  growth,  comprehensive  disaster  risk  management  and  regional 
<br/>cooperation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2021, the Governments of Indonesia and Australia signed a Memorandum 
<br/>of Understanding (MOU), aimed at enhancing trilateral cooperation with Pacific Island Countries, 
<br/>with Fiji chosen to be among the first to participate.  The MOU prioritised cooperation in various 
<br/>thematic  areas  including  disaster  risk  management,  humanitarian  response,  climate  change  and 
<br/>sustainable economic growth.  Given our shared vulnerability to natural disasters and the importance 
<br/>of regional collaboration, Fiji was selected to engage specifically in disaster risk management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  6</span><span>th</span><span>  August,  2024,  the  Governments  of  Australia  and  Indonesia  formally  extended  an 
<br/>invitation  to  our  Government  for  a  peer-to-peer  exchange  with  Indonesia,  designed  to  enhance 
<br/>collaboration  in  disaster  risk  management.  This  exchange,  supported  by  Australia-Indonesia 
<br/>Partnership  in  Disaster  Risk  Management  (SIAP  SIAGA),  was  critical  to  our  learning  from 
<br/>Indonesia’s extensive experience in disaster preparedness and response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  such,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  between  8</span><span>th</span><span>  and  13</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2024,  I  led  a  10-member 
<br/>delegation  to  Indonesia.    This  delegation  included  my  Permanent  Secretary,  the  four  Divisional 
<br/></span><span>Commissioners  and  Officials  from  the  National  Disaster  Management  Office,  as  well  as  two 
<br/></span><span>members of the Australian High Commission, including Ms. Louise Scott, who is here with us and 
<br/>Ms. Elizabeth Beard.  The mission had several key objectives to engage with Indonesia’s national 
<br/>and provincial governments, to exchange best practices in disaster risk reduction and humanitarian 
<br/>assistance, and to explore future areas of cooperation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme included engagements at regional, national, subnational and 
<br/>community  levels.  A  key  highlight  was  our  visit  to  the  ASEAN  Coordination  Centre  for 
<br/>Humanitarian Assistance (AHA), where discussions focused on the establishment and operation of 
<br/>regional humanitarian mechanisms, an area of significant relevance, given that we are considering 
<br/>establishing a similar mechanism in the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I delivered a keynote address at the 2nd Global Forum for 
<br/>Sustainable Resilience and attended the Asian Disaster Management &amp; Civil Protection Expo and 
<br/>Conference (ADEXCO). These platforms allowed us to share our insights and experiences, while 
<br/>also learning from global experts on building sustainable resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  had  a  bilateral  meeting  with  Her  Excellency  Retno  Marsudi,  Indonesia's  Foreign 
<br/></span><span>Minister, where Minister Marsudi outlined Indonesia's priorities for Pacific cooperation, focusing on 
<br/></span><span>climate change, disaster risk reduction and response, and the Blue Economy. I echoed Fiji's support 
<br/>for these efforts, particularly, in advancing peer-to-peer learning and exchange initiatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  delegation  also  engaged  in  productive  discussions  with  Indonesia's 
<br/>National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB). During these discussions, we agreed to re-establish 
<br/>the bilateral MOU on disaster risk management, which had lapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a further show of Indonesia's commitment, BNPB extended an invitation for Fiji to attend 
<br/>the Indian Ocean Tsunami Commemoration in Aceh Province, taking place from 8</span><span>th</span><span> to 10</span><span>th</span><span> October 
<br/>this  year.  This  engagement  will  further  solidify  our  partnerships  and  enhance  our  disaster 
<br/>management capabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the subnational  level, the delegation had valuable meetings with  the Jakarta Provincial 
<br/></span><span>Agency  for  Disaster  Management  and  the  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur  (NTT)  Provincial  Agency  for 
<br/></span><span>Disaster Management. These engagements provided the delegation with an opportunity to observe

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>emergency  operation  centres  at  different  scales  and  witness  firsthand  the  coordination  between 
<br/>national and subnational agencies during disaster events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the visit to a local community in Bali, Indonesia, was equally insightful. 
<br/>The  delegation  observed  how  disaster  resilience  is  embedded  at  the  grassroots  level,  through 
<br/>community training and education programmes, supported by the Australian-funded SIAP SIAGA 
<br/>initiative. These local-level efforts align closely with Fiji's vision of building resilient communities 
<br/>that are equipped to manage disaster risks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster risks in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in the face of climate 
<br/>change, are no longer confined to borders, as we all know.  Complex riskscapes, as highlighted in 
<br/>the  United  Nations'  2019  and  2021  Asia-Pacific  Disaster  Reports,  show  how  biological  hazards, 
<br/>climate variability and disasters interact, posing increasing challenges for our region. The proposed 
<br/>trilateral  partnership,  combining  Indonesia's  wealth  of  experience  and  Australia's  strong 
<br/>humanitarian commitment, will allow Fiji to build greater resilience to these risks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Government  has  already  benefited  from  the  longstanding  cooperation  with  Australia. 
<br/>Through  the  Fiji-Australia  Vuvale  Partnership,  Australia  has  supported  disaster  preparedness 
<br/></span><span>activities  in  Fiji,  such  as  the  AUD1.2  million  Disaster  Resilience  Programme  and  the  Cyclone 
<br/></span><span>Recovery  Programme,  which  rehabilitated  critical  infrastructure  damaged  during  </span><span>TCYasa</span><span>.  
<br/>Additionally, regional initiatives, such as the Australian Humanitarian Partnership Disaster Ready 
<br/>2.0 Programme, Pacific Insurance and Climate Adaptation Programme and the Women's Resilience 
<br/>to Disasters initiative, continue to bolster Fiji's disaster preparedness and recovery efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our cooperation with Indonesia is equally promising. The draft MOU for 
<br/>the Fiji-Indonesia  cooperation, initiated in  2022, is  now under review to  reflect  the new strategic 
<br/>objectives emerging from this trilateral initiative.  This trilateral cooperation between Fiji, Indonesia 
<br/>and Australia is a forward-looking initiative. It provides a solid foundation for Fiji to strengthen its 
<br/>disaster risk management capabilities, while also contributing to the broader  
<br/>regional resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to convey my deepest appreciation to the Governments of Indonesia 
<br/>and Australia, for their continued support and collaboration. The lessons learned from our mission to 
<br/>Indonesia have been invaluable, and we are committed to working hard to implement these learnings 
<br/>for the benefit of the Fijian people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a government, we will continue refining and prioritising this trilateral initiative over the 
<br/></span><span>coming months, ensuring that it delivers meaningful and long-term benefits for our nation and the 
<br/>wider Pacific region.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU  –Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>Ministerial Statement.  Of course, it is an important commitment from him and his team, and I wish 
<br/>to  acknowledge  him  for  that.  Again,  this  proves  the  point  that  for  us,  SDG  17  is  important  -  the 
<br/>partnership, because we do not have the capacity, we do not have the capability, and this is where 
<br/>regionalism and, of course extending beyond the region as well in terms of the regional architecture, 
<br/>where we have issues of common interest. This is what brings us together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just focus on two areas without repeating what the honourable Minister has stated and this 
<br/></span><span>is for Government, particularly from experience for us to raise our level of resilience and particularly 
<br/></span><span>in terms of preparedness, not only in its strategies but of course in its application.  What is important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2143 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is political will. I will say that again, for us to raise our level of resilience and of course our level of 
<br/>preparedness so that we can deliver when it comes to emergency situations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The political will and commitment is so important. Based on the past experience Fiji has gone 
<br/>through so many disasters, but disasters after disasters we have reports. Reports are filed away. These 
<br/>are not analysed, and the lessons learned from those reports taken. And of course, what is important, 
<br/>is the direction that we will take based on the leadership of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2011, Mr Speaker Sir, we changed the way things were done at NDMO with just a simple 
<br/>statement.  Shifting  from  a  culture  of  reaction  to  a  culture  of  prevention.  That  really  changed  the 
<br/>dynamics of how we dealt with emergencies and disasters. Because we prepare well now it will be 
<br/>easier for us when it comes to emergency situations and this why I was saying unfortunately in most 
<br/>previous disasters, good reports, but filed away, nothing was done to it. It needs political will and 
<br/>commitment which change the development paradigm with three simple factors; the way we live is 
<br/>changing what we call the new norm, intensity, the frequency, the way we live is changing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore, the way we do development must change. Not just development for the sake of 
<br/>development,  but  resilient  development,  that  is  very,  very  important.  And  the  third  one  is  the 
<br/></span><span>partnership,  the  way  we  live  is  changing  therefore,  the  way  we  do  development  must  change, 
<br/></span><span>therefore, the partnership becomes important as well. And that it means that for continuing with this, 
<br/>because only then we can prepare well for the next disasters. And commitment and application either 
<br/>they be an Australian government either that, New Zealand government we have the MOU that we 
<br/>signed with Indonesia few years back. It is time that these MOUs be revisited. But how are we going 
<br/>to apply what we have learnt from Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand back here in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We went on taxpayers’ money, what is important is that we must see the results back here. 
<br/>Honourable Minister, I have a word of advice, I know that a lot of your senior staff are leaving. I 
<br/>think now, NDMO has not been tested for quite a while with a serious disaster and probably with the 
<br/>assistance of the Australian Defence Force, let us bring coral reef exercise very quickly.  We need to 
<br/>do some tabletop exercises because of the turnover that is happening in the Ministry. We look forward 
<br/>to the discussions on the Bill this afternoon, Sir, but I commend the Ministry, and this is an important 
<br/>subject, and we must all support this because we prepare well now it will save us a lot in the future. 
<br/>Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement, 
<br/>and we acknowledge the information that he shared with us this morning and we have nothing further 
<br/></span><span>to add.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. So, I have already invited the honourable Minister for Lands 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to take the floor now. My apologies to that Group of 9.

<div><span>Government Freehold Buy-Back Scheme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers, honourable Leaders of the Opposition, Members of 
<br/>Parliament, those who are watching at the gallery and those who are joining us live.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise this morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to speak on the statement of the Government's Buy-
<br/>Back Scheme from 1989 to-date.  The Government's Freehold Buy-Back Scheme was the initiative 
<br/>of the Rabuka SVT Government in 1989, and it was promised on buying back ancestral land that 
<br/></span><span>were  alienated  as  freehold  land  through  assisting  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  landowners  who  had  little  or  no  land 
<br/></span><span>available for agriculture registered under their names in the Register of Native Lands to meet the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>growing members of the </span><span>mataqali </span><span>or the LOU or landowning unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The first freehold buy-back land was approved by Cabinet on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 1989, and they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>included these parcels of freehold land: Vunia Island in Vanua Balavu; Tuvumaca, Welagi/Yavusa 
<br/>in Taveuni; Matakunea, Navatu in Cakaudrove; Korodogo, </span><span>Mataqali</span><span> Naduru, Dogotuki in Macuata 
<br/>and; Mua Estate, </span><span>Yavusa </span><span>Wainikeli/Naselesele in Taveuni.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the 20th April 1993, Cabinet further approved $2million in the budget 
<br/>to assist in additional freehold buy-back initiatives to further formalise the purchase of 24 freehold 
<br/>parcels of land to assist the landless resource owners secure arable, cultivatable land interest-free.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, out of the 24 freehold buy-back land, 15 are in the Northern Division, 8in 
<br/>the Central Division and one in the Western Division.  The Ministry through its Land Use Division 
<br/>is responsible for the administration and monitoring of this Buy-Back Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Scheme the Government purchases freehold land for sale in the 
<br/>market  on  behalf  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>landowners.  The  acquisition  process  was  based  at  the  time  and 
<br/>continues to be based on a fair and market price determined by Government registered valuers.  This 
<br/></span><span>will be made possible through Interest-free loans as stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Sales 
<br/></span><span>and Purchase Agreement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  main  features  of  the  Sales  and  Purchase  Agreement  between 
<br/>Government and the respective LOUs includes the purchase amount shall be paid over period of 30 
<br/>years. Upon completion of the payment, the Director of Lands on behalf of Government shall transfer 
<br/>the  said  land  to  the  Trustees  in  freehold  status,  and  it  shall  not  be  alienated,  sold,  transferred  or 
<br/>exchanged except to the State. If the Trustees default in payment of the monies as scheduled, then 
<br/>the Minister may rescind the agreement and require trustees to hand over the vacant possession of 
<br/>the land to the Director of Lands, and all monies paid shall be forfeited to the Government.  Subject 
<br/>to Cabinet approval, the terms and conditions of the agreement may be varied by mutual consent of 
<br/>the parties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Section 29(5) of the 2013 Constitution, provides that all land that existed as 
<br/>freehold land immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall remain as freehold 
<br/>land even if it is sold or purchased unless it is sold to the State or acquired by the State for a public 
<br/>purpose under Section 27. Given these new constitutional requirements, the buy-back land shall now 
<br/>revert and have reverted since 2013 to qualified landowning units in its current tenure as freehold 
<br/></span><span>land and not as </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> reserved land as per initial Sales and Purchases Agreement stated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so far out of the 24 freehold buy back lands, nine landowning units have 
<br/>fully paid their dues amounting to a return of $1.7 million to the State. To date, seven landowning 
<br/>units have paid off their debts with parcels of land transferred are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> the Yavusa Nasuva in Tuvumaca in Taveuni, Cakaudrove,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Wairuku Estate, Waivunia Savusavu in Cakaudrove,

<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mataqali Nailagobokola in Nausori, Tailevu,  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Mua Estate, Yavusa Wainikeli, Welagi Tavueni,

<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>As of last week, on Friday, Tuwaidra in Nabu, Yavusa Vugalei, Kasavu in Tailevu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, two landowning units have fully paid their land parcels in addition to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>seven and their land parcels have yet to be transferred to them and they are:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other hand, 15 landowning units have partly paid their dues with a total outstanding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>balance of just over 2 million, which is currently being monitored by the Ministry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  way  forward,  the  current  measures  undertaken  by  the  Ministry  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improve loan repayments are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening collaboration with our landowning units. The Ministry through the Land 
<br/>Use Division, continue to liaise with the Trustees and landowning units and properly to 
<br/>advise them and assist them wherever it is relevant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Joint  Venture  Initiative  –  Land  Use  Division  has  successfully  implemented  joint 
<br/>ventures  initiatives  and  resource  owner  friendly  concepts  to  fast  track  and  assist 
<br/>landowning units in paying back their loans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Leasing  of  their  land.  –  For  unserviced  accounts,  ongoing  consultations  and  active 
<br/>marketing  and  leasing  land  to  assist  the  landowning  units  in  their  payments.  The 
<br/>Ministry is currently leasing 11 freehold buy back lands to assist the landowning units 
<br/>that have defaulted in their payments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  the  successful  applicants,  the  Ministry  has  also  rendered 
<br/>assistance to landowning units such as redefinition of their boundaries for buy back lands that have 
<br/>been paid off, land-use visibility reports on potential developments and ongoing consultations and 
<br/>assistance rendered for the transfer titles without any cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the success rate sitting at 37.5 (percent) meaning 9 out of the 24 of 
<br/>the  buyback  land  scheme  fully  paid,  the  buyback  scheme  has  greatly  benefited  the  traditional 
<br/>landowners.  It  has  brought  a  sense  of  belonging,  pride,  ownership,  security  and  of  course 
<br/>empowerment to them. The Ministry, through its Land Use Division for the land bank have always 
<br/>emphasised the right or equal access to land for all including the vulnerable members of indigenous 
<br/></span><span>i-Taukei</span><span> and those desiring to secure affordable parcels for their livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey that began three decades ago for the recipients of the buyback 
<br/>scheme is a journey that has been characterised by their determination, resilience and unwavering 
<br/>commitment to prosperity. The Government and the Ministry is, therefore, proud to be part of the 
<br/>journey by these landowning units.  Over the years the Ministry has been steadfast in its commitment 
<br/>to  provide fair, transparent,  effective  and non-discriminatory administration for all buy back land 
<br/>purchase under the Freehold Buy-Back Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  landowning  units’  land  have  been  handed  over  are  always  advised  to 
<br/>cultivate their land, maximise its potential for productive purposes and generate significant returns 
<br/>for the landowning units.  Furthermore, LOU’s are always encouraged to pursue income generating 
<br/>initiatives to benefit the current and future generations. Added to this, are the intrinsic in heritage 
<br/></span><span>attached to land which hovers around reclaiming their culture, their identity, and indeed their future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I still have some time in my present role as the acting Minister for 
<br/>Home Affairs and Immigration, I wish to inform Parliament and the people of Fiji that our security 
<br/>personnel, men and women of the RFMF in the deployed units and regions of Lebanon, Syria and 
<br/>Golan Heights, Jerusalem and in Sinai are all well, safe and in high morale. Whilst they are there, 
<br/>they remain compliant with the safety protocols that are required of them in a very hostile region at

<div><span>present.  I also urge all our citizens to remember our men and women in this region in the Middle 
<br/>East in their prayers, whilst they go through a very turbulent and difficult time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I would like thank the honourable Minister of Land 
<br/>for his Ministerial Statement. Mr. Speaker, the tribute must be paid to every government since the 
<br/>initiative  of  Buy-Back  Scheme  came  into  effect.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Buy-Back  Scheme  was 
<br/>established  in  1989  as  the  Minister  has  alluded  under  the  Rabuka  regime  with  the  intentions  or 
<br/>objectives to  assist  the native  landowners who had little or no cultivable agricultural  land. Thirty 
<br/>years incentive was given to the </span><span>Mataqalis</span><span> to repay loan before regaining absolute ownership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, the Buy-Back Schemes must be monitored to see whether the land 
<br/>is utilised and used for that purpose or else it will be of no use. Until 2020, only four </span><span>Yavusa</span><span> were 
<br/>paid off fully and gained ownership. In 2021, the FijiFirst Government paid $4.7 million on the land 
<br/>Buy-Back Scheme. It purchased 26 parcels of freehold land on behalf of land-owning units.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most or majority of Fijians in our country do not own land, hence initiatives 
<br/>should be given to those Fijians, and here the honourable Minister for iTaukei wants to transfer all 
<br/>state land to iTaukei land. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government of the day must monitor as most of the 
<br/></span><span>buyback  land  has  breaches  such  as  non-cultivation  and  land  lying  idle.  And  we  all  know,  how 
<br/></span><span>important the agriculture sector is, as what happened during COVID 19. Keeping land idle is of no 
<br/>use for our nation or to our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion Mr. Speaker, Sir, it may be a good initiative, but every Fijian has to be looked 
<br/>after and should own a piece of land for living. In fact, most of iTaukei does not have any land in 
<br/>Fiji. As this initiative was started by the honourable Prime Minister, I would urge the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to start an initiative that will look after all Fijians, and all will have a piece of land in 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  honourable  Kirpal.  You  are  very  true  in  saying  that  some 
<br/>iTaukei do not have any land, they are landless people. So, this is one way of providing land to them. 
<br/>The honourable Minister for Lands has quoted that specific Section of the Constitution 2013, which 
<br/>when buying back freehold land, it remains freehold land. But I think reservation of those freehold 
<br/>land can be undertaken, because we have a precedent case in Ovalau, where freehold land has been 
<br/>reserved for the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the leader of the G9-Bloc or their designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, let me thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Lands for the statement on the buyback scheme and for the update, the assurance that our men and 
<br/>women were serving over and beyond shores, are well and safe. Perhaps, I also  take this time to 
<br/>remind the honourable Members of the Parliament that the best way to remember them, not only as 
<br/>we pray, but the best way to remember them is to support them with your poppy. So, if you are not 
<br/>wearing a poppy, I would ask them perhaps, but they should be fine and contribute to the aftercare 
<br/>fund of the servicemen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also stand as the Chairman of the trustees of the Bua Buyback Scheme for 
<br/>the Yavusa Wainikeli in Naselesele, Taveuni.  Perhaps, my response to the honourable Minister is 
<br/>really in the form of our journey - in how we acquired the land, what we want to do with it and where 
<br/>we are at this point in time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 30 years ago, through the wise decision of our Chief, Ratu Talemo Ratakele, 
<br/></span><span>and the others of the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, we decided to commit the </span><span>vanua </span><span>to acquire this piece of land. It took us

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2147 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>30 years to pay it off, until last year when the title was given to us by the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/>Those years of hard work, but of a commitment by the </span><span>vanua</span><span> to see an opportunity to get back the 
<br/>land that belonged to them but is owned by someone else, the opportunity to own it and the challenge 
<br/>to utilise it. This is where are today. The challenge to utilise this piece of land which is ours, Yavusa 
<br/>Wainikeli.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to share with you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done so far.  I sit as a chair with 
<br/>some  of  us  who  live  in  Suva  and  representation  from  the  </span><span>mataqali  </span><span>in  </span><span>vanua</span><span>.  We  have  left  out  a 
<br/>strategic direction for the utilisation of this land here. It is a five to 10 and beyond, and how are we 
<br/>going to utilise this land. It has not been an easy exercise. The challenges within the </span><span>vanua</span><span> with the 
<br/>conflicts of who owns it and who should use it. This is something that we are facing right now, but 
<br/>really the way forward is advocacy and the ability of the committee or the team that is leading the 
<br/></span><span>vanua </span><span>to be able to explain very clearly on what the land is meant for, and what it should be used for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  saw  the  opportunity  when  we  acquired  this  piece  of  land.  It  was  an 
<br/>investment  forward,  an  investment  for  the  next  generation,  and  above  all,  the  realisation  and  the 
<br/>confidence that we now own the land, we must now use the land to benefit us now and the generation 
<br/>to come. We have been fortunate that through the consultation with the Government agencies, in this 
<br/></span><span>particular case, the honourable Minister for Land, and the honourable Minister for Agriculture who 
<br/></span><span>have guided us all along in their support. This 1,184 acres of land in Bua of four blocks, we will be 
<br/>signing an MOU soon with the honourable Minister for Agriculture to improve some of the roads 
<br/>and a demonstration farm. We have also completed a land assessment with the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Lands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the baseline that we should start off.  I wish I had more time to tell 
<br/>our story, but at this point in time, we have realised that the key to our success in our venture forward 
<br/>and beyond is based on four key areas. The first one, is really on good leadership, that is given two 
<br/>good plans. Three, </span><span>duavata, veiwekani vinaka</span><span> and </span><span>cakacaka vata </span><span>brings </span><span>duavata</span><span> or unity. Four, a 
<br/>continuous consultation and support from the Government and the other key stakeholders.  I once 
<br/>again thank the Government, and this is one of the most useful projects that Government has done 
<br/>that will benefit our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, honourable Naivalurua has taken a very huge, in 
<br/>fact, it is a giant step to help his own </span><span>vanua</span><span>, his </span><span>yavusa. </span><span>At one time, the chiefly family were closely 
<br/>shutting off people to use that particular land that was bought for the whole tribe. I am so glad and 
<br/>happy that honourable Naivalurua has decided to shift his base from Sawani back to his village. He 
<br/></span><span>has done very well, and I must applaud him for that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we will now adjourn for lunch and we will resume when the bell is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sounded.

<div><span>Strategic Vision and Progress Towards Enhancing Access to Justice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, </span><span>na gone Turaga na Tui Cakau</span><span>, the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, </span><span>kemuni na gone 
<br/>mai Rewa</span><span>, </span><span>qasenivuli</span><span>, and members of this great country who are listening in at this moment, before 
<br/>I begin, Sir, allow me to respond to the issue raised by honourable Kirpal, and I will do so by referring 
<br/></span><span>to a speech made by His Excellency at the International Labour Conference in Geneva in June of last 
<br/></span><span>year. This what he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “…in  line  with  Fiji  Government  and  Cabinet  decision  to  cede  to  the  United  Nations 
<br/>Declaration  on  the  Rights  of  Indigenous  People  (UNRIP)”  and  President  Katonivere 
<br/>highlighted  in  this  summit,  “provides  an  opportunity  to  inform  the  interest  of  the 
<br/>community, that Fiji's has taken the important step of supporting UNRIP.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He goes further to say, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…we  join  the  international  community  in  affirming  the  fullest  expression  of 
<br/>Indigenous  people’s  aspirations.  Fiji’s  support  to  UNDP  is  complementary  to  its 
<br/>commitment to ILO Convention 169 which ratified in 1998. As a nation we will continue 
<br/>to ensure that the Rights of Indigenous People are safeguards and protected.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one has to ask a very important question, how did the landowners first lose 
<br/>their land?  A good example is none other than Suva City, as I understand there was a case in the 
<br/>Lautoka  High  Court,  they  lost  out,  High  Court,  Court  of  Appeal  because  of  time,  records.  I  do 
<br/></span><span>understand they were only paid annuity, a small amount and that is what the people of Suvavou are 
<br/></span><span>still begging for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Buy-Back Scheme is a Social Justice Programme for the </span><span>itaukei</span><span>. I was in Koro recently, 
<br/>there are freehold land on Koro Island. One has to ask how can there be freehold land on the island? 
<br/>I have a file of Mudu Village, Koro, who are asking for land, 500 acres they only have 200 acres and 
<br/>the numbers keep on growing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this government is committed to the principle of restoration. I did say this 
<br/>in my very first speech here. For my fellow Parliamentarians, I cannot explain how it touches our 
<br/>heart when we talk about land, land lost, dubious means, fraudulent means an outright illegal. Our 
<br/>forefathers did not have any means to reclaim that land, but this scheme is a Buy-Back, it gives a 
<br/>small satisfaction to the members of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> who have lost land and that does not stop the other 
<br/>ethnic groups from purchasing land through lease, outright freehold, or even if you want to rent. But 
<br/></span><span>for the owners of land, as honourable Naivalurua articulated, they have taken steps to be developed,

<div><span>2149 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  this  is  the  legacy  of  this  very  government  -  a  government  that  cares  and  a  government  that 
<br/>delivers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Yesterday, I was in a funeral, head of my </span><span>mataqali </span><span>said, so, when are 
<br/>we going to get this thing back and he said, it takes time. What I am saying is, the government is not 
<br/>going to willy-nilly deal with the rights of the </span><span>itaukei</span><span>, it is going to follow the proper channel of law 
<br/>by due process  and of course consultation.  That  is  the point Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want  to  stress  in 
<br/>relation to honourable Sanjay Kirpal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No shortcut! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- No shortcut! James 4:10 and I quote, “</span><span>Humble yourselves in the sight 
<br/>of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.”  </span><span>Honour, get down on your knees before the master, that is the 
<br/>only way out, you will get on your feet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  speak  on  the  Ministry  of  Justice’s  strategic  vision  and  progress 
<br/>towards enhancing access to justice and public service delivery in Fiji.  It is with great honour and 
<br/>responsibility that I address this august Parliament today. The Ministry of Justice remains steadfast 
<br/>in its mission to uphold justice, integrity and accountability, reflecting our unwavering commitment 
<br/>to rule of law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over  the  past  months  our  accomplishments  have  been  more  than  mere  milestones.  This 
<br/>signifies our relentless pursuit of excellence in the public service. Every initiative we undertake is 
<br/>grounded in our dedication to serving the people of Fiji and fostering a society where justice prevails. 
<br/>The ministry stands as a pillar of democracy and a beacon of hope in public governance guided by 
<br/>strategic visions that aligns the aspirations of our citizens within imperatives of justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have made significant strides through carefully planned initiatives that you flag both the 
<br/>commitment to operational excellence and our ability to adapt to the evolving need of our society. 
<br/>Our ongoing reforms in process and systems coupled with the active engagement of our staff, ensure 
<br/>that we continue to meet the demands of the public and uphold the highest standards of services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most pivotal undertaking of the ministry has been the comprehensive socialisation 
<br/></span><span>of this 5 Years Strategic Development Plan for 2025-2029. This plan is not a mere document, it is a 
<br/>strategic framework that charters the course of our future endeavours, outlining our aspirations and 
<br/>how we intend to achieve them. Aligned with the National Development Plan for 2025-2029, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Justice  will  continue  to  promote  justice  and  inclusive  societies  for  sustainable 
<br/>development,  provide  access  to  justice  for  all  and  build  effective,  accountable  and  inclusive 
<br/>institutions at all levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SDP has been meticulously disseminated to all registry centres across Fiji, ensuring that 
<br/>every  member  of  our  staff  is  aligned  with  the  Ministry’s  new  mission,  vision  and  values.  The 
<br/>socialisation process is a transformative journey that seeks to embed the principles of excellence, 
<br/>innovation, and accountability within the very fabric of our Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By engaging our 164 member staff nationwide in this process, including the six additional 
<br/></span><span>staff who joined on 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2024, we ensure that our strategic objectives are not only understood 
<br/></span><span>but are embedded and actively pursued at every level. This alignment is critical as it empowers our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="30">Page 30</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>staff to contribute meaningfully to our overarching goals, thereby enhancing the quality of service 
<br/>we provide to the public. The Strategic Development Plan serves a compass that guides our actions 
<br/>and decisions, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and excellence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  stipulated  in  the  Ministry’s  Strategic  Development  Plan–Strategy  3:  Customer 
<br/>Empowered Services – The Ministry engages its customers for long-term marketplace success. This 
<br/>engagement strategy includes how the Ministry listens to the voice of our customers, builds customer 
<br/>relationships, and uses customer information to improve and identify opportunities for innovation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry profoundly values the importance of being a good listener to our customers. 
<br/>The diversity of views, either positive or adverse are considered as a vehicle of change and a direct 
<br/>contributor  to  business  excellence  either  from  customer  services  standpoint  or  capacity  as  an 
<br/>organisation to operate within the excellence mechanisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry uses the following customer mechanisms to listen to the voice of the customer: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>email feedback; 
<br/>feedback forms; 
<br/></span><span>formal and informal correspondences; 
<br/></span><span>telephone; 
<br/>field reports; and 
<br/>customer referral mechanisms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  mechanisms  have  enabled  the  Ministry  to  innovate  and  creatively  enhance  our 
<br/>customer support, fostering loyalty and trust. By cultivating a customer-centric mindset within our 
<br/>workforce and deepening our understanding of customer behaviour, we have been able to improve 
<br/>the  services  we  provide  while  promoting  a  culture  of  knowledge-sharing  and  continuous 
<br/>improvement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  shifted  its  focus  to  a  customer-oriented  approach,  prioritising  the 
<br/>development of strong customer relationships. This shift has empowered our workforce to a better 
<br/>segment and to understand our customer needs. Our commitment to this approach is evident in the 
<br/>outreach  programmes,  where  we  actively  bring  our  services  to  the  people,  ensuring  greater 
<br/>accessibility and engagement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has extended its services to the public through the registration of Births, Deaths, 
<br/></span><span>Marriages, as well as Registration of Companies, conducted by district staff. Many individuals in 
<br/></span><span>remote maritime islands have not been registered, leading to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>children attending school without birth certificates; 
<br/>couples living together without being officially married; 
<br/>lack of death certificates for those who have passed away; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>other services of the Ministry can facilitate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In doing so, the Ministry has identified its customers through: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>customer segmentation; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>product offerings and customer support; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>building customer relationships; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complaint management.

<div><span>2151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with our long-term strategic vision, the Ministry has developed an 
<br/>improvement planning process that transforms our priorities into actionable steps and measurable 
<br/>outcomes.  This  detailed  blueprint  guides  daily  operations,  ensuring  alignment  with  our  goals  by 
<br/>involving input from all levels of the organisation. The process promotes coherence and consistency, 
<br/>driving performance and fostering a results-oriented culture. Through this alignment, staff can focus 
<br/>on achieving clear objectives, enhancing efficiency, ownership, and accountability in their efforts to 
<br/>deliver excellence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reflecting on a comprehensive record of our achievements, challenges and learnings over the 
<br/>years, it provides a transparent and detailed account of our performance, highlighting key milestones 
<br/>and  areas  for  improvement.  This  serves  as  both  a  testament  to  our  progress  and  a  foundation  for 
<br/>future improvement. The progress of the Ministry is very critical for accountability ensuring that we 
<br/>remain transparent and answerable to the people we serve. We have begun our journey capturing the 
<br/>essence of our efforts and the impact of our initiatives. It provides valuable insights and informs our 
<br/>strategies  and  guides  our  future  endeavours.  By  reflecting  on  the  past,  we  can  learn  from  our 
<br/>experience and build on our successes as we continue to improve and evolve as an organisation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A pivotal aspect of our strategic and  operational planning is the formulation of the costed 
<br/></span><span>Operational Plan. This plans aligns the financial requirements and allocations necessary to achieve 
<br/></span><span>our strategic objectives, ensures that our resources are utilised efficiently and effectively, maximising 
<br/>the impact of our initiatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  costed  Operation  Plan  is  an  essential  tool  for  physical  responsibility  and  strategic 
<br/>resource management enabling us to deliver our commitments while maintaining financial stability. 
<br/>The formation of the costed Operation Plan was a vigorous process that involves detailed analysis 
<br/>and careful planning. To ensure that every dollar is spent wisely, supporting initiatives that drive our 
<br/>mission  forward.  This  plan  not  only  provides  a  financial  road  map  but  also  serves  as  a  tool  for 
<br/>monitoring and evaluating our progress, ensuring that we remain on track to achieve our goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Justice is deeply committed to making justice accessible to all Fijians through 
<br/>our extensive outreach program. These initiatives are a crucial part of our mission, as we strive to 
<br/>bring essential services directly to communities across Fiji. Our outreach includes a range of services 
<br/>such  as  registry  of  births,  deaths,  marriages,  register  of  titles,  official  receiver  and  register  of 
<br/>companies.  From  August  13</span><span>th</span><span>  to  18</span><span>th</span><span>,  2024,  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  collaboration  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Justice, conducted an outreach programme in Yasayasa Moala.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This programme provided the village of Totoya, Matuku and Moala with guidance support 
<br/></span><span>on  obtaining  vital  documents.  During  this  period,  officials  and  staff  from  the  births,  deaths  and 
<br/>marriage registry officiated four court marriages, three in Yaroi, Matuku and on a vessel travelling 
<br/>from Lomati to Yaroi due to the inability of officials being able to travel to Lomati to conduct the 
<br/>court  marriage.  The  outreach  efforts  in  Yasayasa  Moala  yielded  impressive  results.  7  late  birth 
<br/>registrations, 27 business registrations, 14 new birth registrations and 42 birth certificate renewals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building on this success, the Ministry of Justice organised a ministerial tour to Koro Island 
<br/>from September 10</span><span>th</span><span> to the 13</span><span>th</span><span>, 2024. The purpose of the tour was to bring our services closer to the 
<br/>people,  strengthening  their  trust  and  confidence  in  the  justice  system.  As  part  of  this  effort,  in 
<br/>partnership with Post Fiji Ltd, we opened the Births, Deaths and Marriage Registry Office at the Post 
<br/>Office in Koro Island. Accompanied by representatives from eight Government Ministries and 13 
<br/>stakeholders, I visited five villages namely, Nasau, Nabuna, Nakodu, Nacamaki and Navaga, along 
<br/>with key institutions including the Nasau Post office, Koro High School, the District Commissioners 
<br/></span><span>Office, the Nasau Agriculture Station and the Nasau Health Centre and various nursing stations. The 
<br/></span><span>tour was an astounding success with the people of Koro warmly welcoming the services provided.

<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  each  village,  residents  eagerly  learnt  to  access  services  from  BDM  Officers  and  FNPF 
<br/>Staff,  who  printed  ID  Cards  and  checked  members  account  balances.  Many  villagers,  especially 
<br/>women, seized the opportunity to register their business and apply for grants offered by the Ministry 
<br/>of Women, Children and Social Protection. The engagement and enthusiasm from the community 
<br/>underscored the positive impact of bringing this vital service directly to the people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From 25</span><span>th</span><span> September to 29</span><span>th</span><span> September, I, along with senior members of the Justice Ministry 
<br/>visited  Ovalau  to  engage  with  communities  and  provide  direct  assistance.  Accompanied  by  a 
<br/>representative from the Registrar of Companies and the Ministry’s executive team, we visited Tokou, 
<br/>Voma, Nauouo, Waitovu and market vendors along the Levuka corridor. The primary focus was to 
<br/>facilitate registrations of businesses, births,  deaths and marriages services. This  initiative sparked 
<br/>great  interest  with  many  residents  registering  small  businesses  including  canteens,  farms,  food 
<br/>services and handicraft centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 253 new businesses were successfully registered in Levuka, and 
<br/>as  of  today,  253  businesses  have  been  approved.  The  Ministry  is  extending  its  outreach  to  other 
<br/>villages,  including  Bureta,  Lovoni,  Taviya,  Arovudi  and  Rukuruku  from  this  Friday  into  this 
<br/>weekend.  Many  residents  were  unaware  of  the  need  to  register  their  businesses  until  they  sought 
<br/></span><span>Government aid, where registration was required. To assist these new business owners, the team is 
<br/></span><span>providing  guidance  on  online  business  registration  and  applying  for  the  business  grant  from  the 
<br/>Ministry of Trade and Commerce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  coming  months,  additional  registry  offices  will  be  established  in  Qarani  on  Gau, 
<br/>Keiyasi Village in Nadroga/Navosa, Rotuma, Ba and Kadavu.  This effort reflects our commitment 
<br/>to embodying the principle of “no one should be left behind”, ensuring that even the most remote 
<br/>communities receive the support they need.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in light of the celebration of Fiji Day, 
<br/>a team will be also going to Vanua Levu, soon after the official function, we will be engaged in Bua 
<br/>for two days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our commitment to ensuring that justice is right for all Fijians, not just a privilege for a select 
<br/>few, is unwavering. I would like to recognise the previous Government’s efforts in establishing BDM 
<br/>in  Savusavu,  Nabouwalu  and  Korovou,  which  made  these  essential  services  more  accessible. 
<br/>Additionally, in partnership with Post Fiji, we have expanded BDM services to 20 post offices across 
<br/>the country, further enhancing access to all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, investing in human capital is essential to the Ministry’s success. Over the 
<br/></span><span>past months, we have launched comprehensive Leadership and Customer Service Training programs, 
<br/></span><span>aimed at enhancing our staff’s skills and competencies.  These initiatives are central to cultivating a 
<br/>culture of leadership, professionalism and excellence within the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  introduction  of  improvement  systems  has  significantly  streamlined  our  operations, 
<br/>boosting  efficiency  and  service  delivery.    In  July,  we  conducted  a  two-day  inhouse  training  on 
<br/>Leadership Training for our team leaders emphasising the internal procedures and the roles of each 
<br/>officer. This training is part of our ongoing effort to position ourselves as premier ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  several  team  leaders  visited  the  Fiji  Airways  Headquarters  in  Nadi  to  gain 
<br/>valuable  insight  into  customer  service  excellence,  particularly  focusing  on  benchmarking  and  the 
<br/>concept  of  self-reflection  to  drive  internal  improvements.    I  also  met  with  the  Acting  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  of  Justice,  the  Director  of  Corporate  Services  and  all  heads  of  Registries  to  address 
<br/>challenges and discuss necessary improvements to facilitate public service delivery across Fiji. By 
<br/></span><span>equipping our staff with the necessary tools and training, we ensure that they are well prepared to 
<br/></span><span>meet the demands of their roles and deliver exceptional service to the public.

<div><span> Ministerial Statements  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight the significant milestone through the collaboration 
<br/>between  the  Ministry  of  Justice  and  iTaukei  Affairs,  aimed  at  enhancing  the  </span><span>Vola  ni  Kawa  Bula 
<br/></span><span>(VKB) system. This partnership underscores our commitment to making Government services more 
<br/>accessible  while  preserving  traditional  governance  systems.  The  VKB  is  crucial  for  the  iTaukei 
<br/>people as it serves as a living document that records ancestral lineages and family roots. However, 
<br/>challenges have arisen, particularly with the timely updating of birth and death records, leading to 
<br/>disputes over land ownership and chief appointments.  I am excited to announce that the VKB as a 
<br/>pilot project had commenced, with the officers from VKB based at the Ministry for Justice for one 
<br/>month and to  report to  the two consultants who  are  currently undergoing the review of the  VKB 
<br/>system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is an honour for the opportunity to speak on the Ministry of Justice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Members  of  Parliament,  fellow  citizens.  While  the 
<br/>honourable Minister’s words attempt to portray a story of success, the reality faced by the people of 
<br/>Fiji  tells  a  very  different  tale.  The  Minister  boasts  about  progress  and  achievements,  yet  the 
<br/>experiences of ordinary Fijians, those who must navigate a complex and often inaccessible justice 
<br/>system remain plagued by delays, bureaucracy and lack of support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  The  Ministry  speaks  of  enhancing  access  to  justice,  but  I  ask  the 
<br/>honourable Minister where is the access when people’s cases are backlogged for many years and 
<br/>victims of injustice are left in the dark without resolution to answers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  so-called  strategic  vision  is  nothing  but  hollow  words  when  it lacks 
<br/>tangible outcomes. The people of Fiji have had grand promises time and time again even during the 
<br/>2022 General Election, but promises do not pay for legal fees, nor do they shorten the wait times for 
<br/>hearings  and  judgements.  The  Ministry  must  address  the  serious  challenges  of  delayed  court 
<br/>proceedings, lack of legal aid for vulnerable groups and overwhelming complexities for our judicial 
<br/>purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  find  it  disingenuous  for  the  honourable  Minister  to  speak  of  the 
<br/>Ministry’s progress and strategic vision when the same honourable Minister remains silent during 
<br/>the  recent  debate  of  the  reintroduction  of  the  death  penalty.  When  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Women made a shocking statement calling for the death penalty for drug traffickers, where was the 
<br/></span><span>voice of the honourable Minister for Justice? How can the Ministry claim to be a Ministry for Justice, 
<br/></span><span>when  it  fails  to  speak  up  on  fundamental  human  rights?  Silence  on  such  critical  issues  speaks 
<br/>volumes. It suggests a lack… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir. Point of Order!  I think the honourable Member 
<br/>should  stick  to  the  topic.  Standing  Order  60  and  stop  meandering.  He  needs  to  stop  misleading 
<br/>Parliament, there has been no debate in Parliament on this issue, and no introduction of it, and he 
<br/>needs  to  be  factual  about  it  when  he  is  presenting  on  it. Stick  to  the  relevance  of  the  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Thank  you.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Silence  on  such  a  critical  issues  speaks 
<br/>volumes.  It  suggests  a  lack  of  true  commitment  to  justice,  fairness  and  the  protection  of  rights 
<br/></span><span>enshrined in the 2013 Constitution. To the honourable Minister for Justice, it is your duty not just to 
<br/></span><span>promote policies and strategies, but to ensure that the Government and its independent institutions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>uphold the 2013 Constitution, the very foundation of our democracy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Constitution guarantees the rights and freedoms of every Fijian, and it 
<br/>is the responsibility of the Ministry to protect these rights without compromise. This is not just a 
<br/>legal obligation, but a moral one. If we are to build a justice system that is truly accessible, efficient 
<br/>and equitable, we need more than words, we need genuine reform, especially your service delivery.  
<br/>Honourable Kirpal was not wrong, he was right! Especially about Fijians who do not own land. You 
<br/>need to improve your service delivery and perform well, honourable Minister. While the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Justice may seek to reassure us with grand statements and statistics, the Opposition will 
<br/>continue to hold this Government to account. We will ensure that the voices of ordinary Fijians are 
<br/>heard, and that the justice system serves them, not just the privileged few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also attended the launch of the Sexual Orientation Gender Identity, Gender 
<br/>Expression and Sex Characteristics Handbook, which was funded by the UK Government, and there 
<br/>are  various  case  studies  of  injustices  against  fellow  Fijians  which  are  shocking.  I  invite  the 
<br/>honourable Minister to read this book to gain more knowledge of the issues facing our vulnerable in 
<br/>our society. At the same time, we have the NDP. If the honourable Minister would go to sub-chapter 
<br/>8.1, there is more to talk about injustice in the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I take my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must humbly request all honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament to show our unwavering support for the poppy appeal in honour of our brave Military 
<br/>Forces. Let us not also forget the importance of Pinktober, as we stand in solidarity with our cancer 
<br/>survivors and advocate for the health and well-being of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now give the floor to the leader of the G9-Bloc or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Justice for 
<br/>the Ministerial Statement. It was very informative, highlighting the progress that the ministry has 
<br/>done so far in enhancing its service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  if  the  honourable  Ketan  Lal  was  listening  to  the  last  ministerial  statement  by  the 
<br/>Minister for Justice, he had touched about the backlog in court cases. So, the focus on the ministerial 
<br/>statement today was on the birth, deaths and marriages (BDM) and also other services that have been 
<br/>taken to the maritime areas and also in conjunction with the REACH Programme with Ministry of 
<br/>Education where we saw some new couples had their wedding on the government vessel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable minster for the service delivery done so far and we hope to move to 
<br/></span><span>other parts, Vanua Levu, I think the honourable Minister should not forget Vanua Levu if not we will 
<br/>have to return all the </span><span>‘</span><span>kai Vanualevu’ in Viti Levu. There is also a call from the Honourable Naupoto 
<br/>and the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources, not to forget Vanua Balavu and other parts of 
<br/>Lau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very important issue that you have raised, that is for the Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) officer 
<br/>that is now attached with the consultant at the Ministry of Justice given that we were moving around 
<br/>with this Child Justice Bill and Child Care and Protection Bill, and that is one of the things that came 
<br/>up. Given that most of our villagers do not register their children in the VKB</span><span> </span><span>and they are denied 
<br/>their fair share of lease money too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given  if  this  service  delivery  is  enhanced  because  one  of  the  requirements  is  the  birth 
<br/>certificate, and also when you come to elections too, some people do not go to vote because they do 
<br/></span><span>not have a voter card because they do not have a birth certificate. In some cases, some school students 
<br/></span><span>do not have birth certificates and they find it very hard to go for enrolment to go to schools. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2155 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  in  one  of  our  consultations,  we  found  out,  and  probably  just  another  suggestion 
<br/>honourable Minister to add on to enhancing the services, that is to have a system that connects the 
<br/>Ministry of Health when a baby is delivered and at that same time it hits that system for registration 
<br/>of  birth  certificates.  That  also  allows  the  mother  and  the  child  for  other  grant  services  that  are 
<br/>available for newborn.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A system that should allow that particularly child to be registered automatically in the VKB</span><span>
<br/></span><span>through the system. This could be something that could improve the system as we move on, thank 
<br/>you very much honourable Minister for the service delivery that was done so far to reach out to the 
<br/>maritime areas and to the interior parts of Fiji, where most of the people when they go out, they want 
<br/>these services to come to their doorsteps. Because they have to pay transportation fees and also bus 
<br/>fares to come to areas, even have to by boats to come to Viti Levu, Suva and taking these services to 
<br/>their doorsteps will really help them a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank the Coalition Government for bringing these services and taking it to another level 
<br/>where the FijiFirst Government had reached, we have taken it to another level. Vinaka, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Interesting, thank you so much for the comments and now we will move 
<br/>on  honourable  Members.  What  has  been  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Justice  is 
<br/>something that we should seriously take note of and that is the VKB,</span><span> </span><span>reviewing it, and there is a need 
<br/>for the Minister of i-Taukei Affairs to see how best to take into account, those who have blood ties 
<br/>et cetera. Especially with our vasu’s and those that are part European. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.
