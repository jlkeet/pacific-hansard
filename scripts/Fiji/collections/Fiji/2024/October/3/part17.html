<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, you would have heard me in this House 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>talks about developing comprehensive ecosystem for micro, small and medium enterprises in Fiji. 
<br/>This Bill is another step in that direction.  Be assured, Sir, and honourable Members of this august 
<br/>House that we are not taking the use of Standing Order 51 lightly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are recommending its use in this exceptional case due to the following reasons. We have 
<br/>had several nationwide consultations which was conducted from 5</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2024 to 16th February, 
<br/>2024, and we have received overwhelming support from the public and the MSMEs to expedite this 
<br/>Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are addressing something that your government never 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>addressed - access to finance. You should be ashamed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  all  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  access  to  finance  remains  the  biggest  challenge  for 
<br/>businesses, particularly MSMEs and as I have said, that side of the House did nothing.  They were 
<br/>sleeping on the job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Microwaving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The Bill aims to bridge the gap and unlock private sector 
<br/>investment into businesses in a systematic and secure manner.  The Bill has been drafted by legal 
<br/>experts from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and vetted by the Office of the Solicitor-General.  
<br/>This is also a joint reform output of the ADB and the World Bank Policy action items that unlocks 
<br/>budgetary support, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am told this important Bill (wait for it) has been stalling the 
<br/>last seven years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have brought this into the august House in August after a year of its inception. Therefore, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  the  nation,  particularly  the  MSMEs  of  our  country  and  aspiring  entrepreneurs,  are 
<br/>eagerly awaiting this Bill and I have to say, deserve this Bill.  We are not saying for us to expedite 
<br/>and pass the Bill within the same week, or the same day but like that side of the House, Sir, we are 
<br/>saying, bring it at the next Parliament session for debate.  That gives the Committee approximately 
<br/>six to eight weeks to conduct their work and review the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As usual, Sir, the Ministry offers any support required to the Committee to help them in their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work, analysing the Bill and, of course, should they require to conduct their own consultations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  At 
<br/>the end of the debate, we will have the right of reply from the mover. This is to do with Standing 
<br/>Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have to try and catch my attention, make me look towards you and then understand that 
<br/>you want to ask a question, you want to stand up and speak, otherwise I will just concentrate like this 
<br/>and when I look back, no one is standing so that is it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, .. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He should  be given some coaching from the front bench.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I thank you for the opportunity and apologise for not catching your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>eye earlier, Sir, I was looking at the Deputy Prime Minister.

<div><span>Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I appreciate the purpose of the Bill to do something about financing for Micro, Small and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). I think it is critical, it is a move in the same direction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  point  I  wanted  to  make,  Sir,  when  you  talked  about  the  consultations;  extensive 
<br/>consultations have been done by bureaucrats with people in Fiji, consultation in this House is by the 
<br/>representative of people.  That is why we always need adequate time, that is the point.  We do not 
<br/>have any argument with the purpose of the Bill. So, when you say, “oh, we have already done this 
<br/>consultation.” </span><span>Me cava</span><span>, is that enough?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultation here is by the representatives of people. You need to make sure of that - consult 
<br/>well, give us enough time so we can deliberate. That is the main purpose of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That 
<br/>is all I want to say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am glad that they are doing Standing Order 51.  They are finally beginning to see the light, 
<br/>they are beginning to change because before, when they were on this side of the House, they were so 
<br/>anti-Standing Order 51 and now they are doing it. People used to say, “you are a hypocrite.”  No, we 
<br/></span><span>were not hypocrites, we never argued against it. The people sitting next to them were the ones who 
<br/></span><span>argued, and the people sitting in front of them.   That is the point I wanted to make, Sir. Consultation 
<br/>is required by the representatives of people and that is who we are in this Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  we  have  been  given  ample  time  here.    It  is  not  like  the  straight 
<br/>Standing Order 51 that we used to encounter. But now it is Standing Order 51, and it is being referred 
<br/>to the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- My contribution is probably about 60 seconds, Sir. I am very happy that 
<br/>this is now on the floor of Parliament, and it is actually going to the Committee to get done. I just 
<br/>wanted to correct, the honourable Minister, Sir.  He said it was seven years in the making, but guess 
<br/>what?  Seven years in the making started by us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I really do not have much to say other than the 
<br/>MSMEs and the young men and women entrepreneurs of this country deserve this. We have tried to 
<br/>be both, pragmatic but also expedient, and that is why we approached it the way we have approached 
<br/>it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you have correctly pointed out, Sir, we are not using Standing Order 51, like the other side 
<br/></span><span>of the House used to, like instant coffee making legislation - tabled in one day and legislate law the 
<br/>next day.  As we have said, this side of the House is doing things differently and actually elevating 
<br/>the standards of law making in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 (Bill No. 18/2024) moved under Standing Order 51 is 
<br/>committed to the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs and to report back to Parliament 
<br/>at its next sitting.]
