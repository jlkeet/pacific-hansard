<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>watching the proceedings on television and the internet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 6 Students &amp; Teachers – St. Joseph the Worker Primary School 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Year 6 Students and Teachers of St. 
<br/>Joseph the Worker Primary School. Welcome to your Parliament, children, and I hope that you will 
<br/>learn something from the workings of your Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Planned Water Cuts – Suva/Nausori Areas 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On an OHS matter, honourable members, I have been advised that the planned water cut for 
<br/>the Nausori/Suva areas will commence from midnight tonight. The Parliamentary complex will also 
<br/>be affected, and whilst there will be a standby water truck here in Parliament, this will not be enough 
<br/>to ensure full hygiene standards for the Parliamentary complex.  I have perused tomorrow’s Order 
<br/>Paper and I can gather that the only urgent business is the Bill from the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/>That is the only urgent matter that is at hand from the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If honourable Members are in agreement to stand down tomorrow’s proceedings, but bring 
<br/>forward  the  honourable  Prime  Minister’s  Bill  today,  that  would  be  very  good.  Are  there  any 
<br/>objections, honourable members?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can see that some are still chatting there. Are we in agreement there, honourable Leader of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>the Opposition?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.– It is alright, Sir, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Finally, honourable Members, please, kindly take that Items 4 and 5 on 
<br/>today’s  Order  Paper  will  be  deferred  to  a  later  special  sitting  of  Parliament  which  would  be 
<br/>communicated in due course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, honourable Members, and we will now proceed to Item 6 on the Order Paper. 
<br/>There is so many rumblings going on, I really do not understand. Are we together in all this and the 
<br/>way  we  are  moving?    Honourable  Maharaj,  you  and  honourable  Bala  seem  to  be  engaged  in  a 
<br/>conversation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.– All good, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you.
