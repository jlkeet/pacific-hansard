<div><span>MOU - NZYWAM and Ministry of Health 
<br/>(Question No. 215/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span><span>the Memorandum of Understanding between the Youth with a Mission (YWAM) New 
<br/></span><span>Zealand and the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member, 
<br/>for his question. In terms of the MOU between the Ministry of Health and Youth With A Mission 
<br/>(YWAM). The signing of the two parties was endorsed by Cabinet on 7</span><span>th</span><span> of August and Friday 4</span><span>th</span><span> of 
<br/>August consecutively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the MOU itself, the MOU allows for the partnership between YWAM and the 
<br/>Ministry of Health to assist the Ministry in terms of service delivery and in reaching universal health 
<br/>coverage to our hard-to-reach populations within Fiji, mostly in the rural and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU is a 10-year MOU in which the agreement allows for volunteers under the YWAM 
<br/>to come over to Fiji and work in this space of primary healthcare settings within our maritime and 
<br/></span><span>rural areas which is accessible by boat. They come in their ship and assist the Ministry in those areas 
<br/></span><span>as it is in terms of work that they are doing, not only in terms of primary healthcare but also in terms 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of awareness, screening, dental, which I am sure the honourable Member is well aware of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, this partnership is for 10 years and what we have noticed that even though 
<br/>they are cutting on yearly basis. This partnership moving forward, we will have to come up with 
<br/>ideas on how to streamline some of the processes that are involved in registration, in issues such as 
<br/>procurement and customs as well. So, we are grateful for the ongoing partnership. It started from the 
<br/>previous government until now, and the Ministry is ensuring that we will continue with this because 
<br/>they are assisting us in a very critical space, the primary healthcare especially in the maritime island 
<br/>areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell it is a 10-year MOU and I will be willing to answer any more questions based 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>particular things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, last month, the shippers in the Yasawa Group 
<br/>saw over 2,400 patients who needed dental, general health checkup, nutrition, health education and 
<br/>optometry,  on  the  boat  and  they  gave  out  reading  glasses.  Because  it  is  a  boat,  it  only  serve  the 
<br/>maritime island. Over the last three years they have seen over 11,000 Fijians in the maritime zone.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The supplementary question to the honourable Minister, would he consider the waiver of the 
<br/></span><span>temporary registration licence that the doctors, nurses, dentists that are on this boat need to pay with 
<br/>the Fiji Medical and Dental Council, since they are providing free service benefitting our people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, I thank, honourable Ravunawa for 
<br/>his  supplementary  question.  Yes,  that  is  something  we  will  consider,  seeing  that  it  is  a  10  year 
<br/>agreement and an agreement of understanding. Also, most of the visiting teams are the same ones 
<br/>that are coming in and out on the same year. So, yes, we will take that into consideration and see how 
<br/>best we can assist them as they are assisting us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>St. Giles Psychiatric Hospital Facelift and Upgrade 
<br/>(Question No. 228/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.N. TUICOLO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the St. Giles Psychiatric Hospital facelift and upgrade?. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuicolo for 
<br/></span><span>his  question.  In  terms  of  the  update  to  Parliament  on  St.  Giles  Psychiatric  Hospital  facelift  and 
<br/>upgrade. Just by way of context, St. Giles hospital is one of the oldest hospitals in Fiji and has been 
<br/>in service since 1884. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  it  has  lived  through  many  climatic  and  operational  challenges  and  the  current 
<br/>infrastructure has undergone significant wear and tear over the years. With the increasing service 
<br/>demands, increasing number of patients of all ages are seen, treated, admitted and followed up at the 
<br/>hospital, it places a considerable demand on the infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Patients seen at that hospital range from acute, chronic psychiatric illness, substance abuse 
<br/>and forensic psychiatric cases. Any infrastructural works that have been done over the years was to 
<br/>cater for changing demand in patient demographics, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It has also been a tertiary care 
<br/>training hospital for many years through Fiji Medical School and now FNU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last two years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while working with our development partners and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through budgetary allocation, our health partners and development partners have come on board to 
<br/>assist us with the Women's Ward and the Moala Ward and the admin building which was renovated  
<br/>and now occupied.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another significant work that was completed involved the tarsealing of the roads and carpark 
<br/>inside the hospital premises which cost over $235,000. The road had not been repaired for a number 
<br/>of years causing not only discomfort to passengers and damages to the vehicles, but also to staff who 
<br/>work and live within the vicinity of St. Giles Hospital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this year, the Ministry constructed a new fence behind the Men's Ward costing around 
<br/>$13,000 to improve the security of the admission facility as was highlighted in the media, and in this 
<br/>financial year, the ministry has also allocated funding to the minor works allocation for further repair 
<br/>and renovation works at the hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, constant development and advancement of medicine worldwide, the ministry is 
<br/>approaching partner and donor organisation for the possibility of assisting towards the establishment 
<br/>of a new facility that will allow the hospital to venture into the latest treatment modalities, elevating 
<br/>mental health services in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  new  facility  will  allow  the  hospital  to  branch  out  into  the  fields  of 
<br/>addiction, psychiatry, child and adolescent psychiatry and old age psychiatry and to deliver speciality 
<br/>services such as group therapy, psychodrama, lithium level testing, recurrent transcranial magnetic 
<br/>stimulation,  electroconvulsive  therapy  (ECT)  as  it  commonly  known,  and  geropsychiatry.  Again, 
<br/>government remains committed to addressing mental health in the country and improving the mental 
<br/>health services to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, are we sufficiently equipped at St. Giles to take care 
<br/>of,  at  the  moment  whilst  the  upgrades  are  being  done  and  post  building  later  on  building  a  new 
<br/>facility,  are we sufficiently equipped at St. Giles to take care of the substance abuse patients?  I am 
<br/>talking about those that came out of prison or currently in and who are incarcerated and those that 
<br/>doctors find that are suffering from mental trauma and are substance abuse patients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when asked the same question 
<br/>to our technical people at St. Giles, the answer I got was yes, in terms of the capacity, yes,  and they 
<br/>are currently doing it right now. But in terms of the treatment afterwards on substance abuse, and 
<br/>how you deal with it afterwards, that is where the gaps still lies and that is where the government 
<br/></span><span>through the partnerships that I had mentioned, that we are approaching other development partners 
<br/></span><span>to assist us in this area on substance abuse and its treatment in the long term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, it is something that the ministry with our development partners are looking into, but 
<br/>in terms of your question, the capacity right now as it is, yes, to look after it in the acute phase and 
<br/>treat them accordingly. And also, available in our other hospitals in CWM and for areas which other 
<br/>NGOâ€™s assist us in this space, which receive grant through the Ministry of Health for some of their 
<br/>operational work they are also helping us in this area.  In a nutshell, yes, we have the capacity to deal 
<br/>with it now, but it is the long-term aspect of the treatment that is where they still get. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.â€“ </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span> Let me know for the supplementary questions, we will move on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the third Oral Question for today.  I now call on honourable Ketan Lal to ask his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.â€“ Then that question lapses now, so we will move to the fourth Oral Question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>2158 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for today.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dental Prosthetic Services - Nakasi Health Centre 
<br/>(Question No. 248/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the status of the Dental Prosthetic Services at Nakasi Health Centre? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  I  thank  the  honorable 
<br/>Ravunawa for his question. In terms of the Dental Prosthetic Unit that is currently under the CWM 
<br/>Hospital but is operational in Nakasi Health Centre, that was an arrangement made by the previous 
<br/>Administration, due to the fact that there was an issue with the space within the Dental Department 
<br/>here at CWM.  It was just for a temporary measure until space can be identified and then move back 
<br/>into CWM Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As it is, there are a few options that are available that the Ministry is looking into on how to 
<br/></span><span>bring back the prosthetic services back to CWM. Option one right now is the School of Dentistry and 
<br/></span><span>Oral Health, under FNU for the JB Savou Dental Clinic adjacent the CWM Dental waiting room is 
<br/>currently being used by clinical studies and to be used by the prosthetic team, that is one option. And 
<br/>the other option is for the occupation of the former FNBC office, as dental officers and dental staff 
<br/>interim with current office and staff, to be refurbished as a prosthetic clinic and prosthetic lab.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As it is, the ministry is also looking into the decentralising this service into the subdivisional 
<br/>hospitals, Savusavu in particular, we have talked with the dental officers there, and they are very 
<br/>skilled in doing dental prosthetic services, but it is just the space that they need to be working into. 
<br/>It should be made conducive to the environment in which they work in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nevertheless, as I have mentioned the move from CWM to Nakasi was a temporary measure, 
<br/>and they are still there, and the ministry is trying its best to relocate them back to CWM because it is 
<br/>Central. It is the only one available, I believe for the central and eastern division. And yes, in terms 
<br/>of plans for the future we will relocate them because it was a temporary measure in the initial stages. 
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 249/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on the outcomes of the recent Second Asia Pacific Ministerial 
<br/>Conference on Civil Aviation and the Delhi Declaration? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vanawalu for the question. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I led the Fiji delegation to the recent 2</span><span>nd</span><span> Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on 
<br/>Civil Aviation held in New Delhi, India on the 11</span><span>th</span><span> and 12</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024. The Conference was 
<br/>hosted by the Government of India, as always, the arrangements were for the Fiji team was superb. I 
<br/>say always, as from experience, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when a Fijian is hosted by the Indian Government, 
<br/>hospitality goes up, another notch, I have experienced this Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2159 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to thank our High Commissioner to India, His Excellency Mr. Jagnnath Sami, and 
<br/>his dear wife, Kancha, for supporting the Fiji delegation and likewise, Counsellor Nilesh Kumar. The 
<br/>Conference was a pivotal event for the region, addressing the evolving challenges in civil aviation 
<br/>and  setting  a  collective  vision  for  the  future  through  the  adoption  of  the  Delhi  Declaration.  The 
<br/>Conference was chaired by honourable Ram Mohan Naidu, Minister for Civil Aviation for India. I 
<br/>was privileged and honored to be elected as a Deputy Chairperson. This position not only highlights 
<br/>Fijiâ€™s leadership and commitment to the civil aviation sector, but also ensures that we have a direct 
<br/>influence in shaping the region's aviation policies moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 1</span><span>st</span><span> Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation took place in Beijing, China in 
<br/>2018. The Conference resulted in the Beijing Declaration, it has laid the framework, groundwork for 
<br/>states to collaborate to achieve shared commitments and take the necessary actions to address these 
<br/>challenges  confronting the aviation sector. Since the adoption of  the Beijing Declaration, Fiji has 
<br/>made  significant  strides  in  advancing  aviation  safety  and  security  oversight.  Our  effective 
<br/>implementation  score  stands  above  the  global  average,  a  testament  to  a  commitment  to  maintain 
<br/>rigorous safety standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following the Inaugural Conference, 2018, the International Civil Aviation Organization co-
<br/></span><span>hosted the 2</span><span>nd</span><span> Asia-Pacific Conference with the Government of India, gathering over 200 delegates 
<br/></span><span>to discuss commitments and reflect on the aviation industry, while addressing sustainability. Those 
<br/>in  attendance  included  12  Ministers,  eight  Deputy  Ministers  and  24  Director  Generals  of  civil 
<br/>aviation.  The  Prime  Minister  of  India,  the  honourable  Narendra  Modi  made  the  closing  address, 
<br/>demonstrated great ideas and its critical component of India's economic development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While some commitments since 2018 have made satisfactory progress. The majority of safety 
<br/>and annual targets have failed to meet expectations. The shortfall is primarily due to the pandemic 
<br/>which has plunged the global civil aviation sector into a deep crisis. A significant outcome of the 
<br/>Conference  resulted  in  29  Asia  Pacific  nations  committing  to  landmark  shift  towards  sustainable 
<br/>aviation, enhance safety and technological innovation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accelerating efforts to reduce the region's environmental impact was one of the key outcomes 
<br/>of  the  Conference.  This  is  in  line  with  the  global  framework  that  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Organization  (ICAO) Member States  agreed upon at  the ICAOâ€™s 3</span><span>rd</span><span>  Conference on Aviation and 
<br/>Alternative  Fuels  (CAAF/3)  that  I  had  chaired  in  Dubai  last  November.  This  aviation  industry  is 
<br/>committed to achieving a collective global aspiration vision to reduce CO2 emissions in international 
<br/>aviation by 5 percent by 2030. This, through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, low carbon aviation 
<br/></span><span>fuels and other aviation cleaner energies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As  you  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  undertaking  a 
<br/>feasibility study into the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Fiji involving both Fiji 
<br/>Airways and Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC).  Emphasis was put on the critical role of accelerating 
<br/>progress towards gender equality in the sector, and further efforts was needed to ensure gender equity 
<br/>in aviation across the region to meet the human resource demands of aviation sectors rapid expansion. 
<br/>A significant commitment by the Aviation Ministers of the Asia and Pacific region was the adoption 
<br/>of the Delhi Declaration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this declaration reaffirms support and continuous efforts towards realising 
<br/>the commitments of the prior Beijing Declaration. These commitments come at a crucial time for the 
<br/>aviation  industry  which  is  rebounding  from  COVID-19.  The  Declaration  outlines  several  key 
<br/>commitments including:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker Sir, Fiji fully supports the Delhi Declaration and stands committed 
<br/>to implementing its principles of safety, security and innovation. This Declaration marks a significant 
<br/>step forward for civil aviation in the Asia Pacific region and Fiji is ready to collaborate with our 
<br/>regional partners to meet the aviation challenges of today and tomorrow. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.â€“  I  just  have  a  small  supplementary  question.  Honourable  Minister,  I 
<br/>congratulate you on your attendance at the Delhi Conference and in terms of the Delhi Declaration 
<br/></span><span>that has actually transpired, my question is relating to implementation. Whether it is Fiji or whether 
<br/></span><span>it is regional, how are we going to ensure that we actually implement those things that have come up 
<br/>within the Declaration, and my question, you may know, probably leads towards sustainable aviation, 
<br/>fuels et cetera that particular aspect of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA. â€“ Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Beijing and Delhi Declaration came out of 
<br/>this huge growth in travel by air in the Asia Pacific region and our concern is that we need to make 
<br/>travel seamless.  There are about 29 Flight Information Regions (FIR) within the Asia Pacific and 
<br/>these FIR need to be talking to each other and seamless when you pass through from one to the next.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our concern is that not everyone is on board in terms of safety, in terms of security, and other 
<br/>requirements by ICAO. We need to be singing from the same page, across the Asia Pacific region. 
<br/>As I had mentioned the other day, Fijiâ€™s score in the last audit was sitting higher than the average 
<br/>regional and global score, so Fiji is doing well. The challenge is our Pacific neighbours, so we need 
<br/>to help them grow their aviation industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what came out of this, is that Governments needs to commit. We know that 
<br/>travel by air is critical, but you cannot have a State not doing its part because we are all connected in 
<br/></span><span>travel. If you could just allow me, Sir, there was North Korea in the meeting and you know when 
<br/></span><span>North and South Korea are in a meeting one stands up and one speaks. These people normally, if you 
<br/>test your missiles into the atmosphere, you will notify the commercial, you know, airlines and all 
<br/>that, that I will be testing my missiles over these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the North Koreans have been known to be firing the missiles into parts that are taken by 
<br/>airlines. That  is  the kind of stuff we want  to discipline. It  is  called Notice to  Airmen (NOTAM).  
<br/>Interestingly over the last two days, Iran was firing into Israel. They did not notify the commercial 
<br/>aviation people that they were firing missiles over the area. So, that is the kind of discipline that we 
<br/>need  in  aviation,  because  we  are  all  too  good  in  this.  The  underlying  principle  is  that  it  must  be 
<br/>seamless, it must be safe, and it must all subscribe to the sense of safety when you are flying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, anyway, in terms of the government you need to commit, and I am happy 
<br/>that every time I present my budget to the honourable Minister for Finance in aviation, he does not 
<br/></span><span>compromise. Thank you.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2161 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  happy  to  hear  that  the  Minister  for  Finance 
<br/>consistently assists you, but will he be assisted by ICAO also with respect to the original issue that 
<br/>you are talking about?  We know the value of everyone working off the same page. By the way, I 
<br/>have flown to South Korea whilst the ICBM has been flown across by North Korea. I know, it is a 
<br/>very scary thing. Will  we be getting  assistance  from  ICAO in  terms  of the regional issue so that 
<br/>everyone can sing off the same page, because aviation security, as you rightfully pointed out, it needs 
<br/>to be everyone singing from the same tune sheet.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we opened the Pacific Liaison Office (PLO) in 
<br/>Nadi two months or three months ago. This is the Pacific Liaison Office for ICAO. Fiji is hosting 
<br/>this. The salary is paid for by Singapore, but we provide the premises in Nadi for the PLO. That is 
<br/>our contribution to the region, and this office is going to provide training and support for our island 
<br/>SIDS.  So, ICAO is helping in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just before we continue with the questions, bit of housekeeping and for the 
<br/>purposes of complying with Standing Orders, with respect to the sitting time, now I call upon the 
<br/>Leader of the Government in Parliament, to move his suspension motion.
