<h3>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>ANTI-DOPING BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>20th May, 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 (Bill No. 1/2024) be debated, voted upon and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister's,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>members of the public joining in through virtual platform. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today to speak on the Anti-Doping Bill 2024, a significant 
<br/></span><span>legislative step aimed at safeguarding the integrity of sports in our nation. This Bill, first introduced 
<br/></span><span>in May 2024, represents our continued commitment to ensuring clean competition, fairness and the 
<br/>wellbeing of our athletes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the world of sports is ever evolving, and so are the methods used by those who 
<br/>seek to gain an unfair advantage through doping.  It is our duty to ensure that our athletes compete 
<br/>on a level playing field, free from the influence of performance-enhancing drugs.  The National Anti-
<br/>Doping Bill seeks to address this issue by aligning our laws with international standards, particularly 
<br/>those set forth by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you are aware, this Bill was initially given until August 2024 by WADA 
<br/>to be finalised with clear indication that penalties for non-compliance would follow.  However, due 
<br/>to  the  positive  developments  that  have  taken  place  over  the  past  few  months  during  the  review 
<br/>process, we have been granted some grace period to ensure that this Bill is passed.  This extension 
<br/>reflects the progress we have made, but also underscores the critical importance of passing this Bill 
<br/>at the soonest to establish Fiji’s compliance at the international doping standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill has gone through a rigorous review process, and we have ensured 
<br/></span><span>that it is both comprehensive and practical for our national context.  It includes provisions for the 
<br/></span><span>establishment of a National Anti-Doping Agency, robust testing protocols, education programmes 
<br/>and strict penalties for violations.  It is focused not only on detection and enforcement, but also on 
<br/>prevention and education to foster a culture of clean sport.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I speak on the Bill today, I am confident that it addresses the necessary 
<br/>legal, procedural and operational aspects required for an effective and antidoping framework.  The 
<br/>Anti-Doping Bill, which we are proposing is a pivotal step towards strengthening our nation’s anti-
<br/>doping  efforts.    This  Bill  seeks  to  consolidate  and  enhance  our  existing  legislative  framework  to 
<br/>effectively combat doping practices in sports.  By aligning with international standards set forth by 
<br/>organisations like WADA, we demonstrate our commitment to being at the forefront of the global 
<br/>fight against doping.  This is an unprecedented development not only for Fiji, but for the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, without a central and specialised organisation to support law enforcement 
<br/></span><span>and regulatory agencies in Fiji, the sports sector will remain vulnerable to the use of performance 
<br/></span><span>enhancing drugs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee, line

<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministries, stakeholders, and international partners like WADA and staff of my Ministry who have 
<br/>contributed to the development of this Bill.  Their invaluable input and effort has helped shape a 
<br/>piece of legislation that is both progressive and in the best interest of our athletes and the sporting 
<br/>community.  As the Minister for Youth and Sports, I am deeply proud of the progress we have made, 
<br/>and  I  can  only  praise  God  for  the  work  carried  out  over  the  past  months,  demonstrating  our 
<br/>unwavering commitment to protecting the integrity of Fijian sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look ahead to the future of sports in Fiji, it is vital that we create an 
<br/>environment where integrity and fair play are at the forefront.  This Bill is not just about enforcement, 
<br/>it  is  about  protecting  the  spirit  of  sports,  promoting  the  health  of  athletes,  and  ensuring  that  Fiji 
<br/>continues to participate in the global sporting arena with the highest ethical standards.  To that end, 
<br/>your support for this Bill is crucial.  It not only reflects our commitment to the values of fair play, 
<br/>but also ensures that Fiji remains in good standing with WADA and the global sporting community.  
<br/>Failure  to  pass  this  Bill  could  lead  to  penalties,  which  would  damage  our  reputation  and  the 
<br/>opportunities available to our athletes on the international stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker and honourable Members of Parliament, I urge all of you to support this Bill 
<br/>once again, as it represents a critical step in maintaining the dignity and reputation of our athletes 
<br/></span><span>and sporting institutions.  Let us pull together to pass this legislation and build a future where sports 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji continue to thrive in the spirit of fairness and excellence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Honourable Members, the vote is now in motion, and I have been given a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>list of speakers by the honourable Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Bala; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Micro and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services; and  
<br/>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Naupoto.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the debate will be limited to one hour only, even though there are more 
<br/>than eight speakers here and the Secretary-General will pass the timing note. Speaking times will be 
<br/>limited to five minutes each. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the initiative behind and fully understand 
<br/>the  need  and  reasons  for  the  Anti-Doping  Bill.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bill  in  its  current  form  is 
<br/>undeveloped and raw and seems like it has been drafted in some hurry.  I do not know why, but the 
<br/>Bill and the proposed body to look after it, does not seem to have a clear pathway to the try line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addressing the Anti-Doping Bill 2024, it is crucial to highlight the lack 
<br/>of  attention  given  to  the  wider  issues  affecting  player  welfare  and  sports  integrity  in  Fiji.  The 
<br/>Government’s single focus on doping neglects the broader needs of our athletes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>and the sports systems leaving a significant gap in sports governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  Sports  Integrity  Commission  is  essential  to  ensure  fairness, 
<br/>transparency and the well-being of athletes across all sports, that is, rugby, soccer, netball, athletics 
<br/>and more.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the player welfare, our athletes are more than just competitors.  They are 
<br/>human beings who deserve protection and support.  On integrity, corruption, match-fixing and doping 
<br/>are merely symptoms of a broader crises on sports governance. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Bill’s 
<br/>focus  is  too  narrow  as  it  only  deals  with  doping  while  ignoring  the  other  elements  of  the  sports 
<br/>corruption.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  protection  of  women  and  girls,  one  of  the  most  neglected  aspects  in  the  current 
<br/>framework is the safeguarding of women and girls in sports.  Fiji’s sports eco-system must include 
<br/>measures to prevent harassment and abuse, ensuring that the women can safely report incidents of 
<br/>misconduct  through  anonymous  channels.  The  absence  of  any  such  protection  in  this  Bill  is 
<br/>unacceptable.  We must empower women and girls to participate in sports with dignity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are we still on anti-doping? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You have moved onto women and everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, no, it is related to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, no! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I have got five minutes let me finish, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, confine your speech to anti-doping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  On  gender  and  imbalance,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  not  just  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>safeguarding, it is also about representation. Women are under-represented in coaching in…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bala, I will not allow you to continue with that diatribe because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you need to confine yourself to the issue here, it is anti-doping.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  BALA.-  Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  is  at  a  pivotal  moment  in  sports 
<br/>governance.  We  cannot  afford  to  miss  the  opportunity  to  create  a  transparent,  accountable  and 
<br/>athlete-friendly framework.  The Bill, as it stands, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is too narrow, as I have said 
<br/>earlier on, too incomplete and too indifferent to the real needs of our athletes. It is not just … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- This is Anti-Doping Bill? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- I am talking about the Bill. What else do you want? You better have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>look at the Bill then you will know.  It is not just about catching our athletes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me finish by saying that the Bill must be revised, 
<br/>expanded and refocussed to address the real challenges facing Fijian sports today. The creation of 
<br/>the Sport Integrity Commission is the solution that will not only protect at least but also restore the 
<br/>trust in our sports institution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  my 
<br/>contribution to the Bill today would be confined to two matters. I am sure that all the others would 
<br/>have a toothpick on the Bill itself.  I want to speak on what the Anti-Doping Bill would do apart from 
<br/></span><span>it becoming an addition to the laws of our country.

<div><span>Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Anti-Doping Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is part of Fiji’s global commitment to fairplay, good 
<br/>sportsmanship and the promotion of health and equality for all of our athletes.  We live in a very era 
<br/>and  age  today,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  an  example  I  am  sure  that  most  of  our  older  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament would have played rugby in an era where they were graded in either the bantam, midgets 
<br/>and senior grades, so that is by weight. And most when they entered into the secondary school would 
<br/>remain a midget or bantam right up until they left high school. They do not grow in size </span><span>ia sa sui 
<br/>dromo  tikoga  na  tamata</span><span>.  They  find  that  is  not  really  a  fair  way  in  which  sports  is  going  to  be 
<br/>administered.  Then the age grouping was seen as a more fairer away of administering sports in our 
<br/>schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  athletics,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  example,  age  groups  were  even  adjusted  to  ensure  that 
<br/>everyone has an opportunity to compete, and everyone also has an opportunity to win the prize at the 
<br/>end of the competition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, beyond the age grouping step, we traditionally know in our schools, and I 
<br/>am contextualising this Bill in the way we understand sports development here in our country. It is 
<br/>all open competition, and this is where the Anti-Doping Bill, I suppose, fits into the picture.  This is 
<br/>where athletes in an open environment may consider taking advanced enhancing drugs so that it gives 
<br/></span><span>them an advantage over and above their peers in the competition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who would forget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the famous race, the 100 metres in Seoul in 1988 where 
<br/>the champion Carl Lewis was beaten on the tracks by the Canadian, Ben Johnson.  We all know the 
<br/>story, Sir. Ben Johnson lost his medal, stripped off his medal and was also banned for some time.  In 
<br/>fact, Mr. Speaker, it was said in that race alone in Seoul that six out of the eight finalists all tested 
<br/>positive for banned substance. It was highlighted, it was said to be the most dirtiest race in the history 
<br/>of the Olympics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the reason why these laws are important in today's context, and I do 
<br/>not understand why honourable Bala was going on about that this was not a complete law, it needs 
<br/>some more time to be to be rehashed. I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we probably need some anti-doping 
<br/>laws amongst ourselves here in this House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K.  BALA.- I was the one who started that, I know everything. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- The Anti-Doping Bill, if we do not pass it in the House today, 
<br/>(I thought this was going to be a bi-partisan Bill for both sides of the House)  we are going to lose a 
<br/></span><span>lot as a country in an era and in a region where there is increasing competition for venues where these 
<br/></span><span>competitions were going to be held, Fiji stands to lose quite a lot if we do not pass this Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are making a bid for the SPG. We are making a bid for other international meets and 
<br/>without operationalising these laws and ensuring that these regulations are in place to provide for the 
<br/>operationalising of these laws, we will lose these competitions.  If we lose these competitions, we 
<br/>are going to lose our recognition, we are also going to lose our standing as a central place in the 
<br/>Pacific where we can get all of these competitions into.  I support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a Bill that both sides of the House realised that 
<br/>it  needs  to  be  done,  especially  because  we  have  sporting  bodies  that  take  part  in  international 
<br/>activities, talking about rugby, athletics, football and weightlifting, et cetera.  The importance of it is 
<br/>recognised, but what must happen (and I will point something out shortly) is we cannot do this if 
<br/>there are something deficient in the current Bill in its form. I raised this whilst I was sitting on the 
<br/></span><span>Committee,  it is something that obviously needs to  be looked at  or maybe even thought about  or 
<br/></span><span>quickly re-drafted and I specifically talk about.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2185 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, let me just say, Sir, this entire thing depends on three things. There is a  code, 
<br/>convention and WADA.  These are the things that we have made commitments to, and it is important 
<br/>that we get this Bill done so that we are compliant in terms of all our activities locally, and also in 
<br/>order to protect our local sportsmen and women, because using sports enhancing drugs has become 
<br/>big business.  I just hope one day that they do not decide to list </span><span>warusi </span><span>on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important parts of the Bill is with respect to the functions 
<br/>of the Drug Free Sport Fiji which is the institution that has been established in this particular Bill that 
<br/>will take of our drug testing activities, et cetera.  The worrying part for me and I still have some 
<br/>reservations on it is section 5(f), and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The functions of DFSF are to coordinate with the Fiji Police Force, Fiji Revenue 
<br/>and Customs Service (FRCS), local sports entities and other anti-doping organisations to 
<br/>investigate complaints on doping sports in Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Police Force has very wide powers. If you fall foul of doping, it is not a criminal offence. 
<br/>And revenue and customs, so how far do they go in terms of their investigative work?  Do we need 
<br/>to curtail it, or do we seriously need to have the Police Force and FRCS on board with respect to 
<br/></span><span>investigative work that is going to be done, if you have taken drugs to enhance your sporting needs.  
<br/></span><span>As I have said, it is not a criminal activity, it is not something that you will be criminally charged 
<br/>with.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will be banned for life or whatever but there are things in there that are very positive, 
<br/>and I think by looking at this particular provision, and if the Office of the Attorney-General wants to 
<br/>quickly see whether it can be amended, or do we really need to engage the police because they have 
<br/>very vast powers within their laws.  You cannot have someone who has tested positive for a particular  
<br/>drug and the police comes traipsing through his house on a search warrant, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The powers are different, this is not an offence that has been created under the criminal law 
<br/>act.    It  is  actually  something  that  is  dealt  with  by  DFSF  within  the  powers  that  is  given  to  him.  
<br/>Otherwise, as I have said earlier, DFSF is actually to permitted out to carry out anti-doping testing 
<br/>of athletes.   It is something also that we need to seriously look at into how it will operate with respect 
<br/>to our Coca-Cola Games, et cetera that has happened, whether that has been used at that particular 
<br/>level too, and this will facilitate all of that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a good thing, Sir, it is a great thing to keep us compliant with respect to everything we 
<br/></span><span>do in our sports in Fiji and worldwide, and it keeps us, and I know for a fact, I heard the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for Sports has spoken about this  too, Sir, that if we do not do this, we may get told that we 
<br/>cannot partake in a particular activity offshore.  So, it is important that we get it done, I know the 
<br/>Committee has done some tremendous work on it. The only reservation is the one that I have actually 
<br/>pointed out, Mr.  Speaker. I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to contribute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span> Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute 
<br/>to the Anti-Doping Bill which in some respect is a historic Bill in terms of sports in Fiji.  I would 
<br/>like  to  congratulate  the  honourable  Minister  for  Youth  for  initiating  this  Bill  very  quickly  and 
<br/>bringing it to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Former Minister had initiated it.

<div><span>Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Just  that  I  would  respond  very  quickly  to  the  previous 
<br/>speakers from  the other side, Sir, and there was a suggestion that it  was a bad Bill.  Sir, WADA 
<br/>actually assisted in the drafting of the Bill.  They are the foremost experts, Sir, when it comes to anti-
<br/>doping so any suggestion that it is a bad bill is questionable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  one  was,  I  did  have  a  conversation  with  the  honourable  Koya  regarding  the 
<br/>concern about the police and I had a think and I was reading the clause again.  It talks about this 
<br/>coordination with the Fiji Police, FRCS, sporting entities and other anti-doping organisations.  So it 
<br/>is fairly, what is the word for it, not a  a must report to police immediately kind of thing.  It is at the 
<br/>discretion of the anti-doping authority, should they wish to consult the police.  There can be possibly 
<br/>criminal action involved, like for example, someone is deliberately manufacturing anti-doping illegal 
<br/>substances  and  providing  it  knowingly  and  making  money  or  something,  so  there  may  be  some 
<br/>criminal element and may require the police, but I saw it as more distant option there available to the 
<br/>anti-doping agency, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  regard  to  the  Bill  itself,  firstly  I  think  Fiji  has  become  a  victim  of  its  own  success.  
<br/>Successive golds in the Olympics followed by the silver this year has created a bit more focus on 
<br/>Fiji.    And  of  course,  the  need  to  actually  do  something  to  ensure  that  as  we  compete  and  as  we 
<br/></span><span>continue  to  dominate  the  Seven’s  that  we  appear  to  be  doing  the  right  thing  in  terms  of  ethical 
<br/></span><span>behaviour when it comes  to  sports. However,  I thought I just attack this from  more an economic 
<br/>angle.  You will recall, Sir, that when I talk about my priorities in terms of trade, the last one is about 
<br/>raising  the  standard  of  Fiji  because  if  we  are  concerted  in  our  effort  to  raising  standards  in  our 
<br/>country, we will start being perceived at a different level.  It is not just a little backwater in the middle 
<br/>of the Pacific Ocean, it is a serious player when it comes to things like sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And if we listen to people like Ben Ryan when he was leaving, Fiji, he said that the Fijians, 
<br/>some of them are super athletes in terms of what they can do.  So, there is an opportunity with this 
<br/>Bill, Sir, to really validate some of the perceptions that we have about our athletes, we can actually 
<br/>then benefit more in terms of tourism.  Right now, we are doing a billion plus in remittances. With 
<br/>these type of validations that have international connotations, it really elevates sporting, people look 
<br/>at sports through the athletes’ eyes, look at the athletes from an international perspective and this will 
<br/>no doubt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have a ripple effect into the economy as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, the Bill is a good one. It covers, in my view, all that is required in terms of a 
<br/>body that needs to safeguard standards in the country regarding drug free sports. The fact that it is 
<br/>aligned very closely to WADA, simply means that we will be  complying with the highest authority 
<br/></span><span>when it comes to anti-doping globally and we will ensure that sports is a profession for our young 
<br/></span><span>men and women, it continues to be protected, the temptation to delve into drugs will become more 
<br/>and more apparent as they compete more, they start earning millions, start earning $10 million a year, 
<br/>some of our athletes will end up in that vein.  So, I think the Bill in its current form is a satisfactory, 
<br/>Sir. It addresses the concerns of WADA, which is most important, as alluded to by all speakers.  Of 
<br/>course, it sets us on sail on an economic path in terms of sports tourism.  With those few words, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the outset I want to say that this Bill is definitely 
<br/>needed, but not in the current form. There are too many flaws in the Bill, and I am going to highlight 
<br/>section by section which needs to be plugged before we pass this Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will start off with Clause 6 where it says that s that DFSF will approve any purchase, sale 
<br/>or lease of property and borrowing of money above a prescribed value. I understand that this body 
<br/></span><span>comes  under  a  Ministry,  and  it  is  funded  by  the  Government.  Why  is  the  Minister’s  consent  not 
<br/></span><span>taken?  Normally, any statutory body who wants to raise any money, the consent of the Minister is 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taken. So, I can see there is a problem there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Clause 7, it says that the Minister will appoint the Chairperson and the Vice 
<br/>Chairperson. Normally, in any situation, it is the Minister who appoints the Chairperson and then the 
<br/>Board decides the Vice Chair.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another problem that I see is Clause 8, the language. Language says, “The Office of a member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Board becomes vacant.” The language itself needs to be fixed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move on to Clause 11, and the honourable Prime Minister will agree 
<br/>with me and the rest of you will agree me, that when it comes to the remuneration of a CEO of a 
<br/>statutory body, it is decided by the Higher Salaries Commission and not the Board. Here, it says it 
<br/>will be decided by the Board. No, it needs to be stated by Higher Salaries Commission. Go and look 
<br/>at all other legislations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It does not mention Higher Salaries Commission at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another problem that this Bill has is to do with Clause 17, where it says, 
<br/>“annual  reports”.    Submit  the  annual  audited  financial  accounts  to  the  Minister.  My  question  is, 
<br/>when? Every other legislation like the Audit Bill, which we have just gone through, clearly state that 
<br/>within nine months, you must submit your Annual Reports and every other Bill.  This Bill does not 
<br/>talk about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It  has no meaning.  What it says is what it says. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No, no, no, it is not an interpretation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another problem in the law that I can see is it talks about audit - Audit Act 
<br/>1969. It states Audit Act 1969, and we know that the Audit Act 1969 is going to be reviewed. Then 
<br/>it states, and I quote: “…DSFS is exempted from audit under the Act…”  How can this organisation 
<br/></span><span>be  exempted  from  audit?  It  says  that  the  money  is  appropriated  annually  by  Parliament,  it  is  a 
<br/></span><span>statutory body, and any statutory body must be audited. You cannot say, ‘unless’. What is ‘unless’?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is known! It is stated! It is clear, that any statutory organisation must be audited, full stop! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  another  flaw  in  the  legislation  or  the  Bill  I  see  is,  the  Minister  may, 
<br/>following consultation with DFFS, make regulation.  It should be the other way around. The other 
<br/>way around is that DFFS, with the approval of the Minister, will make the regulation. That means, 
<br/>they will consult the Minister, the Minister will take it to Cabinet, but it is about operationalising the 
<br/>Act. That is what it is all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the biggest challenge that I find, is the way the structure is created.  You have a Board; 
<br/></span><span>the Board can co-opt members and the Board can appoint the Advisory Committee. The advisory 
<br/></span><span>committee is basically doing the work of the CEO - carrying out research, and all that work. What

<div><span>Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will the CEO do?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CEO is clearly stated here that he or she can decide not to attend the Board meeting, can 
<br/>nominate his or her nominee. Normally, it does not work like that. A Board must have a CEO, and 
<br/>the CEO attends the meeting. Otherwise, if there is a dispute between the two, the CEO will always 
<br/>send a nominee. That is not how a system works, and that is my comment, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Kumar.    I  now  offer  the  floor  to  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speak on the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  former  member  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  in  the  last  term  of 
<br/>Parliament, our Committee members,  two are still here - honourable Tuicolo and honourable Pillay, 
<br/>when we received submission from the Fiji Sports Council and the various sporting bodies that do 
<br/>report to this Standing Committee, one of the topics that usually comes up is the anti-doping issue, 
<br/>and the need for the Bill was very much needed back then, the last four years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our recommendation, we always support the calling for the Bill to be established.  So, I am 
<br/>very  grateful  that  today,  I  have  a  chance  to  speak  on  this,  as  a  former  member  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee and we are finally here to say that the Bill is before us, for the adoption of the Bill and I 
<br/>fully agree with the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister for bringing it to Parliament and the Standing Committee 
<br/>members for their work on the Bill.  As it is, Mr. Speaker Sir, there are a few key components of the 
<br/>Bill, and I will just touch on a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, the Bill prioritises rigorous testing protocols. Through random testing and 
<br/>the use of advanced technology, we will ensure that our athletes are held accountable for their actions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024 places strong emphasis on education and awareness.  
<br/>Sir, this Bill will not work without a strong emphasis on education and awareness, and I believe that 
<br/>it is incorporated into the Bill.  For the Ministry of Education, through the Ministry of Health, we 
<br/>can ensure that this Bill goes to the wider scope of our community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Anti-doping  Bill  2024  also  underscores  the  significance  of 
<br/></span><span>mental health support for athletes. The pressure to perform at elite level can lead some athletes down 
<br/>to the path of substance abuse and we are very grateful that the legislation proposes the establishment 
<br/>of mental health resources that athletes can access confidentially.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By addressing the underlying issue contributing to doping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we pave the way 
<br/>for a healthier and more supportive athletic environment. As it is,  I support the Bill and, again,  I 
<br/>thank the Standing Committee, and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing the Bill on board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is a step in the right direction, in fact, I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>say it is a leap in the right direction for sports in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill is the precursor to establish our own Anti-Doping Agency, DFSF it will be called. 
<br/>All sporting nations have their own Anti-Doping agencies, and it is good for Fiji that sends high end 
<br/></span><span>athletes, that go right up to the Olympics, and just imagine for a while when our athletes go to the 
<br/></span><span>Olympics, they get a gold medal for example, our flag is raised, our anthem is sung and then later  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="69">Page 69</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Anti-Doping Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2189 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on, they get disqualified. Their medal is taken away from them because they failed their doping tests.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This agency that will be established, will protect our athletes to make sure that when they go 
<br/>up there to represent Fiji at the highest level, that they are clean, and they play fairly. I support the 
<br/>Bill; this is good and the right step at this time in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my comments on the Bill that is 
<br/>before  Parliament, the Anti-Doping Bill 2024. The Bill in its current form is perfect and it has gone 
<br/>through the whole process of Standing Committee deliberation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The points raised now by the honourable Opposition Members should have been raised by 
<br/>the Standing Committee member which is from the G16-Bloc, and also the report for this particular 
<br/>Bill has been signed too by the honourable Usamate, we are members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>together.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  went  through  the  deliberations  of  the  Bill  and  what  the  honourable  Praveen  Bala  had 
<br/>mentioned when he was Minister for Sports, he had initiated, that particular Bill. That was draft one, 
<br/>after a few executive consultations, the Bill was developed to draft two.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After consultation with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it was developed to draft 
<br/>three, and it went back to the Ministry for draft four.  After draft four, it was then taken to Cabinet, 
<br/>and was passed by Cabinet and the honourable Minister for Sports then tabled it to the Parliament 
<br/>back when the was Bill was first tabled through Standing Orders. That was draft number four. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Draft  number  four  is  what  the  Standing  Committee  had  worked  with,  calling  public 
<br/>consultations through media and moving around all areas in Fiji. We also called upon the Members 
<br/>of Parliament to present their views. It was unfortunate that none of the Members that have shared 
<br/>their views now, did not appear before the Standing Committee or made use of that call, even not  
<br/>making a written submission. Even the online platform was available there. That is the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, when we sat after the consultation with the comments, we sent it back to the Ministry.  
<br/>We  called  the  Ministry  in  a  roundtable  meeting  with  all  sporting  bodies  around  Fiji  and  they  all 
<br/>supported the current form of the Bill then. Then after taking on board their comments, we sent it 
<br/>back to WADA for their comments when the Standing Committee was developing the form of the 
<br/>Bill after the consultation. Then WADA gave their comments and also it provide justification, after 
<br/>that then we send it back to the drafters at the Solicitor-General’s Office, who then made the final 
<br/></span><span>drafting of the Bill, which is before us, considering WADA’s requirements, international standards 
<br/></span><span>plus the views of the people throughout the consultation and other views that came in presented to 
<br/>the Standing Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the process that was followed and the drafting that was made, and I will agree with 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and 
<br/>Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  on  Clause  5(f).    When  honourable  Koya  was  in  the 
<br/>Standing Committee he had raised it, we had taken that on board, and we had sent his comments to 
<br/>WADA.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the interpretation he has shared in the Parliament and WADA gave their interpretation 
<br/>and  justification,  they  were  satisfied,  the  interpretations  is  what  you  have  alluded  to.    It  is  more 
<br/>towards trying to cut down on those that are manufacturing drugs and the sources of drugs that will 
<br/>be used by athletes.  These are some of the interpretations that the Standing Committee took on board.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the Bill that is before the Parliament, and it has gone 
<br/>through extensive consultations and deliberations with WADA. WADA wanted some of the clauses 
<br/>to be consistent with their standards and their codes, so we had to take that on board to be compliant 
<br/>with international standards. I have no further things to say, but for us to support the Bill. I also call 
<br/>upon  the  G16-Bloc  to  support  the  Bill,  given  a  Member  of  their  group  is  also  in  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee that had already endorsed this particular Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as already mentioned, today is very historical and 
<br/>the Bill itself is historical. On that note, I thank all those who have contributed to the formulation of 
<br/>the Bill. I thank the Chairman, all the honourable Members of the Standing Committee, Members of 
<br/>Parliament who have participated in the formulation of the Bill, and our sporting bodies in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a small island nation in the Pacific, Fiji has been promoted to Tier 2 level.  
<br/>Thus, the need that we have the Anti-Doping Bill in place. The Bill may not be perfect to our context, 
<br/>but it is a requirement when we want to compete at the international level. I have nothing further to 
<br/>add, but to thank everyone who have contributed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
