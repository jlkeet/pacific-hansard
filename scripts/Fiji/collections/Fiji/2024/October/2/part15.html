<div><span>Relocation – Sigatoka Rubbish Dump 
<br/>(Question No. 244/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/>if the Ministry has plans for the relocation of the Sigatoka rubbish dump, which is next 
<br/>to our heritage site and at the entrance to Sigatoka town? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  address  an  issue  of  both  the 
<br/>environmental and cultural significance. The relocation of the Sigatoka rubbish dump and the broader 
<br/>agenda of sustainable waste management in Sigatoka Town. The current location of the Sigatoka 
<br/>dump poses serious concerns. The current location has been the dumpsite since 1949, about 75 years 
<br/>ago. No concrete steps have been taken to address or even change the site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the site’s position is  near to the most very precious  assets,  which is  the 
<br/>Sigatoka sand dunes, UNESCO World Heritage site and the entrance to Sigatoka Town from  the 
<br/>Nadi way. The dump threatens the environment and the public health, the image of the Town as a 
<br/></span><span>gateway  for  tourism  and  economic  development.  So,  the  Coalition  Government  recognises  the 
<br/></span><span>environmental degradation caused by the proximity of the dump to the sand dunes which jeopardises 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not only the ecosystem, but also our cultural heritage. The frequent fires at the site release toxic fumes 
<br/>that endanger health of nearby communities and tourists. Moreover, as a getaway to Sigatoka Town, 
<br/>the dump creates a bad first impression, potentially discouraging investments and tourism which are 
<br/>key to the region’s economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I assure Parliament of the Ministry in collaboration with United Nations 
<br/>Development Programme (UNDP), is committed to a long-term solution for waste management in 
<br/>Sigatoka.  It  has  taken  75  years  to  come  this  far,  and  the  Coalition  Government  is  committed  to 
<br/>addressing and resolving this issue. It is also part of the new National Development Plan on solid 
<br/>waste  management  as  articulated  in  sub  chapter  8.4,  and  one  of  the  KPI’s  is  one  landfill  in  the 
<br/>Western Division, as well as one recycling plant for the next three years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  actively  working  with  the Council  and UNDP  under  the 
<br/>Investing in Coral Reefs and Blue Economy Project to  establish a modern sanitary landfill in the 
<br/>Western Division while transforming existing dump sites into efficient collection and sorting centres. 
<br/>This  initiative  was  endorsed  by  Cabinet  in  June  2024,  which  includes  the  rehabilitations  of  four 
<br/>dumpsites, which also includes Sigatoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The facilitation of an open competitive bidding process for Public Private Partnership (PPP) 
<br/></span><span>that  will  modernise  waste  management  infrastructure.  This  includes  proper  containment.  It  is  a 
<br/>collection and environmental monitoring systems which are so crucial to preventing the ecological 
<br/>damage associated with open dumping. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ban infrastructure, the Ministry is exploring the establishment of a waste 
<br/>management authority which will centralise resources and expertise from all municipal councils to 
<br/>enhance waste management and recycling efforts. This centralised body once established will ensure 
<br/>improve governance, transparency and consistency in waste management policies across Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implementation of this comprehensive Waste Management Plan will 
<br/>yield numerous benefits for our nation such as significantly reducing environmental pollution and 
<br/>preserving our cultural heritage. The Sigatoka sand dunes will be safeguarded and will maintain its 
<br/>status as UNESCO's World Heritage Site.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, modern sorting and recycling facilities will also allow us to recover valuable 
<br/>resources from our waste stream contributing to a circular economy. Current practice as it is, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  100  percent  of  the  waste  collection  goes  direct  to  the  landfill  or  dumpsite.  So  the 
<br/>improved waste management practices will reduce greenhouse emissions from decomposing waste 
<br/>and  dump  fires,  contributing  to  our  national  climate  change  mitigation  efforts.  The  entrance  of 
<br/>Sigatoka Town will be transformed, creating a more appealing gateway for tourists enhancing overall 
<br/>visitor experience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure this honourable Parliament that the Coalition Government 
<br/>is  committed  to  addressing  the  issue.  Throughout  this  process  we  commit  to  maintaining 
<br/>transparency, engaging with local communities, ensuring their voices are heard and their concerns 
<br/>addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  task  before  us  is  significant  but  not  to  other  potential  rewards.  The 
<br/>implementation of a modern waste management system represents more than just an infrastructure 
<br/>project but symbolises our commitment to sustainable development, environmental stewardship and 
<br/>the preservation of our cultural heritage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The location of the Sigatoka dump is not just a warning sadness, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it presents  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2095 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our commitment to cleaner, greener and a more prosperous future. This modern waste management 
<br/>system will safeguard our natural and cultural heritage, right from Sigatoka into a more appealing 
<br/>destination and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts by reducing harmful emissions from 
<br/>waste. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government's  actions  that  were  set  up  and  dedicated  to  sustainable 
<br/>development by engaging the community and stakeholders will ensure that Sigatoka Town as well 
<br/>as  the  entire  Sigatoka  community  and  Western  Division  will  benefit  with  a  more  efficient  and 
<br/>environmentally  friendly  waste  management  system.  This  comprehensive  approach  to  waste 
<br/>management  will  turn  a  significant  challenge  and  opportunity  for  innovation,  job  creation  and 
<br/>sustainable growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the honourable Minister's passion with 
<br/>what he wants done, and I acknowledge that it may take some time to actually get it done especially 
<br/>in light of the fact that we are looking at a PPP to get it done. But waste management is big business 
<br/>but in the interim, because it is such a huge problem, especially because it is a tourism-based area, 
<br/>does the Sigatoka Town Council actually have a management regime to manage that particular site? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I specifically asked this, honourable Minister, because in light of the fact that if there is an 
<br/></span><span>application by Government to turn that into a World Heritage Site, there is a buffer zone that needs 
<br/>to happen, and that would fall within the buffer zone.  It is actually quite difficult if you do not comply 
<br/>with those requirements for it to become a World Heritage Site. So, is there a proper management 
<br/>regime on it at the moment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we can only use a live example that we have here in Lami which was moved very 
<br/>quickly, and that site is now dead. Nothing can grow in there for quite a number of years, and I think 
<br/>that  came  through  with  the  assistance  of  the  European  Union.    So,  it  has  to  be  something  that  is 
<br/>addressed very quickly but the management regime, is it in place or is there a management regime 
<br/>with the Sigatoka Town Council?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I thank the honourable Member for raising that 
<br/>issue. I think about 21 months ago when I visited the site, it was really in a very bad condition and 
<br/>they were waste being dumped all around the site. That is something that we have discussed with the 
<br/>Management, as well as the newly appointed Administrators on how best we can contain and manage 
<br/>the  current  site.    There  is  a  system  in  place  on  how  to  better  manage  the  current  site,  so  that  is 
<br/>something that the Management, as well as the newly appointed Administrators are seriously working 
<br/>on it right now, to ensure that we continue and preserve that site because it is a declared UNESCO 
<br/>Heritage site as it is something that the Council is seriously considering in maintaining the dump site. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, since it is 
<br/>next to the Sand Dunes, the last thing we would want is tourists come and visit those places and say 
<br/>that the place is smelling bad.  One is physical waste, and the other one is the odour that is released 
<br/>from the dump site because it is waste, it decays.  Are there any mitigation plans in terms of smell 
<br/>and odour from the place, that would be grateful?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the site has been there for the past 75 years and 
<br/>you would not want to go closer to the site.  It is a really serious concern not only to the nearby 
<br/>residents of Sigatoka, but a big challenge as well for tourists who visit Sigatoka Town.  As I have 
<br/>said, it is something challenging and have insisted that the current Administrators and the Council 
<br/>contain the odour that comes out from the dump site.  Now, there is hardly any fires around the dump 
<br/></span><span>site  due  to  the  plan  that  has  been  put  in  place  by  the  Executive  Management  and  the  Council  in 
<br/></span><span>addressing the problem at the Sigatoka Dump Site.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-Honourable Minister, this may not necessarily be only for Sigatoka 
<br/>but maybe all the Councils in Fiji.  Has there been any consideration or technical scoping done to see 
<br/>the potential for the conversion of waste into energy, as has been done in some countries? Also, do 
<br/>we have the volume?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, when I was in China in June, I visited one of the 
<br/>Waste and Incineration Facility.  It is very good facility and the honourable Prime Minister, in his 
<br/>last visit, also visited one of those facilities.  It is something we are also exploring at the moment as 
<br/>part of our review of the waste management system that we currently have in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go to all the dump sites around the country, all have reached their capacity, so it is a 
<br/>really serious issue right now that needs to be addressed immediately. We have also been receiving 
<br/>presentation by some of the agencies and companies on some of the very effective and sustainable 
<br/>waste manage systems that are happening right now around the world, as well as some that may be 
<br/>effective  in  Fiji.    But  we  are  currently  reviewing  that  and,  hopefully,  we  should  come  up  with  a 
<br/>system that will be sustainable for our future generation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase of Requests for Co-operative Registration 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 245/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications inform Parliament on how 
<br/>the Ministry is handling the increase in requests for co-operative registration?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vakalalabure for the 
<br/>question.  Sir, it is no secret that since coming into office, we have really tried to push the agenda of 
<br/>MSMEs  and  also  for  co-operatives,  not  only  by  making  them  an  actual  Department  within  the 
<br/>Ministry, but also encouraging a lot of our Fijians to join and form co-operatives. We believe, Sir, 
<br/>that one of the pathways out of poverty lies within the co-operative movement, as well as the MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of activity, yes, we have seen a resurgence in activity, Sir, since 2022. In the year 
<br/>2022, just in terms of awareness, we conducted 182 sessions in awareness. By 2023, the number had 
<br/>grown by 109 percent to 484 sessions.  Registrations have also steadily increased whereby 61 co-
<br/>operatives were registered in 2022, which has gone up to 73 percent, to 134 co-operatives in 2023. 
<br/>So, clearly, Sir, that question is quite  intuitive, and a good observation is that we will have some 
<br/>resourcing challenges very soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a grant in place, Sir, of about $0.5 million.  For the first time, we have created a 
<br/>grants specifically for co-operatives so that will add more momentum to the co-operative surge and 
<br/>the co-operative movement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What are we doing about it, Sir?  Right now, we have decided to try and digitise the database 
<br/>for co-operatives and MSMEs. What that will do is actually allow us to track the registrations and 
<br/>track how that process is happening, including applications for grants and, hopefully, that will create 
<br/>some efficiencies in terms of how work is being done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond that, Sir, I am sure the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will probably be expecting some knock on 
<br/></span><span>the  door  for  some  additional  resources  next  year  because  certainly,  Sir,  there  is  some  serious 
<br/></span><span>investment going into the movement.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2097 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thought  I  will  just  share  two  stories  of  two  co-operatives  established 
<br/>recently and the first one is the co-operative in Togabula. At the moment, they plant cassava, and 
<br/>they supply to the Suva Market.  When we presented the assistance, they actually got very emotional 
<br/>because they had been waiting for four years for their tractor.  That tractor will actually double their 
<br/>production, so right now they are doing about 70 bags a week at round about $100 a bag, and that 
<br/>will grow to about 140 bags. So, that is the type of thing we are seeing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another co-operative that we saw was just next door in Natadola.  A group of cane farmers 
<br/>got together.  They were interested, Sir. They did the IHRDP loan, so their one-third was actually 
<br/>loaned from Fiji Development Bank (FDB), and their leader insisted that I go and see the farm itself.  
<br/>When we stood on their farm, he pointed out to me the seven lines of tobacco and seven lines of </span><span>suki</span><span>
<br/>already planted there. In three months, they will harvest it, and they will pay back their one-third 
<br/>deposit to FDB. So, that is the type of innovation, Sir, that is happening amongst our farmers and the 
<br/>co-operative movement, and it is quite exciting to see the level of interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are a lot more stories, Sir, and I plan to share one or two very soon, but there is a lot of 
<br/>interest  in  the  co-operative  movement.  They  are  seeing  a  lot  of  benefits  in  grouping  together, 
<br/>particularly,  when  it  comes  to  capital  expenditure  investment,  and  we  will  certainly  continue  to 
<br/></span><span>encourage it because we certainly can see a way of creating another pathway for poverty which is 
<br/></span><span>high on the People’s Coalition Government’s agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister with 
<br/>respect  to  co-operatives,  ,  are  we  from  the  Ministry  actually  encouraging  some  of  the  older  co-
<br/>operatives to enter the export market because of the amount of things that are in demand offshore, 
<br/>especially local products that we know are in demand in Australia and New Zealand and we have 
<br/>created a pathways for it but we are not actually exporting? Are they being put onto it, that this is a 
<br/>particular product that is required, and they can actually get more out of the Ministry with respect to 
<br/>getting that done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are encouraging co-operatives where 
<br/>there are farmers particularly, to look at various markets.  I know for a fact, Sir, that at the moment, 
<br/>there is shortage of dalo and cassava in New Zealand and also in Australia, so those are markets that 
<br/>are readily available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two years ago, before I joined politics,  I encouraged a group in Lomaiviti to start selling 
<br/>through an exporter here to Sydney and they do </span><span>tausala</span><span>, and it is very successful. Traditionally, they 
<br/>used to only sell their </span><span>dalo</span><span> to Suva.  So, there are a lot of opportunities like that, and we will continue 
<br/>to push them along and encourage our farmers to use co-operatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a sidenote, Sir, we work very closely with the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Agriculture, 
<br/>Ministry of Women and Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, in terms of pushing the co-operative agenda. 
<br/>Sometimes, because of the shortage, we leverage off their resource as well to get the awareness out. 
<br/>So, as honourable Koya correctly pointed out, there are some low hanging fruits that we flag now 
<br/>and  again.  Right  now,  Food  Processors  is  looking  for  </span><span>rourou</span><span>  suppliers  for  </span><span>palusami,</span><span>  so  we  are 
<br/>encouraging farmers to supply</span><span> rourou</span><span>, if they can.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the ninth Oral Question for today. Since honourable 
<br/>Shalen Kumar is not present, his question has now lapsed, so we will move straight on to the tenth  
<br/>Oral Question.

<div><span>Planned Water Pipeline Extension – Northern Division 
<br/>(Question No. 247/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport update on the current  and planned water pipeline extension projects  in  the 
<br/>North? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Tuiwailevu for that question.  Sir, the 
<br/>WAF projects, as I have explained, are aligned with the Water Sector Strategy 2050 Plan which is 
<br/>now the national commitment to SDG6 - Water and Sanitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  has  not  forgotten  the  Northern  Division.  Understanding  the 
<br/>ongoing development in the North, the Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of all 
<br/>rural grassroot communities on the mainland and also those in smaller neighbouring maritime islands 
<br/>are catered for, including the upcoming planned business developments, residents and visitors to the 
<br/>North all have access to reliable water supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It has been identified that an investment of approximately $218 million is required for the 
<br/>next three decades to upgrade and build new water projects to meet the growing demand and improve 
<br/>the reliability of water supply in the Northern Division.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of this commitment, the Coalition Government has already begun executing several 
<br/>key  water  extension  projects,  some  ongoing  from  the  last  Government  as  the  Government  re-
<br/>continue.  The major extension projects, Dagau Main Extension Project, Seaqaqa - $0.56 million. 
<br/>This extension project covers 3.4 kilometres pipeline that shall benefit close to 50 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Nabekavu to Dogoru Mains Extension Project, Labasa, costs $0.8 million to cover 2.6 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kilometre pipeline that will benefit approximately 30 households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Water Supply Projects, include Kubulau Combined Scheme Project - $2.4 million. This 
<br/>rural extension project covers 26 kilometres pipeline, which is nearing completion. It will benefit 
<br/>close to 220 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Delaivuna Combined Scheme in Taveuni - $0.9 million, is now in the initial stage and will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>involve 7 kilometres pipeline to benefit close to 480 households.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  major  upgrading  projects  that  will  eventually  lead  to  new  water  connections,  include 
<br/>Benau to Volanao Bulk Mains Upgrading Project - $16 million. This project is in line with the plan 
<br/>30 Mega Litres per Day (MLD) Water Treatment Plant and the new Matagi Water Source Intake 
<br/>which will increase the storage capacity at the Volanao Reservoir.  This upgrading will allow for 
<br/>future network extensions towards the outskirts of Labasa, including Boubale and Malau. The project 
<br/>is currently in its initial stages with procurement, grant mobilisation and environmental compliance 
<br/>to be fully completed. Close to 600 households are envisaged to benefit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Benau to Rara Reservoir Bulk Main Upgrading Project - $6.14 million.  It forms the first 
<br/>phase  of  the  Tabia  Mains  Extension  Project,  aimed  at  providing  a  feed  supply  from  the  Rara 
<br/>Reservoir.  Procurement, grant mobilisation and environmental compliance have commenced, and it 
<br/>is part of a packaged project that includes the Benau to Volanau Bulk Mains Upgrading Project, to 
<br/></span><span>benefit close to 300 households.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2099 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these ongoing projects collectively represent a significant investment of $27 
<br/>million in the Northern Division. This will benefit thousands of households, improve water quality, 
<br/>reliability  and  address  the  challenges  of  ageing  infrastructure  and  water  scarcity  in  the  Northern 
<br/>Region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms of future projects, the Tabia Mains Extension Project Phase II will continue the 
<br/>first  phase  currently  underway,  extending  the  water  supply  to  the  Tabia  community.  The  project 
<br/>involves  laying 25 kilometres of new pipelines, construction of a pump station  and installing  a 2 
<br/>MLD reservoir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nabouwalu Water Supply System Expansion, the 2 MLD packaged plant 1 MLD reservoir 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been completed and will extend the water supply network to the outskirts of Nabouwalu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Navaqiqi Water Supply System Extension, a new 5MLD Storage Reservoir will be installed 
<br/>at an improved elevation at Navaqiqi to support further network extension, following the commission 
<br/>of the new 5 MLD Water Treatment Plant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Seaqaqa Water Supply System Expansion, a new water treatment plant and upgraded 2 MLD 
<br/></span><span>Storage  Reservoir  will  be  constructed  to  support  network  extension  along  the  Naduri  Road  and 
<br/></span><span>Nanivuda Village, once the new Naililiyaga Water Source is secured.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Nasasa Water Source Development, WAF is securing a new water source at Nasasa to 
<br/>supplement the water supply for Taganikula and Wainikoro Systems, which will also support future 
<br/>extension.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Wainivasa  Water  Source  Development  in  Taveuni,  that  is  currently  being  explored  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>terms of the potential of the Wainivasa Source to facilitate network extension in South Taveuni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  these  investments  in  new  infrastructure  and  the  expansion  of  the  water  supply 
<br/>network, Sir, the Ministry, through WAF, aims to meet the growing needs of the Northern Division's 
<br/>population and support sustainable development in the region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> It is the Coalition Government's policy commitment that Fiji’s water resources are managed, 
<br/>maintained and protected to provide equitable and secure access to water for beneficial users for all 
<br/>sectors of the Fijian economy, and support sustainable development uplift of the rural and grassroots 
<br/>communities.   Of course, also extending sanitation services where these are viable and for reliability 
<br/>and affordability for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for talking about the 
<br/>issues in the South of Taveuni, which has been an area of water shortage over time and lot of water 
<br/>carting.    I  am  just  thinking  about  the  Delaivuna  Project  and  the  Wainivasa.  The  extension  of 
<br/>Delaivuna one, is that from the new source in Wainivasa or from the existing sources? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the  information I have been provided with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is from the Wainivasa source.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, honourable Minister, the plea of  
<br/>farmers in Seaqaqa. I know that most of the land leases in Nanivuda were not renewed, but there was 
<br/>a plan for the extension from Buavou. Is that still under consideration because of the so many farmers 
<br/>in Tadravula and the other sectors in Seaqaqa?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very, very important project because our farmers are important, and this has been their

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>request from so many years.  The previous Government has made efforts to move it to Buavou, but 
<br/>then the extension from Buavou, and now you are considering Nanivuda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are looking into that, and as I have also 
<br/>mentioned, in terms of  the boreholes, the budget has been provided and we are currently looking 
<br/>into that as a matter of urgency, given the needs in the Seaqaqa area.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of Government, perhaps to 
<br/>save money, there are already boreholes in place.  I have asked the honourable Minister for Lands 
<br/>and  Mineral  Resorces,  if  we  can  get  the  data  from  his  Ministry  because  Government  has  eight 
<br/>reserved boreholes in Seaqaqa itself, and if we can utilise that.  Perhaps, it can save us from making 
<br/>new boreholes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the last time I visited was with  WAF and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they were working on those boreholes and the infrastructure to connect them to the communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the source that you have mentioned about Nasasa, I 
<br/>assume this is Nasasa Nadogo.  If that is correct, is that just for Nasasa Village or the whole of that 
<br/></span><span>area feeding into Wainikoro? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I cannot answer that offhand, I will need to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>check on that.  
<br/></span></div>
