<div><span>Construction of Telecommunication Tower 
<br/>(Question No. 238/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  inform 
<br/>Parliament if there are any plans to construct telecommunication towers in the Nasau 
<br/>District in Ra? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  answer  the  question  by 
<br/>honourable Matasawalevu, I just thought to respond to honourable Rinesh Sharma’s comments about 
<br/></span><span>the FRU and I thought I just make something very clear particularly to the public of Fiji.  The trustees 
<br/></span><span>of the Fiji Rugby Union have been vilified unjustifiably.  These men and women, we should call 
<br/>them “heroes” because they came in when FRU was on its knees.  We had uncovered that the whole 
<br/>FRU structure  was  illegal.   You talked about  disconnected, there was one big  disconnection, Sir, 
<br/>happening there.  The trustees were asked to come in and fix the problem and it was made very clear 
<br/>to FRU at that time that if they did not fix it, we were going to be out of the World Cup.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trustees did that.  They not only ensured we stayed, and they played 
<br/>very well in the World Cup and also, they were on a pathway now to return power back to the board 
<br/>of FRU on 28</span><span>th</span><span> November.  I just thought I would share that with the public of Fiji that criticisms are 
<br/>fair, but we need to be, sometimes research a bit before we make criticisms because sometimes maybe 
<br/>we are being a bit unfair particularly, in this case on the trustees who have not been paid a single cent 
<br/>to actually carry out the work they have carried out. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Point of Order – Standing 80 on Personal Explanation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is a personal explanation. This is something that is in conjunction with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what you have stated, honourable Sharma.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Sir, the honourable Minister has accused me of what you said in 
<br/>Parliament.  So, it is directed to me and indirectly to you.  It was just posted on their page by the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Youth and Sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am not reacting to it because I have stated what I wanted to state based 
<br/>on something I heard being mentioned by the honourable Minister for Sports and that is where it 
<br/>ends.  I am not going to take it any further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  now  I  will  address  honourable 
<br/>Matasawalevu’s question.  I think the simple answer to the question is, yes.  The People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government is very committed to ensuring that we reach the unconnected, Sir, and included in that 
<br/>is all provinces in Fiji.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2079 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Sir, I would like to tell a story just to explain why it is taken a bit of a time 
<br/>to actually get to where we are getting to now.  When I got into the Ministry of Communications, 
<br/>you could say there was a fair bit of dysfunctional in that Ministry: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>They did not have a properly constituted telecommunications authority.  The Board was 
<br/>actually just some civil servants that the Minister at that time had gathered together. What 
<br/>I knew, any regulatory body has to have the best of Fiji on this Board. So, one of the jobs 
<br/>was to actually reconstitute the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji (TAF) Board which 
<br/>we have done. It is chaired by a gentleman by the name of David Eyre, he is a well-known 
<br/>telecommunications expert in Fiji and also an engineer.  There is the name such as Tomasi 
<br/>Vakatora (Junior) on the Board.  He is a well-known Senior Executive in Fiji, was at one 
<br/>time the CEO of ATH. These are the types of people we brought on the Board. This is just 
<br/>like the Civil Aviation Board that I had mentioned yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>There was no CEO in Telecommunications Authority of Fiji. I am not sure for how long 
<br/>and so once the Board settled in, their next job was to actually find a CEO, he has now been 
<br/>appointed. One of his main jobs, Sir, is to rollout the connecting the unconnected to the rest 
<br/>of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>When I got the declaration on universal areas, and we have to gazette the locations that we 
<br/>decide that we are going to rollout connectivity to.  The latest Gazette from the Government 
<br/>at that time was 6</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2022 so it is fairly recent.  There was no mention of the Province 
<br/>of Ra here – zero.  Honourable Matasawalevu, you are not even officially on the list of the 
<br/>sites that are to be looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Sir, I asked the Telecommunications Authority to relook at the sites, at this 
<br/>stage, prioritising the maritime areas and then looking at other areas that have not been covered.  At 
<br/>the moment there are about another 80 sites that have been identified which includes Ra.  That will 
<br/>come on board and then we will try and prioritise the actual rollout of the sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first deployment which is like, sort of a test deployment will happen towards the end of 
<br/>this year and that is a rollout to some of the maritime locations.   Once that happens, that includes 
<br/>Lau,  Kadavu  and  Lomaiviti,  then  we  will  start  rolling  out.  There  is  a  fund  called  the  “Universal 
<br/>Service Fund” that actually sits in the Ministry of Communications, we are using that fund, but it is 
<br/>not enough, Sir.  I will be reaching out to donor partners as well to try and accelerate the connecting 
<br/>the unconnected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the positive things, Sir, that we all know about  is,  whilst  we are  trying to  get  this 
<br/>going, Starlink has arrived in town.  Some of our people that can afford the connectivity, and some 
<br/>are doing it through their relatives overseas, I think, here are two in Nairai.  That has already started 
<br/>so that is creating some positive assistance in terms to those who want connectivity more urgently. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in a nutshell, yes, we will look at Nasau District as part of the overall plan.  Right now, 
<br/>we just have to make sure we plan out the initial phase like on a model launch, if you like, Sir.  Once 
<br/>that is done, and then will have a firmer plan and hopefully by then, we have some donor partners so 
<br/>that we can then accelerate the process.    Again, Sir, as you know, it needs a bit of a well-articulated 
<br/>plan before we actually go and see the donor partners as well.  In essence, Sir, where we are at in 
<br/>terms of the planned rollout but be assured, we are very serious and doing our best to get this moving.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I understand stand what you are saying in terms of 
<br/></span><span>rolling out this particular programme, but in terms of the actual hardware that is going to be put on 
<br/></span><span>the ground, it is the Ministry that is paying for the hardware that is going in, but like you said, maybe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>2080 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the donor partners will be involved. Will these towers also, wherever it is put, whether it is in Ra or 
<br/>in Vanua Levu, will you still be permitting Digicel, Vodafone, et cetera to share these towers and 
<br/>other institutions that are involved?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is a very good question.  We are trying to be agnostic 
<br/>when it comes to operators that sit on a tower because it is just more efficient to operate that way. At 
<br/>the moment, in the lead up to the launch process, all the Telcos and the other satellite providers are 
<br/>providing offerings to the Ministry of Communications to assess the best option.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the other things as well, you kind of touched on it, how we actually make payments 
<br/>to the Telcos once they actually do the rollout.  We are using the USAID through their expertise there 
<br/>to assist TAF to work out the payment modelling to ensure that when we roll out the towers and the 
<br/>CAPEX is spent by the Telcos, the compensation is sorted as well.  As you correctly pointed out, 
<br/>what sort of mode of payment will happen? So those are being part and parcel of consideration of the 
<br/>first rollout, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partnership Arrangement – NZMFAT and Ministry of Housing  
<br/>(Question No. 239/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the partnership arrangement between the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign  Affairs 
<br/>and Trade and the Ministry of Housing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question  before  the 
<br/>House  and  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.    This  agreement  started  back  in 
<br/>December 2019 after Cabinet approval albeit the Ministry of Housing and the New Zealand Ministry 
<br/>of Foreign Affairs and Trade for a period of three years until December 2022.  The new Partnership 
<br/>Agreement was recently endorsed by Cabinet on 12</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 for a term until April 2029.  
<br/>From the day of the signing, it is expected to be done before the end of this month, October 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The collaboration aimed to support Fiji's ambition to improve socio economic outcomes for 
<br/>low-income  earners  in  Fiji  through  improved  access  to  quality,  affordable  housing,  support  good 
<br/>governance between partners and to facilitate efficient management of resources for greater efficacy 
<br/>and impact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrangement includes technical assistance through the provision of a 
<br/>housing  policy  advisor  with  the  Ministry  of  Housing.  This  advisor  will  strengthen  policy  and 
<br/>planning  efforts,  support  the  Ministry's  regulatory  role  and  oversee  the  finalisation  and 
<br/>implementation of the National Housing Policy Framework. Additionally, the advisor will facilitate 
<br/>Fiji’s housing stakeholders’ coordination platform to support this initiative.  Sir, NZMFAT will cover 
<br/>recruitment  and  salary  costs  up  to  six  months  totalling  NZ$1.75  million  (equivalent  to  FJ$2.4 
<br/>million).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  NZMFAT  also  co-funds  the  revitalisation  of  Informal  Settlement  and 
<br/>Environment (RISE) Programme.  It aims to improve infrastructure and implement sustainable water 
<br/>and sanitation management systems in six vulnerable informal settlements within the greater Suva 
<br/>area.    Sir,  NZMFAT  will  provide  funding  close  to  NZ$3.6  million  (FJ$5  million)  and  oversee 
<br/>governance for this initiative.  The phase one site include Matata in Lami, which comprise of about 
<br/></span><span>62  households,  Wailea  in  Raiwaqa  of  104  households,  Muanivatu  inVatuwaqa,  comprising  of  96 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2081 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>households,  Wanibua  in  Muanikoso  of  43  households,  Komave  in  Nabua  of  47  households  and 
<br/>Nauluvatu Reservoir Road which has about 91 families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  overarching  objective  is  to  eliminate  the  risk  of  exposure  to 
<br/>contamination  and  where  we  cannot  eliminate,  RISE  aims  to  reduce  the  communities’  risk  to 
<br/>exposure to contamination by at least 80 percent.  Sir, RISE through its programme, is also doing 
<br/>this by treating wastewater in these communities and reducing exposure by alleviating flooding and 
<br/>reducing  interventions  to  disrupt  pathway  and  pathogens  from  environment  to  humans.  These 
<br/>interventions include are few key areas, drainage works, pathways, wet ponds, bathroom and toilet 
<br/>facilities, spot backfilling, pressure sewers, communal sewer tanks, treatment wetlands, as well as 
<br/>there is a demonstration now at Tamavua-i-wai which has about seven pressure tanks, one treatment 
<br/>wetland, 16 wet ponds, a spot backfilling and one communal sewer tank.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  this  agreement,  NZMFAT  is  also  co-funding  the  Model  Town 
<br/>Charitable Trust (MTCT) known as Koroipita which offers subsidised climate resilient, housing and 
<br/>community support services to over 1,000 residents.  Both NZMFAT and the Ministry of Housing 
<br/>are  part  of  the  MTCT  governance  group  with  NZMFAT  responsible  for  providing  co--funding 
<br/>support.  The total funding allocated for this is around NZ$6.1 million, and New Zealand has already 
<br/></span><span>provided funding of NZ$3.2 million (FJ$4.4 million) from 2019 to 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  NZFAT  will  further  assist  through  institutional  strengthening  providing 
<br/>support  for  a  two-way  planning  concept  to  the  Ministry  of  Housing  to  improve  overall  health, 
<br/>structure  and functioning  of the organisation.   Sir, NZMFAT will provide funding support to  the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Housing  through  a  separate  climate  funding  arrangement  for  the  development  of  the 
<br/>Strategic Development Plan (SDP).  This initiative is timely, coinciding with the current launching 
<br/>of the 2025-2030 National Development Plan envisioned in 2014.  It will act effectively and guide 
<br/>the Ministry and the stakeholders in achieving strategic outcomes for the housing sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  NZMFAT  will  also  provide  funding  to  support  the  establishment  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Housing’s  National  Housing  Database  which  we  currently  do  not  have  one  at  the  moment.  The 
<br/>database will be a comprehensive and centralised system to collect, maintain and analyse data related 
<br/>to the housing sector at a national level to inform targeted policy intervention.  The total funding for 
<br/>the provision of analytical systems, institutional strengthening at the Ministry of Housing, as well as 
<br/>its SDP and the standard of National Housing Database is around NZ$1.7 million equivalent FI$2.3 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government through the Ministry of Housing acknowledges 
<br/>and thanks the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its support. The outcome of 
<br/>this partnership will create opportunities for: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase access to affordable high quality social housing for Fijian communities; 
<br/>Increase provision and coordination of basic services to informal settlements in the greater 
<br/>Suva area; and 
<br/>Increase strategy and planning capacity in the public sector for long term development 
<br/>with the housing sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of execution and monitoring, a Project Steering Committee will be 
<br/>established  whose  role  is  to  govern  and  manage  the  delivery  of  the  activities  within  the  housing 
<br/>sector.  This  Committee  is  to  meet  every  three  months,  and  its  membership  comprises  of  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary of Housing, NZMFAT representatives and the Ministry of Housing Advisor. 
<br/></span><span>The role of the Committee is to provide high level strategic guidance, receive and review workplans 
<br/></span><span>and progress reports as well as address any policy or strategy issues as they arise.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  the  RISE  Programme,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  Technical  Advisory  Group  comprising 
<br/>representatives of the Ministry of Housing and RISE Fiji will provide clinical advice to the Steering 
<br/>Committee and service providers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  this  arrangement,  NZMFAT  will  provide  an  indicative  funding 
<br/>amount  of  close  to  NZ$11.5  million  (FJ$15.9  million)  directly  to  the  service  providers  for  the 
<br/>technical assistance. The programme and the model town’s trust subject to conditions that NZMFAT 
<br/>will enter into within the service provider for the delivery of the above- mentioned activities and the 
<br/>New Zealand Government policy and the appropriation by the New Zealand Parliament of sufficient 
<br/>funds to support the activities. The partnership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry of Housing will 
<br/>be reviewed every three years from the date of signing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership agreement should enhance the Ministry of 
<br/>Housing’s Services by leveraging resources, expertise and best practices from both parties.  It fosters 
<br/>collaboration to address housing challenges more effectively, ensures alignment with national and 
<br/>international goals enhancing funding opportunities.  Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this partnership 
<br/>is anticipated to lead to improve housing outcomes and greater community resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  heard  rightfully,  the  honourable  Minister 
<br/></span><span>mentioned that they will be providing assistance to six informal settlements within the greater Suva 
<br/>area to cater for clean drinking water. My question to the honourable Minister is, we have done a 
<br/>$300 million Viria Water Project. What went wrong with this particular project that we actually have 
<br/>to fork out more money to cater for clean drinking water, especially in the greater Suva area whereby 
<br/>we had invested $300 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  it  is  imperative  for  us  to  actually  assist  informal  settlements,  my  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, what about the formal settlements around these informal settlements that are 
<br/>actually  facing  this  water  disruption  till  to-date  because  of  theses  informal  settlements?  The 
<br/>infrastructure was only done for the formal settlements, not to cater for informal settlements. One 
<br/>common example, I would actually give, in Vatuwaqa, there is a 4- inch pipe running for the formal 
<br/>settlements and then there is a 200 to 300 additional connections throughout the Wailea Informal 
<br/>Settlement and Nanuku. The formal settlements are also facing the same issue. So why is preference 
<br/>only given to informal settlements and not to include the formal settlements in this area?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  I 
<br/>think the assistance that is fully supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
<br/>is to support the vulnerable families.  These are the poor of the poorest. These are people who do not 
<br/>have access to infrastructure that is supplied by the State. These are the people who live on the edges 
<br/>of the town and do not have access to the basic services or amenities.  I think we should be thankful 
<br/>that this Government has come on board to support these families, not from our budget but it will be 
<br/>funded by the New Zealand Government with the support of the Monash University in Australia.  I 
<br/>think this is a very good initiative and we should be supportive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  one  area  that  is  also  going  to  support  the  government  in  the  provision  of  these  basic 
<br/>services to some of these settlements that have been there without the process of going through the 
<br/>respective agencies and ministries to support some of these settlements.  In a way, the funding is to 
<br/>support the poor of the poorest, those that actually do not have access to basic services and amenities.  
<br/>The issue with some of these informal settlements that face the difficulty with the supply of water to 
<br/>formal settlements, that is something that the Ministry is looking at right now is how best we can 
<br/>identify some spaces where we can actually relocate some of these settlements and also provide them 
<br/></span><span>with  the  basic  necessities,  proper  piping,  proper  infrastructure  to  assist  some  of  these  informal 
<br/></span><span>settlements.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2083 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted  by  the  honourable  Minister,  this 
<br/>partnership arrangement started in 2019 and it is almost like six years now.  Of course, the project 
<br/>was disrupted by COVID-19.  My question to the honourable Minister is how long is the tenure of 
<br/>the  Technical  Advisor’s  role  and  what  are  the  expected  milestone  or  deliverables  under  his 
<br/>leadership?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme will go up to 2029 as I had also 
<br/>mentioned in my speech.  Some of the key roles of the Technical Advisor is to assist the Ministry to 
<br/>providing  technical  support.    Currently  you  must  have  also  heard  and  seen  in  the  news  that  the 
<br/>Ministry of Housing is doing a Review of the National Housing Policy.  We have an advisor from 
<br/>the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade currently now with the team going around 
<br/>our areas where the consultations will be held, supporting the Ministry in the review and the Ministry 
<br/>has found it very positive on the contribution provided by the Technical Advisor and also going to 
<br/>help  the  Ministry  in  providing  institutional  support  and  capabilities  in  strengthening  the  systems 
<br/>within  the  Ministry  of  Housing.    Like  having  a  database  in  place,  that  is  something  the  support 
<br/>officers will need an expertise to support the Ministry in providing these various core responsibilities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based on my delivery, I have also mentioned that profiling will continue but depending on 
<br/></span><span>the Parliamentary support by the New Zealand Government.  As long as we need assistance from 
<br/></span><span>them, they will continue to assist the Fijian Government as well as the Ministry of Housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand the consultation started in 2021 and 
<br/>2022 because the work was substantially done.  How much more time do you think it will take for us 
<br/>to finalise the National Housing Policy considering that in the last two budgets, we are not talking 
<br/>about finalising, we are talking about implementation when we have heard from you that one has to 
<br/>finalise the policy first? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the timeline for the Ministry is to complete and 
<br/>also forward to Cabinet for approval before the end of this year.  Once we finish all our consultations, 
<br/>after  completion  of  the  report,  we  will  have  to  report  back  to  Cabinet  for  endorsement  and 
<br/>confirmation of the review of the National Housing Policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I wanted to add some more on these informal things and how it is kind of 
<br/>chewed in heavily into the coffers of Government, especially to do with formal and informal, water 
<br/>supply, electricity and roads. I think we covered this substantially in the last few years, but the policy 
<br/>of the Government has changed a lot. We never used to encourage this before but since it is a human 
<br/>rights issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Previous governments have kind of lent some ears to how the unfortunate and people who 
<br/>cannot afford could be helped. The outcome of that is chewed into the formal sector on the water 
<br/>supply, roading, electricity because people were looking for their votes both in the Local Government 
<br/>and in the National Elections, that has brought about the change.  So, the formal sector will have to 
<br/>bear with the sharing of all these benefits so to speak, that has changed a lot.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I remember asking the honourable Premila Kumar when she was the Minister for Housing, 
<br/>can we not relax the town planning stringent conditions? Instead of curbed and tarsealed road, we go 
<br/>for gravel?  Just some kind of subdivision where, at least, peg marks of the allotment are clearly 
<br/>demarcated, and we will be able to re-establish the boundaries again. But again, the reply that was 
<br/>provided was, what  we  give out  to  be the same; same for those that can  afford and  same  for the 
<br/>housing to help the poor, to get the title. To get a proper title you need the proper infrastructure and 
<br/></span><span>that is highly expensive, very costly.  The Government has to bear that.

<div><span>Operational Procedures - Monitoring and Regulation    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 240/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament on the operational procedures to monitor and regulate the 
<br/>movement of small boats travelling between islands? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question which have also been alluded to slightly this morning. There have been challenges and we 
<br/>do agree and as acknowledged in terms of the monitoring and regulations of small boats travelling 
<br/>between our coastal communities, between islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First and foremost, the safety of small boats and monitoring rests with the boat owners and 
<br/>boat masters.  If they are certified, they do know what to do and they are trained in it. What MSAF 
<br/>is working on now is to establish, the current problem we have is the monitoring and implementation 
<br/>of the regulations down to village level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  MSAF  officers  based  at  various  locations,  but  they  cannot  cover  or  monitor 
<br/>everything.  Sir, MSAF is currently working on consultations on a MOU with the Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs  for  the  engagement  and  assistance  of  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro,  </span><span>or  </span><span>Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>  as  a  sort  of 
<br/>Enforcement Officers or Compliance.  This could involve: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>checks on registration of small boats to ensure that these small boats have been serviced 
<br/>and registered; 
<br/>have the right safety equipment; 
<br/>those who are operating it are qualified of the Certificate of Competency; 
<br/>able to provide advice to boat owners in terms of the weather situation, right advice on 
<br/>passenger  loading  capacity  and  in  terms  of  communication  channels  available  or  in 
<br/>instances of emergencies; 
<br/>closely liaising with the stakeholders such as the local police; and  
<br/>able to submit some kind of monthly report as part of the monthly report that is required 
<br/>with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Minister for his response. The point here is on the enforcement aspects.  I understand the big picture 
<br/></span><span>at the strategic level, the laws and regulations that has been in place.  I just wanted to bring this to 
<br/>the attention of the honourable Minister.   It  is  a  tough  job  on the ground, and  I am  trying to  use 
<br/>Taveuni as an example.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, as a matter of just an exercise, I deployed a small team from Naselesele Village 
<br/>to monitor the boats that are coming from Taveuni to Matei Landing; 13 arrived at Matei Landing 
<br/>between 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.  Out of the 13, only are few were wearing flak jackets, and the list went 
<br/>on.  This morning, the team was deployed again.  There were 14 boats that arrived from Qamea and 
<br/></span><span>not many were wearing those flak jackets or life jackets.  When they were asked, they said, “we left 
<br/></span><span>it at home.” where they asked and they said, oh we left it at home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question to the honourable Minister, can we review the </span><span>modus operandi</span><span> at the operational 
<br/>level or tactical level?  I know the resources are limited, but it can be done. There are many hands on 
<br/></span><span>the ground that could be used just to make sure that it does not result in any of these undue situations 
<br/></span><span>that may cost us more, moreso of a life.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2085 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  you  reply  to  that,  I  recalled  the  statement  shared  by  honourable 
<br/>Naupoto, the Standing Committee travelled from Vanua Levu to Taveuni on two open punts, very 
<br/>little  was  seen  on  the  safety  aspects  of  that  travel.    That  included  the  Parliamentary  Standing 
<br/>Committee.  No life jackets were seen, but these were the ones that were always traversing these two 
<br/>islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Sir,  as  I  mentioned,  the  regulations  are  there,  it  is  just  the 
<br/>monitoring,  and  I  suppose  the  components  of  monitoring  and  enforcement.  As  I  have  already 
<br/>mentioned, the infrastructure of the Ministry of the iTaukei Affairs is there, and we are working with 
<br/>them in terms of some of their personnel on how best to do the enforcement and the monitoring.  I 
<br/>suppose the other part is,  what  is  the responsibility of the community themselves, and that is  the 
<br/>wider awareness and respect in terms of observing safety protocols.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From what I have seen, even crossing rivers in my province, that is a requirement, but they 
<br/>do it once there is an Enforcement Officer there.  Once they move away, then it goes back to the old 
<br/>practice.  I suppose it is a general attitude in society in terms of safety.  I suppose a lot are saying that 
<br/>they are </span><span>kai wai</span><span>, but no one is a </span><span>kai wai,</span><span> only the fish, I suppose.  Yes, it would involve a community 
<br/>wide or nationwide change in attitude amongst our people.  I mean not another taskforce, but just 
<br/></span><span>starting from us.  I have been guilty of not wearing a life jacket crossing a river, so if the Members 
<br/></span><span>of the Standing Committee, I am not sure whether they wore it or not.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBER.- We did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You did, okay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  for  us,  Ministers  of  Members  of  Parliament  can  send  out  that  message  as  we  are 
<br/>travelling then that will be good. I am not perfect, I have not practiced it too, but it is something that 
<br/>we need to do.  It is just an attitude change.  Because Taveuni has been used as an example today, I 
<br/>would like to request the </span><span>Turaga Tui Cakau</span><span>…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You only have one marine  checker?  We have only one marine checker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- On the island of Taveuni,  yet we have so many </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span>.  How do 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we get the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> or even the villagers?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  We  will  work  on  that  with  our  various  stakeholders  and 
<br/>ministries, and I request you, Sir, as the paramount chief to also assist with Naselesele and the </span><span>tikina</span><span>
<br/>in that regard.  We all have to work together in this regard - maritime safety.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  supplementary  question.    I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for his explanation.  It gets a bit worrying to see the actual play that is going on 
<br/>the ground.  There are people travelling from Vanuabalavu to Cicia,  and they are travelling from 
<br/>Moala to Matuku and to Totoya.  I just wanted to ask the question if the honourable Minister think 
<br/>that by, it is a financial return that forces the boat operators to continue?  If a fine or some kind of 
<br/>responsibility is given to the boat drivers and the owners just to stop them, it is a huge responsibility 
<br/>of running in the middle of the ocean with a small fibre glass boat.  Does the honourable Minister 
<br/>think in the same line as I am thinking? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is the in regulations, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- No enforcement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- the enforcement part is identifying the offender and imposing 
<br/>the fine.  There needs to be people there who are identifying and enforcing.  In addition to what I 
<br/>mentioned, with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, we are also increasing the number of enforcement 
<br/>officers.  I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance for 
<br/>his thoughts in also assisting us in terms of maritime safety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is strange to see, even to hear these open boats travelling from Vanua 
<br/>Levu to Tuvalu.  You would be surprised.  They are frequent users of this passage, the open boat, the 
<br/>punts with no life jackets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just have a question for the honourable Minister 
<br/>given this rural area experience.  As much as we want to enforce the law, one of the huge problems 
<br/>that people in the rural areas face is access to the items, life jackets, flares, et cetera.  That is the usual 
<br/>feedback to us.  Why do you make laws but not get these equipment readily accessible to us? It is not 
<br/>a new issue, honourable Minister but probably something that you need to consider or if you have 
<br/>already considered, what is the plan?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- From my understanding, at the beginning when the survey is 
<br/>done, they have it there. I think after that, I am not sure, they go and store it away or something.  That 
<br/>is a good suggestion.  These things are expensive too and we have to fork out the cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Finance might look at subsidizing some of these items to assist 
<br/>our rural and maritime operators. That is an option. He is shaking his head. We respond in a positive 
<br/>way to your suggestions and that is something that we will definitely look into. It is not only that, it 
<br/>is the flares and a few other items, the costs have gone up a bit which we need to assist the operators 
<br/>with as they do not earn a high income, they are mostly our rural and maritime community members 
<br/>who have subsistence income.  I believe they should be assisted with some sort of subsidy. Thank 
<br/>you for the suggestion, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Life jackets are very expensive. The latest ones look just like a shirt. Not 
<br/>like the big thick ones that we used to have before. These are now in the market but as you said, 
<br/>honourable Minister, they are really expensive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just two suggestions to the honourable Minister: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The introduction for survival swimming, especially in our maritime areas. If your Ministry 
<br/>and MSAF can work with the Ministry of Education as one of the way forward as well as 
<br/>Fiji Navy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>A reduction of boat marshals’ fees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  We  note  that,  we  have  received  those  requests  and  we  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>working on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measures to Improve Nadi and Lautoka Water Supply  
<br/>(Question No. 241/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/></span><span>Transport update Parliament on what measures are being undertaken to improve the water 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="42">Page 42</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2087 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supply in the Nadi-Lautoka areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I thank the honourable Sakiusa Tubuna for his question. Sir, 
<br/>with the rapid expansion of the Nadi-Lautoka urban areas, a population of approximately 220,000, 
<br/>the  Government  of  the  day  sees  it  fit  under  the  Water  Sector  Strategy  2050  to  account  for  an 
<br/>investment  of  approximately  $397  million  in  the water  sector  and  approximately  $1.22  billion  in 
<br/>sanitation by 2050. The measures shall also address the increasing demand for water and wastewater 
<br/>services by the tourism sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the two financial years, 2023-2024, 2024-2025, the Water Authority of Fiji through the 
<br/>funding  support  of  the  Fiji  Government  is  investing  approximately  $47  million  into  water  and 
<br/>wastewater  infrastructure  upgrades  in  order  that  these  projects  are  aligned  to  the  Water  Sector 
<br/>Strategy 2050 Plan against strategic outcomes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Access to clean and efficient water services; and 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Access to safe sanitation services which of course is aligned to Section 35 and 36 of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijian Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The significant investment is focussed on improving redundancy and capacity of both water 
<br/></span><span>and wastewater systems ensuring that they can cater for existing and future demand. Some of these 
<br/>ongoing projects, Varaqe to Saru Water Treatment Plant Pipeline Works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Varaqe  Dam  and  Saru  Water  Treatment  Plant  were  first  established  in  1959  and  the 
<br/>infrastructure, particularly the raw water trunk mains has age significantly over the past 64 years. 
<br/>These assets have not undergone substantial upgrades. Frequent operational issues, natural disasters 
<br/>and environmental wear have compromised the reliability of this system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  address  these  challenges  a  robust  design  with  improved  pipe  material  is  being 
<br/>implemented to enhance the resiliency and water conveyance capacity totalling project cost of $9.7 
<br/>million which should be completed by December 2024 and Nagado to Nadele trunk mains upgrading 
<br/>works. The Nadi-Lautoka water system faces a supply demand gap of 4.4 megalitres per day or 5.4 
<br/>million  litres  per  day  due  to  outdated  infrastructure  and  insufficient  treatment  and  conveyance 
<br/>capacity.    To  address  these  gaps  WAF  is  upgrading  the  trunk  mains  which  will  ensure  a  better 
<br/>hydraulic performance, improve redundancy and provide flexibility in operations between Nadi and 
<br/>Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The project cost $8.3 million, duration of 44 weeks, completion date approximately estimated 
<br/>to be December 2024. And of course, I had mentioned prior to the upgrading of the Nagado Water 
<br/>Treatment Plant capacity, the Nagado Water Treatment Plant was originally commissioned in 1982 
<br/>with a capacity of 45 megalitres per day (MLD) and that has been incrementally upgraded to current 
<br/>capacity of 90 MLD. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the plant faces operational challenges. Frequently processing raw water exceeding 
<br/>its  design  capacity  due  to  increased  demand.  In  addition,  fluctuating  raw  water  quality  from  the 
<br/>Vaturu  Dam  has  exacerbated  production  limitation  and  water  quality  compliance  issues.  To 
<br/>progressively address this, water authorities installed an additional 20 MLD package treatment plant 
<br/>to increase the treatment capacity, costing $14.6 million and completion date first quarter of 2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  setbacks  have  been  experienced  due  break-ins  and  thefts  of  key  essential 
<br/>components and I am requesting to the public to please respect our assets in terms of our public assets 
<br/></span><span>supplying basic necessities such as water and even roads and other infrastructure. In addition to those, 
<br/></span><span>the planned upgrading of the Wastewater Pump Station and rising main from Denarau Island to the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Treatment Plant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I had already mentioned the current plant was established in the 1970s for the capacity 
<br/>for one or two hotels and not the number of hotels which are there now and planned. So, we need to 
<br/>expand that to accommodate the growing demand for further developments and the pump stations 
<br/>are now operating at the maximum capacity, costing about $15 million and that has been tendered 
<br/>and we are looking at 24 to 36 months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the upgrading of the existing Navakai Wastewater Treatment Plant, this has been 
<br/>there for quite some time and work needs to be done in terms of that to relieve the load and cater for 
<br/>additional wastewater connections which envisage up to 2040. For the Denarau Plant, collaboration 
<br/>has been established with Denarau Corporation Limited and Ministry of Tourism in terms of design 
<br/>and  input  and  also  the  load.  So,  we  are  looking  forward  to  that  project,  ensuring  the  future 
<br/>sustainability of water and wastewater services on Denarau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major contributor to Fiji's GDP through the tourism industry. So, this project represents 
<br/>major commitments from the Coalition Government and of course acknowledging the building on 
<br/>the work of the last government, which is of course to be commended, in which we prioritise long 
<br/></span><span>term development of water and sanitation services across the country in key economic areas such as 
<br/></span><span>Nadi and Lautoka. Again, that is the developments which we look forward to, to cater not only for 
<br/>the current challenges, but also  the future demands as we move forward in the Nadi and Lautoka 
<br/>areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I thank the honourable 
<br/>Minister for his explanation however, I hope he knows that Nadi has Akhil  Sam in Nawaicoba. I 
<br/>hope you know that. Is the Coalition Government  considering of utilising Akhil  Dam  to  ease the 
<br/>water problem in Nadi because Akhil Mines has a huge volume of water and can ease majority of 
<br/>that problem. You can utilise that dam for the water problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Nawaicoba dam, which dam? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Akhil mine dam. I hope you went to that site, Nawaicoba  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Akhil mines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Yes, in Rada, Nawaicoba. I think most of them do not know about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you. We will definitely look into that suggestion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for providing an update on the measures being undertaken to improve the water supply in 
<br/>the Nadi and Lautoka area. I believe every effort should be made to provide clean water to people. 
<br/>People who live close to Vuda Reservoir, in Lautoka, have raised some concerns and that is regarding 
<br/>fencing and security at the reservoir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to them, the reservoir area should be properly fenced, and it should be protected 
<br/>by security, especially at night time, so that the youths do not consume alcohol in the area. That is 
<br/>current practice in that area and my question to the honourable Minister. Are there plans to have the 
<br/></span><span>reservoir  area,  especially  this  Vuda  reservoir  area  secured  so  that  the  reservoir  water  is  not 
<br/></span><span>contaminated and safe for consumption?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2089 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, in terms of the specific location, we will definitely look 
<br/>into that, but normally there is a facility or asset you secure that and ensure that it is secured, that is 
<br/>my  understanding  from  what  I  know  have  security  or  those  who  are  caretakers  there,  but  that  is 
<br/>something I have to check in terms of what you have mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nadi and Lautoka are heavily populated areas 
<br/>and of course we need to support the tourism sector. I know the previous government has done direct 
<br/>lines to some of these facilities, but our ability to respond when it comes to times of emergency, the 
<br/>previous government has purchased package plants. So, what is there in your plan about building 
<br/>upon this capability so that we can respond to this request particularly that water is a basic need?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had mentioned we have the Fiji Water 
<br/>Strategy 2050 which is an assessment of water resources and needs in Fiji and the strategy to address 
<br/>those. So, it is all there in the strategy and that is the plan which we are working on implementing. 
<br/>And it also includes package plants and extending pipelines in addressing areas where the needs for 
<br/>water in terms of not only the urban but rural needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, we the Government has budgeted $5 million, close to $6 million in terms of expanding 
<br/></span><span>water sources which will cover the boreholes and that is something which the Ministry of Lands and 
<br/></span><span>Water Authority of Fiji and our ministries is working on in terms of implementation and ensuring 
<br/>that those come online to the various committees who are in need of that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Yes, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F. S. KOYA.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand your very comprehensive response, you 
<br/>spoke about waste water treatment plants now, with respect to Nadi and Lautoka both waste water 
<br/>treatment plants sit right at the entrance of the City and the town. Are there plans, or do you have any 
<br/>immediate plans, or in the future to move those wastewater plants outside of the City limits or actually 
<br/>putting it somewhere you do not actually get the smell wafting through the cities in the towns and 
<br/>closer to Denarau, Nadi.  I know it is in-between the towns, centre and going towards Denarau, and 
<br/>Lautoka is  right at the entrance of the town at Natabua. Have you got plans to move entirely the 
<br/>wastewater treatment plants into an area where it is not going to affect the general public? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU  –  Yes,  there  are.  Wastewater  is  an  area  which  we  have  not 
<br/>developed satisfactorily, in terms of stances and needs, in order to serve up the population so, that is 
<br/>an ongoing assessment.  I know that some of the landowners do not want this water treatment near 
<br/>their areas so, there is a current assessment of some of the locations in terms of the viability of them 
<br/>being here and there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, alternative locations, and of course we have to do a cost benefit analysis in terms of 
<br/>moving that. And if there are plans for further developing or moving then we need to have a financing 
<br/>models to support that. So that is something, it is an ongoing work in terms of what the Ministry and 
<br/>the Water Authority of Fiji is doing.

<div><span>seen enough of me today.  Oh no, you still have some more! You are a very popular Minister, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.–  So,  I  am  referring  to  Standing  Order  42(1),  where  the 
<br/>maximum number of questions to be asked of a Minister is two. But I think the interpretation of that 
<br/>might need to be looked at the Business Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anyway,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.  So,  in  the  Water  Sector  2050 
<br/>Strategy, if we could all read that so in the next one and a half years, I do not get asked any more 
<br/>questions. But, anyway, jokes aside, it is quite critical and important document. There is a plan for a 
<br/>10 mega litre reservoir in Wainadoi and network extension at a cost of $25 billion by 2030, plus a 3 
<br/>mega litre Navua Water Treatment Plant and power extension at $8 million by 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of this specific question on Vunitaqala Settlement. In 2022, Rotary Water Pacific 
<br/></span><span>undertook some upgrading work in the neighbouring of Maqumaqua Village where new pipes were 
<br/></span><span>laid  to  connect  Vunitaqala  Settlement.  Unfortunately,  due  to  funding  constraints,  this  was  not 
<br/>completed to Vunitaqala but Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) has initiated discussions with Rotary 
<br/>Pacific in order to relook at the scope and plan engagement with this settlement, to ensure that there 
<br/>is no overlap in project responsibilities moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is still in that stage, relooking at the full scope and we will liaise with the community 
<br/>for another submission to be made, but with required mandatory documents to be made with their 
<br/>submission  including  the  normal  land  access  or  access  before  any  work  is  done.  Once  these  are 
<br/>provided, WAF will be in a position to conduct a feasibility study of the water source and work with 
<br/>the Department of Water and Sewage in terms of the water supply management plan, and we could 
<br/>consider it moving forward in the next budget.

<div><span>Update – National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027 
<br/>(Question No. 243/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services update Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the National HIV Surge Strategy 2024-2027? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the National HIV Surge Strategy for 2024 – 2027, that has been developed as a 
<br/>response to this sharp and persistence rise in the new cases of HIV in Fiji.  As I have mentioned, a 
<br/>number of time UNAIDS - Global AIDS Monitoring Report of 2022 reported that since 2010, the 
<br/>estimated number of new infections in Fiji has risen by 260 percent and unfortunately, we are the 
<br/>second fastest growing epidemic in the Asia Pacific, only behind Philippines (I believe) and we have 
<br/>surpassed Papua New Guinea as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2021, just to show some context in terms of the data, the Ministry recorded a new HIV 
<br/></span><span>cases in the hundreds for the first time since we reported our first case some 35 years ago in 1989. 
<br/></span><span>There were 121 new HIV cases in 2021, 245 new cases in 2022, 450 new cases in 2023 and for this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2091 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year in the first six months, we have recorded 552 new cases. Out of those, for this year alone from 
<br/>January till June, 552 new cases, 97 percent were diagnosed in adults and 3 percent, or 12 cases were 
<br/>diagnosed in children less than ten years old.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Divisionally,  Sir,  the  Central  and  Eastern  Divisions  recorded  69  percent  or  380  new  HIV 
<br/>cases. The Western Division recorded 27 percent or 151 new cases. The Northern Division recorded 
<br/>3 percent of 19 new HIV cases. The male gender is the most affected with 69 percent or 381 new 
<br/>HIV cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, this has also increased with 14 infections 
<br/>who were diagnosed in newborn babies in 2022, eight in 2023 and so far, in 2024, six from the period 
<br/>of January to June this year. Also, on the same period, 15 percent of more than 552 new cases who 
<br/>were amongst those with injectable illicit drugs. AIDS rated deaths has also increased over the years, 
<br/>with 25 deaths in 2021; 46 in 2022; 82 in 2023; and currently we have 13 deaths in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the strategy, that was developed following a wider consultation 
<br/>between  the  stakeholders  within  the  Government  and  then  the  community  as  well.  Consultation 
<br/>forums on the strategy organised by the Family Health Division of the Ministry, were attended by 
<br/></span><span>the representatives from the faith-based organisations, community support, advocacy groups, partner 
<br/></span><span>government  agencies,  civil  society  organisations  and  non-governmental  organisations  and  their 
<br/>contributions and insights have been captured in the strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Input from the Permanent Secretary Sub-Committee on HIV and Illicit Drugs and the HIV 
<br/>Board have been incorporated both senior level bodies have endorsed the Strategy. So, through these 
<br/>consultations, the Surge Strategy has been harmonised with the National Counter-Narcotics Strategy 
<br/>of 2023-2028, which Cabinet had endorsed and is now being implemented. We are not alone in terms 
<br/>of  assistance  from  our  international  technical  organisations  such  as  World  Health  Organisation 
<br/>(WHO), Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the Kirby Institute of the 
<br/>University of New South Wales in Australia, who have actively participated in the formulation of the 
<br/>Strategy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the HIV Board through its mandated pro under the HIV Act of 2011, have also endorsed 
<br/>the setting  up  of two  multi-sectoral  taskforces to facilitate the implementation  and roll out  of the 
<br/>Strategy.  Cabinet  on  12</span><span>th</span><span>  September,  2024  has  also  endorsed  the  National  HIV  Strategy 
<br/>Implementation. Over the months ahead, the Ministry through the taskforces and with the support of 
<br/>our technical and community partners will roll out the strategy to the whole of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People may ask what does the Strategy comprise? There are five priority areas that addresses 
<br/>the  need  to  increase  public  awareness  and  understanding  of  HIV  infections.  Reduce  HIV 
<br/>transmissions and expedite public health response, treatment, care, human rights and social justice 
<br/>for people living with HIV. The goal of the strategy is to enhance early diagnosis, ensure effective 
<br/>treatment,  achieve  sustain  vile  suppression  and  foster  a  supportive  environment  free  of  stigma, 
<br/>discrimination, to improve quality of life for individuals living with HIV and reduce transmission 
<br/>rates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to be on the record to say to members of the Parliament and to those that are listening 
<br/>in, that before we see a reduction in the number of cases, Fiji will see a rise in the number of cases. 
<br/>Simply for the fact, that our programmes are increasing testing, so numbers will increase before we 
<br/>start to see the numbers decrease, due to the effectiveness of this strategy, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another important point to note as well, being diagnosed with HIV now, is no longer a death 
<br/></span><span>sentence. With appropriate treatment, people living with HIV can live a productive, fulfilling  life,

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributing  effectively  to  their  families,  their  communities  and  to  Fiji  as  a  whole.  I  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Speaker for the opportunity to share briefly on the National HIV Surge Strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his reply. It was 
<br/>quite  shocking  to  hear  that  we  have  surpassed  Papua  New  Guinea.  We  used  to  have  a  regional 
<br/>response to HIV, but at the moment, we are talking about the biggest cause being the “blue-toothing.” 
<br/>There have also been in some quarters saying that one of the reasons for the rise is the lack of money 
<br/>that is going into preventative health and research.  If that is true for this, how does the Ministry make 
<br/>sure that it does not happen in other areas?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there used to be a 2013 regional response where they had some funding, but once that 
<br/>stopped it had an impact on this. I am just wondering how the honourable Minister is looking at how 
<br/>to  make sure that preventative funding is  coming and the  research, so we do not have these kind 
<br/>things happening in the future, not only HIV, but in other areas too.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Since  taking  office,  I  have  been  briefed  on 
<br/></span><span>UNAIDS  and  its  role  on  HIV  in  Fiji,  even  though  the  numbers  have  decreased,  but  they  have 
<br/></span><span>maintained a staff at the UN office. In terms of the funding, yes, to note there was a decrease when 
<br/>coming in, but there has been some renewed assistance since taking office, and since announcing the 
<br/>numbers and that has been very much forthcoming within our development partners, mainly DFAT 
<br/>that have put in funding through WHO.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was privy to that handing over ceremony back in Geneva and other development partners 
<br/>are  stepping  up  and  assisting  us  in  this  space.  Yes,  I  do  agree  the,  the  funding  for  research,  the 
<br/>preventative side of it. That is why the Surge Strategy will capture those issues especially on the 
<br/>prevention side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of a budgetary allocation, there have been an increasing budgetary on consumables, 
<br/>especially with testing the capabilities and that is why not only that, together we have used the UN 
<br/>agencies platform in terms of purchasing that has been endorsed by Cabinet. So, we are using that 
<br/>platform to allow them to buy for us the drugs, consumables testing things to enable us to do more. 
<br/>As I have said, we will see a rise in the numbers before we see a fall, and the strategy we will direct 
<br/>us in the way should go forward based on evidence and mostly based on data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think there should be more awareness done here, because we need to take 
<br/>in mind the new cases that we have enough of HIV,  it is 500 just for the first six months of this year. 
<br/>That is quite alarming! Perhaps if the honourable Members would be able to come up with some 
<br/>ideas as to how best you can inform the members of the public of the seriousness of the case that we 
<br/>have. We have drugs that has already been highlighted well, but no HIV. It is kind of lingering around 
<br/>us all the time and now there is a sudden increase. I think the concern is very much there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that help the advocating, we used 
<br/>to have champions. Ratu Epeli Nailatikau, the former President and former Speaker was a very visible 
<br/>champion of this issue. So, I think those sorts of things, people in prominent positions, he used to 
<br/>actually take things out of his pocket at events. I think that was getting something like that from a 
<br/>person of that stature really helped to get that message across. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Perhaps you may be able choose one amongst yourselves as to be the new 
<br/></span><span>champion. You put the condoms and everything in your pocket and we should not be ashamed of it. 
<br/></span><span>Ratu Nailatikau did hell of a work there, “put it on bring it on” that is what he usually says.
