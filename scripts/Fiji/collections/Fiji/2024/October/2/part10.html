<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to todayâ€™s sitting, those joining us in the gallery and those 
<br/>watching the proceedings on television and the internet.  Thank you for your continued interest in 
<br/>the workings of your Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Year 8 students and Teachers of Yat 
<br/>Sen Primary School.  I know you did your very best in your Eighth Year Exams last week, but it does 
<br/>not stop there, children.  So, keep on doing your best in school, and welcome to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have some of your colleagues from that famous school of Yat Sen sitting here amongst 
<br/>us.  I will not name them but, at least, they should be able to come around and meet and talk with 
<br/>you, just to encourage you.  You stay on course in the studies that you are doing, and who knows, 
<br/>maybe one day you will end up like your former school mates who are here with us in Parliament.  
<br/>All the best!  
<br/></span></div>
