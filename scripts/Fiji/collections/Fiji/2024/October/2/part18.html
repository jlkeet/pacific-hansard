<div><span>SPECIAL INVESTIGATION REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES FOR ADB MEETING 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Review  of  the  Special  Investigation  Report  on 
<br/>Procurement of Goods and Services in relation to the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> Asian Development Bank 
<br/></span><span>Annual Meeting which was tabled on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers 
<br/>and honourable Members of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, to move the motion, I 
<br/>take this opportunity to speak on the motion for the Review of the Special Investigation Report on 
<br/>Procurement of Goods and Services in relation to the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> Asian Development Bank Annual General 
<br/>Meeting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  will  not  go  into  the  background  in  much  detail  but  basically  it  is  an 
<br/>investigation of plausible material mismanagement in the Ministry of Public Service focussing on 
<br/>funds used for the hosting of the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> Asian Development Bank Annual General Meeting in Nadi in 
<br/>2019 where we spent a total of $10.9 million VAT inclusive price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from going through the Report of the Office of the Auditor-General, the Committee on 
<br/></span><span>22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, invited the Ministry of Public Service for a written response as well as a presentation 
<br/>on the issues raised. The Ministry of Finance was also invited to clarify issues, as well as the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance Internal Audit team which carried out the preliminary audit with the discussion or written 
<br/>response from Ms. Susan Kiran, the former Permanent Secretary.  Unfortunately, due to the lapse of 
<br/>time, some of those responsible had left and could not be able to include them including the then 
<br/>Permanent Secretary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The summary of findings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the three objectives to ascertain if a 
<br/>fraud exists in payments. The Office of the Auditor-General  found that there was sufficient  audit 
<br/>evidence to determine if there was an existence of fraud.  The second is to ascertain if payments were 
<br/>made in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We found that generally there was non-compliance or there were anomalies on payments and 
<br/></span><span>the inability to manage the conflict of interest arising from the appointment of the Events Transport 
<br/></span><span>Provider.  Then there was the issue of non-compliance on payments due to the lack of capacity, lack

<div><span>Special Investigation Review Report –   
<br/>Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of segregation of duties and timely planning. There is also significant delays in the processing of 
<br/>ADB meeting events major contracts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Objective 3 is on the limitation of the FMIS system over the processing of payments or other 
<br/>transactions to provide avenues for the misappropriation of Government funds.  The Office of the 
<br/>Auditor-General noted that limitation existed in the FMIS.  The FMIS at that time allowed reopening 
<br/>of prior year’s open account payables and there was no document, policy and guideline in place to 
<br/>assist the user on FMIS.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What the Committee found in addition to the findings by the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>was that the main cause of weakness was the setup of a project team by the Ministry of Civil Service. 
<br/>This consisted of contractors and civil servants with poor coordination amongst the civil servants 
<br/>leading to the low level of accountability. We found that there were issues with the Ministry of Civil 
<br/>Service that they were not able to manage the level of funding of around $10 million. They did not 
<br/>have an Accounts Department to manage the payments process. There was no Standard Operation 
<br/>Procedure (SOP) or even a Finance Manual for that matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An important issue, the report itself was late even when it was completed in December 2020, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it came to Parliament on 27</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023. That was around three years later.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is  good that the investigation was not  conducted as  subsequent  to  the 
<br/>Report,  improvements  were  done  by  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  and  the  current  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary who managed to forward the cases and the report to FICAC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I submit this Report to the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>I have a list with me provided by the Whips.  Before I go into that, please be reminded honourable 
<br/>Members this is another case, $10 million is involved here of taxpayers’ funds which and it needs 
<br/>close scrutiny and oversight as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The batting will be as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.A. Maharaj;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small &amp; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises;     
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.K. Ravunawa;  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute briefly 
<br/>on this Special Investigations Report on the 52nd Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting which 
<br/>was held in Denarau.  More than 3,582 attendees from both public and private sectors, visitors from 
<br/>around 76 countries and over 30 side meetings, seminars and debates took place during that particular 
<br/>Annual General Meeting.  Nevertheless, the initial budget for this particular event was $19 million 
<br/>and was then revised to $10 million but the actual amount used was $10.9 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  event  gave  us  a  good  economic  advantage  and  prosperous  to  Fiji 
<br/>because if we recall, soon after this particular Annual General Meeting, we went into COVID-19.  It 
<br/></span><span>was through the negotiations that took place in this particular Convention that we were able to secure 
<br/></span><span>some interest-free loan during COVID-19. There were also certain loans that were approved during 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Investigation Review Report –   
<br/>Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2117 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COVID-19 which resulted from the negotiations in this meeting whereby we did not have to pay for 
<br/>quite a number of years and after that, then we had to pay the sum amount and not the interest because 
<br/>it was given to us at zero percent interest. If we look at it in entirety, some of these amounts would 
<br/>have been in a way, 50 percent was supposed to be paid by the government and 50 percent was issued 
<br/>to the Government in terms of grants.  These were some of the advantages that came through after 
<br/>having  an  event  of  this magnitude.    Never  ever  before  we  actually  had  an  event  in  Fiji  with  this 
<br/>magnitude, mostly what we would actually have overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  nevertheless,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  findings  were  quite  interesting  when  we  started 
<br/>investigating into this Report because whether it was $10, $100 or in this case $10 million, if there 
<br/>is a mismanagement of funds, it needs to be investigated.  If there is any kind of fraudulent act that 
<br/>has  been  performed,  it  should  be  referred  to  the  appropriate  authorities.    In  this  case,  what  was 
<br/>actually surprising was that after this event, someone went into FMIS and voiding all the payments, 
<br/>not just for this year but going back to 2015.  What also was surprising was the Chief Accounting 
<br/>Officer not doing anything about this particular case.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These were some of the things that raised the eyebrows of the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/></span><span>because  then  there  was  also  an  investigation  conducted  by  Internal  Audit  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/></span><span>Finance and these two reports were assessed by the Office of the Auditor-General before they carried 
<br/>out this independent investigation into ADB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we look at the amount of money that was mis-appropriated, it was close to around $10,000.  
<br/>If we look at the ratio around $10 million to $10,000, it comes to around 0.1 percent.  But as I have 
<br/>said, a mismanagement is a mismanagement.  In this case, what we have seen when the Ministry of 
<br/>Civil Service was created, they had a budget of close to around $1.5 million to $3 million only.  But 
<br/>then when there was  a reform in the Ministry of Health, the doctor’s salary was transferred from 
<br/>Ministry of Health to Ministry of Civil Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Chief Accounting Officer at that point in time, who was the Permanent Secretary should 
<br/>have developed a fully-fledged Accounts Department in the Ministry of Civil Service.  What was 
<br/>happening,  they  were  relying  on  the  Accounts  Department  from  the  Ministry  of  Employment.  
<br/>Basically, the staff were loaned from the Ministry of Employment to the Ministry of Civil Service to 
<br/>look after close to around $40 million which was the salary of the doctors.  Then when we actually 
<br/>had the event of this magnitude of around $10 million which was precedence in the sense that we 
<br/>never had this kind of event prior to this, the Ministry of Civil Service opted to take it on board and 
<br/></span><span>without realising that they do not have a formal Accounts Department within the Civil Service.  When 
<br/></span><span>they actually started negotiating, going in, preparing for this particular event, that was the time all 
<br/>these mismanagement, misappropriation and data actually started to go missing.  What we actually 
<br/>expected back then was for the Permanent Secretary who was the Chief Accounting Officer to take 
<br/>action but the report was handed to the Permanent Secretary back then from the Events Coordinator 
<br/>and nothing was done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One good thing that came out, that it came to Parliament and then to the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee.  Unfortunately, the Public Accounts Committee at that point in time did not have the 
<br/>powers  to  initiate  that  kind  of  investigation  but  through  the  Ministry  of  Civil  Service  and  the 
<br/>Permanent Secretary, the case had been referred to FICAC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, from  the Committee’s findings  there was no fully fledged 
<br/>Accounts section.  No action was taken against the alleged officers.  It was stated in the report that 
<br/></span><span>according to the Ministry of Civil Service, our preparation was not up to the expectation of ADB but 
<br/></span><span>still they went ahead with that.

<div><span>Special Investigation Review Report –   
<br/>Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there were shortfalls which led to mismanagement of funds but again I reiterate, we need 
<br/>to look at the nominal value as well and not generalise that there was fraud, for example, $1 million 
<br/>or $2 million but there was a certain amount for which accountability was missing.  But the events 
<br/>after that led to it, going into FEMIS and removing the payment system, all that raised eyebrows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the work of the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee  and  its  Members.    The  recommendations  are  practical.  Most  of  them  are  now  being 
<br/>actioned especially with the Ministry of Civil Service.  One good thing is, in future if we have to 
<br/>organise an event of this magnitude, at least, now we have a SOP as to  how we should go about 
<br/>conducting and facilitating such an event in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to talk very 
<br/>briefly on the Report before us, because it makes for very embarrassing reading actually.  Nice try, 
<br/>honourable Maharaj. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, when we look at this Report, you will recall that I used the analogy of the Nabukalou 
<br/>Creek.  During high tide everything looks lovely and rosy but at low tide is a mess.  This Report 
<br/></span><span>actually  precisely  demonstrates  what  I  have  said  before.    Again,  of  course,  all  of  us  looked  in 
<br/></span><span>admiration when the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> ADB Meeting took place. A lot of positives actually happened, but, at the 
<br/>end of the day, what does ADB think of us in terms of the money we spent? That to me is probably 
<br/>the most concerning thing from this Report because, yes, we have gone ahead and done a few deals 
<br/>to help us through COVID-19 but again there will be a niggling feeling about accountability and 
<br/>things like that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can talk about transparency and all these kinds of things, but this Report just says and I 
<br/>hope, even our side of the House will learn from this, that things need to be done properly. We need 
<br/>to resource projects properly, we need to have the right people in the right place, we need to have the 
<br/>right ministries doing the work that is expected and finally, always get advice from your accountants 
<br/>or your bean counters, in this instance, the Ministry of Finance. It appears from the Report there was 
<br/>little, if any, guidance from the Ministry of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the things that I thought I would highlight, Sir, as the Office of the Auditor-General 
<br/>noted and also the Committee that there is sufficient evidence to suggest that there is fraud. I hope 
<br/>that FICAC does follow through with the investigation whether it is $10,000 or $1 million, it should 
<br/>be investigated.  There were instances when payments were made on inflated invoice amounts or 
<br/></span><span>invoices  were  used  as  a  quotation  to  support  payments.  There  were  instances  where  unjustified 
<br/></span><span>payment of variations of contract, competitive quotes were not obtained, goods and services were 
<br/>not procured without issuance of Local Purchase Orders and there was no evidence to substantiate 
<br/>the receipt of goods. In addition, there was an inability to manage the conflict of interest arising from 
<br/>the  appointment  of  the  Event  Transport  Provider  who  was  also  the  contracted  Professional 
<br/>Conference  Organiser  (PCO).      It  was  noted  that  the  PCO  did  not  act  in  the  best  interest  of  the 
<br/>Government  when  its  own  transport  fleet  was  engaged  to  provide  transport  services  without 
<br/>following open and transparent procurement procedures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will use the word that the honourable Usamate says a lot in this House, “flabbergasted” or 
<br/>as we say in </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> sometimes, “</span><span>sa vakamadua sara ga.”</span><span> When we have these kinds of opportunities 
<br/>to showcase ourselves internationally, we need to ensure that our ducks are in a row and with things 
<br/>in order because otherwise, we start being looked at as the laughingstock, sadly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have to say with the Report in front of us and I thank the Committee for 
<br/></span><span>coming  up  with  this  Report,  that  this  suggests  a  major  breakdown  in  processes  and  procedures; 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Investigation Review Report –   
<br/>Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2119 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everything that you think could go wrong with a piece of project work is right here in this report. I 
<br/>know  that  as  mentioned  by  honourable  Maharaj  and  also  the  honourable  Chairman  of  the  Public 
<br/>Accounts Committee, the Civil  Service has since implemented a  lot of the recommendations that 
<br/>were proposed and that is a positive, of course. But, for all of us in this august Chamber, I think there 
<br/>are some lessons from this Report that we need to take to heart as we plot our way forward in the 
<br/>new Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister and Members of 
<br/>Parliament, thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Special Investigation on 
<br/>the Report of the Standing Committee on Public Accounts that was tabled on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024 
<br/>and the Review Report by the Committee in the outcome of their scrutiny of the accounting process 
<br/>followed on the Procurement of Goods and Services during the 52</span><span>nd</span><span> ADB Meeting held in Nadi from 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> to 5</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The finding of the audit, Mr. Speaker presented to us today revealed indeed a disturbing and 
<br/>essential reality by the Ministry of Civil Service.  There is a significant degree of non-compliance as 
<br/>alluded  to  by  the  previous  speaker;  non-compliance  with  rules  and  regulations  pertinent  to  the 
<br/></span><span>procurement of goods and services which include the mismanagement of the Financial Management 
<br/></span><span>Act 2004, Finance Instructions 2010, Procurement Regulation and the amended Regulation in 2012, 
<br/>Ministry of Labour and Industrial Relations, Employment Finance Manual 2013, FMIS Access and 
<br/>Password Policy, ADB 2019 Green Book and the General Best Practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Office of the Auditor-General confirmed to the Committee that the criteria 
<br/>tested in each of the investigations were sufficient to conclude on the objectives set out on this audit.  
<br/>It was revealed in their professional findings the discrepancy as were noted, has also been alluded to 
<br/>by the previous speakers. It was also noted that there was an absence of disciplinary action on those 
<br/>who are implicated in this default and embezzlement of the taxpayer funds, and this is very serious, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon deeper analysis of this finding, it seems that the issue stems out from lack of capacity, 
<br/>inadequate segregation of duty, untimely planning by the Ministry of Civil Service for Procurement 
<br/>of Goods and Services, poor handling or processing of quotations and the non-issuance of LPO and 
<br/>the controlled weaknesses of the settlement of invoice are the manifestations of these deficiencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To resolve this concern. Mr. Speaker, I support the Committee's recommendation to establish 
<br/></span><span>a fully-fledged professional accounting team to oversee and monitor the accounting system and the 
<br/></span><span>processes whenever we have events of such magnitude. An entity dedicated to upholding the sanctity 
<br/>of  our  procurement  process  would  deter  future  instances  of  non-compliance  and  reflect  our 
<br/>commitment to transparency, accountability and practice of good governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, it is critical for us to consider this finding and commit to a part 
<br/>of progressive reform within ministries and departments. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the Standing 
<br/>Committee  of  Public  Accounts  for  presenting  this  comprehensive  Review  Report  with  its 
<br/>recommendations to Parliament, despite the multiple challenges they faced.  Their endeavour aid us 
<br/>in our effort to improve, and their recommendations, Mr. Speaker, brings light to the path ahead of 
<br/>us towards an efficient, transparent and accountable procurement system, also we can learn and take 
<br/>on lessons learned from this Report. Let us come together and, navigate this path of transformation 
<br/>towards a transparent, efficient and a robust procurement process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members who have 
<br/></span><span>spoken before me. This Report is important because it does shed light on the critical importance of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Investigation Review Report –   
<br/>Procurement of Goods &amp; Services for ADB Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>integrity  in  Government  procurement  and  I must say that having  been in  Government  the last 20 
<br/>months, there is an area where we have experienced serious issues with respect to having the right 
<br/>and  qualified people in place for Government procurement projects, and that ensuring our processes 
<br/>are up to-date.  I could go on and on of what happened in the past.  We had issues such as procurement 
<br/>waivers for $4.6 million during COP23, but what I want to do today is, not dwell on what happened 
<br/>in the past.  When we were in Opposition, we used to raise this very strongly.  Some of the lessons 
<br/>that we have learnt being in Opposition and looking at reports of that nature, I think, all we can do is 
<br/>to move forward and improve the various processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19, and I know the point 
<br/>raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica are important points that we should all 
<br/>remember as a Government, as Members of Parliament, and I think more importantly for our civil 
<br/>servants, particularly those who are responsible for procurement.  All these events of the past whether 
<br/>it is COVID-19, whether it is holding big conferences, we hold conferences on a daily basis, there 
<br/>are requests that come to me on a daily basis on waiver of tender for procurement, and there are some 
<br/>valid cases and events, for example, booking hotels.  You cannot  call for tender, it is impractical 
<br/>because the price keeps changing.  When a particular Ministry, for example, Office of the Attorney-
<br/></span><span>General is holding the Attorney-General’s Conference, then what we get is a request for tender waiver 
<br/></span><span>for procurement of the services for a hotel.  They make sense, they need to be done.  But, a more 
<br/>strategic, forward looking procurement approach is essential to ensure that Government processes 
<br/>are executed with the utmost integrity and efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the House, that the Ministry of Finance is taking a very 
<br/>proactive  comprehensive  approach  to  address  these  issues.    We  have  reviewed  the  procurement 
<br/>regulations,  and  we  have  obtained  Cabinet  approval.    For  that,  we  are  currently  reviewing  the 
<br/>financial instructions to complement the implementation of the new FMIS system thereby bolstering 
<br/>the  integrity  and  the  efficiency  of  our  procurement  and  payment  system.    Sometimes  it  is  the 
<br/>efficiency of the system that puts officials, officers, and different Ministries, there is urgency, things 
<br/>need to be done, and things do not go right.  Sometimes it is not deliberate.  It is just that the systems 
<br/>are not working.  So, we are focusing on issues such as the processes and the systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the Ministry of Civil Service, the reforms that happened in the past, when the Public 
<br/>Service Commission, roles were taken by Ministry of Public Service; things happen.  Even now the 
<br/>Ministry of Public Service (Public Service Commission) the clarification on payment of allowances, 
<br/>appointments,  acting  appointments,  we  find  that  there  is  lack  of  clarity.    So,  the  staff  cannot  be 
<br/></span><span>blamed all the time in some of those cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new FMIS system, Mr. Speaker, Sir is going to improve a lot of the data, systems and 
<br/>records and that will help.  For example, honourable Maharaj talked about the void payments and 
<br/>how can we avoid all the wide range of risks that are involved in something like that.  Unauthorised 
<br/>modifications, so the system that we have got now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has got enhanced controls and 
<br/>they will serve as a safeguard against financial irregularities, and thereby protecting those who are 
<br/>involved in doing it as well as making sure that taxpayers funds are not wasted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recently approved Cabinet Procurement Regulations 24, Mr. Speaker, Sir, represent  a 
<br/>significant  step  forward.    In  addition  to  value  for  money,  integrity,  accountability  and  fair 
<br/>competition,  we  have  incorporated  risk  management  and  sustainability  as  new  principles  of 
<br/>government  procurement.    All  Ministries  are  undertaking  procurement  projects  or  who  are 
<br/>undertaking procurement projects must ensure that these principles are followed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are working currently on comprehensive procurement guidelines to

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2121 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  working  currently  on  comprehensive  procurement  guidelines  to 
<br/>complement the new procurement regulations, and these guidelines will provide clear, unambiguous 
<br/>guidance to ministry personnel involved in procurement.  We plan to implement the regulations and 
<br/>guidelines by March 2025 on top of the improvement, Sir, that have been made.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, all want to say is that there are lot of issues from the past. 
<br/>We have to acknowledge that. It is there. Some of them have not been resolved. Some of them have 
<br/>never been investigated, whether it is to do with the issues within the Public Service or within Public 
<br/>Enterprises, Public Cooperations, but these are issues that are there. However, we have as Ministry 
<br/>of Finance and as a government focussed on improving some of those processes and systems. And I 
<br/>am confident, Mr. Speaker, that this will help the whole of Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me just repeat this very important point, that for procurement, that is a very critical area 
<br/>for Government in terms of the use of taxpayers’ funds because everything that the Ministries do, 
<br/>every  project  that  they  do,  services  they  provide,  a  lot  of  it  is  dependent  on  how  quickly,  how 
<br/>efficiently the Ministry staff, for example the Ministry of Health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister for Health has all the good policies. There is a lot of advocacy. But 
<br/></span><span>what we find is when medicine does not reach Savusavu, it is nothing to do with doctors, nurses and 
<br/>those who are responsible for providing those services is Savusavu or Labasa. It is the procurement. 
<br/>It is the ability of the ministries procurement sections to be able to do that, plan that ahead, if you do 
<br/>not planned it, you can get the drugs on time and those who have worked in the Ministry of Health 
<br/>will understand this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I want to say is that this is a very, very important area. I am happy that the investigation 
<br/>report or investigation by the Auditor-General, interrogation by the Public Accounts Committee and 
<br/>the public enunciation of these issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  In Parliament is an important signal to those 
<br/>who are involved in procurement. We look forward to more improvements as I said in terms of the 
<br/>reviews that we have done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  I now  call on the  honourable  Chairperson of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee on Public Accounts to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  thank  all  the  Members  who  have 
<br/>contributed  to  the  debate  this  afternoon  on  the  Report.  I  think  we  all  agree  there  is  a  need  for 
<br/></span><span>accountability in everything we do and also for future events, we need to have specific SOP for all 
<br/></span><span>events set up before we carried out such events of that magnitude.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the Ministry of Civil Service as well as the other Government 
<br/>Ministries and Departments to learn from this experience so that it does not occur in the future. The 
<br/>Ministry of Civil Service to continue to follow up follow up with FICAC on those other cases apart 
<br/>from the $10,000 loss that is stated in the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before Parliament is asked to vote, honourable Members with due respect 
<br/>to the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I will be invoking 
<br/>Standing Order 20 to refer the matter to the Subcommittee on Public Accounts to investigate further. 
<br/>This will be an addition to the matter that I had referred on yesterday, and I will await the report from 
<br/>the Standing Committee once more from your Subcommittee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
