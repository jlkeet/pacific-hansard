<br/></span></div>
<div><span>organisations and commends the overall performance and achievements of the Ministry with a few 
<br/>recommendations to be considered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  accordance  with  Standing  Order  109(2)(b),  our  Committee  is  tasked  with  scrutinising 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>issues related to health, education, social services, labour, aviation, culture, and media.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, through our comprehensive review, we have identified several key concerns 
<br/>and  challenges  affecting  the  health  sector  and  have  put  forward  a  series  of  recommendations  to 
<br/>address these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise and commend the Ministry of Health's ongoing efforts to enhance the health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector through its current policies and procedures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, as part of our duties under Standing Order 110, the Committee conducted 
<br/>site visits to hospitals across the Western Division. These visits highlighted several concerns, which 
<br/>we  subsequently  raised  with  Ministry  of  health  Officials  during  their  public  submissions  to  the 
<br/>Committee.  Our  report  details  these  concerns  and  offers  actionable  recommendations  to  address 
<br/>them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the Permanent Secretary and his executive team 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their valuable contributions to this review process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  acknowledge  the  outstanding  leadership  and  guidance  of  the  former 
<br/>Chairperson  of  the  Committee,  honourable  Alitia  Bainivalu,  and  former  Committee  members  - 
<br/>honourable  P.K.  Bala;  honourable  K.K.  Lal  (Alternate  Member);  and  honourable  P.K.  Bala 
<br/>(Alternate Member), and the current Committee members for their dedicated efforts in finalising this 
<br/>Report.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this 
<br/>Report to Parliament and encourage all honourable Members of this esteemed House to review its 
<br/>findings and recommendations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Foreign  Affairs  and

<br/></span><span>Unit 2023 Annual Report that was presented in Parliament and referred to the Standing Committee

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Financial  Intelligences  Unit  was  established  in  2006  under  the  Financial  Transactions 
<br/>Reporting Act 2004. The Unit functions both, as an intelligence unit and as a regulator, as mandated 
<br/>by the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004. These two core functions are aimed at protecting 
<br/>Fiji’s  financial  system  from  abuse  by  criminals  who  seek  to  use  the  financial  services  offered  to 
<br/>launder the proceeds of crime or to facilitate other serious crimes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Unit is  fully funded by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) and the Governor of RBF was 
<br/>delegated the responsibilities of the line Minister over the Unit in 2005 and has remained that way 
<br/>up to the reporting period.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Review Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was compiled after the Committee perused the Annual 
<br/>Report and a face-to-face discussion with the Acting Director and her senior staff.  The Committee 
<br/>extends its gratitude to them for their timely response to the Committee’s request for information and 
<br/>their openness during our discussions.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji FIU must be commended for being up to date with their Annual Report and I must add 
<br/>that the professional way in which the Annual Report is structured and presented greatly enabled the 
<br/>Committee to compile and table this Review Report back to Parliament in a timely manner.  The 
<br/></span><span>Review Report has five recommendations, two of which the Committee feels that the line Ministries 
<br/></span><span>should look at with some urgency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Committee Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the hard work involved in the compilation of this Review Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence I submit this Review 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report to Parliament.
