<h3>AUDIT BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>AUDIT BILL 2024  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 85, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the Audit Bill 2024 (Bill No. 17 of 2024) be read a second time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call upon the mover of the motion, I remind honourable Members 
<br/>that pursuant to Standing Order 85(1), the debate  will be on the principle and the merits of the Bill.  
<br/>I hope I am clear on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said quite rightly, focussing on the 
<br/>principles and the merits of the  Audit  Bill  2024. The establishment of the Office of the Auditor- 
<br/>General (OAG) is legally mandated under Sections 151 and 152 of the Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Audit Act of 1969 provides the legal framework for the duties and powers of the Auditor-
<br/>General. The principal objective of the Act, Sir, is to provide for the salary, duties and powers of the 
<br/>Auditor-General,  the  auditing  of  public  accounts  and  for  other  purposes  connected  with  it.  So, 
<br/>pursuant to Legal Notice No. 3 of 2023, dated 5</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, the Act is one of the written laws 
<br/>that is assigned under the responsibility of the Minister for Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  Audit  Act  1969,  Sir,  entails  a  thorough  consultation,  so  the  Ministry 
<br/>through the OAG, undertook a comprehensive review of the Act with a focus to amend the Act to 
<br/>modernise it so that it is able carry out its functions in line with some of the international standards 
<br/>and best practices. So, given that the Act was last reviewed in 2006, it does not really capture the 
<br/>developments that have taken place over the last so many years, in particular, in the public sector 
<br/></span><span>accounting practices and new standards that have been adopted in many other countries. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2101 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the main objectives of the review, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthen the independence of the OAG. I think that is the most important thing, consistent 
<br/>with the independence guaranteed in the Constitution.  I think it does not matter who is in 
<br/>Government and who is in Opposition, that principle of the independence of the OAG, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, is very, very important and critical. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>To clarify the auditing mandate and include specific mandate to carry out compliance with 
<br/>new developments in IT and also in the context of environmental auditing. So, in the whole 
<br/>area of climate change and environmental accounting, there are standards which need to be 
<br/>put in place to empower the Auditor-General to take that into account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>To  ensure  that  all  audits  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  applicable  international 
<br/>standards on auditing, namely the international standards on auditing and the International 
<br/>Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions (ISSAIS). I know, Sir, that in forums, like the 
<br/>International Parliamentary Union (IPU), these things have always featured and there are 
<br/>countries where governments do not do this, and it has always been an issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>To protect the delivery of roles and responsibilities by the Auditor-General and officers of 
<br/></span><span>the OAG from personal institutional perspective and how audit findings are reported. I think 
<br/>that is also a very important principle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>To recognise that the OAG, its budget, staffing, revenue streams are consistent with other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provisions of the Audit Act and also as provided in the Constitution itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>To provide for the review of audits for entities that are not subject to audit by the Auditor-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General in accordance with the Constitution as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  important  because  we  know  there  was  a  change,  for  example,  in 
<br/>section 72 of the Finance Instructions and two independent institutions, the Elections Office and the 
<br/>Human Rights Commission. There was a new paragraph stated there that the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>for Finance, for example, could not order or authorise an independent audit without the agreement of 
<br/>the Supervisor of Election or the Human Rights Commission.  I do not know why it was done.  So, 
<br/>it is very important that, that kind of restriction is not placed on the OAG.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  enhance  the  powers  of  the  Auditor-General  to  access  data, 
<br/>including  more  increasingly  now  data  held  in  an  electronic  form,  and  I  think  FRCS  Act  that  we 
<br/>amended, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms revenue, has also been changed because a lot of the records are 
<br/>now electronic and the OAG ought to be empowered to be able to access those electronic records if 
<br/>the OAG is to be empowered to do a thorough auditing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Audit Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultation, as I have said, was facilitated by the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance with the OAG and Office of the Solicitor-General, and it commenced in June 
<br/>2023.  The  OAG  conducted  an  extensive  consultation  and  received  technical  assistance  from  the 
<br/>Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (PASAI) for which the outcome is presented before 
<br/>the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The call for written submissions was published on the OAG’s website on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023, and 
<br/>in  the  daily  newspapers  on  15</span><span>th</span><span>  July,  2023.    Direct  invitations,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  attend  the 
<br/>consultation meeting were issued to 49 key stakeholders. A total of 36 responded to the invitations 
<br/></span><span>and  through  written  or  oral  submissions,  and  consultation  meetings  were  held  in  Suva  and  the 
<br/></span><span>Western Division from 24</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2023 to 15</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>2102 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there was generally overwhelming support to the amendments proposed, stakeholders 
<br/>consulted  sought  clarifications  on  specific  matters  relating  to  different  sections  of  the  existing 
<br/>legislation, and the proposed new sections.  The reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not bringing this as 
<br/>an amendment Bill because there were a lot of changes and we felt that it is better to bring a complete 
<br/>new Bill which also includes some of the original provisions in that Bill so that we could go Clause 
<br/>by Clause and Parliament would have a very clear view as to what the new Audit Bill and we wanted 
<br/>to take a little bit of time so that we are able to do this in a much more effective way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our development partners have recognised this effort to strengthen external 
<br/>scrutiny in the OAG and this was one of the policy points that we had foreshadowed as part of our 
<br/>budget support with the various international organisations, our development partners, World Bank, 
<br/>DFAT, DFATNZ, and this has been a key focus since we came into Government in terms of looking 
<br/>at the overall Public Financial Management Reforms, which also included the strengthening of the 
<br/>Public Financial Management Legislative Framework, the Finance Management Act, Procurement 
<br/>Regulations, Finance Instructions, et cetera, and, of course, the new FMIS  system that I had talked 
<br/>about in Parliament which has come into force from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were few teething problems, but I think all these reforms will support 
<br/></span><span>and  strengthen  the  implementation  of  the  new  legislation  and  also  strengthen  the  Office  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said  in  Parliament,  the  recent  appointment  of  Ms.  Finau  Seru 
<br/>Nagera  by  His  Excellency  the  President  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Constitutional  Offices 
<br/>Commission,  as  the  new  Auditor-General  of  Fiji  -  the  first  woman  ever  to  hold  this  position, 
<br/>obviously,  this  new  legislation,  amendments  and  improvements  will  significantly  strengthen  the 
<br/>Office of the Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I commend the Bill for second reading.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now for debate on the motion.  Also, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list of speakers flagged by the Whips. Leading the batting would be: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable F.S. Koya; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ratu J.B. Niudamu; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable M.D. Bulitavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister  for  Finance,  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  for  presenting  the 
<br/>merits and principle of the Audit Bill 2024.  In my view, Audit Bill sets the legal framework to protect 
<br/>the interest of our citizens, who are actually the taxpayers of this country.  They want their money to 
<br/>be utilised effectively and ethically, and this particular Bill precisely does that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker. Sir, I also acknowledge the provisions in the Audit Bill 2024 that aligns with 
<br/>international  best  practices.  For  example,  section  13  includes  (as  the  honourable  Minister  has 
<br/>mentioned) environmental audit.  Environmental audit is an important component of the Audit Bill 
<br/>2024, and given the increasing importance of climate change, modern audit frameworks now include 
<br/>environmental  audits.  This  provision  assesses  how  public  funds  are  used  to  meet  climate  goals, 
<br/>reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainable resource management.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I suggest a slight change to the title, if we can call this “Environmental and Climate Audits”, because 
<br/></span><span>climate change is very visible, so that is the change that I am proposing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2103 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  provision  in  the  Bill  which  is  very  appealing  is  the  audit  of  information 
<br/>technology system and the use of international auditing standards. The Audit Bill 2024 empowers 
<br/>auditors to assess the security and resilience of the Government IT System, focussing on protecting 
<br/>public data and ensuring continuity of Government services in the face of cyber threats. So that is 
<br/>really, really important when we are talking about money.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  suggest,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  inclusion  of  two  more  areas,  and  that  would  be  gender 
<br/>responsive auditing, because the Government has moved into gender-based budgeting. So, if it is 
<br/>gender-based budgeting, it would be interesting or important to include gender responsive auditing.  
<br/>Modern Audit Bills increasingly include provisions of gender audits, focussing on whether public 
<br/>funds are being used in a way that promotes gender equity and addresses specific gender-based issues 
<br/>in public policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one that I would like to suggest is the Debt Audit. This is the national debt. It is 
<br/>always important to get a view of the Auditor-General as to how the borrowing took place, how it 
<br/>was utilised and whether the borrowing was at a concessional rate that we hear, or how was it done 
<br/>and how was it utilised?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think at this point, I would like to share my experience considering that I 
<br/></span><span>was involved along with Housing Authority Board to undertake a special investigation conducted by 
<br/>the Auditor General’s office and this relates very well to Section 12 of the current Audit Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during this special investigation we faced 3 issues, I do not know whether 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can speak about this now or not. Maybe later? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Alright, so at this point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said what I wanted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to say and I will stop here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  for 
<br/>putting  this before the Parliament for its second  reading.  I  am  going to  be very brief, with  just a 
<br/>couple  of  points  on  the  actual  Bill.  Obviously,  Section  151  of  the  Constitution  is  the  operative 
<br/>provision with respect to Auditor Generals, but just for clarity’s sake Sir, I think it is important that 
<br/>we all know this in terms of the functions of the Auditor General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 1521 (a) basically says, that at least once in every year, the Auditor General shall 
<br/>inspect, audit and report to Parliament on the public accounts of the state, the control of public money 
<br/>and  public  property  of  the  state  and  all  transactions  with  or  concerning  public  money  or  public 
<br/>property of the state. Now, I am not sure but, this might be an issue that needs to be checked with the 
<br/>Attorney General’s office with one of the provisions that is in there, in terms of audit. And I think 
<br/>that  it  is  specifically  to  do  with  performance  audits  and  also  to  do  with  institutions  that  may  be 
<br/>receiving grants et cetera, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I read it correctly, it says that it “may”, the Auditor General “may”, if he wants to audit it, 
<br/>it does not say “must.” It needs to be looked at and put in line with what is in the Constitution and 
<br/>doubled checked with the honourable Attorney General’s office, would know better. So, just that 
<br/>one, and in terms of the performance audit itself, I think in today’s day and age, what is actually 
<br/>transpiring, again, because it says the Auditor General “may” at any time, it is at his or her discretion, 
<br/>I think it needs to be synclinal. It needs to be put into a timeframe, that the Auditor General must 
<br/></span><span>honour the two-year cycle, do these performance audit, especially Sir, so that we are, the general 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>2104 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>public is quite aware that a particular institution is making sure that they are actually performing in 
<br/>terms of public funds et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just one or two more issues, Sir. In the definition section, honourable Attorney-General this 
<br/>is addressed to you, I think it is (e) it says that a local authority within in the meaning of the Local 
<br/>Government Act 1972, expect a local authority in respect to which the Minister is responsible for 
<br/>Local Government has directed that the auditor general is not the audit under section 51 (1) of that 
<br/>Act. It is actually a bit of double Dutch, I am not sure what is being referred to, maybe it needs some 
<br/>clarity or somebody needs to get the English right so it is easier for people to understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a couple of other things. Again, this has to do with the powers of the 
<br/>Auditor General. In Section 6 (1) the powers of the Auditor General, in section 6 (1) (a) it says in the 
<br/>performance of his or her functions under Section 152 of the Constitution, and of his or her functions 
<br/>and  duties  under  this  Act,  the  Auditor  General  “may”  call  on  any  officer,  member,  employee  or 
<br/>contractor or a public entity for any explanation or information that may be required.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the recent reports that have come out of the Committee, Sir, and the enquiry that 
<br/>has been instigated by you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe we should include former employees in that 
<br/></span><span>particular portion also. Otherwise, we are restricting ourselves to those that are currently employed 
<br/></span><span>and officers. I am not sure if former employees is permitted within that, but that may be a provision 
<br/>that we need to put in, in light of the fact that we know we have a report before the Parliament and 
<br/>an investigation current. So, that is just an addition that may need to be put in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the same, Section 6, we look at (f) it talks about obtaining legal advice and it says 
<br/>from the private practice. I do not know whose private practice is being referred to or should it say 
<br/>from private practitioners in circumstances considered appropriate by the Auditor-General. I think it 
<br/>is just the English that needs to be corrected, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing also is the subsection 3 talks about an offence. I think that is also something 
<br/>that needs to be properly spelt out, but otherwise in general, Sir, the one very glaring thing in there 
<br/>and I am not sure if everyone will agree to this, there is an audited section 8 speaks about the Auditor-
<br/>General that may delegate to any employee or contractor. So, it goes out, any function due to your 
<br/>power of the Auditor-General, other than the function of certifying reporting accounts that comes to 
<br/>Parliament.  In case of handing out unfettered power like that to someone who is a private contractor 
<br/>Sir, there needs to be a bit of a check and balance. I am not sure honourable Minister of Finance, how 
<br/>it should be dealt with, or maybe we need to put some provision in there that it is not an unfettered 
<br/>power, that the Auditor-General has, with respect to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  those  things,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  otherwise  in  a  nutshell  itself,  it  brings  us  in  line  with 
<br/>international best practices and standards, and I think it is a timely Bill that has actually come before 
<br/>the Parliament, and I think the Committee will have a thorough inspection of this once it gets to the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We just had another change in the listing and the last speaker would be the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Finance  for the second  reading  of Audit  Bill 
<br/>2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to commend the drafters for this particular Bill, I 
<br/></span><span>think it is one of the best Bills I have ever seen particularly on auditing laws. It has come into line 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the international standards and best practices of what we are supposed to do, particularly the 
<br/>appealing section which has now come into this new Bill, Sir. We have seen that the old Act had only 
<br/>had 13 provisions. Now it has extended to 27 provisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister had alluded to 
<br/>earlier, the laws goes with the time and we need to change laws, particularly the old common laws 
<br/>which we had relied on. We change with what we are facing nearly every day, and I have seen from 
<br/>section 1 right up to section 27, I have seen that it is in line with the international best practices. I 
<br/>have no further comments to say.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give a brief contribution to the Bill, 
<br/>which is for the second reading and just to respond to honourable Koya, given it has been the last 
<br/>eight years in Parliament or even more, we are much used to Standing Orders 51. When Bills come 
<br/>for the short cut provision, we go into debate and we tend to go into the substantive matter and I 
<br/>thank  the  Government  for  exhausting  the  normal  procedure  to  go  through  first  reading  and  into 
<br/>second reading, where we can only comment on the principle and merits of the Bill and after this, 
<br/>through Standing Order 85(4).  Then the honourable Speaker will refer it to the Standing Committee 
<br/>for consultation and other deliberations where the suggestions and the clauses has been referred to 
<br/>by honourable Koya and also honourable Premila Kumar can be part of the individual submissions 
<br/></span><span>to  the  Committee  to  look  into  the  Bills.  We  will  then  have  discussions  with  the  drafters  at  the 
<br/></span><span>Attorney-General's  office  in  terms  of  the  final  forming  of  the  Bill.  They  will  come  back  to  the 
<br/>Parliament after the Committee reports back, and before we go into the third reading of the Bill and 
<br/>before enactment.  That was the procedure given, that we were so used to, the shortcut provision. 
<br/>Sometimes when we go back to the original work of a legislature, we are quite confused at times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But just on the merits of the Bill, I agree with the honourable Minister for Finance and Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, in terms of clause 6. But all these come under Section 152 (3) of the Constitution, 
<br/>where a written law can be made in order to add further provisions to see the functions and powers 
<br/>of  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General.  In  clause  6,  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister, the mover of the motion, it gives more power to the Auditor-General, especially in searches 
<br/>of property and to compel getting of passwords in order to get evidence, if they are doing an auditing 
<br/>or an investigation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the more important provision would be clause 12 of the Bill, whether its 
<br/>merits and principles, which is aligned to your ruling on Monday.  The understanding of the Business 
<br/>Committee,  where  subcommittees  through  its  terms  of  reference  can  make  investigation  if  the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Public  Accounts’  report  comes  to  the  Parliament,  and  whether  from  the 
<br/>debate there are some unresolved issues that Parliament may think to revisit in terms of wastage of 
<br/>Government resources or taxpayers’ fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Where you have the discretion to allow a subcommittee to relook into that. This particular 
<br/>Bill has brought your decision, Sir, on Monday and the Business Committee, where it now allows in 
<br/>clause 12, where Parliament can also instruct through this particular Bill, the Office of the Attorney-
<br/>General to do a special investigation in terms of any findings that Parliament might see that is not 
<br/>sufficient that has been given. That ruling is now consistent if the Bill comes into an Act, that will 
<br/>cover the Parliament’s role in also instructing the Office of the Attorney-General to do further audits 
<br/>or investigation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On clause 19, it also allows the honourable Speaker of Parliament to now appoint a natural 
<br/>person to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. That is a new provision that is in this particular 
<br/>Bill, where the honourable Speaker of Parliament will now appoint a natural person, the wording that 
<br/></span><span>is in the current Bill, to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. Given in the past, there have been 
<br/></span><span>many allegations in terms of the independency of this particular organisation. The honourable Deputy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="61">Page 61</a></div>
<div><span>2106 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister will well remember a few years ago, when the former Auditor-General was accused 
<br/>of  drinking  grog  with  some  politicians  and  was  more  aligned  to  some  political  parties.  The 
<br/>independence of that organisation was questioned by the former Minister for Economy at that time. 
<br/>But the merits of the Bill brings it into international standards and best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last clause, I would like to comment on is clause 21, which has principle and merits too. 
<br/>That  will  outline  the  matters  with  the  Auditor-General,  must  report  to  Parliament  including  any 
<br/>matter that the Auditor-General may wish to bring to the attention of Parliament arising from any 
<br/>audit, special investigation and review of audits in the preceding calendar year or financial year. It 
<br/>provides  a  pathway  after  the  Auditor-General  makes  those  special  investigations  instructed  by 
<br/>Parliament through the Standing Committee or through your subcommittee to the terms of reference 
<br/>that you had ruled out the other day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It provides the pathway for the Auditor-General to bring back a second report, probably on 
<br/>any findings that Parliament might want to ensure on whether the state resources or taxpayers money 
<br/>needs to be accounted for. With those words, I commend and support the Bill for the second reading, 
<br/>and look forward for it to come to the Standing Committee where we will then do our consultation 
<br/>plus deliberation in conjunction with the drafters from the Office of the Attorney-General and come 
<br/></span><span>back to the Parliament, if needed to be instructed through your decision, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.W.R.VOSAROGO.– Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to speak on 
<br/>the second reading of the Audit Bill of 2024. I suppose, reiterating the merits and the principals that 
<br/>have been spoken about by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, the mover of the 
<br/>Bill in the Parliament this afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the points that I think is important to note Mr. Speaker, Sir and I am sure all of us here 
<br/>at in Parliament can agree to, is the point raised by the honourable Premila Kumar. These laws are 
<br/>going to ensure that there is confidence in how public funds are going to be spent. Everyone in this 
<br/>country pays taxes, everyone contributes to the treasury, and everyone contributes to the money that 
<br/>is ultimately going to be shared or given to ministries of government and government departments in 
<br/>order for them to be able to work the responsibilities that are given to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is one of the ways and I suppose the only way in which this Parliament is able to convince 
<br/>those that are actually contribute to the treasury that their money, money that they spend, taxes that 
<br/>they pay is actually going to the right place and has been spent on the right occasion.  It is through 
<br/>the audits that are conducted that we get the public confidence that we so desire to have here in this 
<br/>Parliament. So I thank all those that have been involved behind the scenes, the Auditor General’s 
<br/>Office, the Ministry of Finance staff who have  been instrumental in  the early revising the Act  of 
<br/>1969.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  had  stated  it  correctly,  the  last  revision  of  this 
<br/>amendment that was brought to this Act was in 2006. That is a long time ago and as we know, laws 
<br/>need to be revised so that it continues to remain relevant and efficient in addressing current challenges 
<br/>and concerns as we go year by year. This is a good time, and I see the Honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister has resoundingly stated that in the Parliament this afternoon Mr. Speaker sir, this is a good 
<br/>time in which the Act needs to be replenished completely.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, there are provisions in the old Act that will be maintained in the new one but there 
<br/>are additional ones that provides for the safeguards, provides for the guardrails that attends to the 
<br/>present  challenges,  the economic challenges that  we have at  the moment,  as  well  as the business 
<br/></span><span>challenges that we also will have to attest to as we move forward.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2107 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the principals that I think is important for Parliament to note that this 
<br/>Bill brings, is that it is going to promote effective governance. So, we can see that in the additional 
<br/>provisions  that  are  going  to  be  added  on  to  last  17  provisions  that  were  there  before.  So  these 
<br/>provisions are of course are designed to ensure that governance is one of the main hallmarks of the 
<br/>laws that we are going to see spanning through, hopefully in the next session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, having to address this Parliament on the relevancy and efficacy of 
<br/>the laws and how responsive it needs to be in our present-day society, is that, once we have these 
<br/>audit  laws  brought  to  be  passed  by  Parliament,  we  are  actually  going  to  be  inducing  a  more 
<br/>investment trade and economic growth environment in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is what we ultimately intend to encourage, is that people from within and people from 
<br/>outside looking in, know that we are a very accountable government, accountable to the people and 
<br/>accountable for all the money that is collected to be spent on our government. With those few words, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the second reading by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.–  Honourable  Members,  I  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister and Minister for Finance to speak in reply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Members for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their contribution and support for the second reading of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to also thank honourable Bulitavu for laying out the process. I think 
<br/>that was very clear. The honourable Members will have the opportunity to make their presentations 
<br/>and I am hoping that the Standing Committee will look at each clause and also look at the drafting 
<br/>and the language as well. You know as we normally do in any Bill that goes to the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But just to quickly pick on some of the points, Mr. Speaker, Sir, raised by the honourable 
<br/>Members. The honourable Minister for Lands is absolutely correct. I mean, the history of auditing, 
<br/>whether you talk about mid-18th century or whether about industrial revolution, it all started with the 
<br/>view to ensuring that there is value for money, that there is accountability of public money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the years all these things have changed with a lot more sophistication in the way public 
<br/>funds are raised and in the way it is being used. On the issue that, honourable Premila Kumar raised 
<br/>about  debt  auditing,  it  is  already  part  of  the  work  of  the  Auditor-General.  The  Auditor-General's 
<br/>Office looks at financing, looks at debt, interest rates, the whole financial situation of the Government 
<br/>and obviously all that come into play.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the gender auditing, I think that is already or can be done and there is no restriction on 
<br/>gender  auditing  and  it  can  be  done  as  part  of  the  performance  and  compliance  audits.  So  the 
<br/>compliance audit can show, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a matter of principle that gender audits, there is no 
<br/>restriction. The issue of environmental audits, that is part of the relevant international language and 
<br/>that is why we have kept it as environmental audit and of course, you know, climate change and 
<br/>everything else would fall into that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The points raised by honourable Koya, were all very relevant Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I guess, 
<br/>you know, those were more the content of what is in the clause and I am sure honourable Koya will 
<br/>have an opportunity to speak about that through the Standing Committees.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another point that probably was raised, that people must be wondering, the 
<br/></span><span>audit of the Auditor-General's Office itself, you have powers as the honourable Speaker of the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="63">Page 63</a></div>
<div><span>2108 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Audit Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You appoint the auditor to audit the Office of the Auditor-General. And again, you know it is an 
<br/>important principle, because it puts every institution in a situation where they are accountable, and 
<br/>of  course  as  a  Parliamentary  process,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  role  of  the Public  Accounts  Standing 
<br/>Committee is very important  and more  Public Accounts Committees around the world  take more 
<br/>interest in the work of the Office of the Auditor-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the important principle, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we are including in this important principle 
<br/>in this Bill, if  I can add few more. One, is of course protection from liability, performance audits and 
<br/>compliance audits. Timing and publication of reports as honourable, Koya raised. Procedural fairness 
<br/>in relation to reports, notification of serious irregularities, review of audits and of course the principle 
<br/>of independence. So, a lot of the strengthening of the Audit Act, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is strengthening 
<br/>that principle of independence and we are looking at all the key pillars of independence or key pillars 
<br/>of supreme audit institutions whether it is a Lima Declaration, whether it is the Mexican or Mexico 
<br/>Declaration of 2007. These are all principles that have been enunciated very well by international 
<br/>institutions, including the UN resolutions on independence and existence of the Auditor-General's 
<br/>Office, the powers, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, what we have done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is bring all these international principles together, 
<br/></span><span>look at what they are and how they are going to strengthen the independence of the Auditor-General's 
<br/></span><span>Office and support the governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One last point before I conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which is quite a misconception that some 
<br/>people have about government grants. There are people out there for example, let us say the Attorney-
<br/>General's  Office is  holding a conference in  Nadi and spending about  $300,000 or $400,000. And 
<br/>people look at the Attorney-General and say, we want the audit report. How much you are spending? 
<br/>That is not the way it is done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  are  part  of  government  expenditure.  So,  when  a  grant  is  given,  there  is  a  grant 
<br/>agreement, there are certain requirements that abetted by the Auditor-General’s Office, the Solicitor-
<br/>General's Office, and the requirements are that the audited reports will come to the ministries and the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance. And then, the Auditor-General, as part of its audit process and will look at all 
<br/>that. So, I just wanted to clarify that, I think honourable Koya raised that about grants. Otherwise, 
<br/>the  Auditor-General's  Office  will  be  auditing  150  grants  and  spend  all  the  time.  That  is  not  the 
<br/>principle about auditing grants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to once again thank all the honourable Members for their comments. 
<br/>I think they are very useful. I wish all the members of the Standing Committee who are going to look 
<br/>at this report, all the best and we look forward to the report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote.
