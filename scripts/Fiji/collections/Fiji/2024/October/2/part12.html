<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the World Surf League Corona Fiji Pro 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, and ladies and gentlemen listening through the radio or watching through 
<br/>television  or  livestream  or  from  the  gallery,  I  take  great  pleasure  in  providing  an  update  on  the 
<br/>recently held World Surf League Corona Fiji Pro.  Fiji is known for many things. We are known for 
<br/>our hospitality, our culture, our beaches and our friendliness, and our goal is to add to that list,  top-
<br/>tier global events is, of course, one of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the support of Government and the private sector, we successfully 
<br/>brought back the World Surf League (WSL) Fiji Pro after seven years. This is a three-year partnership 
<br/>where the first event was held from 19th August to 23rd August at Cloudbreak, Tavarua. This event 
<br/>not only showcases our stunning natural landscapes, but also reinforced Fiji’s standing as a premier 
<br/>sports tourism destination on the global stage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, surfing is not a traditional spectator event, like rugby or football, where 
<br/>economic returns are largely measured based on how many seats we fill in a stadium.  Instead, its 
<br/>economic value is measured by global brand exposure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Cloudbreak has gained global fame for its powerful and flawless left-hand 
<br/>reef break, making it a top choice for surfers and a key reason for Fiji’s celebrated to return to the 
<br/>World Surf League event. The 2024 Corona Fiji Pro presented by Bonsoy was Event 9, which is the 
<br/>final event for the 2024 Championship Tour before the finals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Event 9 delivers a much higher audience, as it decides the final five men and women who 
<br/>then go into the finals. And next year, we will be the final stop. So, this will be a strategic advantage 
<br/>to Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Fiji  Pro  has  set  a  new  benchmark  for  international  events  in  Fiji, 
<br/>contributing significantly to various sectors of our economy. Allow me to detail the multiple benefits 
<br/>this event has brought to our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had the honour of having the President of Fiji His Excellency, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere 
<br/>officiate  the  opening  of  the  Event.  My  colleague,  the  Shadow  Minister  for  Tourism,  honourable 
<br/>Koya, was also present. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  economic  ripple  effects  of  the  Fiji  Pro  Event  has  been  widespread, 
<br/>particularly in our tourism and hospitality sectors. In the Corona Fiji Pro Event, 36 athletes from 12 
<br/>countries participated. The event also brought event organisers, support staff, media personnel, and 
<br/>passionate surf fans. Our hotels and resorts have seen a marked increase in occupancy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  direct  economic  returns,  you  are  looking  at  airfare,  accommodation,  food  and 
<br/>beverage,  transport  and  taxes  in  the  local  economy.    Preliminary  assessments  indicate  that  this 
<br/>singular  event  has  generated  millions  of  dollars  in  direct  and  indirect  economic  benefits.  Local 
<br/>businesses, including restaurants tour operators and service providers have all experienced increased 
<br/>patronage.  This, in turn, strengthens the very foundation of our tourism-based economy which has 
<br/></span><span>been steadily recovering since the global pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The financial impact of such international events extends far beyond the event itself, creating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a sustainable flow of income that boosts local and national economies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, hosting the Fiji Pro has elevated Fiji’s profile globally.  The extensive media 
<br/>coverage, including live broadcasts and media engagement has showcased not only the event, but 
<br/>Fiji’s natural beauty and world-class surfing to millions of viewers worldwide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, our preliminary analysis shows over $2.5 million in total brand media value 
<br/>of exposure for Tourism Fiji in social media.  We are looking at 205 total branded social posts that 
<br/>produced over 45 million impressions and 29 million video views.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The event also delivered over $255,000 in media plan value for Tourism Fiji and 2.3K global 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>PR hits with over $50.4 million in global advertising value equivalency across 36 countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the event was also supported by global brands, such as Corona, Red Bull, 
<br/>Yeti, Shiseido and Apple Watch.  So, we strategically maximised the Fijian brand.  The exposure is 
<br/>invaluable for our tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I also wanted to share the impact the event had on our communities and our 
<br/></span><span>people.  The WSL rebuild  the Cloudbreak surf  tower, which was  destroyed during  </span><span>TC Harold</span><span> in 
<br/>2020, after being operational since the mid-1990s.  This is now being gifted to Tabanivono-i-Wai as 
<br/>a legacy asset to monetise via renting the tower out for other events.  I also acknowledge the cash 
<br/>contribution made to the Nabila and Momi Villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the event also saw support to the Fiji Surfing Association and local surfing 
<br/>community.  The WSL delivered a three-day women’s development programme and a water safety 
<br/>programme. A local surfer received a place in the Fiji Pro Event as a wildcard and donation of cash 
<br/>and items to the Fiji Surfing Association.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we also staged a ‘live site’ in Denarau, to allow locals and other guests who 
<br/>could not go out to Cloudbreak to also watch the event live.  One of the other aspects of Fiji Pro 
<br/>Event has been its contribution to jobs and skill development, from event management, logistics and 
<br/>security to hospitality services and transportation; local talent was heavily involved in the planning 
<br/>and execution of this world-class event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly, these employment opportunities did not just provide temporary income.  They 
<br/>also quipped many of our people with valuable skills and experience that can be leveraged in future 
<br/>events.    This  adds  long-term  value  to  our  workforce  and  positions  us  favourably  in  the  highly 
<br/>competitive tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, an event of this scale would not be complete without a firm commitment to 
<br/>environmental  sustainability.    I  am  pleased  to  report  that  the  Fiji  Pro  Event  upheld  the  highest 
<br/>standards  of  environmental  stewardship.  Initiatives,  such  as  the  ocean  forest  diversity,  marine 
<br/>environment protection projects and no single-use plastics were also positive contributions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  one  of  the  standout  initiatives  was  the  encouragement  of  participants  and 
<br/>visitors  to  plant  coral  in  nearby  reefs  –  an  act  that  directly  contributes  to  the  preservation  of  our 
<br/>marine ecosystems.  We have long recognised that our natural environment is one of our greatest 
<br/>assets, and we must protect it for future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Pro has served as a platform to promote environmental conservation, particularly in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>safeguarding our oceans and coral reefs. This approach aligns with our broader national goals for 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2053 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sustainable tourism development where we balance economic growth with environmental protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, looking ahead, the success of the Fiji Pro positions us favourably to attract 
<br/>more international events.  In line with our tourism diversification strategy, we are already exploring 
<br/>new  partnerships  and  avenues  to  host  a  variety  of  international  events.    These  opportunities  will 
<br/>continue  to  deliver  significant  economic,  social  and  environmental  benefits.  The  ongoing 
<br/>collaboration with the WSL, in particular, is a cornerstone of our efforts to solidify Fiji’s place on 
<br/>the international sports tourism map. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Fiji Pro Event has been a success for our country.  It has 
<br/>boosted our economy, created employment, showcased our culture and reinforced our commitment 
<br/>to  environmental sustainability. Most importantly, it has demonstrated our capacity to  host world 
<br/>class events and has positioned Fiji as a leading destination for sports tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we build on this success,  I have every confidence that Fiji  will continue to  thrive as a 
<br/>global tourism and events destination, bringing long-term benefits to our people and our economy. 
<br/>We look forward to even greater achievements in the years to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  </span><span>Vinaka  vakalevu,  </span><span>and  I  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, right at the outset, I 
<br/>want to say “congratulations” to the honourable Minister for Tourism for finally acknowledging the 
<br/>benefits of sports tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  must  understand  that  if  we  focus  on  our  conservative  traditional 
<br/>markets, that is just a norm for Fiji. We cannot really just rely on weddings and our return visitors, 
<br/>et cetera. It will become sluggish, and we will have stagnant growth. But we knew that before, in 
<br/>order to expand our tourism industry, we had to look at what were the other avenues. We knew that 
<br/>sports tourism was huge business around the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  a  lot  of  information  being  passed  back  and  forth  from  the  Opposition  at  that 
<br/>particular time about the golf tournament, et cetera. But I am so happy to see that now, the light is 
<br/>shining bright with respect sports tourism. Now, the honourable Minister understands the importance 
<br/>of global market visibility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Let love shine.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That is alright, it is not an issue, honourable Minister.  At that time, you 
<br/>probably were not well versed with respect to how the benefits work but I am really happy too and 
<br/>fully supportive of what you are actually doing at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  events  like  the  World  Surfing  League,  coming  and  running  a 
<br/>competition in Fiji, is a great move in the right direction. Although it is coming back after a few 
<br/>years, there were some issues before that, but it has been resolved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  now  is  becoming  an  actual  desirable  destination  with  respect  to  sports  tourism,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker Sir. It is becoming a major sports destination. We can also see now that we can even hold 
<br/>musical concerts that are bringing in substantial amounts of money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you may remember, that we had several sporting events that were sponsored 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>2054 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in part by Government at that time, but we needed to put ourselves on the market and we did.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to put things into perspective, that direct expenditure (and I think I am 
<br/>talking about sports in general), in sports tourism roughly equates to about $67.1million. We have 
<br/>roughly about 21,000 individuals employed in that particular sector, which equates to 520 full time 
<br/>jobs. This comes out of a survey that was done by Tourism Fiji with the assistance of the Market 
<br/>Development Facility through the Australian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The average spend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to our visitors is about $6,877 that is during 
<br/>their stay. So, the total expenditure is about $40 million and if you break it down, that is about 40,000 
<br/>visitor nights. So, you can see what sports tourism does for Fiji, Mr. Speaker Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The benefits actually goes beyond just normal specific economic immediate gains; there are 
<br/>long term gains.   Ninety percent of those people that were surveyed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, said, “Oh, we 
<br/>will be back.”  They find a new avenue. Just to put it into perspective, the gentleman surfer who is 
<br/>actually quite famous, you might have all seen it during the Olympics, he was on top of the wave 
<br/>with a symbol on his hand, basically just a single finger pointing upwards, and the picture was taken. 
<br/>That generated a lot of interest.  That gentleman, Gabriel Medina, comes from Brazil, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we did this surfing in the beginning, just the viewership alone, because he has such a 
<br/>huge following, put Fiji on the map with respect to sports tourism. And not just sports tourism, people 
<br/>are wanting to come in, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all in all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you look at sports tourism, it is not just about surfing, it 
<br/>is about our Drua also that have created a huge interest in Fiji in terms of sports tourism - our rugby 
<br/>team, our Super Rugby team - the Drua and also our normal rugby team. We want to ensure also that 
<br/>maybe, one day we can actually start holding a HSBC 7s series here. Also, we do have the facilities, 
<br/>and I am sure the honourable Minister is actually working on seeing what can be done in conjunction 
<br/>with the Fiji Rugby Union, despite all the little difficulties that they currently face.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do hope that the Ministry of Tourism will look at actually growing surfing 
<br/>in Fiji. It is a big and lucrative sport. But as I have said earlier, with sports like this, in terms of golf, 
<br/>surfing and other sports that actually happen in Fiji, that is not just common sports, we have a large 
<br/>viewership. And if you put all of that into the equation in terms of the amount of dollars that we are 
<br/>looking at, we would not be able to spend that much in terms of marketing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I take my hat off to the honourable Minister for hosting a great surfing tournament and 
<br/>we hope to see a whole more sporting activities in terms of our tourism industry happening in Fiji. 
<br/>And most of all, Mr. Speaker Sir, I take my hat to all the tourism operators that take part and all those 
<br/>who have assisted in it.   I think they have done a fantastic job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- </span><span>Vinaka!</span><span> I now call on the honourable leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister for his Ministerial Statement and, of course, the update on the World Surf Lead Corona Fiji 
<br/>Pro.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as rightly said by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we cannot over 
<br/>emphasise the importance of sports tourism in Fiji. You know that hosting this kind of international 
<br/>sporting event on our shores brings a lot of growth in our economy and also our social networks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one important point about such an event is that they do bring large crowd  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2055 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of fans with them, just like rugby. When you have world class surfers and a world champion like 
<br/>Kelly Slater, who participated in the Fiji Pro a number of times, these are world class athletes, worth 
<br/>$40million, for this particular guy, and has more than 5 million followers competing in the Fiji Pro, 
<br/>they surely bring fortunes and fans with them. They stay in our hotels, like the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister said, they eat in our restaurants, and they use our transport mediums. So, when they 
<br/>depart, they leave behind millions of dollars for our people and for our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a point for the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, hosting more international events will 
<br/>mean  investing  on  sporting  infrastructure.  We  need  to  upgrade  our  facilities  to  comply  with 
<br/>international standards if we are to get more competitions. I know Government is moving in that 
<br/>direction, and I want to thank the Ministry of Sports and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for 
<br/>working on that part. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a suggestion to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, Australia will 
<br/>be hosting the 2026 Rugby League World Cup. It will be a boost to our sports tourism if we can have 
<br/>some of these competitions played in our sporting grounds. So, Deputy Prime Minister, we hope that 
<br/>you will work with the organisers on this particular event, if we can have some of those games in 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his 
<br/>Statement and the great  work his  Ministry is  doing in  promoting and  coordinating more sporting 
<br/>tourism events in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- You may note, honourable Tuinaceva that I laughed a bit because instead 
<br/>of pronouncing the Minister for Tourism, you mentioned the name of the Deputy Speaker. </span><span>Sa malo 
<br/>e!</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on Maritime Safety Authority of Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians, ladies and 
<br/>gentlemen,  and  Students  and  Teachers  who  are  with  us  today  from  Yat  Sen  Primary  School, 
<br/>welcome.    I  thank  you  for  the  opportunity  to  address  this  House  regarding  the  Maritime  Safety 
<br/>Authority of Fiji (MSAF) and specifically some updates on incidents, remedial actions and also a 
<br/>brief on derelict abandoned ships on our shores and the work of MSAF.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, MSAF plays a very critical role in enhancing safe shipping and cleaner seas throughout 
<br/>the 1.8 million square kilometres of Fiji’s maritime space.  So, MSAF is working towards being a 
<br/>dynamic  and  internationally  respected,  regulator  provider  and  promoter  of  maritime  safety  and 
<br/>maritime environment protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms overview of incidents, a total of 94 incidents from the year 2021 to the present, 
<br/>have been recorded by MSAF.  The trend shows that 31 incidents was recorded in 2021, 10 incidents 
<br/>in 2022, 34 incidents in 2023 and 19 incidents recorded so far in 2024. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  incidents  include  vessel  groundings,  collisions,  equipment  failures  and  non-
<br/>compliance with maritime safety regulations.  Out of this total, 80 percent were classified as major, 
<br/>10  percent  of  the  incidents  resulted  in  fatalities  and  1  percent  resulted  in  serious  injury.    The 
<br/>remaining incidents were minor with no significant impact on life or property.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  primary  causes  identified  are  human  error,  adverse  weather  conditions  and 
<br/></span><span>insufficient and poor maintenance of vessels. Some of the examples Mr. Speaker, Sir, also include a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>2056 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vessel on 21</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2033, which was drifting and towed back due to a power failure. Sir, MSAF 
<br/>insisted on the offloading of passengers for alternative routes, and this was implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues regarding this was power backup.  Again, this survey had been conducted 
<br/>and  a  list  of  defects  identified  and  directed  to  this  particular  company.    This  vessel  is  still  being 
<br/>detained in terms of lack of compliance and also the need to work on those defects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was one which was prevented from sailing due to air conditioning defects.  This was, 
<br/>again,  detained  but  eventually,  that  was  addressed,  and  the  vessel  was  allowed  to  be  operational 
<br/>again.  There  was  another  regarding  ramp  malfunction,  again,  this  was  detained  until  that  was 
<br/>rectified, then allowed to operate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was another incident which, on 9th March, 2024, lost power and had to be towed to 
<br/>Suva.   Again, this had to do with the on-board power backup and this is still detained. So, MSAF is 
<br/>engaged in more investigation and compliance, and ensuring the safety of passengers as we move 
<br/>forward.   Related to this is more investigation trainings and auditor trainings for seafarers and vessel 
<br/>operators and focusing on compliance with the national safety regulations and emergency procedures 
<br/>through the IMO International Safety Management Systems and the Local Ships Safety Management 
<br/></span><span>Systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increased awareness campaigns are conducted through surveys and inspection of ships, and 
<br/>this is strengthened to build capacity for our officers.  Further, increase port inspections of vessels 
<br/>have been implemented to ensure adherence to safety standards.  These include frequent checks on 
<br/>safety equipment, effectiveness of the ships’ planned maintenance systems and overall operational 
<br/>readiness.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, MSAF is also in the process of recruiting more staff to strengthen its presence in 
<br/>the outer stations, and we will continue to expand our services in terms of coverage of Suva, Lautoka, 
<br/>Levuka and other local jetties and boat landing spots.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revisions  to  existing  maritime  regulations  have  been  initiated  to  address  gaps  identified 
<br/>during  incident  investigations.  These  includes  stricter  penalties  for  non-compliance  and  more 
<br/>rigorous safety checks for high risk vessels which have been evident with the recent reactivation of 
<br/>the  infringement  notices  in  June  this  year.    This  process,  from  20</span><span>th</span><span>  May  to  24</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  involves 
<br/>informing all maritime stakeholders, including ship masters, seafarers and ship owners, mariners and 
<br/>marine service operators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effective  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  June,  2024,  MSAF  will  commence  the  issuance  of  maritime  safety 
<br/>infringement  notices  pursuant  to  sections  262  and  263  of  the  Maritime  Transport  Act  2013.  This 
<br/>involves the issuance of notices specifying infringement offences and notices which give operators 
<br/>specific timelines to address issues.  So, the law must be enforced, and this is what this Coalition 
<br/>Government is about   enforcing laws in terms of our maritime safety and shipping operators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF is also actively conducting outreach programmes in remote areas to 
<br/>raise  awareness  about  maritime  safety  practices.  These  programmes  target  local  maritime 
<br/>communities, boat builders and small vessel operators.  In addition, ongoing efforts to include closer 
<br/>collaboration with law enforcement agencies and maritime partners, such as Fiji Water Police, Fiji 
<br/>Ports  Corporation  Limited,  Biosecurity  Authority  of  Fiji,  Ministry  of  Fisheries,  Ministry  of 
<br/>Environment and other relevant maritime stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  we  are also  progressing towards  digital transformation  of processes  and 
<br/></span><span>records to ensure that the identification of non-compliance, et cetera, is provided as per the real time

<div><span>data for enforcement purposes.  In terms of navigational  aid,  including  beacons and buoys are in 
<br/>progress to improve guidance for vessels navigating through challenging routes.  There is a five-year 
<br/>plan to improve navigation aids that have been damaged in the past years through the various weather 
<br/>events.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF continues to seek technical cooperation in the Ministry in this regard, 
<br/>and recently we had hosted Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries together where visits were done 
<br/>to  local  lighthouses,  beacons  and  other  infrastructure  which  needed  upgrading,  and  continued 
<br/>partnership in that regard, is being pursued. So, in terms of that, one of the issues, which we do not 
<br/>want to dwell on the past, but if the Marine Department of PWD was there, these issues would not 
<br/>have come up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the deterioration of our navigational aids and beacons, the Marine Department 
<br/>used to work on time to address these issues efficiently and effectively so that there are no risks in 
<br/>terms of our navigational aids.   As I have mentioned, I do not want to dwell on the past as some of 
<br/>the honourable Opposition Members have been doing.  But, in reality, the Marine Department was 
<br/>like a Public Works Department.  They were constantly moving around in the whole of the maritime 
<br/>islands to monitor, check and fix the navigational aids.  But that was done away with and, again, 
<br/></span><span>taken up by the private sector which, as we have seen, has not been really effective and efficient in 
<br/></span><span>that regard.  So, we are doing a catch up in terms of the damage done by the past Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of planned future action, we plan to (in terms of MSAF) conduct a 
<br/>comprehensive  audit  of  all  commercial  and  passenger  vehicles  in  this  financial  year,  to  ensure 
<br/>compliance and updated safety standards.  This includes advanced training for incident management 
<br/>and adoption of new technologies for monitoring and enforcement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week two Australian Maritime Safety Authority senior staff are in Fiji to conduct port 
<br/>state and flex state surveys and enforcement training to all of the MSAF surveyors and enforcement 
<br/>officers.  The training is  made possible through MSAF membership of the Asia-Pacific Regional 
<br/>arrangement on Maritime Safety  and Maritime Environment Protection as espoused in the Tokyo 
<br/>MOU Framework.  It is building capacity in terms of our MOU local capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have mentioned, the proposal for legislative amendments are already 
<br/>underway,  to  tighten  the  regulations  and  introduce  mandatory  incident  reporting  for  all  maritime 
<br/>operators.    The  review  entails  mandatory  marine  spill  vessel  insurance,  shipwreck  insurance  and 
<br/>assessing  the  compliance  requirements  and  standards,  including  restricting  the  age  of  imported 
<br/>vessels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also include the possible lowering of the vessel deregistration age.  The MSAF remains 
<br/>committed  to  enhancing  maritime  safety  through  continuous  improvement,  as  I  have  mentioned 
<br/>specifically, also through regulatory framework, enforcement mechanisms and public awareness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Pacific  regional  maritime  scene,  MSAF  has  commenced  negotiations  to  establish 
<br/>bilateral MOUs with maritime safety administrations of the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and Papua 
<br/>New Guinea.  This will enhance the cooperation within the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) and 
<br/>through the MSG Framework in partnership with other maritime nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The same arrangement will extend to other Pacific Island Forum Member Countries as we 
<br/>are  progressing  towards  supporting  the  SPC  initiative  to  a  Pacific-One  Maritime  Framework, 
<br/>harmonisation and recognition of Maritime Safety Standards, protection of the maritime environment 
<br/></span><span>and capacity building of seafarers across the region.   For the future, next year, MSAF will be looking 
<br/></span><span>at the same arrangement on MOUs with Australia, New Zealand and Singapore.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of an ongoing issue on marine pollution and derelict ships, through partnership with 
<br/>other  maritime  partners  and  stakeholders,  in  this  case  the  Fiji  Ports  Corporation  Limited  have 
<br/>together, derived working data on wrecks, derelicts and abandoned vessels, especially within Fiji’s 
<br/>port boundaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, a joint MSAF and FPCL Committee on removal of these vessels have been formed and 
<br/>convened on a weekly basis to fast-track the removal processes under the Seaport Management Act 
<br/>and Maritime Transport Act.  Both legislations outlined provisions for the removal process to wrecks, 
<br/>derelicts and abandoned vessels. Unfortunately, nothing concrete had been done in the past and I do 
<br/>not want to dwell into the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, this has been an ongoing issue, and the Coalition Government is dealing with 
<br/>this ongoing problem of derelict vessels which honourable Ketan Lal had also raised, apart from the 
<br/>ongoing pothole issue he has raised.   I am pleased to advise that the Joint Committee is working 
<br/>closely with the removal processes. In fact, a meeting has identified wrecks, derelicts and abandoned 
<br/>vehicles and through the FPCL Seaport Management Act processes, all these owners and agents were 
<br/>issued with the Letter of Vessel Concern at the meeting.  The Letter of Vessel Concern is for the 
<br/>owner to upgrade the vessel to seaworthiness, or failure to do that within 30 days will result in a 
<br/></span><span>Removal Process Letter which they should act on within 21 days.  So, failure to comply will result 
<br/></span><span>in vessel seizure, removal or auction if the vessel has any value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the MSAF process, all Fiji registered vessels under this category are to deregister, a full 
<br/>survey conducted to determine seaworthiness and viability, and if beyond economic repairs, then the 
<br/>vessel is seized for removal either through scuttling, scraping and sinking at identified diving areas 
<br/>of more than 30 metres, mostly for recreational diving purposes and fish spawning. Of course, with 
<br/>full consultation with the Department of Environment.  With the timeframe in terms of what I have 
<br/>described,  the  first  tangible  removal  of  vessels  should  begin  to  happen  from  November  2024 
<br/>onwards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  have  been  issues  raised  with  passenger  movement  in  terms  of  the  management  of 
<br/>passengers during peak periods. This is an ongoing concern, not only from the members of the public, 
<br/>but in terms of MSAF as the regulator, MSAF has instructed shipowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues  raised and identified is the mismatch between the tickets  issued and the 
<br/>passengers,  and  the  passengers  allowable  for  that  vessel.    So,  I  urge  ship  operators  and  vessel 
<br/>operators to, please, put the safety of passengers as number one priority. So, whatever ticket you 
<br/>issue must be the one allowable for that passenger because the number of passengers on the boat is 
<br/>related to the capacity of that vessel and also the safety procedures and equipment in that vessel.  For 
<br/>example, the number of life jackets must match the number of passengers. So, that is an issue which 
<br/>MSAF is  emphasising right now and closely monitoring.  The onus is  on the operator to,  please, 
<br/>ensure that number of tickets you sell does not exceed. Most of the overloading is in the peak season, 
<br/>for example, school holidays, Christmas and, again, this is an ongoing issue year in, year out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I have insisted on MSAF to, please, do its role as the regulator and apply the law, because 
<br/>I believe in the last Government, I am not sure of the implications of the MSAF regulation because 
<br/>there was sort of a tendency to look at that very liberally.  So, the shipowners are fully aware of the 
<br/>plan and in addition, there needs to be standby vessels if there is an excess of passengers.  It is the 
<br/>responsibility of ship operators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For connecting and preparing for unplanned mechanical breakdown, MSAF is stepping up 
<br/></span><span>the  pace  of  routine  and  in-between  surveys  and  spot  checks  of  vessels  and  its  machineries  and 
<br/></span><span>onboard equipment.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  some  of  the  2023-2024  activities  of  MSAF,  the  Boat  Master  Licences  and 
<br/>Restricted Marine Engineer Class 6 training programmes have been conducted where in excess of 
<br/>1,500 participants were trained and also certified.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Survey and Registration programme, 629 registered vessels were surveyed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and registered.  These include small boats.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Seafarers  training  and  registration  programme  where  more  than  3,500  seafarers  have 
<br/>completed assessment and certification.  This is important because in a recent incident in Lau where 
<br/>a boat capsized, the operator was not certified and when someone is not certified, he is not aware of 
<br/>the safety procedures and what to do and what not to do in emergencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, MSAF has launched a 5-year training plan to  enhance 
<br/>staff competencies. Of course, the review of the Ship Management System and the Audit Framework 
<br/>and  conducting  maritime  survey  outreach  programmes  to  remote  locations.  There  is  partnership 
<br/>between regional maritime authorities, digitalisation, and there is urgent work where there needs to 
<br/>be catch-up on repairing and upgrading the navigational aids and beacon across the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those were the updates in terms of MSAF and maritime environment and 
<br/></span><span>work which continues in terms of compliance and, particularly, for adherence of safety regulations 
<br/>in terms of our maritime operations, and the safety of our people in moving between our maritime 
<br/>provinces and our main islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn the House now for tea.  Before 
<br/>doing so, I also invite the school children and those in the public gallery to join in and have some 
<br/>free time to discuss things with your, I do not know whether it is favourite Member of Parliament or 
<br/>most popular Member of Parliament since they will all be there having tea as well.  We will resume 
<br/>when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed,  I would like to inform you that 
<br/>we have, amongst us, another batch of Year 8 Students and Teachers from Yat Sen Primary School. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  humbled  by  your  presence  this  morning,  students  and  teachers.  This  is  your 
<br/>Parliament, this is where we make laws, we change and amend laws, and we even repeal laws. This 
<br/>Chamber has been in existence for so many years now since we were in the colonial era and then we 
<br/>had elections and then today you are here with us.  Welcome to our Parliament.   I hope that the 
<br/>proceedings this morning will give you some idea of how your Parliament and how your Members 
<br/>of Parliament do carry out their work in this august House. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  will  continue,  and  I  now  invite  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his address on 
<br/></span><span>MSAF.  Being maritime sailors 3,500 years ago, the sailors of the Pacific were the best in the world.  
<br/></span><span>We were the leading edge on this and when this country was settled by people that came down from 
<br/>Taiwan to Papua New Guinea, to Solomons, to Vanuatu and to Fiji around 3,500 years ago, at that 
<br/>time we were right at number one of the world. When the sailors came to Fiji, they realised how well 
<br/>our sailors did.  It is one of the things to get back to that but maritime, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very 
<br/>important for different areas such as tourism, shipping and fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that strike me with the speech by the honourable Minister is that he kept talking 
<br/>about Public Works Department (PWD).  He has got all this thinking about PWD running the ships. 
<br/>Let me remind him that PWD was never responsible for shipping in this country. It was the Marine 
<br/>Department, but the Marine Department had two roles. It was the referee and the player, so what 
<br/>Government did was took out the referee bit and put MSAF in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The player bit was Government Shipping Services (GSS). That was what was done. I do not 
<br/>know what the honourable Minister is trying to say; keep the player and the referee the same.  That 
<br/>was the development that was done to be able to improve. If you have the wrong the systems, you 
<br/>will get the wrong kind of results. Overtime, that regulatory bit went to MSAF, and it needs to be 
<br/>able to do that bit well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He talked a bit about derelicts without really talking about the complexities of derelicts that 
<br/>we have.  When you have derelicts, there are different parties that are responsible for different things. 
<br/>Fiji Ports Corporation Limited has jurisdiction over the ports from Nukulau all the way to Draunibota. 
<br/>They have that, and they control the movement of ships, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, MSAF is the one that declares the derelicts, but if you declare the derelict and you do not 
<br/>take into account all the other parties, then someone will have to pay all of these. All of those issues 
<br/>are things that need to be ironed out. You are trying to say that the Government in the past did not 
<br/>do it, you need to understand the complexities of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to hear that the honourable Minister is talking about reviewing 
<br/>the law, all of these things have to be looked at. I would suggest, given the congestion that we have 
<br/>in the port here, we might need to have two different ports: one operational port in Suva where the 
<br/></span><span>boats  that  are  actually  doing  work,  unloading,  loading  cargo  coming  into  Suva,  the  rest  that  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="16">Page 16</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2061 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>waiting on operation should stay on the Laucala side. I think that has been the suggestion that has 
<br/>worked in the past and it will help us to control it, at the moment, everybody comes here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, we also need to look at one of the big things. There is no shipping company in Fiji 
<br/>that can afford to get rid of derelicts because of the cost. Maybe we need to look at insurance systems, 
<br/>insurance schemes and included in that insurance. Maybe the premium can also be a bit high and 
<br/>included in those insurance premiums are the cost of removing derelicts because when it comes to 
<br/>cutting up or sinking ships, or scuttling ships, it is very expensive. These are the kind of advice I am 
<br/>getting from some people on this side of the Parliament who are IMO auditors and are also certified 
<br/>to captain ships over 1,000 tonnes, so that was the advice that was given across to the honourable 
<br/>Minister today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad to see all the work that has been done by MSAF in terms of swift 
<br/>shipping, cleaner seas, lot of good policies. One thing I am concerned about Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope 
<br/>when  you  have  all  these  policies,  it  is  not  the  Government  Ministers  themselves  who  break  the 
<br/>requirements for compliance. I hope it is not the Government Ministers and Government officials 
<br/>when they travel on these ships, they themselves break the requirements. Overloading! I hope as you 
<br/>go  around  the  islands,  you  are  not  having  overloaded  boats  and  you  just  turned  a  blind  eye  to  it 
<br/></span><span>because this is one thing, if you have great rules and policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am not saying, I am just saying and I hope that you are not, so please 
<br/>do not do it! I am saying that people say, “oh, great policy! Hey, but the head honchos themselves 
<br/>are  breaking  the  policies.    Maybe  it  is  alright  for  all  of  us  to  break  the  policies  and  to  be  non-
<br/>compliant.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move on, one of the things that I notice a few years ago, MSAF has 
<br/>got  ISO  9001  certified.  That  means  they  have  benchmarked  themselves  against  international 
<br/>standards. I think this is a good move, we talked it about on CAAF about two or three days ago, about 
<br/>how they had to lift the standard and now I suggest this is something that we can apply all across 
<br/>state owned enterprises and statutory bodies. We used to have a system in Fiji which we called the 
<br/>Service Excellence Programme that used the criteria of the Malcolm Balbridge Excellence Awards 
<br/>and apply that to all of our entities, and it allowed us Sir, to benchmark against international standards 
<br/>so that we can lift the whole performance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I said, our people in the islands, shipping is very important for them. We need to make 
<br/>sure  that  the  quality  of  ships  are  good.  I  am  wondering  whether  we  are  strictly  enforcing  the 
<br/>requirements by MSAF to kick off on those people that are allowed to make fibreglass boats because 
<br/>if those boats are not safe, if we are not making sure that they comply to the standards, then their 
<br/>ships break apart in the seas, that will cause loss of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I congratulate the honourable Minister, I know MSAF have got a good CEO now, good 
<br/>Board, a lot of good policies. I noticed also that in their budget, they had asked for, how much money 
<br/>did they ask for? The budget that they have asked for in their strategic planning, they are not getting 
<br/>that money, so honourable Minister for Finance, you might want to have a look if you really think 
<br/>about the maritime people there, please make sure that they get enough money to be able to do things, 
<br/>so we can keep them safe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I like the body language and everything that goes with it, a very inspiring 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way of making your presentation.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now call on the honourable Leader of the G-9 Bloc or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement 
<br/>on MSAF, an important organisation for a maritime nation like Fiji.  Because of our geography, we 
<br/>are a flag State because we register vessels, and a port State also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are obliged under international conventions to do a lot of things that comes under MSAF 
<br/>– United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), International Convention for the 
<br/>Safety of Life At Sea (SOLAS) and International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from 
<br/>Ships (MARPOL).  They fall under this very important organisation, in addition to regulating the 
<br/>local shipping, making sure that they are safe.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  a  lot  of  yachts  that  come  in  Fiji  and  as  soon as  they  enter  Fiji 
<br/>waters, the safety aspect, in some cases, it has to do with this very important organisation, MSAF.  
<br/>One aspect I think of monitoring and ensuring compliance that is a little bit lacking, is on our small 
<br/>boats that are crossing from island to island.  They set a crossing from Vatulewa to Taveuni and other 
<br/>points in Vanua Levu, crossing across to Taveuni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was an incident lately of the small boat that ran aground, and kids were swimming. I 
<br/></span><span>think they wanted to lighten the load, and that was exactly the wrong thing to do, to get these kids 
<br/>into the water.  I hope the investigation on that incident has been done and remedial action have been 
<br/>taken on small boats complying with safety regulations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think if you look at the statistics for search and rescue, most of the search and rescue is done 
<br/>because of the non-compliance of small boats that traverse our waters.  For islands, that is the only 
<br/>way they travel between those islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You talked about navigational aids which is equally important.  As we make sure the ships 
<br/>are safe, we ensure also that the route that they take is well marked and safe so that they do not run 
<br/>aground.  We have a lot of beacons that the posts stand on.  The posts only marks where the danger 
<br/>is, it is the part at the top that is missing, that tells the captain which side you should be travelling on.  
<br/>And with that part missing at the top, there is a chance that they might go on the wrong side and run 
<br/>aground.  For beacons and lights, because we are so prone to cyclones, every time a cyclone passes 
<br/>through, most of the time the heads of these beacons will disappear.  They need to be put back in 
<br/>place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree totally with what was mentioned by honourable Usamate.  MSAF 
<br/>has a good CEO, and we wish him well - Mr. Cawaki and his Board, the big role that he played for 
<br/>the  maritime  nation  like  Fiji.    I  have  the  feeling  that  you  need  to  increase  the  number  of  MSAF 
<br/>enforcement officers.  When we went from Vatulewa to Taveuni with the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and Defence, we went on two fibreglass boats to cross over.  There was no MSAF 
<br/>officer on the Vatulewa side to check whether the boats that are crossing have life jackets and all the 
<br/>safety features.  We had life jackets and there were two police boats that we crossed on.  I think there 
<br/>is a need to increase enforcement officers so that they can be spread around these points where our 
<br/>small boats cross. I thank the honourable Minister for his Statement this morning.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move on to my Statement, allow me once more to congratulate our 
<br/>own Fiji school Boys Under 18 Team on their second victory against the Australian School Boys 
<br/>defeating them by 34 points to 25 yesterday afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I also take this opportunity to wish our Team that will be in Palau this week all the very 
<br/>best. The Team is being led by the Permanent Secretary, Ratu Meli Nacuva and FASANOC.  They 
<br/>will be making our final presentations for our 2031 Pacific Games bid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  rise  today  to  address  an  ongoing  matter  that  has  drawn  significant  public 
<br/>attention, the situation involving the Fiji Rugby Union and the players.  As a nation with deep-rooted 
<br/>pride in our rugby heritage, it is essential that we remain transparent and proactive in handling any 
<br/>challenges that may affect our national sport and its representatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the World Cup preparation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the request of the honourable Minister of 
<br/>Justice, the Trustees voluntarily took responsibility of Fiji Rugby in May 2023, four months prior to 
<br/>the World Cup and at that time, their biggest priority was in finding the funding to get our Flying 
<br/>Fijians into camp, to train and then to play in the World Cup and return to their clubs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only funding in place at that time was from Government of a grant of $2.5 million for 
<br/></span><span>the preparation and participation.  After discussions with Fiji Water, through the Office of the Prime 
<br/>Minister, their arranged to assist with a sponsorship of $3.8 million. The total budget was $10 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  when  the  World  Cup  Team  came  together  in  Taveuni  and  discussed  and 
<br/>negotiated their contracts for the World Cup campaign, the then Fiji Rugby Interim Administrator 
<br/>advised that it was agreed that each Flying Fijian squad member, 33 players in total, would receive 
<br/>a sign-on fee of $30,000 and an allowance of $500 per day from 1</span><span>st</span><span> July to 15</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023. That 
<br/>is around 107 days.  In fact, the players had asked for $600 per day and a few players were in camp 
<br/>earlier from around 1</span><span>st</span><span> July.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With Government backing and after a visit from the honourable Prime Minister, bonuses were 
<br/>offered at that time of $30,000 for winning the quarterfinal, $40,000 for winning the semifinal and 
<br/>$50,000 for winning the final.  The bonuses were, therefore, based on the Team’s achievements and 
<br/>promised for after the World Cup.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in  addition  to  the agreed payments, Fiji  Rugby, Fiji  Government and World 
<br/>Rugby paid all expenses for the Flying Fijians for preparation for and participation in the 2023 Rugby 
<br/>World Cup  - all travel  to, from  and during camp; international  air travel; all accommodation and 
<br/>meals; all playing and training gear; and incidentals also.  These had also been budgetted for by Fiji 
<br/>Rugby, World Rugby and Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  former  captain’s  claims,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  difficulty,  of  course,  is  in  the  former 
<br/>captain’s original statement where he stated that issues existed between Rugby House and the players 
<br/>going back 10 years. Questions have been raised on unpaid money as far back as 1987, 2007 and 
<br/>2019.  But the current trustees have only been there for a year and regrettably, it will be a challenge 
<br/>to investigate every claim if records are not available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there appears to have been a lot of frustration among the players and sadly, the 
<br/>Trustees currently at Rugby House are taking the brunt of it. They have reached out to the players, 
<br/>met with several of them and they have heeded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on other players’ comments, in various comments from the players, there 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been a distinct theme of misinformation, and a lot of issues raised are simply not factual.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, players concerns raised on what happened to the £6,000 or FJ$1.7million 
<br/>that World Rugby awarded for reaching the quarterfinals was very quickly answered by World Rugby 
<br/>in releases to the media, advising that there was no prizemoney awarded for reaching the quarterfinals 
<br/>of the World Cup. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, further questions on where the prizemoney for the Fiji Men’s Sevens Team 
<br/>who competed at a tournament in Samoa last year, a reported $25,000.  It was noted that the coach 
<br/>of the Fiji Sevens Team had told the Samoa organisers that they could keep the prizemoney.   It was 
<br/>also noted that all the players were advised of this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon this coming to the notice of the Trustees, the Trustees requested the Samoa organisers 
<br/>to give the prizemoney to FRU.  Internally, the Trustees had agreed that the prizemoney would be 
<br/>shared between the players and the Samoa organisers.  Unfortunately, Samoa could not honour that 
<br/>payment, and the cheque received at the time was returned as there were no funds in the Samoans’ 
<br/>bank account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the coaches, statements that the 15s coach had not been paid and that 
<br/>even the current coach had not been paid for some months has been refuted by the coaches concerned, 
<br/></span><span>as the coaches have been paid by the Fiji National Sports Commission through Government grant for 
<br/></span><span>internationally qualified coaches. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, initially, the issue of corruption raised against FRU has not been proven 
<br/>factual as the Trustees requested evidence with a promise to pass it on to FICAC or to the police for 
<br/>investigation,  and  no  team  member  has  been  able  to  provide  any  information  on  instances  of 
<br/>corruption.  In responding to the former captain’s initial comments, the Trustees expressed concern 
<br/>on the player issues but took the accusation of corruption very seriously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On issues prior to the quarterfinal, regrettably, three days before the quarterfinal, the Team 
<br/>Manager  arranged a zoom  meeting between the former  captain, some team  members and the Fiji 
<br/>Rugby Interim Administrator at that time.   Mr. Speaker, Sir, in that meeting, the former captain and 
<br/>some players demanded payment of bonuses prior to the quarterfinal, and they threatened Fiji Rugby 
<br/>that they would not play the quarterfinal match unless the bonuses were paid first. This was the first 
<br/>time that the Trustees were made aware that the players differed with the Interim Administrator on 
<br/>the timing of the bonus payment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Trustees took this threat seriously because of the serious implications and consequences 
<br/>in Fiji. In addition, the pressure on Fiji Rugby was enormous, particularly as there would be serious 
<br/>implications on funding if Government did not agree to the bonus.   We had no option, but to approach 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister to seek his advice and concurrence on a course of action.  Government 
<br/>would have to pay the bonus, much earlier than planned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an undertaking was given to the players by the Prime Minister’s Office that 
<br/>they would be paid the quarter final bonus they demanded, immediately after the quarters. Because 
<br/>of Government’s processes which was appreciated by Fiji Rugby and the risk that the bonus would 
<br/>not be paid when demanded, the Trustees had to seek an overdraft facility for the immediate payment.  
<br/>Government then reimbursed FRU later, well after the team returned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Rugby could not and will never risk a boycott of any match by a Fiji 
<br/>Rugby Team, team let alone a quarterfinal of the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The consequence of such 
<br/>a boycott would likely have been Fiji players and Fiji Rugby being expelled from participating in the 
<br/></span><span>World  Rugby  matches.  The  former  captain  and  the  senior  players  were  aware  of  this  but, 
<br/></span><span>unfortunately, still proceeded with their demands.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2065 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the payments, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that the bonus was not only promised 
<br/>but was paid.  The sign-on fee of $30,000 has been paid.  The $500 daily allowance has been paid. 
<br/>Fiji Rugby has already stated that a few payments were late due to regulatory processes that had to 
<br/>be complied with. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all payments due are part of the full review being undertaken as I speak. 
<br/>Only last week, the CEO of the Drua confirmed that all the Drua players were also receiving their 
<br/>full paid Drua salary as their time with the Flying Fijians was seen as national duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On available resources, the Flying Fijians are a nationally proud group, most of whom played 
<br/>for  national  pride  when  they  are  called  up  to  do  so  for  family  and  country.  Fiji  Rugby  and  the 
<br/>supporters also want the team to be fairly compensated for their efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sports has become very expensive, and Fiji does not have the resources of 
<br/>Australia, New Zealand, England, France or Japan, where a number of our players are on contracts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently, Fiji Rugby's national teams, player development and welfare, as 
<br/>well as our domestic competition, cost Fiji Rugby approximately $30 million per annum and that 
<br/></span><span>depends on a few generous sponsors, the Fiji Government and a grant from World Rugby.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Trustees and their progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the Trustees were appointed last 
<br/>year, Fiji Rugby was in trouble, as reported earlier. It had substantial debts owing over $6.8 million 
<br/>and assets of only $3 million. In the Trustees report, they have cleared the majority of their debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Trustees have restructured the operations since and after meetings with 
<br/>every union, the new structure has been accepted and, yes, a new professional business model under 
<br/>a company limited by guarantee was approved by all the unions to take over the operations of rugby 
<br/>in Fiji. The company, its Articles of Association and Constitution were approved by all of the unions 
<br/>at the recent Special General meeting. These documents have been approved by World Rugby and 
<br/>FASANOC which represents the Olympic Committee in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, in the first round of voting by the unions, a Special Nominations Committee was 
<br/>elected. This professional Committee will now be responsible to vet and approve all nominations for 
<br/>the new Board of Directors to be elected at the AGM on 9</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The players have got their wish, thanks to the unions themselves electing to be a professional 
<br/>business.  The  Trustees  and  unions,  by  restructuring  and  approving  the  new  Constitution  and 
<br/>operations, have satisfied the concerns of World Rugby. We now have re-admitted Fiji Rugby to the 
<br/>World Rugby Council and only last week, the CEO of Fiji Rugby was in Dublin at World Rugby 
<br/>Headquarters, representing Fiji at meetings held there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one change that was demanded by both, World Rugby and the International 
<br/>Olympic Organization was that all voting members of any board of national sports organisation had 
<br/>to be elected by the members of that sport and as such, this meant that the previous mandated position 
<br/>given to the Prime Minister's Board nominee could not be appointed to Fiji Rugby Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there is a course of action that can be taken by the directors to invite a government 
<br/>representative to sit on the Board. If any member of Parliament wishes to sit on the National Sports 
<br/>board, they can, but they must be elected. The honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection is a current member of Fiji Rugby Union Board.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Accusations,  Investigation  and  Audit:    Mr. Speaker,  Sir,  the  Trustees  of  Fiji  Rugby  have 
<br/>accepted that the issues and accusations made by the players must be addressed and as such, have 
<br/>written and been in contact with them. The Trustees have held meetings with players and coaches. 
<br/>They  have  promised  to  investigate  the  players’  claims,  and  as  such,  engaged  I.  Naiveli  &amp;  Co 
<br/>Chartered Accountants, to review each of the 43 players’ contracts, payment disbursements, as well 
<br/>as the timing of payments. Sir, this exercise is currently in progress and the first report should be 
<br/>received later this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, regarding the 43 players engaged in 2023, all have been given a schedule 
<br/>of payments, that disclosed the funds disbursed to their respective bank account during the period 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July, 2023 to 15</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, and the players have been requested to confirm and cross-check 
<br/>with their bank to confirm that the payments have been deposited into their respective accounts. Once 
<br/>these player disbursements have been addressed and the final report from I. Naiveli &amp; Co. Chartered 
<br/>Accountants has been received, the Trustees will publicly release the findings of the review. Any 
<br/>shortfalls in payment to any player during the period mentioned, the Trustees are committed to settle 
<br/>them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must commend the Trustees of Fiji Rugby for the work they 
<br/></span><span>do. They were appointed due to their business and professional experience and involvement in rugby 
<br/></span><span>and sports. They should be thanked for all they have achieved.  Not one of them has received any 
<br/>remuneration for the over 80 meetings they have held in the last 14 months, all in an effort to get 
<br/>rugby on the right track. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rugby is more than just a sport in Fiji - it is a symbol of our national unity 
<br/>and strength. While challenges like this are unfortunate, I remain confident that with the collaborative 
<br/>efforts of all stakeholders, we will resolve these matters promptly and continue to build a strong, 
<br/>unified rugby community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I look forward to meeting with the Trustees once they receive I. Naiveli &amp; Co’s report, so as 
<br/>we can answer and address everything with honesty and sincerity. The people of Fiji require this, and 
<br/>our rugby players deserve the truth which they shall get. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  earlier,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Youth  and 
<br/>Sports had made it clear that the Government is no longer involved in the recent saga between FRU 
<br/>and the Flying Fijian captain’s claims.  But now, he has been making statements on it because it is a 
<br/>matter to discuss, because it is about the future of our youth for career in rugby.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very serious allegations have surfaced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and it is on the verge of boycotting 
<br/>by the Flying Fijians at the quarter final clash against England in 2023. And just now, the honourable 
<br/>Minister highlighted that our players demanded bonuses and threatened FRU, and further states that 
<br/>all has been paid to the players. But it is quite interesting to note that FRU has responded saying that 
<br/>they ensure a thorough and impartial review. They have engaged in an external audit, and they are 
<br/>committed to transparency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  go  a  few  months  back,  the  Fiji  Women's  Sevens  team  slept  on  the 
<br/>benches  outside  the  Sydney  Airport  while  the  Men’s  Sevens  Team  slept  in  a  hostel,  reported  by 
<br/></span><span>fijivillage</span><span> on Monday, 20</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024. The honourable Minister for Youth and Sports then said that 
<br/>FRU did not realise that Sydney Airport closes at 11 p.m., which led to players sleeping outside. So, 
<br/>the question is, who was sleeping on the job that caused our players to sleep outside on the benches?  
<br/>Many people are asking, is this the way we are empowering the aspiring youths of Fiji for a career 
<br/></span><span>in rugby just so that they can sleep on benches at international airports?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, when this

<div><span>2067 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>news gets circulated by international media, they make a mockery out of our players, management 
<br/>and the nation as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, coming back to this matter, when honourable Vocea asked the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Youth and Sports about the Fiji Secondary School Rugby Deans Competition, I saw this 
<br/>is an opportunity to ask a direct supplementary question regarding the claims by the former Flying 
<br/>Fijian captain. We are a very effective Opposition, and we bring current matters right to Parliament 
<br/>and definitely we will make a very good government in the next two years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to agree with you on a matter of disconnect, which you stated 
<br/>yesterday. I would like to quote you from the Hansard Report, in fact, on Monday, that honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister offered to pay $20,000, and this is what you responded to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Youth and Sports. You mentioned here that you are not paying for the $20,000 that will be given 
<br/>to the sevens aside team. And here there is a bit disconnection. I agree with you,  there is a lot of 
<br/>disconnection, a lot of disconnection with this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian people embraced rugby.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Government Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- See a glass falls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Fijian  people  embrace  rugby,  making  it  part  of  their  daily  lives  and 
<br/>culture. Today, rugby stands as a symbol of national pride and unity in Fiji. Our Fijian players have 
<br/>…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a misleading statement. I just want to remind 
<br/>the honourable Member that award given to the Fiji Rugby Sevens Team it was my paper to Cabinet. 
<br/>How can I oppose that here?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You said it! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- I did not oppose it! It was my paper to Cabinet.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  level  of  disconnection  is  quite  surprising.  I 
<br/>would like to continue. Our Fijian players not only have excelled in the field, but also have become 
<br/>role models for the younger athletes because their claims now, like I highlighted on Monday, the 
<br/>younger  ones  are  looking  up  to  them  and  what  they  say.  Their  success  stories  highlight  the 
<br/>opportunities  that  rugby  can  provide  both  locally  and  internationally,  and  rugby  has  become  a 
<br/>pathway for social mobility, offering young Fijians the chance to improve their lives and support 
<br/>their families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issues and challenges exist everywhere, and it will be an 
<br/>ongoing  issue.  But  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Youth  and  Sports,  you  really  need  to  fix  this 
<br/>disconnect. This requires proper investigation and audit. Honourable Minister for Youth and Sports, 
<br/>budgeting  is  one  thing  and  how  you  use  the  finances,  is  the  other.  We  need  to  promote  good 
<br/>governance,  integrity,  transparency  and  accountability,  because  at  the  end  of  the  day,  it  is  the 
<br/>Government that funds FRU through the Fijian National Sports Commission.

<div><span>I understand there is an AGM that is planned for November, where unions can voice their 
<br/>concerns. There is also calls for a Player Association to set up to protect the players. Like honourable 
<br/>Premila  Kumar  said,  the  players  need  to  be  part  of  the  decision-making  process,  especially  the 
<br/>younger ones.  The appointed personnel who cannot deliver need to wake up or go home. We, as a 
<br/>nation, have come too far with the success of rugby to mess it up now for our future generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – I now call upon the honourable Leader of G9-bloc, or their designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.– Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Youth and Sports for his ministerial statement regarding the current situation of the Fiji 
<br/>Rugby  Union.  Throughout  the  world,  over  many  years,  sports  have  unified  people.  They  draw 
<br/>communities together in common purpose. They have people of different faith, different races and 
<br/>different walks of life who come together to support their local team or their national team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  rugby  holds  this  place  in  Fiji.  It  is  truly  our  national  sports,  and  we  all 
<br/>experience how important it could be to us, as a people our sense of being one nation like in 2016. 
<br/>When we won the Olympic gold medal it was a time of pure pride and great joy for every Fijian 
<br/>around the world. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji rugby which we are born with has come a long way. We are 
<br/></span><span>an international superpower in the sevens code and have been toppling tier one nations in fifteens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Rugby Union is not an income generating institution but relies heavily on sponsorships 
<br/>and funding from companies and sponsors to support its operations and tournaments. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, for instance, to host the Farebrother and Skipper Cup, all of the cost is an estimated expenditure 
<br/>of over 1 million  dollars. The problem  with  the Fiji  Rugby Union is due to  the lack of visionary 
<br/>leaders in the past. They are relying heavily on grants and whenever there is a delay it will affect 
<br/>everyone in the Fiji Rugby Union.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, rugby in Fiji has not been effectively monetised to its full potential which 
<br/>could have financial benefits for the sport. For example, till to date there is no merchandise shop of 
<br/>the FRU in order to buy and bring back money to the union. I thank the current Fiji Rugby Union 
<br/>trustees  on  offering  to  focus  on  setting  up  alternative  revenue  streams  and  not  to  rely  solely  on 
<br/>sponsors and grants. I would like to thank: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Peter Mazey; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Mrs. Jenny Seeto; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Alipate Naiorosui; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Sikeli Tuinamuana; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Mr. Mosese Naivalu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who are all volunteers and Trustees but have rugby at heart.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  committed  to  improving  management  practice,  instilling  a  positive  work 
<br/>environment and changing communication channels and promoting accountability and transparency 
<br/>with the rugby house to assist with efforts to advance rugby in the country. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am 
<br/>calling  on  the  rugby  unions  in  Fiji  to  learn  from  the  past  and  continue  to  work  hard  to  achieve 
<br/>continuous improvements and management towards the performance of our teams.

<div><span>report via Cabinet, but I also acknowledge that I also have a duty to do here in this august Parliament, 
<br/>so I apologise for that.  I am presenting my Report now, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Leader of the Opposition for raising this point and the opportunity to inform this 
<br/>august  Parliament  of  the  outcomes  of  the  4</span><span>th</span><span>  Conference  of  the  Small  Island  Developing  States 
<br/>(SIDS) held from 27</span><span>th</span><span> May to 30</span><span>th</span><span> May in St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda. The unique vulnerabilities 
<br/>and challenges of SIDS were first recognised by the international community in 1992 at the Rio Earth 
<br/>Summit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  then,  three  major  conferences  in  Barbados  1994,  Mauritius  2005,  and  Samoa  2014, 
<br/>have progressively shaped our collective agenda to address these specific challenges. Building on the 
<br/>shared narratives established during these foundational conferences, the fourth conference in Antigua 
<br/>and Barbuda advanced our efforts to accelerate sustainable development outcomes for SIDS. They 
<br/>also identified shared priorities for achieving resilient, equitable and sustainable growth pathways 
<br/>for our small island nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister's leadership in entrusting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me with the responsibility of leading Fiji's delegation to the fourth SIDS Conference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SIDS  is  recognised  as  a  distinct  group  of  developing  countries  facing 
<br/>specific social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities at the 1992 United Nations Conference 
<br/>on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The SIDS grouping comprises 39 UN 
<br/>Member States from three geographical regions:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Caribbean; 
<br/>the Pacific; 
<br/>the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea (AIS).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our challenges are well known, stemming from our small size, remoteness and geographic 
<br/>dispersion and scattered populations and its effect on our economies and development. SIDS require 
<br/>better  support  to  enhance  resilience  to  exogenous  shocks,  such  as  market  fluctuations,  climatic 
<br/>extremes, and frequent and intense disasters. Despite being the lowest emitters of greenhouse gases, 
<br/>more than 40 percent of SIDS have debt-to-GDP ratio above 40 percent, with some exceeding 100 
<br/>percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At some stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji was in this group of nations and due to the hard work of 
<br/>this side of the Parliament and the honourable Minister of Finance that has been reduced to almost 
<br/>70  percent  at  the  moment.  Our  borrowing  from  global  financial  institutions  is  often  at  non-
<br/>concessional  rates.  Between  2017  and  2021,  no  more  than  1.55  percent  of  total  global  Official 
<br/>Development Assistance (ODA) was allocated to SIDS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fourth SIDS Conference, theme “Charting the Course Towards Resilient 
<br/>Prosperity,” brought together over 3000 delegates including 22 Heads of States and Government, 
<br/>highlighting  the  critical  importance  of  unity  and  cooperation  among  SIDS  in  addressing  shared 
<br/>challenges such as climate change, debt sustainability and economic vulnerability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  was  represented  by  myself  as  the  head  of  the  delegation,  supported  by  permanent 
<br/>representatives to the United Nations and the High Commissioner to United Kingdom, the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  for  Environment  and  Climate  Change,  the  Director  of  National  Disaster  Management 
<br/>Office,  the  Director  of  Multilateral  Affairs  at  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  key  Ministry 
<br/></span><span>Officials. Their participation in  the general  debate, side events  and bilateral  meetings highlighted

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji's  commitment  to  the  SIDS  agenda  and  our  leadership  in  the  global  discourse  on  sustainable 
<br/>development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji delegation co-hosted and participated in 11 side events on a range of issues, including 
<br/>early  warning  systems,  marine  biodiversity  protection,  SDG  localisation,  enhancing  the  digital 
<br/>economy and leveraging data and technology to improve planning and decision making. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On key decisions and outcomes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the SIDS global agenda has been shaped 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the Programmes of Action adopted at previous SIDS Conferences, the; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>1994 Barbados Programme of Action; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>2005 Mauritius Strategy; and  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>2014 the Samoa Pathway.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 4th SIDS Conference in Antigua and Barbuda builds upon this legacy with the adoption 
<br/>of  the  “Antigua  and  Barbuda  Agenda  for  SIDS  (ABAS)  -  A  Renewed  Declaration  for  Resilient 
<br/>Prosperity.” ABAS outlines the sustainable development aspirations of SIDS over the next 10 years 
<br/>and  calls  for  international  support  to  strengthen  health  systems,  build  strong  institutions,  achieve 
<br/></span><span>gender equality, and empower youth. It also seeks support for conserving, restoring, and sustainably 
<br/></span><span>using oceans, marine resources, and biodiversity, while facilitating easier access to affordable and 
<br/>concessional finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  ABAS  identifies  priority  areas  for  SIDS,  including  building  economic 
<br/>resilience, scaling-up climate and biodiversity action and support, conserving and sustainably using 
<br/>ocean  resources,  mainstreaming  disaster  risks,  health,  data  and  statistics, science  and  technology, 
<br/>populations,  and  partnerships.  Partnerships  are  the  cornerstone  for  implementing  this  agenda, 
<br/>requiring strategic collaborations with multilateral and bilateral development partners and through 
<br/>South-South and triangular cooperation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Numerous  initiatives  were  launched  at  the  4</span><span>th</span><span>  SIDS  Conference,  including  a  Centre  of 
<br/>Excellence for SIDS  and a Debt  Sustainability Support  Service, both  to  be based in  Antigua and 
<br/>Barbuda.  Multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners  also  announced  commitments  such  as 
<br/>scaling  up  international  climate  finance  and  mobilising  public  and  private  investments  for  SIDS. 
<br/>Throughout  the conference, significant  discussions were held  on revitalising  SIDS  economies for 
<br/>accelerated  sustainable  growth,  enhancing  financing  and  aid  effectiveness,  leveraging  digital 
<br/>technologies, making climate finance work for SIDS, and investing in human capital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  adoption  of  the  Antigua  and  Barbuda  Agenda  for  SIDS,  a  renewed  declaration  for 
<br/>resilient prosperity was welcomed as a robust outcome, encapsulating commitments across critical 
<br/>areas  such  as  climate  action,  debt  sustainability,  digital  transformation,  and  human  capital 
<br/>development.  Importantly,  it  seeks  to  usher  in  a  new  era  of  development  for  SIDS,  focused  on 
<br/>securing more equitable approaches and a better “fit for purpose” modalities for donor support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consensus established at SIDS4 on key financing priorities and reforms 
<br/>required from the global community and existing financing architecture, set a strong basis for SIDS 
<br/>positions at last month’s Summit of the Future in New York held in September, from the 22</span><span>nd</span><span> to 23</span><span>rd</span><span>.  
<br/>A key element emphasised by all SIDS was the value of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index,  
<br/>a methodology designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of national context.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without  a  robust  means  to  assess  national  circumstances  beyond  GDP  alone,  SIDS  will 
<br/></span><span>continue to face challenges in accessing finance, managing debt levels, and stimulating private sector 
<br/></span><span>investment. Concessional financing for SIDS is essential to building structural resilience, growing

<div><span>sustainable economies, protecting biodiversity, and advancing a sustainable and productive ocean-
<br/>based  sustainable  economies.  The  conference  saw  the  launch  of  several  specific  new  initiatives, 
<br/>including  the  Centre  of  Excellence  for  SIDS  and  the  SIDS  Debt  Sustainability  Service  Initiative, 
<br/>aimed at addressing unsustainable debt burdens faced by many small islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to emphasise that the priorities outlined in ABAS align with our 
<br/>national development plans and the region's 2050 Strategy for a Blue Pacific Continent. Integrating 
<br/>SIDS priorities into our policies and plans is imperative to achieving coherent and comprehensive 
<br/>progress towards the sustainable development agenda. ABAS has been adopted by the UN General 
<br/>Assembly in July, and the Summit of the Future offers world leaders another chance to forge a global 
<br/>consensus and support for the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I acknowledge the Fiji delegation who actively participated at the conference 
<br/>sessions, including at the general debate, the interactive dialogues, the high-level events convened 
<br/>by  the  UN  Secretary-General,  more  than  20  technical  side  events,  and  more  than  10  bilateral 
<br/>meetings. The UN Secretary-General has warned that we are confronting a climate crisis with the 
<br/>speed and urgency of a Formula 1 car, but we are responding with outdated and inadequate tools. 
<br/>The Government cannot tackle this challenge alone, we need the entire society to unite in developing 
<br/></span><span>innovative solutions to strengthen our resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite being the lowest greenhouse gas emitters, we face the most severe climate impacts. 
<br/>We  must  demand  debt  reduction  and  cancellation  and  ensure  easier  access  to  climate  financing. 
<br/>Investing in green and resilient infrastructure is essential for our survival and a sustainable future. 
<br/>Now is the time to be bold, take decisive action, and lead the way for our people and our planet. 
<br/>Thank you very much Mr. Speaker Sir for the opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.– Thank you, honourable Minister for that very informative statement that 
<br/>you have just undertaken. And before we invite the Leader of Opposition to make his comments or 
<br/>response, honourable Members, we have two streams here, SIDS, Small Island Development States. 
<br/>One is being headed by the honourable Minister that have just attended the meeting in the West Indies 
<br/>and the other one is chaired by the honourable Leader of the Opposition here, comes under SIDS as 
<br/>well that falls under the International Parliamentary Union (IPU). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, in the Pacific, I lost kind of pride in this whole process, some are attending that meeting, 
<br/>some are attending this meeting. We just come back from Palau, that is part of the SIDS that we are 
<br/>part  of,  and  now  we  are  going  to  be  hosting  another  one  in  Nadi,  in  the  hope  that  we  can  bring 
<br/>something together. Otherwise, I will find myself in a very terrible situation because I do not know, 
<br/>there is two SIDS here and we are both for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is better that we come to some understanding, someone has to pull out, we are already 
<br/>chairing this one here and we had several meetings in Natadola where people from the West Indies 
<br/>attended as well. And then, we have this one here, because we were wondering who was going to go 
<br/>there then all of a sudden, we saw your delegation honourable Minister attending this one here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, for the sake of trying to get some semblance here, what should we do? That is the question 
<br/>I would like to pose here before the Leader of Opposition makes his statement and the G9-bloc. We 
<br/>need  to  wind  this  out,  otherwise  there  will  be  two  groups  attending  the  same  meeting,  and  that 
<br/>meeting that occurs in the IPU, I lead that delegation all the time. So, it is a big waste of money and 
<br/>resources.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Let us suspend the proceedings now and thrash this out, because we need 
<br/>to come up with a better alternative.  Otherwise, the honourable Minister will be making submission 
<br/>down there.  It is linked to the UN. That particular one is linked to the Forum Secretariat and this one 
<br/>here, is under IPU.  So, this is where Parliamentarians have to decide and make submissions on issues 
<br/>like this on climate change and everything.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, let us agree that we suspend proceedings, so we can tackle this one 
<br/>here. For the sake of just trying to find ourselves in a single vote all the time, we agree.  So, we will 
<br/>suspend proceedings and let us thrash this one out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD. – Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. First of all, let me say that you 
<br/>are making a very valid point about the issue and sometimes an overlap of issues being discussed in 
<br/>the same way in different forums. I think there is a difference, the International Parliamentary Union 
<br/>(IPU) is really an institution of legislators which includes both Government and Opposition. It is a 
<br/>separate international organisation designed to bring legislators together so that they have a different 
<br/>platform to address these global issues in a legislative framework and how the legislature can behave.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SIDS is a UN platform and is a kind of a multilateral organisation, represented most of 
<br/>the time by governments, ministers, policymakers and officials. It is a different stream, and I think 
<br/>the reason why it is different is because the legislators have a different role in terms of supporting 
<br/>the UN system or the multilateral agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think what we are doing, Mr, Speaker, Sir, here is very good. Under your leadership and 
<br/>from the Government side as well, we are trying to involve the Opposition in a much bigger way. 
<br/>For  example,  when  we  go  to  COP,  COP  is  really  not  a  parliamentary  delegation,  but  it  is  a 
<br/>government  delegation.  But  it  does  not  stop  Government  from  taking  the  legislators  from  the 
<br/>Opposition side so that we build consensus in our own Parliament, in our own policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  then  we  have  what  we  call  Pacific  SIDS,  for  example.    Yesterday,  the 
<br/>meeting that I opened for Pacific Climate Change Ministers was really about the Pacific SIDS coming 
<br/>together and working out their position on a number of issues like the new quantified goal, because 
<br/>we want to have a Pacific position.  So, it is a separate PSIDS, it is a separate smaller grouping. But 
<br/>then the parliamentary PSIDS of the Pacific has a broader agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  your  point  is  taken,  I  think  we  can  connect  and  share  information  from  the 
<br/>Government point of view, which our Members of Parliament and is good that the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition is chairing. So, he has the benefit of knowing and understanding the Government 
<br/>processes, but also contributing to a broader legislative framework beyond our Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I think there is a difference and that will continue. The IPU is really not a UN organisation, 
<br/>it is an international body to support legislators around the world because in some countries, their 
<br/>situation is  really  bad, and you come up with  issues that others are able to  share. So, I hope that 
<br/>clarifies Government allocation of resources for delegations and maybe the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition may want to add to it. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  think  this  is  a  learning  for  all  of  us.  The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister and I did mention this yesterday, when we talked about  Fiji's Foreign 
<br/>Policy  White  Paper,  he  says  that  “oh  our  Foreign  Policy  White  Paper  says  that  regionalism  and 
<br/></span><span>multilateralism are force multipliers for our foreign policy.” The Pacific Small Island Developing 
<br/></span><span>States (PSIDS) that is the regional body, same thing with the Caribbean, they have the CARICOM, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2073 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are  regional bodies. But  when we go into multilateralism,  that is  where the geopolitics. The 
<br/>geopolitics are just divided into main regions, and you will be aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, PSIDS when 
<br/>it goes into multilateral bodies, we connect to the Alliance of Small Island States.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For your information, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Chairmanship is going to change from Samoa to 
<br/>Palau, that is happening next year. An Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). When we use the 
<br/>UN system links to G77+China, the biggest voting bloc in the United Nations. That includes Asia 
<br/>Pacific because we are the region and the African Union as well, of course the Caribbean, we are the 
<br/>biggest voting bloc.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, multilateralism has so many bodies. The first multilateral body was the IPU. 
<br/>It was formed in 1865 or 1868, the first multilateral body and then we have the United Nations (UN) 
<br/>that was formed in 1945. Under the UN there are so many other arms of the UN. One is the United 
<br/>Nations General Assembly (UNGA), for the Paris Agreement, the Climate Change we have United 
<br/>Nations Framework and Conventions for Climate Change (UNFCCC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe that the honourable Minister for Lands is going to another Conference of Parties 
<br/>(COP)  very  soon,  I  think  it  is  the  one  on  biodiversity,  The  Minister  for  Agriculture  is  our 
<br/></span><span>representative to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), that is another 
<br/></span><span>body. So, all these are multilateral bodies and for us, in terms of the way forward, we need both.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is importance for us is the consistency in our messaging from regional into AOSIS, into 
<br/>G77 plus  China, into the UNFCCC, into the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), which you will be 
<br/>heading next week. These are all multilateral bodies, we act locally, but we think globally. That is 
<br/>the main thing in all this, all Minister, all Members of Parliament must be aware of all this regional 
<br/>arrangements. That is why we insisted that a bus be brought into the house.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For consistency, I would recommend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we have done in your IPU team, 
<br/>before a delegation leaves particularly when you attend a multilateral meeting, there is a Bureau for 
<br/>Multilateral in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it is the best thing for us to seek advice because 
<br/>there are Fiji positions on most of these issues. You  cannot just go and say your own! You must 
<br/>anchor on Fiji’s position, and Fiji’s position is best known in Foreign Affairs. You can be interviewed 
<br/>on what is Fiji’s position and that is why it is advisable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is regionalism into multilateralism, and multilateralism has so many arms. One is the 
<br/>IPU,  and  we  are  chairing  SIDS.  We  want  to  bring  up  SIDS  as  a  recognised  body  within  IPU. 
<br/>Seychelles  initiated back to  our special circumstances and needs, back to  Bermuda. If we always 
<br/>anchor on this, this is all connected to our National Development Plan, our Foreign Policy White 
<br/>Paper, now we have a bus, our position on the Paris Agreement and, of course, the other issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we need both, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but we need work together so that the message from 
<br/>our  bus  is  consistent  with  the  UN  Summit.  The  UN  Summit  for  the  future  was  headed  by  His 
<br/>Excellency last week and we participated. So, the messaging from this is what we will need to take 
<br/>to IPU, I have some documents for you, Sir, for our meeting next week, so that consistency is there. 
<br/>But we just need to work together on Fiji’s position.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Member. The honourable Prime Minister has led 
<br/>the way. Now, he is kind of withdrawing himself from the COP Meetings because he feels that the 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and other Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers 
<br/>should be part of that delegation where we go in and bid as a Government.  As a Government, we, in 
<br/></span><span>attending  IPU,  will  only  have  to  be  riding  on  whatever  policies  you  put  in  place  but  that  is  the 
<br/></span><span>confusion that it creates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>2074 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The confusion that it creates, I would like to share this, in the Pacific we have 13 countries 
<br/>and out of these 13, some are tied to another regional group which has Indonesia as a member and 
<br/>even Australia. The  rest  of us in  the Pacific,  we  are kind  of lost  here but even though  that SIDS 
<br/>meeting that you attended, honourable Minister, I find that there is a connection there, because then 
<br/>you have PIF and then it comes down. So whatever policies that are being raised by the Government 
<br/>to PIF and to the UN, that is the channel it goes through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But here, when you are talking about the same thing, I am probably at a loss! I am sitting here 
<br/>in the meeting, and I think I have heard this already from the Government. Then all of a sudden you 
<br/>are sitting there, and Fiji is being pushed around. We made an attempt to ensure that we are properly 
<br/>advised from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before we attend our meeting. We would like to see 
<br/>what is the position that we are going to take when going to IPU. Because over there it is a different 
<br/>story altogether, you have 180 countries in the IPU and UN is only 190 something.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of membership, IPU is a fully fledged organisation, but in terms of financing that 
<br/>you just discussed in Antigua, Sir, that is interesting! Because that is lacking here, yet we are part of 
<br/>the  Government.  So  which  one  do  we  take?  Now  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is 
<br/>suggesting both to continue, but I think we should make a fair decision here because IPU is for us, 
<br/></span><span>Parliamentarians. That is the body that is settled there for us and at the same time it is the UN as well 
<br/></span><span>for which we are a member of.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And the different bodies, different organisations that exist. For someone new like me coming 
<br/>in, I find it confusing, because Indonesia is there, and we have to sort things out with this West Papua. 
<br/>But by going to Indonesia, I have recently found out that they have done a lot, even West Papua and 
<br/>Papua New Guinea have close collaborations with them as well, and that is interesting. So, that is all 
<br/>I am asking honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would just like to share that there were indeed 
<br/>some learnings that we had during that SIDS Conference, and as the Leader of the Opposition has 
<br/>shared, the general positions of the nation should be made very well clear before we leave. And the 
<br/>coordinating function of the line ministry should be very well established and should be supported. 
<br/>That is something that we should continue to work on, to strengthen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the general consensus here, both to continue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- But we talk some more. We are using Foreign Affairs before we attend, but 
<br/>at the same time at least we hear from them. So, there will be two going to SIDS. Thank you, that is 
<br/>a bit clearer now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- May I respond to the Ministerial Statement Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I have shared a part of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will recommend and continue with the debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Probably just to add light to this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Maybe I will 
<br/></span><span>start with the UN Summit of the Future. His Excellency the Head of the delegation and we welcome 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Assistant Minister from the Prime Minister’s office back. He just landed this morning.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>2075 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is important, and the takeaway from here is, moving forward. So, strategically when we had 
<br/>the briefing with honourable Naivalurua at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, we strategically asked 
<br/>for sessions where we can bring back issues that will help us in terms of moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first meeting that I attended, and as far as the subject matter is concerned is, the Alliance 
<br/>of Small Island States (AOSIS). The good thing is I will not repeat what the buzz is all about, but 
<br/>this is something that we will take in your IPU meeting. Of course, one interesting thing out of the 
<br/>AOSIS meeting is the Declaration Statehood and Sea-Level Rise. We can access this information, 
<br/>because we have a very strong positions on this, but perhaps with Fiji, honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>for Foreign Affairs and honourable Assistant Minister for the Office of the Prime Minister, we have 
<br/>agreed to Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) in September last year. The expectation 
<br/>from our prune office is for it to be ratified, but it has taken one year now for us to ratify the BBNJ. 
<br/>If Government can take that seriously, because everything about oceans, we the Pacific SIDS, must 
<br/>always champion it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We were the authors of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), and 
<br/>we  hosted  the  First  World  Oceans  Conference,  again  on  biodiversity,  and  this  is  why  it  is  so 
<br/>important, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The plea from our permanent representative in the UN, if we ratify, if 
<br/></span><span>we can work on the instruments and there is a World Oceans Conference in Nice in France next year.  
<br/></span><span>If we can ratify the BBNJ before that meeting, because it is important, it is strategic for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  the  key  takeaway,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  your  information.  The  Climate  Vulnerability 
<br/>Forum, that used to be chaired by Ghana, now it has been handed over to Barbados. It works well for 
<br/>us, and I would also plead with the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Prime Minister of Barbados is the voice now of SIDS, Mia Mottley. She 
<br/>is from the Caribbean. But we need a Mia Mottley from the Pacific on our issues. That is why COP29 
<br/>is very important because it is a finance COP they call it, because everyone is demanding now for a 
<br/>restructure of the Global Climate Finance Framework. I attended one with the Permanent Secretary 
<br/>for Environment and it was very interesting, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji, to our surprise, some of our best practices were highlighted in that, on the innovative 
<br/>ways, rather than waiting for the Global Climate Fund and the Adaptation Fund. Some innovative 
<br/>ways in which we can just finance our own adaptation and mitigation to support our climate change 
<br/>initiatives. The Permanent Secretary for Environment has got that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but I think what 
<br/>is of interest to your office is the handing over from Ghana now to Barbados. We have been trying 
<br/>Barbados in the IPU, they were missing from our previous two meetings. Now that they are chair of 
<br/>the Climate Vulnerability Forum, we have to get them this time, because this is all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the most important messages for us is consistency in our messaging and the 
<br/>other one is application. We have committed the best, and the next thing now is for us to apply and 
<br/>put  into  action  a  buzz  UNFCCC,  Sendai  Framework  and  so  forth.  This  is  where  our  National 
<br/>Development Plan all connects. Perhaps the last thing that I want to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is, I think 
<br/>the  key  takeaway  that  I  took  away  as  well  was  data,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  terms  of 
<br/>application. They are saying on AI, a predicted future is a future that we built, and we can only build 
<br/>that predicted future with data, and monitoring and evaluation is important. We have learnt a lot, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and we will sit with the Government side to share this so that we can move the country 
<br/>forward. Thank you.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for his update on the meeting in May that he attended. Much has been said about this report. 
<br/>I think it is all good. It is aligned to Fiji's ambitions. It is aligned to our 2050 strategy moving forward. 
<br/>It is aligned to the intent of Government and likewise this side for a better future for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Membership of all these multilateral or bilateral organisations is a must for a Small Island 
<br/>State like Fiji. I support what the honourable Leader of the Opposition has said on his observation 
<br/>and the way forward and what must be done, and likewise what you have also stated, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have four points here that I just wanted to raise to support the report and aligned to Fijis 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ambition forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I believe in catapulting Fiji forward as not only a Small Island State but a nation state that 
<br/>has proven in its most difficult situation, it has been able to survive and prove to the world 
<br/>that we are a nation that could be used as a good model for the other island states. It calls 
<br/>for a closer collaboration, Sir and a very strong ambition that must be maintained wherever 
<br/>we are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We must have very strong and very clear plans, and this is what they will ask us. We can 
<br/>make as much noise if we want to. We can talk as much as we want to. The honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition is aware of his experience with the Chinese. We can talk so much, 
<br/>and they will simply ask, what are your plans? Where are your plans? And this is a very 
<br/>important point, and I am so happy that now we have the NDP and to hear that the key 
<br/>outcomes that the honourable Minister attended is really aligned to our NDP and that is a 
<br/>very good, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is really our ability to sniff where the opportunities are, and this comes about through good 
<br/>engagement, good network and building good relationships and that is very important. To 
<br/>do that, there is a call for closer coordination in our work here. Sometimes we go out in 
<br/>various  meetings.  We  really  do  not  know  what  the  left  and  the  right  is  doing.  So,  our 
<br/>discussions this morning, your guidance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is very important. So, the way 
<br/>forward  in  our  thinking  from  this  side,  I  think  the  way  forward  is  about  a  joint  effort 
<br/>representing both sides in whatever meeting it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Last and not least, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fourth point I wanted to add to our deliberations 
<br/>this  morning,  is  in  everything  or  whatever  meeting  we  attend  we  must  come  back  and 
<br/>deliver. There is evidence of the actions that we have, so that when we go back, we can tell 
<br/>them these are the evidence in what we have implemented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am calling for collaboration, strong ambition, good strong 
<br/>plans,  the  ability  to  sniff  out  opportunities  and  last  and  not  least  is  really  about  delivering  this 
<br/>evidence is in the actions we make.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Members and for that I am quite content 
<br/>now that the joint effort is to be led by the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development 
<br/>and Disaster Management and the honourable Minister for Foreign Affairs. So, then we will be able 
<br/>to be guided well, in this other arm of Government going separately to IPU. So, we deliver the same 
<br/>message, because the other Pacific countries are looking towards us as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonga of late, and Palau have been pushing, supported by Tahiti that we were to have another 
<br/></span><span>new way of organising ourselves in the region and I said, no, we have met and I was advised by the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Leader of Opposition with Mereseini Vuniwaqa the former Minister for Women, that it 
<br/>is best that we hold off for a while and just try and put off that supposed plan and have something 
<br/>organised in the meeting in Nadi. That was quickly sent across to the honourable Prime Minister in 
<br/>China which he endorsed and that is the meeting we are about to have. So, at least we will have the 
<br/>single communication meeting coming from one group rather than two.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  two  as  you  have  highlighted,  honourable  Members,  is  to  help  us  to  say  our  bit  in 
<br/>whatever  comes  our  way  in  terms  of  IPU  or  the  Government.  The  Government,  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  is  leading  that  area  in 
<br/>attending that and perhaps, if we may continue, we will get ourselves organised and I will be seeking 
<br/>the honourable Prime Ministers advice as well on this as to see how best we can go forward with us 
<br/>saying the same message all the time instead of two or three. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is all, Sir, and we will now adjourn for lunch since it is 12.30 p.m. We will resume when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.41 p.m.
