<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU. – Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I rise to leave on the Consolidated

<br/>2017 and 2018, on the 15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  through  its  mandatory  role  stipulated  under 
<br/>Standing  Orders  110,  undertook  a  site  visit  to  the  government  grants  project  administered  by  the 
<br/>Council  such  as  the  Tavualevu  Village  Public  Convenience  Project  and  the  Multipurpose  Sports 
<br/>Court Change Room.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council raised concerns on the challenges they have faced over the last few years. The 
<br/>Standing  Committee  noted  various  issues  raised  by  the  Council  and  suggested  possible 
<br/>recommendations as well. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee noted the importance of small 
<br/>municipalities like Tavua in engaging with stakeholders to expedite various planned projects that will 
<br/>be undertaken by the Council to enable them to provide a better service to its people. The Standing 
<br/>Committee  commends  the  Council  for  having  a  good  rate  collection  compared  to  other  Councils 
<br/>around Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  Standing  Committee’s  deliberations,  the  following

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council  
<br/>2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2111 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the list that I have with me supplied by the honourable Whips, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; and 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable A.N. Tuicolo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity 
<br/>to  contribute  to  this  important  debate  regarding  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  Tavua  Town 
<br/>Council Annual Report for the year 2016 -2018, which was tabled by the Chairperson of the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Social Affairs on 5</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2024. This Report is crucial as it sheds light on the 
<br/>operations  and  challenges  faced  by  the  Tavua  Town  Council  during  the  specified  years  and  it 
<br/>provides us with a road map for improvement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we dwell into the findings of the Standing Committee, it is essential to 
<br/>note  the  weaknesses  identified  within  the  Tavua  Town  Council's  operations.  The  Standing 
<br/>Committee's review highlighted several eight years that require immediate attention and rectification. 
<br/>One of the primary concerns was the lack of transparency and accountability in financial reporting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee noted that the Council's engagement 
<br/>with the community was insufficient. There were limited opportunities for residents to voice their 
<br/>concerns or participate in decision making processes. This disconnect between the Council and the 
<br/>community is detrimental to fostering a collaborative environment where citizens feel valued and 
<br/>heard.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  response  to  these  weaknesses,  the  Standing  Committee  proposed 
<br/>several  solutions  aimed  at  enhancing  the  Council's  operations.  Firstly,  it  recommended  the 
<br/>implementation or robust financial management system that ensures transparency and accountability 
<br/>in all financial dealings. This system should include regular audits and public disclosures of financial 
<br/>reports to keep the community informed and engaged by recommending these measures, the Tavua 
<br/>Town Council can rebuild trust with its constituents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  emphasised  the  importance  of 
<br/>community  engagement.  It  suggested  that  the  Council  establish  regular  forums  and  outreach 
<br/>programmes to facilitate dialogue between council members and residents. These initiatives would 
<br/>not only empower citizens but also provide the Council with valuable insights into the needs and 
<br/></span><span>priorities of the community. By fostering a culture of inclusivity, Tavua Town Council can enhance 
<br/></span><span>its decision-making process and ensure that they align with the aspirations of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speakers,  Sir,  one  of  the  major  challenge  for  the  Council  and  the  people  of  Tavua  is 
<br/>flooding. We all know about the situation, and it was also mentioned by the Special Administrator 
<br/>during the presentation, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As far  as dredging  is  concerned, it is  a concern. It  has been raised on so  many 
<br/>occasions, almost in every meeting with the ministries. We are raising this issue for the 
<br/>dredging of Nasivi River. This is a matter of urgency. Although the whole of Tavua Town 
<br/>is not flooded, but the entrance after the bridge and before the bridge - the whole area 
<br/>gets flooded. The whole of Yaladro, Nabuna gets flooded, and before Shop N Save right 
<br/>up  to  the  bus  stand,  the  road  is  blocked.  Villages  that  also  get  flooded  are  Nabuna, 
<br/>Tavualevu, Vanuakula and Rukuruku. We have always been raising this issue, but the 
<br/></span><span>promises were made and so far nothing has eventuated.” 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council  
<br/>2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the honourable Minister for Local Government with the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  will  address  on  the  challenges  faced  by  Tavua  Town 
<br/>Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee highlighted the need for capacity building within 
<br/>the Council. With recommended training programmes for Council’s staff to improve their skills in 
<br/>areas such as project management, financial planning and community engagement. By investing in 
<br/>the  professional  development  of  its  workforce,  the  Tavua  Town  Council  can  enhance  its  overall 
<br/>effectiveness and better serve the needs of its constituents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Consolidated Review Report of Tavua Town Council Annual Reports 
<br/>for  the  year  2016  to  2018,  serves  as  a  critical  tool  for  identifying  weaknesses  and  proposing 
<br/>actionable solutions. It is imperative that we as Members of Parliament support the recommendations 
<br/>put  forward  by  the  Standing  Committee  to  ensure  that  the  Tavua  Town  Council  operates  with 
<br/>transparency, engages meaningfully with the community and builds the capacity of  its staff. With 
<br/>those words Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion for debate that 
<br/></span><span>is  before  the  Parliament.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  acknowledges  the 
<br/>recommendations of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, we respect the reviews of the 2016 
<br/>to 2018 Annual Report for Tavua Town Council, and I wish to thank the Standing Committee for the 
<br/>review they have carried out as well as very useful and practical recommendations they have included 
<br/>in their report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is one of the smallest towns in Fiji, with only 311 rate payers 
<br/>and  a  revenue  of  around  $400,000  annually.  Despite  its  size,  Tavua  Council  has  demonstrated 
<br/>remarkable efficiency in revenue collection, achieving 77 percent of current rates in the last financial 
<br/>year and collecting of arrears stood at 11 percent. Total outstanding amount for rates was only around 
<br/>$51,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am proud to note that Tavua is ranked one of the top five Councils in terms 
<br/>of  current  rate  collections  from  all  the  municipalities  in  our  country.  Furthermore,  special 
<br/>administrators  of  Tavua  are  committed  to  completing  all  pending  financial  reports  by  November 
<br/>2024, ensuring timely submissions to the Officer of the Auditor General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The financial reports for 2019, 2020 and 2021 are already with the Auditor General’s Office 
<br/></span><span>for review. This demonstrates that even our small Councils are setting a benchmark for accountability 
<br/>and transparency in local government leading by example, managing their finances and upholding 
<br/>public trust. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the new appointed special administrators, also very ambitious in developing 
<br/>business  ideas  for new revenue streams.  The Council is  working  on a concepts  to  develop  a new 
<br/>market, bus stand as well as a car park. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to quickly respond to the six recommendations that were provided by 
<br/>the Standing Committee. One is on the Council to seek assistance from the Ministry of Environment 
<br/>regarding the carrying out of environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports for the new proposed 
<br/>dumpsite. I think I have also shared in one of my presentations this afternoon, currently, the Coalition 
<br/>Government is working on the review of the Waste Management System around the country and one 
<br/></span><span>of the projects that we have now is the proposed Western Landfill in the Western Division. Hopefully, 
<br/></span><span>once that is completed, we will be able to rope in Councils from Tavua right down to Sigatoka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council  
<br/>2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next is on the MOU in place between Tavualevu Village and Tavua Town Council regarding 
<br/>the public conveniences. Mr. Speaker, Sir, Ministry of Local Government is consistently encouraging 
<br/>our municipal councils to  maintain public convenience to  high  standards. It  is  something that we 
<br/>have been insisting with all the Councils, we must make sure that all the public conveniences are 
<br/>properly upgraded for better use by the public. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, financial sustainability is the key. While Tavualevu Village 
<br/>has taken the initiative to set up these facilities, the Town Council’s first challenge is maintaining 
<br/>them without a sustainable revenue stream. The Council nevertheless, will work on options that are 
<br/>suitable for both the Council and the Tavualevu Village. We compare the needs of the village and 
<br/>users of the public convenience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the construction of a new market site as well as provision for a car park and bus stand. 
<br/>That is something that the new administrators are working on right now. They have been talking to 
<br/>the landowners on one of the new sites that they have identified, and one of the challenges right now 
<br/>for  Tavua  Town  is,  they  do  not  have  a  bus  station.  The  bus  just  stops  and  parks  along  the  main 
<br/>highway and this is one of the reasons why we have a lot of traffic issues along the main street of 
<br/></span><span>Tavua Town. This is something that the Council as well as the newly appointed administrators are 
<br/></span><span>seriously looking at right now, reviewing it to ensure they find a place where they can also relocate 
<br/>the market. At the same time too, have a bus stand and also maybe create more parking spaces around 
<br/>Tavua Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very important issue is the flooding issue in Tavua Town, which is normally brought about 
<br/>by  the  overflow  of  the  Nasivi  River.  Something  that  we  have  also  been  liaising  closely  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways to find out a long term solution for it. As it is for the past so many years, this 
<br/>place  has  been  flooded,  especially  with  what  I  was  told,  with  the  construction  of  the  new  bridge 
<br/>which has really deteriorated due the flooding issue in Tavua Town. It is something that the Council 
<br/>has to seriously consider now, to come up with a long term solution that is in collaboration with the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Waterways.  The  dredging  of  Nasivi  River  and  other  models  or  options  that  will  be 
<br/>assisting and also resolve this long-standing issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the issues raised is, the Ministry of Local Government to assist with the funding of 
<br/>installation  of  solar  floodlights  at  the  Multipurpose  Court.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it is  one  of  the  very 
<br/>important aspect of town and city management in all the municipalities in Fiji, where the lighting in 
<br/>public spaces, it is really important to ensure public safety when communities or the public come and 
<br/></span><span>use these spaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, with the support from the Government of the People's Republic of China has 
<br/>provided 16 solar lights to the Tavua Town Council. This is from the 200 solar lights donated by the 
<br/>Guangdong province, and these lights are installed in the market, children's park, bus stand and the 
<br/>rear lane which is Mobil Service Station, and ANZ to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council also requested for some more additional solar lights, and we are also thankful to 
<br/>the Embassy for giving us some more solar lights and we are hopeful that we will allocate some of 
<br/>the solar lights to Tavua Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very important issue is one of the last recommendations, the improvement of the town rate 
<br/>collection. I think I have also alluded earlier Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tavua Town is one of the best in terms 
<br/>of the collection of rates. Currently they have collected about 77 percent of the town rates, and it 
<br/></span><span>speaks volumes of the effort, as well as the strategies that are put in place by the management as well 
<br/></span><span>as the newly appointed administrators in managing the rate collection in Tavua Town. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Tavua Town Council  
<br/>2016-2018 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also  assisted the Council to  explore some of the  rate collection strategies to 
<br/>assist the Councils in the collection of their rates. Like those that are working to actually pay directly 
<br/>from  their  wages  and  salaries,  and  also  exploring  better  options  like  paying  from  other  payment 
<br/>modes, like M-PAiSA and other online payment platforms. The Ministry will continue to support 
<br/>Tavua  Town  Council  and  its  executives,  ensuring  that  whatever  challenges  that  they  have,  the 
<br/>Ministry is there to support these smaller town councils.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion 
<br/>moved by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, honourable Iliesa Vanawalu, 
<br/>on the Consolidated Review Report of Tavua Town Council Annual Reports for the Years 2016 to 
<br/>2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I go any further, I take this opportunity to thank the Chairperson and the Members of 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the work they do in scrutinising the Annual Reports of 
<br/>the years in review and compiling the Consolidated Review Report which highlighted the Standing 
<br/>Committee’s findings and recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  speak  on  Recommendation  4.4.  I  noted  that,  in 
<br/></span><span>Recommendation 4.4, the Standing Committee recommends, that the Government to provide funding 
<br/>to the Ministry of Waterways for regular dredging of Nasivi River and to reinstate the annual grant 
<br/>for  regular  maintenance  of  the  storm  or  V  drains  within  the  municipalities.  According  to  a  press 
<br/>release by the Ministry of Waterways in June 2020, the desilting works of six kilometres of the Nasivi 
<br/>River was completed by the Ministry in 2020. The issue of constantly losing crops, livestock, and 
<br/>infrastructure due to flooding for communities living along the Nasivi River, has been addressed by 
<br/>this project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I understand that this is an expensive exercise for the Government, however, 
<br/>the recommendation by the Standing Committee, in the dredging and desilting works, will not only 
<br/>address flooding for the communities in Tavua, but will also boost the business activities in Tavua 
<br/>Town and will further support farmers along the Nasivi River to venture into commercial farming. 
<br/>The  change  in  weather  is  beyond  our  control,  therefore,  the  Tavua  Town  Council  and  nearby 
<br/>communities  must  also  consider  other  alternative  measures  to  address  this  issue,  like  controlling 
<br/>upstream activities, such as clear-cut logging, poor agriculture practices and other developments that 
<br/>would hinder the water flow of the river by reducing its discharge capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again commend the Tavua Town Council with the work that they do 
<br/></span><span>in providing services and resources that enhances the quality of life of the Tavua community, and I 
<br/>request  that  the  Municipal  Council  considers  all  recommendations  put  forward  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee.  I support the motion before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there is a lot that has been discussed 
<br/>in  this  august Parliament on recommendation from  the honourable Members and the onus on the 
<br/>Ministry  for  Local  Government  for  the  implementation  of  the  recommendations  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee. On that note, in the review of the Report, the Standing Committee highlighted the various 
<br/>areas that need to be strengthened by the Council and the relevant recommendation formulated for a 
<br/>solution. Once again the Standing Committee would like to thank the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
