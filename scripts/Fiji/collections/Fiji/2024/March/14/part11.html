<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  There is a Point of Order being raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order 74(1)(a) and Standing 
<br/>Order  80,  I  wish  to  raise  a  Point  of  Order  against  honourable  Ketan  Lal.  Despite  my  personal 
<br/>explanation here on a question that he raised, he continued to…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can I have a look first, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  Yes, you may continue, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  despite  my  full 
<br/>explanation here in answering his question, continued to post on </span><span>Facebook</span><span> the issue that had already 
<br/>been addressed in Parliament and I would ask him to refrain or to pull it down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, whatever you say in Parliament can be addressed 
<br/>under Standing Orders, but if you go to the social media, that is beyond my reach.  But I certainly 
<br/></span><span>would like to ask honourable Ketan Lal, for the sake of ensuring that we maintain the dignity of the 
<br/></span><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Ketan Lal, I am talking, for the sake of preserving the dignity of Parliament, I 
<br/>ask that in your own good time, please, ensure that whatever is being stated in the social media should 
<br/>not paint that picture of you continuing your diatribe outside of Parliament when full explanations 
<br/>have been given. I am not here to defend the honourable Minister, but his dad, he has also served his 
<br/>time well for Fiji in undertaking duties bestowed to him by the honourable Prime Minister now, and 
<br/>we even served time together.  So, that is just one of the things that affects us one way or another 
<br/></span><span>since we come from the islands.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  sons  have  represented  the  country  and  I  was  his  running  mate  in  the  1999  General 
<br/>Elections.    That,  in  a  nutshell,  is  just  a  short  explanation  of  this  late  great  parliamentarian  and 
<br/>gentleman. He is a huge man, honourable Member, you can see it by the built of his sons; not this 
<br/>one here.  This one grew up in the Raiwai and Raiwaqa area, but his other sons are huge people and 
<br/>they played for the national team as well.  I hope you will take that into account, honourable Ketal

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lal, without depriving you of your right to the social media, et cetera.  I think we shall leave it at 
<br/>that, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.
