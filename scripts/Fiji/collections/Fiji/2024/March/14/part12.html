<div><span>[Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; I rise to respond to His Excellency the President’s most Gracious 
<br/>Speech, delivered in this Parliament to mark the opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As His Excellency the President has always done in every occasion, I was elated to 
<br/>hear His Excellency begin his speech by respectfully greeting all in Parliament with our 
<br/>traditional clansmen salutation – </span><span>Miau Sa Bula Re</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I felt proud, not only as a fellow kinsfolk of the Paramount Chief of Macuata, but it 
<br/></span><span>augured with the most recent commemoration of International Mother Language Day on 
<br/>21</span><span>st</span><span>  February,  2024  by  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts  and 
<br/>stakeholder institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The celebration drives home the importance of our mother languages, our </span><span>vosa ni

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>229 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the same light, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts will 
<br/>soon  submit  to  Cabinet  Fiji’s  National  Action  Plan  (NAP)  for  International  Decade  for 
<br/>Indigenous Language (IDIL) 2022-2032.  The United Nations proclaimed decade aims to 
<br/>draw global attention on the critical situation of many indigenous languages and to mobilise 
<br/>stakeholders and resources for their preservation, revitaliation and promotion (quoted from 
<br/>United Nations Resolution). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, using the ‘Three Legged Stool’ concept championed by our late 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statesman, Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, the Fiji NSAP for IDIL focuses on the three themes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Living our indigenous languages; 
<br/>Stopping the loss of our indigenous languages; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Growing our indigenous languages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Action Plan will only be realised with the concerted effort and commitment 
<br/>by all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  adoption  of  Fiji’s  first  ever  National  Cultural  Policy  is  a 
<br/>milestone achievement.  As His Excellency had alluded to in his Speech, the voices of our 
<br/>people are foremost, with an inclusive approach to sustainable development critical for our 
<br/>continued progress and prosperity as a nation.  These are all enshrined in the new National 
<br/>Cultural Policy for Fiji which the Ministry is working on its implementation in the coming 
<br/>months and years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  we  support  the  direction  with  which  our  Ministry  of  Finance, 
<br/>National  Planning,  Strategic  Development  &amp;  Statistics  has  taken  to  formulate  our  New 
<br/>National  Development  Plan.  Reflecting  culture  and  heritage  as  a  vector  for  social  and 
<br/>economic  growth  in  the  National  Development  Plan  will  contribute  enormously  to  the 
<br/>wellbeing  of  all  our  citizens.  Through  the  plan,  an  enabling  environment  for  cultural 
<br/>industry actors will be created, helping our people to gain a steady income and sustain their 
<br/>families’ livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Robust  and  resilient  infrastructure,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  essential  for  Fiji’s  culture 
<br/>sector to thrive. The Coalition Government has designated the Old Grammar Boys School, 
<br/>commonly known as St. Stephen’s building, as the new “home” for our artists and artisans 
<br/>– Fiji’s first National  Arts  Centre. A space  embraced by all practitioners because of its 
<br/></span><span>heritage  nature,  work  is  ongoing  to  ensure  that  the  building  is  artistically  relevant  and 
<br/></span><span>conducive to future users.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Spearheaded by the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and 
<br/>Arts,  an  internal  review  team  will  soon  submit  their  report  which  will  explore  options 
<br/>regarding the upgrade and/or restoration of Levuka world heritage structures to its former 
<br/>glory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capital works on the Levuka Community Centre is almost completed, exemplary of 
<br/></span><span>the continued commitment by the Coalition Government to show tangible improvements 
<br/></span><span>to heritage infrastructure in the historical port town. Similarly, the Fiji Museum, as one of 
<br/>the oldest cultural  institutions in  the Pacific, is  undergoing refurbishment to  ensure that 
<br/>visitors (both local and overseas alike) are exposed to an array of heirloom that narrates 
<br/>Fiji’s rich historical stories.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  link  between  culture,  heritage,  the  arts  and  tourism  is  not 
<br/>surprising.  His  Excellency,  rightfully,  dwelled  on  tourism  being  a  key  driver  of  our 
<br/>economy and the forecasting of a National Sustainable Tourism Framework (NSTF) for 
<br/>Fiji to cater for the increasing demand of global travellers. I am pleased to announce that 
<br/>the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts was inspired by this undertaking 
<br/>and will soon finalise a Fiji Indigenous Tourism Framework, boasting the richness of our 
<br/>cultural heritage resources.  The NSTF includes the latter as foremost to creating a holistic 
<br/>holiday experience for our tourists visiting our shores. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aligned to  the notion of cultural  promotion and fostering cultural  diplomacy, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker Sir, the Ministry is preparing a Fiji delegation to represent our island nation at the 
<br/>13</span><span>th</span><span> Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture (FESTPAC) to be held in Hawaii from 6</span><span>th</span><span> to 16</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June,  2024.  The  FESTPAC  has  been  an  important  avenue  for  the  transmission  and 
<br/>revitalization of Pacific arts and cultures. It provides a space for cultural sharing, learning 
<br/>and storytelling of our rich history and offering traditional knowledge and wisdom as local 
<br/>solution  to  global  challenges.  The  FESTPAC  symbolizes  resilience  and  unity  and  our 
<br/>participation  in  Hawaii,  including  that  of  other  Pacific  Island  countries,  carries  even  a 
<br/>deeper significance as it aims to uplift local communities that were devastated by the recent 
<br/>wildfires in Maui. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our bearers and keepers of culture and heritage are exposed on a 
<br/>regular  basis  to  increasing  exploitation  and  inappropriate  commercialization  of  their 
<br/>traditional knowledge and expressions of culture. The Bill on Traditional Knowledge and 
<br/>Expressions of Culture, as His Excellency has alluded to, is a legal mechanism that will 
<br/>ensure protection of traditional knowledge and expression of culture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister, during World Indigenous Day 2023, launched the 
<br/>Ministry’s  traditional  knowledge  and  expression  of  culture  database  that  will  host 
<br/>traditional knowledge and expression of culture information that was collected by  Field 
<br/>Officers  in  the  last  decade  from  the  1,173  villages  in  Fiji’s  14  Provinces.  Through  this 
<br/>exercise, there is hope that knowledge and expressions that may be difficult to transmit 
<br/>now will be able to sustain itself after all, through a registration and cultural authority to 
<br/>be established as a result.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our internal commitments are equally important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the context of 
<br/>sharing  best  practices  and  as  recipients  of  assistance  rendered.  Fiji  had  ratified  two 
<br/></span><span>UNESCO Conventions for the safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage . In December 
<br/></span><span>2024,  Fiji  will  need  to  submit  its  periodical  report  to  the  UNESCO  Intergovernmental 
<br/>Committee on Intangible Cultural Heritage, capturing all activities it has pursued in the last 
<br/>six years at the national level relating to intangible cultural heritage safeguarding. In the 
<br/>next few months, the Ministry will implement data comprehensive information from all 
<br/>sectors of our economy and is collated to fulfil this mandatory international requirement 
<br/>for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last but not the least, contrary to past beliefs, culture is no longer 
<br/></span><span>seen as a barrier to development. It plays a central and integrated role as a vehicle for social 
<br/></span><span>development, social cohesion and stability, economic development, environment stability 
<br/>and in developing resilient communities. We should no longer work in silos but collectively 
<br/>work for the betterment of all Fijians, especially the indigenous people of these land. The 
<br/>culture  sector  also  has  a  lot  to  offer,  and  the  many  opportunities  waiting  to  unfold  are 
<br/>impetus for growth for the present and future generations.]

<br/>acknowledge all health officials all over the country who are serving our people diligently. </span><span>Ni sa bula 
<br/>vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion moved by the honourable Prime Minister in 
<br/>response to the Speech offered by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji on Monday, 
<br/>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024, while Opening the Second Term of Parliament.  The Address by His Excellency the 
<br/>President plays a pivotal role in shaping the tone for the Coalition Government to deliver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are various important calls by His Excellency for the Government to take heed of with 
<br/>regards to its policy formulation, aiming to advance the nation where our people may live in security, 
<br/>stability and prosperity. The call, I believe, is also for the honourable Prime Minister, as Leader of 
<br/>the Coalition Government, that he must deliver in an honest, resilient and transparent manner that 
<br/>would actively reduce the many emerging socio-economic challenges faced by our people today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President’s  Address  encouraged  us,  as  democratically  elected 
<br/>representatives, to listen to the voice of the people, not only to those who have elected us, but all 
<br/>citizens,  young  and  old,  men  and  women.  He  urged  us  all  to  faithfully  embrace  with  resolve  the 
<br/>principle of democracy and humanity as enshrined in our Constitution. By doing so, we respect the 
<br/>integrity and the dignity of our Parliament and honour all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his Address, His Excellency also reminded us to continue to promote harmony and embrace 
<br/>diversity in our nation.  As leaders, we are to leave aside our differences for the common good of our 
<br/>people and to focus on our communality rather than our tiny differences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency’s most Gracious Speech is, indeed, gracious because he is 
<br/>speaking his heart out to both sides of this august Parliament, for the common good of everyone that 
<br/>call Fiji our home.  It is, indeed, time that we put our Parliament in order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am reminded of a </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse in Psalm 133:1, and I quote: “How good and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pleasant it is, when God’s people live together in unity”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I proceed further, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I want  to  sincerely  thank Dr. James Fong, the 
<br/></span><span>former  Permanent  Secretary  for  Health  and  Medical  Services,  for  the  leadership  he  provided, 
<br/></span><span>especially  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  that  caused  severe  social  and  economic  disruptions 
<br/>around the world.  I wish Dr. Fong and his family well in his retirement.  I also want to put on record 
<br/>in  congratulating,  Dr.  Jemesa  Tudravu,  on  his  new  appointment  as  the  new  incumbent  for  the 
<br/>important position of Permanent Secretary for Health and Medical Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, poverty is on the rise and the truth is, no government can eradicate poverty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completely, not even the Coalition Government.  Yet, we cannot ignore it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to also share another </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse to put my response into 
<br/></span><span>perspective, a verse from the Old Testament, Ecclesiastes 10:19: “A feast is made for laughter, wine 
<br/>makes life merry, and money is the answer for everything.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to bring laughter and happiness to this nation, money is needed.  It is the 
<br/>responsibility of the Coalition Government to find that money.  It is the responsibility of the Coalition 
<br/>Government to:

<div><span>create that environment for investor confidence to invest in Fiji;  
<br/>provide security for all Fijians, our friends and tourists that visit our shores;   
<br/>provide stimulus and support for continuous expansion in private sector growth;   
<br/>improve access to safe drinking water for all Fijians;   
<br/>provide proper sanitation for our people;   
<br/>develop and implement good education policies; and 
<br/>ensure that our people have access to quality healthcare;   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In achieving all of the above, money is needed, and the people of Fiji is looking to the Coalition 
<br/>Government to deliver.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We understand that times are hard on ordinary  Fijians because of the imposed 15 percent 
<br/>VAT.  During our community visits, many families are expressing the same sentiments, and I quote, 
<br/>“life is really, really tough for us, we deeply regret the change of Government”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people continue to suffer in silence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we do not see any positive 
<br/>changes coming soon to give them a much-needed relief.  Recently, some single moms and widows 
<br/>remained unable to access social welfare funds and family assistance recently. Some just gave up in 
<br/>pursuing their application due to the unprofessionalism and bad attitude of staff in the Ministry of 
<br/>Women, Children and Social Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In His Excellency the President’s Address, he pointed out the challenges posed by the burden 
<br/>of  Communicable  and  Non-Communicable  Diseases  (NCDs),  together  with  HIV/AIDS,  which 
<br/>impose a substantial burden on our population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diabetes is one of the leading causes of deaths in Fiji.  This disease does not discriminate.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it affects people from all cultures and backgrounds, male or female, young or old, 
<br/>rich or poor.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), worldwide, one person will die 
<br/>from diabetes in every eight seconds.  In Fiji, currently almost one in every three Fijians is being 
<br/>diagnosed with diabetes, which is about 30 percent of our population, and this number will continue 
<br/>to rise in the next to five to ten years if this crisis continues to be ignored. It is estimated that there is 
<br/>one lower limb  amputation in  every 12  hours</span><span>,</span><span> which means two per day, and approximately 730 
<br/>lower limb amputations annually in Fiji. According to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services’ 
<br/>published NCD latest statistics from 2020, we lost an estimated 5,700 Fijians due to NCD-related 
<br/>causes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  lives  were  ended  too  early  too  soon  by  quiet  killers  like  diabetes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stroke, heart disease, et cetera. Think of the children and partners left behind!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The burden of NCD both, with respect to the risk of premature death and costs to healthcare 
<br/>is alarming. We need an effective whole of society response to deal with it. Government needs to 
<br/>look at fighting NCD in a holistic manner, not just focusing on the Ministry of Health but linking up 
<br/>with the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, Ministry of Education and, in fact, the whole of 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These diseases settle through unhealthy habits which will develop over an extended period of 
<br/>time due primarily to the overconsumption of sugar, salt, oil and highly processed foods and a chronic 
<br/>lack of physical activity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The selling of junk food in our school canteens and carts that are parked outside many school 
<br/>premises can no longer be ignored.  School committees and kiosk vendors are making profits at the 
<br/>cost of destroying the health of our children, and we need to act now.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>233 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  was  glad  to  see  some  coverage  this  week  on  the  mainstream  media  of  that  staggering 
<br/>statistics on NCD and HIV. We must keep talking about these diseases and the burden they place on 
<br/>our society, our economy, and what we can do together to address them. This is a societal problem 
<br/>that affects every community in Fiji and saving lives depends on the actions from all of us, as alluded 
<br/>to by His Excellency the President’s Address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, healthy food choices now come at a substantial cost, and poor government 
<br/>policies triggers the prevalence of NCDs. In 2019, Fiji’s National Debt before COVID-19 stood at 
<br/>$5.7 billion.  It rose to $9.1 billion at the beginning of 2023 because of the COVID-19 pandemic 
<br/>mitigation and recovery packages provided to our fellow Fijians by the previous Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our main GDP contributor, tourism, was unable to generate any revenue during that time due 
<br/>to the grounding of all international flights. The FijiFirst Government injected money into affected 
<br/>Fijians as stimulus, so our people can survive.  All countries around the world suffered the same fate 
<br/>during COVID-19, however, Fiji made impressive strides in its economic growth in 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  secures  a  spot  among  the  top  five  fastest  growing  economies  globally.  Instead  of 
<br/>complaining and wasting taxpayers’ money in  witch-hunting and setting  up various tribunals  and 
<br/>sub-committees, the Coalition Government only needs to build on the successes of FijiFirst.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  forward,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  effort  to  step  out  of  poverty,  the  previous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administration was focusing on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Pursing Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG3) with is universal health coverage. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Managing  the  social  determinants  of  health,  like  building  new  roads,  jetties,  improved 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>connectivity, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Reduce the out-of-pocket expenses for healthcare. 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>At the same time, reduce the time needed to access a health facility when someone has an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>emergency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  please,  allow  me  to  share  some  of  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services’ policies that were under the previous Government which supported and mitigated the work 
<br/>against poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Government Free Medicine Scheme where eligible Fijians are able to access this service 
<br/>efficiently without much hassle.  Now, this system is becoming slow and confusing, and 
<br/></span><span>there is a greater need for registration and public awareness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, FijiFirst introduced a subsidised haemodialysis cost for eligible Fijians who are 
<br/>treated within the hospitals at CWM, Labasa, Lautoka and at the National Dialysis Centre 
<br/>that is receiving chronic cases in Nadera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst  recognised  the  need  for  affordable  and  equitable  access  to  dialysis  treatment  and 
<br/>commenced a Dialysis Subsidy Programme.  All patients requiring long term dialysis treatment with 
<br/>household income of less than $30,000 per annum are eligible for the reduced fee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.    Speaker  Sir,  this  is  not  a  one-time  visit  treatment  but  a  long-term  routine  treatment, 
<br/>requiring multiple visits.  If stopped, the patient will die.  We are receiving calls that many are finding 
<br/>it extremely difficult to access this subsidised dialysis service for reasons unknown to us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may share, Mr. Speaker Sir, during our last sitting of Parliament around the end of last 
<br/>year, you welcomed a gentleman who was seated in the gallery.  He passed away on 30</span><span>th</span><span> December 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>last year.  He has maternal link to me and was my </span><span>Facebook</span><span> friend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the last few weeks of his life, he posted on his </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page, not only a couple of 
<br/>distressing videos, calling on the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>to please assist him to be included in the subsidised dialysis scheme.  He said that he could no longer 
<br/>afford to pay the over hundreds of dollars per session per week for his routine kidney treatment.  He 
<br/>was  well  over  65  years  and  his  age  entitled  him  to  receive  social  benefits  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Women, Children and Social Protection.  Unfortunately, he passed away last year, probably because 
<br/>the Coalition Government failed to attend to his distress call.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many lives were lost to laxity by this Government.  I urge the 
<br/>Government to make systems and processes easy for our people.  Sir, I was informed that he was a 
<br/>strong SODELPA and PAP supporter.  May his soul rest in peace! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in moving forward, FijiFirst also introduced Free Health Care Scheme.  In 
<br/>this  Scheme,  ordinary  Fijians  can  access  medical  and  dental  consultation  and  treatments  by  an 
<br/>authorised  GP  Clinic  for  free.    In  addition,  private  doctors  prescribe  vital  medical  laboratory 
<br/>diagnostic tests and radiology scans where necessary.  These tests were carried out at private medical 
<br/>laboratories and radiology centre, all bills paid by the Government.  In this Scheme, the Government 
<br/>is  also  empowering  and  improving  economic  opportunities  for  the  MSME  operators  to  actively 
<br/>participate in doing business in that space.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his Address, His Excellency encouraged the Government to continue to support MSMEs 
<br/>and co-operatives by enhancing regulatory compliance, access to markets and sustainable finance.  
<br/>Like  most  Government  programmes,  this  scheme  too  is  taking  longer  than  expected  for  eligible 
<br/>households to get their approval.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The application form is complicated and the run around for JP certification and uploading of 
<br/>forms online, et cetera, is not really helping our vulnerable groups, who mostly live in remote villages 
<br/>and settlements.  They do not have any scanner, they do not have network, and most are not well 
<br/>educated.    Patients  kept  following  up,  and  some  of  them  have  submitted  their  registration  since 
<br/>August last year and are still waiting.  Government slackness is taking a toll on the health of our 
<br/>people.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst’s sole purpose for this Scheme is to take the load off our public hospitals Outpatients 
<br/>and Dental Clinics, as well as to aid accessibility to healthcare as part of SDG 3 - Universal Health 
<br/></span><span>Coverage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on, Mr.  Speaker, Sir, today, the average waiting time in most hospitals is about two 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hours to three hours to see a doctor, especially at densely populated areas, like Lami… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   Standing Order 60 - 
<br/>Relevance.      I  am  happy  with  the  honourable  Member’s  statement,  but  I  suggest  that  he  be  very 
<br/>specific and factual.  Otherwise, the relevance is not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- When you said it, we did not say anything, what happened now?

<div><span>Otherwise, everyone is trying to make an attempt to be the Speaker as well here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relevancy, honourable Ravunawa. You have been a Member of Parliament and almost going 
<br/>into the second year now and I think you should understand that.  I ask that you just confine yourself 
<br/>to the relevancy of your speech based on the reply that you are making on His Excellency’s Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  FijiFirst  handed  over  to  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government, some nursing stations that were upgraded to health centre level where medical doctors 
<br/>and nurse practitioners are posted full-time to attend to patient needs efficiently, other than the usual 
<br/>practice of having a staff nurse to see them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, if I can recall a total 19 nursing stations were upgraded to provide health centre level 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>medical care, and those are:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Dawasamu, Tailevu;

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, allow honourable Ravunawa to concentrate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on his speech. He is being factual as well.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The access ensures that medical care is brought closer to our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Government needs to realise that decentralising public healthcare remains 
<br/>one means to ensure to reach the unreached. In doing, so we will reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  call  on  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/></span><span>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  to  provide  more  funding  to  entice  and  incentivise 
<br/>healthcare professionals to nip these NCD crisis and other health issues at the doorsteps of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  ask  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  to  consider  getting  back  the  mobile  dental 
<br/>caravan  and  the  health  bus  so  that  we  can  go  down  and  do  more  community  outreach  at  the 
<br/>community level.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I must continue to thank the honourable Minister for Health and Medical 
<br/>Services for prioritising the need to repair and renovate the deteriorating operating theatre at CWM 
<br/>Hospital. This will assist the backlog of theatre cases, especially cancer cases, that have been on the 
<br/>waiting list for some time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  seen  and  are  also  happy  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  Health  has  begun 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure renovation on various health facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Yes, so we are doing something. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also reliably informed that much of the 
<br/>funding for these renovations is provided by the New Zealand High Commission and other bilaterial 
<br/>partners, the Board of Visitors…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Thank you for investing in the Fijian health sector.  I am, indeed, 
<br/>very grateful for everyone, who stepped in to help the Ministry of Health and Medical Services when 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance seems to have turned a blind eye.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, round off, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- I am rounding up now, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.K.  RAVUNAWA.-  In  essence  of  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Health to consider bringing back the Dental Prosthetic Lab that is currently operating in 
<br/>Nakasi  Health  Centre,  serving  people  right  from  the  border  of  Serua,  Lami,  the  whole  of  Suva, 
<br/>Nausori, Korovou, even up to Wainibuka.  Mostly, the senior citizens, who needed to attend clinic at 
<br/></span><span>Nakasi  are  finding  it  very  challenging  mostly  to  utilise  this  service  for  the  fabrication  of  their 
<br/></span><span>dentures.  These senior citizens (we already know) are facing a lot of challenges with their bus fare 
<br/>top-up subsidies under this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one important point is the Mortuary at Levuka Hospital 
<br/>in the Lomaiviti Subdivision and also at Vunisea in Kadavu Subdivision are not working.  I implore 
<br/>the  Government  to  look  at  installing  temporary  mortuaries  (maybe  a  20-foot  or  40-foot  cooler 
<br/>container) to  be positioned at  Vunisea in  Kadavu and also  at  Levuka in  the Lomaiviti, where the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  comes  from.    It  is  only  important  that  we  do  not  continue  to  deny 
<br/></span><span>families and loved ones the opportunity to pay their final respects and ritual rights in a culturally 
<br/></span><span>accepted manner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as alluded to by the honourable Leader of the Opposition and the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, let us try to work together, uphold our democratic ideas and build a brighter Fiji for 
<br/>our children.

<div><span>As I end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I take back the </span><span>Bible</span><span> verse I shared earlier, Ecclesiastes 19:4: 
<br/>“Money is needed for everything.”  The people of Fiji need our help.  The Coalition Government’s 
<br/>active  involvement  is  critical,  it  should  lead  the way  in  setting  priorities and  driving  the  primary 
<br/>healthcare initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the incredible health workers and

<div><span>also the support staff who are serving in our hospitals, health centres and nursing stations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech and </span><span>vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to speak on the motion before Parliament today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Ravunawa, for those very inspiring factual views 
<br/>that you have raised, especially in the moving of honourable Attorney-General’s village from Nairai 
<br/>to Ovalau.  I do not know how it moved, but strange things can happen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  we  continue,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  once  more  some  very  important  people 
<br/>sitting in the gallery.  From the left, one of our former colleague in the Opposition, who goes by the 
<br/>name of ‘Blue’.  Then we have behind him Jone from Kalabu, who is in green shirt.  Once again, we 
<br/>have the former Assistant Minister, Rajesh Singh, and Mikaele Leawere, whose name has been raised 
<br/>this week in this Parliament sitting.  He is sitting there at the back.  It is good that he has come to 
<br/>listen  to  all  that  is  being  said  about  him.    All  that  was  said  were  all  good,  nothing  bad,  Mikaele 
<br/>Leawere.  We also have the General Secretary of People’s Alliance Party sitting there with a former 
<br/>attaché to the Prime Minister’s Office who once headed the Water Authority of Fiji at one time.  Both 
<br/>are from Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and 
<br/>Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and  gentlemen  in  the  gallery  and 
<br/>fellow Fijians viewing in this morning; </span><span>miau sa bula re</span><span> and a very good morning to you all.  I rise 
<br/>this morning to deliver my  s contribution to this august Parliament in response to the President’s 
<br/>Opening remarks for the 2024 Parliamentary Sitting delivered on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji for his 
<br/>most Gracious Speech.  His Excellency has set the tone for continued support and commitment to all 
<br/></span><span>sectors of the economy, especially to the agriculture sector in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to remind us all that, we, the Coalition Government, are guided by the principle that 
<br/>was highlighted to us in the opening remarks of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>and, that is, we listen to the voices of our people, not only those who elected us, but all our citizens - 
<br/>young and old,  men and women. His Excellency also  remined us that we must acknowledge and 
<br/>recognise our differences, however, we must be united with one common goal to ensure that we live 
<br/>in a progressive and prosperous nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, I will focus my contribution to the issues, plans and progress 
<br/></span><span>related to agriculture and the food production sector. This sector is of paramount importance, not 
<br/>only to the nation’s healthy food production, but also to the wellbeing and the economy of our people.  
<br/>The lack of understanding of biophysical processes, trends and the failure to use information about 
<br/>the  natural  resources,  have  led  to  land  degradation,  inappropriate  land  uses,  increase  the  risk  of 
<br/>drought, flooding and loss of appropriate land for agricultural use and forestry.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  relative  brittleness  of  Fiji’s  marginal  land  may  be  debated,  but,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the 
<br/>agriculture  sector  has  been  the  backbone  of  Fiji’s  economy  since  Independence.    Its  impact  cuts 
<br/>across all the sectors and individuals in this country.  However, there is no question about the level 
<br/>of poverty in some Fijian rural communities today.  It is poverty that compels farmers’ families to 
<br/>clear forest for subsistence agriculture and to become seasonal migrant labourers or make the move 
<br/>to seek employment in rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to thank His Excellency in addressing us all on new global risks 
<br/>and existing challenges linked to climate change.  Apart from agriculture and natural resources, Fiji’s 
<br/>economy is basically supported by tourism.  The tourism industry contributes significantly to Fiji’s 
<br/>economy and the country’s largest foreign exchange earner.  That is the largest export sector and a 
<br/>major employer.  For Fiji, tourism is probably highly vulnerable to the impact of climate change due 
<br/>to the sector’s dependence on environment and climate.  Both agriculture and tourism contributes 
<br/>significantly to Fiji’s GDP.  Among the various forms of on-farm diversification, agritourism is often 
<br/>indicated as having development potential for farms and rural areas.  There is a need to produce food 
<br/>for our expanding population which includes increasing tourist arrivals in the tourism sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an increase in the number of tourists visiting our country presents both the 
<br/>challenge and an opportunity for our resourced-based sector.  To ensure that we are prepared to meet 
<br/>the  growing  demands  of  our  visitors,  in  particular,  to  have  an  adequate  food  supply  to  meet  this 
<br/>demand,  the  Ministry  is  taking  a  proactive  approach  to  address  this.    This  includes  investing  in 
<br/>infrastructure and facilities to support agriculture production and agritourism initiatives, as well as 
<br/>implementing measures to safeguard our land, water and marine ecosystem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has partnered with the Ministry of Tourism and 
<br/>Civil Aviation to implement programmes on the farm-to-fork initiative.  The aim is to promote the 
<br/>use of local agricultural  products in the tourism industry by bringing the knowledge gap between 
<br/>farmers, middlemen and the decision-makers in the hotel and tourism-based facilities.  This will help 
<br/>create  a  cooperative  business  model  amongst  farmers  and  cluster  groups.  This  will  also  promote 
<br/>financial management in the farming communities, an area which needs a lot of attention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of the agriculture sector has continued to navigate several 
<br/>risks  and  challenges  over  the  years  from  external  economic  shocks,  environmental  issues,  social 
<br/>trends and strict implementation processes.  Food import volumes into our region have been steadily 
<br/>increasing since the mid-1990s.  Today, most of our countries produce less than 65 percent of their 
<br/>dietary  energy  supply  domestically.  Our  location  and  distance  from  global  markets  impacts  food 
<br/></span><span>prices and the ability of our communities to access and afford healthy diets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  enhance  food  and  nutrition  security  for  all  Fijians,  the  Ministry  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>identified two targeted goals in the new Strategic Development Plan.  These are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase production of nutritious crops and livestock; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Collaborate  with  other  Government  Ministries  and  agencies  to  execute  the  Food  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nutrition Security policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  had  adopted  our  national  policies  and  has  helped  our  Government  prioritise  climate 
<br/></span><span>investments and strategically engage with funders to access climate finance and direct it to projects 
<br/>that will best protect communities from escalating climate impacts. As part of these priorities, farmers 
<br/>will be assisted with  crops and livestock packages, improved crop varieties and livestock breeds. 
<br/>They will also benefit from increased awareness of local, safe and nutritious food, the establishment 
<br/>of resilient backyard models in peri-urban areas and support for primary and secondary schools farm 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Strategic  Priority  3  of  the  Ministry’s  Strategic  Development  Plan  is 
<br/>dedicated  to  sustainable  resource  management  and  climate-smart  agriculture.    Fiji’s  exposure  to 
<br/>internal and external pressures in past decades had to some extent provided an opportunity for Fiji to 
<br/>develop itself in managing and mitigating the different risks and challenges in health, nutrition and 
<br/>in terms of economic security.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  initiated  various  actions  to  address  climate  change  adaptation,  such  as 
<br/>introducing  disease-tolerant  productivity  and  restoring  soil  fertility.    To  address  the  issues  of 
<br/>mitigation, initiatives such as manure management, using biogas digesters produce methane gas for 
<br/>household use, recycling manure for fertilisers, reviewing the applications of chemical fertilisers in 
<br/>Fiji and introducing organic fertilisers and bacterium culture to increase soil microbial population 
<br/>and fertility restoration are being implemented.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increasing intensity of tropical cyclones and other natural disasters is 
<br/>having  a  substantial  impact  on  farming  communities.    Increasingly,  saltwater  intrusion  and 
<br/>freshwater scarcity present urgent threats to sustainable agriculture in the region.   The Ministry will 
<br/>continue building  retention dams  and seawalls using  the nature-based solution method to  address 
<br/>flood, coastal erosion and coastal inundation.  There will be projects that will also be targeting areas 
<br/>which are normally affected by droughts and prolonged dry spells where irrigation schemes will be 
<br/>established and revived.  The formation of drainage boards will also help address problems associated 
<br/>with high water tables causing flooding in low lying areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our approach towards building resilience encompasses various initiatives 
<br/>such as providing continuous training and awareness on the latest production technologies like Good 
<br/>Agricultural  Practices  (GAP)  for  farming,  sustainable  methods  and  Climate-Smart-Farming 
<br/>Practices.    The  Ministry  also  encourages  farming  as  a  business,  supporting  graduate  farmers  to 
<br/>transition  from  a  subsistence  scale  to  a  commercial  scale.    Non-Government  Organisations  also 
<br/>provides  further  support  to  build  resilient  communities.    In  addition  to  our  overall  strategy,  the 
<br/>Ministry is focusing on reducing food waste through improved processing and storage methods.  Our 
<br/>goal is also to change consumers preferences so that locally produced food is available to everyone 
<br/>in the community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  exploring  the  opportunities  for  better 
<br/>collaboration  with  national  and  international  agencies  to  raise  awareness  among  farmers  about 
<br/>invasive pests and diseases and their potential impacts.  Furthermore, the government recognises the 
<br/>importance  of  research  in  the  agriculture  value  chain  for  long-term  development  in  the  country.  
<br/></span><span>Therefore,  we  plan  to  increase  our  investment  in  research  and  development  including  the 
<br/></span><span>development  of  research  stations.   The  Ministry will  engage  actively  in  providing  to  our  farmers 
<br/>value-adding machines that will assist in preserving food and also add value to agricultural produce 
<br/>that can be sold as supplementary to imported goods.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  population  growth,  urbanisation,  aging  agricultural  fisheries  workforce, 
<br/>over exploitation of oceanic resources and native forests, and pollution present both immediate and 
<br/>long-term  challenges  to  Fiji’s  food  systems  and  achieving  the  SDGs.    Transformation,  therefore, 
<br/>would  require  a  systematic  multi-stakeholder  approach,  taking  into  consideration  the  strength  of 
<br/></span><span>Fijian food systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  developed  commodity  plans  to  tackle  problems  related  to  agricultural 
<br/>commodities.  In addition to ongoing initiatives, the Ministry has established important commodity 
<br/>task forces and will continue strengthening the Crop and Livestock Council to address issues and 
<br/>concerns  related  to  the  production  and  trade  of  key  commodities  such  as  kava,  turmeric,  ginger, 
<br/>coconut, rice and root crops.  These taskforces will establish the direction for these commodities and

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlight production and trade-related issues.  Commercialisation and the use of modern technologies 
<br/>in agricultural development is also being identified to help transform the agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will revitalise the Yalavou, Uluisaivou and Tilivalevu Beef 
<br/>Schemes.    This  will  be  implemented  through  pasture  development,  road  maintenance,  water 
<br/>reticulation,  infrastructure  development  and  the  improvement  of  stockyards.    The  respective 
<br/>programmes will ensure an increase in production to cater for domestic demand.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  is  now  embarking  on  providing  efficient  targeted  programmes  and  strengthening  our 
<br/>policies  to  address  these  issues.  Each  farm  will  receive  improved  breeding  heifers  along  with 
<br/>inclusion of artificial insemination for breed improvement and multiplication programmes. Pasture 
<br/>seeds and planting material will be distributed with agro-inputs for the improvement of pastoral land.  
<br/>The Ministry will continue to work with key stakeholders to support these programmes including the 
<br/>milk industry. This includes strengthening of the Fiji Cooperative Dairy Company Limited with the 
<br/>expansion of the dairy to the West and North. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  genetic  conservations,  breeding  programmes,  the  employment  of 
<br/>digitalization and scientific innovations are also being given priorities in the development of the food 
<br/>sector.  Fiji hopes to further strengthen existing disaster risk management capacities including well 
<br/>established climate and disaster risk governance, early warning systems and response to a range of 
<br/>hazards including tropical cyclones, heavy rainfall, long dry seasons and unpredicted weather pattern. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I conclude, I also wish to address some of the concerns that were 
<br/>raised from that side of Parliament for the last three days.  One is on brain drain. The Ministry as 
<br/>highlighted yesterday most of the skilled workers had migrated and that included veterinarians, plant 
<br/>pathologists, soil scientists, engineers and one of the major causes of the loss of our qualified staff 
<br/>was insecurity they had with their employment in the last term.  We had already been working in 
<br/>trying to address this issue.  So, in the last 15 months we have started advertising vacant posts and 
<br/>filling vacant positions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, as part of this brain drain, there was no succession plan for staff and also the Ministry 
<br/>was  not  investing  on  capacity  building  and  human  resource  development,  and  this  has  also  been 
<br/>addressed.  The high input cost Fiji is exposed to is because of a lot of products shipped to Fiji.  The 
<br/>Government is providing subsidies for fertiliser and also providing planting material at a subsidised 
<br/>price.  Most  of  the  transportation  cost  to  farmers  for  the  inputs  paid  for  by  the  Government,  the 
<br/>transport cost is paid by Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  assistance  given  to  the  dairy  industry,  which  was  highlighted  by  honourable  Sachida 
<br/>Nand, this was done to address the reduction in milk production which was caused by the decrease 
<br/>in stock numbers that we have. The programme is initiated to increase the number of stock so that 
<br/>we can increase our dairy products in the dairy sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will continue to focus on achieving its strategic priorities as 
<br/>outlined  in  the  2024-2028  Strategic  Development  Plan  and  we  are  committed  to  implementing 
<br/>initiatives  that  will  positively  impact  the  agriculture  sector,  contributing  to  the  prosperity  and 
<br/></span><span>wellbeing of all Fijians as alluded to by His Excellency’s the President of the Republic of Fiji in his 
<br/></span><span>opening remarks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for providing me the opportunity to deliver this address and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fully the support the motion before Parliament.

<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Assistant  Minister  Tomasi  Tunabuna  for  your 
<br/>intervention, especially, making sure that there is a succession plan in the Ministry and you will try 
<br/>and increase the supply of milk per cow. It is right down to five litres now. You want to increase to 
<br/>20 litres? I hope for the best.  He is a veterinarian and is very good at that and highly qualified.

<br/>Shaista Shameem; a well-known personality in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now invite and offer the floor to the honourable Taito Rokomatu who hails from Wainibuka

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to acknowledge God 
<br/>the highest, for the wonderful gift and His blessing that He has given over my life, my family and 
<br/>my beloved nation.  Over the years, without God’s blessing and favour, I would not have been able 
<br/>to serve His calling that is to serve the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament ladies 
<br/>and gentlemen in the gallery and those connected to Parliament this morning  – </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka 
<br/>saka, namaste, assalamu alaikum </span><span>and</span><span> faiakse’ea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to speak and respond to His Excellency’s most 
<br/>gracious Speech at the Opening of Parliament on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  I thank His Excellency 
<br/>the President for his wonderful Address to Parliament on the importance of democracy following the 
<br/>Constitution, human rights, harmony and diversity, financial literacy, foreign policy, global world, 
<br/>Blue  Pacific  development,  civil  service  performance,  education,  labour  market,  national  digital 
<br/>strategy and cyber security and most importantly – drugs consumption in Fiji amongst our youths. I 
<br/>quote from the Address of His Excellency which states: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A major priority for the Coalition Government this year is the  formulation of a 
<br/>new National Development Plan that will set our collective vision and the key initiatives 
<br/>and programmes that will allow the nation to grow sustainably in the short and medium 
<br/>term.  The  key  fundamental  of  Government’s  Development  Agenda  is  inclusive 
<br/>development, to improve the wellbeing of our citizens.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  focus  the  honourable  Parliament’s  attention  on  the 
<br/></span><span>development  works  in  parts  of  Ra  heading  down  the  King’s  Road  towards  Korovou.    Firstly,  on 
<br/></span><span>development issue, Ra has a big potential but lacks the boost from Government to fulfil its target, the 
<br/></span><span>vanua</span><span> and the people of Ra.  I am here to raise their voice and allow me to speak in the  </span><span>iTaukei 
<br/></span><span>language. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Au a via laveta cake nikua o ira na wekaqu ni vanua saka vakaturaga o Ra e lutu bera saka 
<br/>tiko ena veivakatorocaketaki ni noda matanitu, au tucake nikua meu gusudra saka na vanua o Ra.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  villages  of  Nailuva,  Nasukamai,  Naqelecibi,  Nabalasere,  Namasia, 
<br/></span><span>Tikina o</span><span> </span><span>Nailuva;</span><span> Namara, Burelevu, </span><span>Tikina o Nalaba</span><span>, they really need a good access road and farm 
<br/></span><span>roads to help them transport their produce to the local market and sick people to get treated in the 
<br/>local  nursing  stations  and  health  centres.    These  roads  will  also  help  school  students  to  travel  to 
<br/>school  safely.    The  same  sentiment  was  shared  by  His  Excellency  during  his  Address  on  the 
<br/>importance of agriculture and better education for our children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the villages that I had mentioned needs tarseal on steep roads. This 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>243 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>starts from Namara Village in Ra and Burelevu Village in the </span><span>Tikina o Nalaba</span><span>, up to the village that 
<br/>I had mentioned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nararavou Village and Nasavu Village in Ra really need Irish Crossing.  
<br/>Their bridge was washed away by flooding.  Students and people in the community use it everyday.  
<br/>Now, parents and guardians will have to help the students to cross the flooding river from time to 
<br/>time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the access farm road from Nukulau Village to connect to Nasoqo Village 
<br/>and Nasukamai Village is 5.5 kilometres which was approved by the FijiFirst Government to be done 
<br/>but until last year, only 3 kilometers has been done but not properly done.   Sir, most of the people 
<br/>farming </span><span>yaqona, dalo </span><span>and cattle farming who are living in that area find it very hard to get access to 
<br/>the main road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Culanuku Village in the </span><span>Tikina o Nalawa, Ra</span><span>, need road repairs and it has 
<br/>been seven weeks now that students in the village have to walk to school on a daily basis.  Everyone 
<br/>is affected by this damaged road and it needs repair.  People are crying and need the Government to 
<br/>help them and reduce spending on unnecessary travels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, </span><span>tikina</span><span> and villages in the Ra Province need clean drinking water and to name 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a few villages, include Navitilevu Village and Savulotu Village. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I plead with the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster Management and the honourable Minister for Public 
<br/>Works,  Meteorological  Services  and  Transport  to,  please,  look  into  this  issue  and  assist  ordinary 
<br/>Fijians.  I reaffirm this Parliament that all the above issues that have been raised or I will be raising 
<br/>before the end of my response is based on my visitation and firsthand experience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) grid that was done by the last Government is still in Sawanivo 
<br/>Village.    From  Sawanivo  Village  towards  inland,  we  have  Nasau  Secondary  School  up  to 
<br/>Nubumakita Village and Nukulau Village and they are in need of electricity.  Soa Village, Matuku 
<br/>Village, Sovusovu Settlement and Wailailai Settlement near Bucalevu Village in Ra are still without 
<br/>electricity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency made a very important point on the need to Address the 
<br/>National Digital Strategy.  This problem is faced by the students of Nasau Secondary School in Ra 
<br/></span><span>whereby their parents and guardians are sending them to other schools near the main road with better 
<br/></span><span>digital connectivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of health services in Ra, the Nasau Nursing Station is located 
<br/>in the highlands of Ra. The ratio of service which is provided by the Ministry of Health and Medical 
<br/>Services is 1:600. The current practice at this particular nursing station is one nurse serving 2,193 
<br/>people from nine villages and six settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the nursing station needs improvement and renovation with the inclusion of 
<br/></span><span>electricity. The honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services needs to look into the above 
<br/></span><span>and provide more nurses to meet the standard of service and practice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming down to Northland development issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on my Maiden Speech in 
<br/>this august Parliament, I had highlighted issues from Wainibuka. Today, I will speak on the issues 
<br/>raised by the people from Northland in Tailevu, as follows:

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Colata Cocoa Farm Road in Nayavu needs EFL grid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Naibita Village and Nailega Village need clean drinking water. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Nalidi Village and Natuvatuvavatu Village need connectivity and installation of towers and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>satellite dish.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Nabouono Settlement in Nasau Village, Wainibuka, needs good access farm road.  More 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>than 15 students are using that road daily. 
<br/>The  district  of  Waibuka  and  the  boader  towards  the  Ra  Province  needs  cooperative 
<br/>awareness or </span><span>‘solesolevaki’</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Korovou Police Station and Nayavu Police Post needs additional vehicles to better serve 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Province of Tailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Korovou Police Barrack and Police Station needs renovation. 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Natovi Jetty needs a Police Post and outboard engine.   
<br/>9.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Verata</span><span> - dou bula na noqu kabani</span><span>, with its three </span><span>Tikina makawa</span><span>
<br/>- Verata, Vugalei and Namalata needs clean drinking water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>From Korovou to Logani Village they really need clean drinking water.   
<br/>11.</span><span> </span><span>Buses and vehicles travelling through the Kings Roads stop at Korovou Town and I thank 
<br/>the  previous  Government  for  the  improvement  made  to  its  public  convenience  facility.  
<br/>However,  there  is  a  simple  issue  arising  which  is  the  closing  time  of  the  public 
<br/>inconvenience.  When the bus stops at Korovou Town, passengers, especially ladies, have 
<br/>to make their way elsewhere to carry out their business after four hours ride from Rakiraki 
<br/>Town to Korovou Town, not forgetting passengers from Suva to Natovi.  That is why we 
<br/>need to inform our civil servants that they play a very important role in the daily operation 
<br/>of the Government machinery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recently made a visit to Vatukoula and had a  </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session with the 
<br/>Vatukoula Gold Mine strike workers, on a promise made to them by the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>(Sitiveni Rabuka) due to payment that was owed to them. I have to carry out their wish and, that is, 
<br/>to relay their message to the other side of Parliament for their voice to be heard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  also  speak  on  youth  development,  employment  and 
<br/>empowerment.  To  empower  youth  to  acquire  employable  skills  which  will  help  them  find  better 
<br/>opportunity,  this  training  can  be  done  through  formal,  informal  and  non-formal  education  and 
<br/>training development strategies policy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On leadership and decision, empowering youth to maximise their leadership skills, including 
<br/>communication, creativity and innovation, as well as introduce more life skills training to promote 
<br/></span><span>respect and understanding of cultural education and spiritual values. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  of  the  promises  made  by  the  Coalition  Government  during  their 
<br/>campaign was not fulfilled. The Turaga ni Koro allowance of $200 fortnight was not delivered as 
<br/>promised.    Villages  are  waiting  for  their  $50,000  each  for  the  development  works.    Honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance promised the people of Fiji that a drop in food price and life will be much better 
<br/>when they will be in power.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, people are suffering,  and the crime rate is increasing  due to  the high cost  of living.  
<br/></span><span>Mothers resort to shoplifting to provide milk supplement for their babies.  During the last Parliament 
<br/></span><span>sitting, I had asked the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration on what can be done 
<br/>to the drug issue in Fiji.  By looking at the statistics, drugs usage and the drug abuse is on the rise 
<br/>which include the mass import of illegal substances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  conclude,  I  fully  agree  with  His  Excellency’s  Address  when  he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>highlighted, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As I look upon the honourable Members of this august Parliament, I am humbly 
<br/>reminded of the immense responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices 
<br/>and aspirations of our people.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must listen to the voice of the people who have democratically elected 
<br/>us as their representatives.  Everything that we do in this Parliament must be for the people, by the 
<br/>people, and to the people of Fiji.  That is why I have highlighted on my response the need for our 
<br/>public servants to work hard and get in touch with the grassroot people and inform their line Ministers 
<br/>on the needs of the nation on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the points I am raising are people’s voices.  It is not important to me 
<br/>what into my pocket, but the reason I am here is to serve my country and the people who have voted 
<br/>all of us in this august Parliament. May God bless Fiji and all Fijians.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  this  august 
<br/>Parliament, members of the public here in Parliament and those who are joining us virtually through 
<br/>livestream media; a great morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  take  this  opportunity  to  commend  </span><span>Turaga  Na  Tui  Macuata</span><span>,  </span><span>Taukei 
<br/>Bolatagane</span><span>, His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Maivilili Katonivere, for his Address last 
<br/>Monday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  take  this  opportunity  to  convey  my  condolences  to  the  Tui  Yasawa,  the  </span><span>Vanua  o 
<br/>Yasawa</span><span>, from the </span><span>Turaga Na Tui Nairai</span><span> and the chiefs of the people of </span><span>Kubuna i Wai</span><span>. </span><span>Ni qai gole 
<br/>ena vakacegu ni Turaga.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taumada au vakavinavinaka i Viti raraba.  I Kubuna vua na Vunivalu Na Tui Kaba kei na 
<br/>kena i sasavu; i Burebasaga vua na Gone Marama Na Roko Tui Dreketi, Turaga Na Vunivalu; kei

<br/>na i solisoli, kemuni na tiko i Viti, kemuni na tiko mai Vavalagi, ena loma ni 14 na Yasana </span><span>and all 
<br/>the communities who are listening in,</span><span> vinaka vakalevu.  Ni qai kalougata tiko.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, may I open my speech with Genesis 12:2 that says, and I quote:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I will make you into a nation, and I will bless you. I will make your name great, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and you will be a blessing.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is connected to what Isaiah said in 41:10, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “Fear  not,  for  I  am  with  you;  Be  not  dismayed,  for  I  am  your  God.    I  will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strengthen you and help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, His Excellency’s Speech, if anything, it summarises that God has given us 
<br/>all the great purpose to bless this wonderful nation of ours.  Members of Parliament, we are not here 
<br/></span><span>by accident, we are appointed by the power of God, and as we sit here and go about our usual business 
<br/></span><span>that, first of all, we must conduct ourselves so that we respect the dignity of this Parliament and, of 
<br/>course, the people we serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may summarise, Mr. Speaker Sir, the word love - </span><span>na veiqaravi, na siro, na vinaka, na 
<br/>duavata kei na cakacaka vata</span><span>.  Religious tolerance, reconciliation, you name it, we are all called 
<br/>upon.  Members of Parliament today, people are watching us.  The prayer of this side of Parliament,

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as you sit on the other side, you will support and we will work together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise today in support of the motion raised by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/>Indeed, we have reached one year, and I wish to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation. God’s 
<br/>inspiration and guidance be with all those who have helped us reach this milestone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Abraham Lincoln, the former US President, said: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  “The trouble with too many people is that they believe realm of truth always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lies within their vision.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>And I say this when I hear what the other side said, “where is the progress? Where is the new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>project?  You are not attending to the plight of the people!’   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then I recall on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2022, as we were about to come to Parliament to vote for the 
<br/>new Government, the new Prime Minister and the new President, what year the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister challenged our Party, and that statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, touches me.  It reminds me and 
<br/>I keep on emphasising the same words over and over again to my staff and to the people, </span><span>Na cava na 
<br/>kavou o na cakava mera okata na lewei Viti, oqo na Viti vou.</span><span>  What is the new thing you will do, so 
<br/>that the people of Fiji will say, ‘yes, this is the new Fiji’, and that is what we carry.  That is our focus 
<br/>- the new Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, in the course of my submission, I will, of course highlight some of the new 
<br/>changes we have created in our 14 months and, of course, also rebut some of what has been said from 
<br/>the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is  a lot more on this journey  - a lot of more planning, a lot more refining, a lot for 
<br/>change for the betterment of our nation.  What an exciting year this year will be.  No time for empty 
<br/>words or frivolous debate.  No time for beating around the bush.  No time for distractions, but only 
<br/>progress, moving Fiji forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because there was a mess.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> </span><span>A vesuki tu o Viti, e qai sereki. Me yacova mai qo, se  tukuni tu ga, sega mada ga ni macala 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kea sega ni qaqa na</span><span> Coalition Government.  Where will we be?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, we launched the Assessment of the Inequalities in the Registration 
<br/>of Births and Deaths in Fiji from 2016-2021, being the first country in Asia and the Pacific to carry 
<br/></span><span>out a quantitative inequality assessment. This, indeed, was the first step for Fiji to bridge registration 
<br/></span><span>gaps. What we ask is; what was done all those years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA. – Nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA. – Absolutely nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA. – There is a real need to know our people, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that even the youngest of society is taken care of. This progressive step is to better inform research 
<br/>conducted and policies aimed at social inclusion of the most vulnerable in our society and allows for 
<br/>international comparability. This includes looking into the challenges of teenage and young mothers 
<br/>in order to strengthen the delayed birth registration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Birth registration, Mr. Speaker, Sir is a fundamental right and a crucial step to accessing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>247 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>essential services.   Sir, to help achieve higher birth registration, specifically targeting this provision 
<br/>of legal identity for all under SDG16 as we all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with accurate data, we are 
<br/>able to better plan and provide for people beginning with our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to state that the Ministry of Justice has just completed its 2018-2011 Annual 
<br/>Report.  So,  in  the  last  five  years,  nothing  was  done.    The  Ministry  is  working  on  a  Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan.  Imagine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why this was not done before, the question I ask? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still  on  the  subject  of  our  children,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  2023,  we  embarked  on  a  public 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultation to draft Bills namely, the Childcare and Protection Bill and the Draft Child…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Point of Order, honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise on Point of Order 61 - relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has not referred to any part of His Excellency’s Address from when he 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>started. He is talking about reports, et cetera, but nothing on His Excellency’s Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – You may continue, honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.  –  The  draft  Bills  also  established  the  register  for  approved  child 
<br/>agencies,  organisations  and  children’s  homes.  The  draft  Child  Justice  Bill  increases  the  age  of 
<br/>criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years and establishes the Child Justice Court.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are some of the features of the two draft Bills which are undergoing 
<br/>review. You must hear the people and because this impacts our young, we must give it the attention 
<br/>it deserves. That is how you make laws - identifying what needs to be done and ensuring that all have 
<br/>had a chance to share their opinions and expertise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Child  Protection.  As  His 
<br/>Excellency has pointed out, honourable Naupoto, that our aim is, indeed, to modernize and strengthen 
<br/>our legislative framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having addressed the issue of children, I now turn to another area that falls 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under my area of responsibility and, that is, of course, Corrections Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sorry to report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the many years I have come across in my discoveries, 
<br/>it would be amiss of me not to outline the changes that have taken place since the era of darkness that 
<br/>overshadowed the institution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It was different when Mr. Naivalurua was there, it was different when 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Vasu was there, but I can share, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the last five years was really difficult. Let 
<br/></span><span>me enlighten this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu. Please, address them in that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>way in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu, former Commissioners 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Fiji Corrections Service. Thank you for your hard work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service, just prior to us being in Government, operated on such stringent 
<br/>and almost toxic environment.  As you would have seen last year, we removed the policy on single 
<br/>mothers.    It  was  discriminatory  on  women.  There  was  an  atmosphere  of  fear  and  disrespect  of  a 
<br/>person’s ranking with decisions made hastily and officers disproportionately disciplined. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is always light at the end of the tunnel. We believe in our people, no 
<br/>matter  who  you  are  and  where  you  are.  The  FCS  has  severed  its  partnership  with  counterpart 
<br/>correction  facilities  overseas.    There  is  now  an  MOU  with  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Medical 
<br/>Services for inmates, as well as Fiji Corrections officers and families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first time, the Fiji Corrections Service is focused on a programme designed to impact 
<br/>the rehabilitation of inmates as well as the Fiji Corrections personnel and their families to promote 
<br/>spiritual development and help inculcate self-awareness, self-discipline and to nurture a culture of 
<br/>working together - something unheard of, at least.  It definitely would not be something expected of 
<br/>the Fiji Corrections Service in previous years. That is change, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I am reminded of 
<br/>the famous words of Nelson Mandela and I quote: “For to be free is not merely to cast off one’s 
<br/>chain, but to live in a way that respects and enhance the freedom of others.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Mercy  Commission  in  2023,  assessed  petitions  made  and  a  total  15 
<br/>individuals were pardoned. This is a record.  Why I say this, some of them have been pardoned, they 
<br/>have applied so many times but were never considered by the previous Mercy Commission.  Having 
<br/>reviewed the guidelines that was previously used, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I can honestly say that there was 
<br/>not much done for such a critical role that the Commission has.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I just share what I was told in December that Mr. Silatolu has spent 
<br/>countless years in prison. In December, his son, a pilot, took him to Singapore to visit. That was so 
<br/>lovely.  Someone who had been incarcerated for so many years, the bond between a father and son 
<br/>with the mother gone, that is real freedom.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Anti-Discrimination  Human  Rights  Commission,  the  Constitution  itself  contains  a 
<br/>chapter dedicated to human rights.  This is an institution that we look to, to spearhead human rights 
<br/>issues in Fiji. This means getting to know our people, empowering our people and speaking for our 
<br/>people when there is no one to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have since appointed a new Director at the Commission who brings with her a wealth of 
<br/>experience having been the Director of the Samoan National Human Rights Constitution for over 
<br/>seven years. The Commission has been active at the forefront of climate change and related issues, 
<br/>including  healthy environment,  drinking water and sanitation, food and cultural  rights, to  name a 
<br/>few, and visiting 27 villages in seven Provinces so far.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to point out that the Commission has since opened their first ever regional office 
<br/>in Lautoka, with the next one to be in Labasa. I want to highlight, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the opening 
<br/></span><span>of the Human Rights Office in Suva, there was no regional office until some weeks back. That shows 
<br/></span><span>the commitment and dedication of the Coalition Government in terms of advocating for human rights. 
<br/>The  Human  Rights  Commission  Act  1999  set  for  the  initial  establishment  later  repealed  by  the 
<br/>Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission 2009, this was over 15 years ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Commission has now expanded, expressions visible and is key to reaching out to people.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one main office has been in place this whole time. It is shocking to note that in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>249 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2007  the  Global  Alliance  of  National  Human  Rights  Institution  Sub-Committee  on  the  tradition 
<br/>recommended suspending the “A” status of the Commission, that is, the Human Rights Commission 
<br/>in Fiji because it was of the view that the ability of the Commission to implement its human rights 
<br/>was compromised as a result of the </span><span>coup</span><span> in 2006 and that is the hallmark of the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/>Interference, interference, interference!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- In 2021, Fiji received the “B” status in line with the strategic priority, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Commission now intends to regain its former “A” status in its application by 
<br/>addressing the recommendations by the Sub-Committee.  I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we 
<br/>will achieve it. Upholding human rights is a fundamental responsibility and goal of the Coalition 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving  onto  legal  institutions,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  point  at  the  outset,  this 
<br/>Government’s priority is to ensure that our people are equipped to do the work. Whilst we appreciate 
<br/>and  thankful  for  the  assistance  that  has  been  rendered  to  us  over  the  years,  we  must  change  our 
<br/>mindset so that we can adopt a “we can attitude”.  We are an independent nation and with that comes 
<br/>the responsibility to ensure that we ourselves are self-sustaining.  We cannot continuously depend on 
<br/>others to do the work for us.  With full representation, the Constitutional Offices Commission (COC) 
<br/>has met on several occasions to deliberate on pertinent issues that fall within the mandate under the 
<br/>2013 Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Constitutional Office Commission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has to-date been the most active 
<br/>that I have ever witnessed.  Never was a Commission with all its members present, never has there 
<br/>been a single Commission that ensures the due diligence, proper documentation and the right people 
<br/>are appointed to look into matters that require scrutiny.  May I say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I started, I 
<br/>asked for the minutes, there was basically no record of this important Commission.  So, we basically 
<br/>started afresh. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  first  time,  the  Commission  resolved  to  consider  its  own  Standing  Operating 
<br/>Procedures (SOP) with respect to the conduct of its internal procedures and functions. For the first 
<br/>time, it established an independent committee to advice on the appropriate remuneration allowance 
<br/>that should be payable to all Constitutional Offices under its responsibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Some 
<br/>were sitting at $500,000 some at $350,000, that is the whole reason and part of the exercise so that it 
<br/>meets what it is required here.  That review is currently being done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been much speculation about the appointment of specific tribunals.  
<br/>Why are there no simultaneous appointments?  Why the expenditure?  Why is the process so slow?  
<br/>Why cannot specific officers be filled?  We outright denounce the accusation of political interference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I remind this august Parliament, there is a distinction between the Constitutional Offices 
<br/>Commission and the Judicial Services Commission. The Constitutional Offices Commission operates 
<br/>when a complaint-initiated mechanism.  It receives complaints from the members of the public and 
<br/>on  assessment  either  report  to  the  police  or  take  note  to  initiate  proceedings  or  allegations  of 
<br/></span><span>misconduct, setup a tribunal and proceed to hearing. The Judicial Service Commission on the other 
<br/></span><span>hand is mandated to investigate complaints for other specific officers for instance those appointed by 
<br/>the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution and Judicial Officers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a former President of the United States of America and who many have 
<br/>turned to for his wise words of governance once said and I quote, “when we got into the office, the 
<br/>thing that surprise me most was to find that things were just as bad as we’d been saying they were.”

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those words speaks truth, that is the reason why we must get the right people to do the job, not to 
<br/>rush matters of sensitivity.  No overnight analysis and verdicts.  This is democracy, it is getting things 
<br/>done the right way and in the proper manner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023 alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the appointment of new Judicial Officers saw an increase on 
<br/>the number of local and qualified men and women appointed to the bench with proper remuneration, 
<br/>deserving of individuals who have spent much of their careers contributing to Fiji’s legal system and 
<br/>jurisprudence.  The judicial system now is well equipped to handle local cases by our people well-
<br/>qualified to do so and who are able to understand the local context when it is required.  This is also 
<br/>to ease the load of the numerous cases that are before our courts today which, Mr. Speaker, Sir, had 
<br/>to be audited by the Acting Chief Justice himself.  This has never been done before in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  give  you  a  snapshot  of  the  number  of  Judicial  Officers,  in  2021  there  were  eight  new 
<br/>appointments.  To-date a record of 22 Judicial Officers have been appointed, 11 Judges, three women 
<br/>and 11 Magistrates.  I take this time to thank these men and women for their acceptance, commitment 
<br/>to the cause of justice.  This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a change and I am very proud to be part of such a 
<br/>development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the major law reviews that His Excellency outlined 
<br/>as  part  of  the  legislative  programmes.  As  you  would  know  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General  is 
<br/>responsible for the preparation of all laws. Principle subsidiary, this programme would ensure that 
<br/>there  is  a  proper  planning  and  policy  mechanism  in  place  to  ensure  that  our  laws  are  properly 
<br/>reviewed in relation to the review of the laws and that includes the setting up of the Fiji Law Reform 
<br/>Commission and Officers who have recently been appointed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is one thing I can attest to that had not adequately taken place 
<br/>previously – consultation.  It is evident from the last 14 months, we are committed to ensure that the 
<br/>voice of the people are heard in formulating the Government policies and laws. This is important 
<br/>because it will determine the way forward to our country and we will ensure that the people’s views 
<br/>are taken into account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  can  just  round-off  now.    In  one  year,  the  Government  assisted  ten 
<br/>communities, one secondary school in the Lomaiviti Province through various projects, as the Tavua 
<br/>Village Evacuation Center, retrofitting project, foot bridges, four villages at the St John College, that 
<br/>is the change Government made, making a positive difference to the lives of people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have here a list of projects,  I was told that there were no new projects 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>undertaken by the Coalition Government, there are 11 projects in Lomaiviti, costing $276,330.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. S.T. Koroilavesau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was supposed to be implemented 10 years ago 
<br/>or even more.  That includes the jetty from my village, Nairai.  This Coalition Government has taken 
<br/>action to implement those projects, that is the change that we are calling for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I would like to support the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>251 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Prime Minister’s motion of an Ocean of Peace, the sentiments resonates deeply and I am 
<br/>reminded of Romans 14:19 and I quote: “Let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace 
<br/>and to mutual edification.”  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity and I look forward to 
<br/>robust discussions and debate over the coming sittings in this august Parliament.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, 
<br/>ni kalougata saka tiko. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>. 
<br/>MR.  SPEAKER.-    Remember  the  great  inroads  in  the  consultative  stance  he  took  in  the 
<br/>nightclub  hours.    I  remember  honourable  Usamate  raising  in  Parliament  -  everything  Lomaiviti.  
<br/>Now, he is talking about nightclubs, are there any nightclubs in Nairai?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But that is the way he has been undertaking his task by doing consultative work, even outside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the urban areas.  Thank you honourable Attorney-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition,  honourable Members  of Parliament, to  our audience in  the gallery and 
<br/>thousands who have tuned in; </span><span>ni sa bula</span><span>, </span><span>namaste, assalamu alaikum </span><span>and a very good afternoon to 
<br/>you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you in this august Parliament today, not just as a Member of 
<br/>Parliament but as a voice for the aspirations and dreams of our entire young and dynamic generation, 
<br/>to respond to His Excellency’s most Gracious Address delivered on Monday, 4th March, 2024.  In 
<br/>response to His Excellency Address, I would like to turn my attention to the Coalition Ministers and 
<br/>their Ministries about their performances in the last 14 months, on matters of truth, constitutional 
<br/>integrity, accountability and transparency of our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Pacific islanders are the guardians of this ocean which is central to their 
<br/>way of life as it underpins their culture, food, livelihood and national economies.  But the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister’s support for Japan’s compliance with safety protocols for the nuclear waste dump 
<br/>has raised concerns by the youth of Fiji on the future state of our coastlines, marine ecosystems and 
<br/>quality of marine food.  Majority of the youth have raised concerns on the health implications that 
<br/>they and their future generations will endure in time to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Pacific  region  produces  about  0.03  percent  of  global 
<br/>greenhouse gas emissions, yet we have been victims of climate change for decades.   The comments 
<br/>made by the honourable Prime Minister to state that Australia’s fossil fuel industries cannot shutdown 
<br/>immediately  rather  we  want  them  to  tone  down  has  left  the  Pacific  civil  society  representing  the 
<br/></span><span>voices and concerns of communities deeply disappointed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a youth who has served in several communities, working and advocating 
<br/>for  youth  empowerment,  climate  sustainability  and  resilience,  has  labelled  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s comments to be harmful and destructive, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It was kind of a slap in the face of the hard work that has been put in by Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>leaders both past and present.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  majority  of  the  youth  have  expressed  their  concerns  and 
<br/></span><span>disappointments over Fiji’s vote at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - a genocide depriving 2.2 
<br/>million people from accessing food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel, the killings of innocent 
<br/>men, women and children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we come from the Pacific nations. We have already been victims of climate 
<br/>change for decades, Fiji has witnessed an estimated 28 cyclones in the last 40 years, our generations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have suffered, yet, we have supported someone else’s suffering in the right for someone to defend 
<br/>their land.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audacity is questionable, and the youth of this country are asking, “is 
<br/>this the leadership we have inherited?  I call on the honourable Prime Minister and I urge him to 
<br/>reconsider his decision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is no room for racism and inequality. Just like that, a war is never a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>solution. What the younger generations are asking for, is for people to stop dying.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another array of disappointment, shooting of stray animals is and will never 
<br/>be an option. Thousands of youth have raised their concerns and shared their disappointment in regard 
<br/>to the comments made by the honourable Minister for Agriculture.  Addressing stray animal requires 
<br/>a multifaceted approach that combines Government interventions and societal engagements and most 
<br/>importantly, compassion.  I believe there are NGOs who have emailed and are reaching out to the 
<br/>Councils and relevant authorities, and I urge the youth to continue raising their voices for animal 
<br/>welfare and wellbeing. I urge the honourable Prime Minister and his Cabinet to find more tangible 
<br/>but yet compassionate solutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  2024.  Where  is  the  confidence  in  our  economy?  Where  is  the 
<br/>confidence under the Coalition Government?  So many Fijians are leaving Fiji by the numbers when 
<br/>this Government came in.  The amount of brain-drain has not gone unnoticed. The honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications says, “oh, there is a mood to invest in the country.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, people are asking as to who authorised the airfare payments for the 
<br/>six </span><span>talatala </span><span>for a sightseeing trip to Macau city? Who paid? The rumours are that a Chinese group 
<br/>trying to sell the idea for casino.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What has this got to do with us?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the questions have been asked, “who paid?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Ask the </span><span>talatala</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, hearing the concerns from that side, they can really 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fill the heat.  Well, more is coming.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Some more, some more! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President highlighted about the 
<br/>efforts to end violence against women and girls and to promote women’s economic empowerment. 
<br/>On 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023, Fijivillage stated honourable Sashi Kiran’s comments, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Our aim is to mould women into leadership roles and encourage them into the Fijian 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>political life that led to the upcoming municipal elections.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, a female CEO has resigned because of working conditions she was 
<br/>facing.  Did the honourable Minister, and even the honourable Minister for Women said anything 
<br/>about this?  In fact, I asked the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>her  Assistant  Minister,  how  many  women  are  Special  Administrators?  How  many  women  are  in 
<br/>advisory roles? Crime against women has increased by 31 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, the honourable Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications likes to talk about 16 years 
<br/>but in 14 months under the Coalition Government, we have witnessed $122 million wind turbine deal 
<br/>blunder under this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Two agencies had signed it,  but we need to note is that a female who 
<br/>was the Permanent Secretary for Fisheries and Forests was removed.  What about the other member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years did nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.-  Trust the process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Back to the honourable Minister for Women, Children and Social 
<br/>Protection and her Assistant Minister,   please, stop hiding behind your fancy speeches of women 
<br/>empowerment and go to the ground and see what is happening.  Go and talk to Shamima Ali from 
<br/>the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre, who has recently come out with bold statements about the state of 
<br/>the women in this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Ministers need a wake-up call.  Sugar coated and fancy words 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will do no good for this country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- For 16 years, you did nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  14  months  -  $122  million  turbine  deal  gone  wrong.    Who  was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sleeping on the job?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President highlighted about Fiji’s debt, that it will be 
<br/>around $10 billion in July 2024.  Some of the politicians on the other side harped at the top of their 
<br/>voices with all the energy they had, about reducing debt in the last campaign, but that has increased 
<br/></span><span>under this Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Very contradicting statements, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President  also  spoke  about  strengthening  our  economy  and  building 
<br/>confidence with investors.  I would like to remind this august Parliament and the youth of this country 
<br/>that a Parliament is not a place to give out or speak of unrealistic dreams and promises, so in a matter 
<br/></span><span>of accountability … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Tuisawau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Go fix the roads?

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… on 4</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2016, when honourable Professor Prasad was a Member of Parliament on the 
<br/>Opposition side, said and I quote, “The National Minimum Wages rate of $2.32 has become a joke 
<br/>around grog bowls.”  He labelled the National Minimum Wage as a joke, and this was an insult to 
<br/>the ordinary Fijians.  How can we expect him to increase the National Minimum Wages to $5? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It’s coming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I would like to tell him, Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, what is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>national joke of the country around grog bowls: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>When will wages be $5; and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>When will lamb chops be $5 a kilogramme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is the national joke of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  when  were  politicians  appearing  on 
<br/>sponsored talkback shows? Fijian Broadcasting Corporations is there for public service broadcast 
<br/>and it has a wider reach.  I have seen some of your talk shows, my goodness! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, who is paying for all these talkback shows?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- They could have called for an Expressions of Interest or tender but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothing of that sort.  This is a party government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- A Point of Order has been raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Standing  Order  60  -  Relevance.    The  honourable 
<br/></span><span>Member  is  going  all  over  the  place.    He  should  be  sticking  to  the  point  and  speaking  on  His 
<br/>Excellency’s Address.  He is going all over the place, and we cannot be knowing where he is going 
<br/>to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Member.  He is not going all over the place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think he is well on track. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Thank  you,  Mr.  Speaker.    I  urge  the  other  side  to  pay  attention 
<br/>because I said in a matter of accountability.  Again, on a matter of accountability, on 10</span><span>th</span><span> July, 2018, 
<br/>honourable  Professor  Prasad,  as  a  Member  of  Parliament,  said  and  I  quote,  “We  will  be  cutting 
<br/>Ministerial  salaries  and  allowances,  we  will  be  cutting  international  conferences  and  we  will  be 
<br/>keeping Ministers at home, focusing to make lives better for Fijians.”

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a matter of accountability, I would like to ask the Coalition Government; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how many international trips have you taken in the last 14 months?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Standing Order 60 on Misleading.  The honourable Member 
<br/>is  misleading  Parliament  by  saying  “what  I  promised  in  2018”.    We  have  kept  the  20  percent 
<br/>reduction in the salary, we have reduced the allowances and for him to actually lie in this Parliament 
<br/>and said that we have not done anything about the allowances, we have not done anything about the 
<br/>salaries.  In this Parliament, he was here, they were actually opposing it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We reduced the allowances.  So, I urge the honourable Member to stop lying in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! Honourable Deputy Prime Minister is raising a Point of Order on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevancy, that is, Standing Order 60 and misleading is under what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Based on that, you may continue honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.- Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  urge  honourable  Coalition  Ministers  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>listen carefully because we are speaking the voices of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quoting him and my question is, “how many international trips?  They 
<br/>really feel the heat on this question. How may international trips, Coalition Government?  In fact, I 
<br/>heard some of them, they are booking their flights right after this Parliament, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Sharma? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  you  confine  yourself  a  little  bit  more  there  because  I  will  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>travelling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Standing Order 62 – when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>speaking a Member must not impute improper motives to any other Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- He is  just quoting from what was being said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- He did not name anyone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Sir, implying that the international travel was unnecessary and

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for personal benefit.  Because when we look back during the FijiFirst Government where they took 
<br/>thousands  of  trips  for  climate  change  meetings,  what  happened?    Now,  he  is  imputing  improper 
<br/>motives for all the travel we did.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, a lot of these travels is funded internationally from international organisations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and it is for mandated meetings and international obligations which we are obliged to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  The  point  that  has  been  raised  is  misleading  Parliament  and  imputing 
<br/>improper motives.  I mean, honourable Sharma, overseas trips are necessary.  We are not living in an 
<br/>isolated island but rather we live in this global village that we live in, and we are part and parcel of 
<br/>what is happening immediately surrounding us and those that are beyond us.  So, we have to attend 
<br/>the meeting and I think it is only proper that we continue because that is the role made by the previous 
<br/>Government and is done by this Government and the next Government as well.  So, if you want to 
<br/>raise issues on these overseas trips, yes, come out with the facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  are  you  really  attacking,  is  it  the  allowances  that  they  receive  because  you  need  to 
<br/>provide a good answer there or reply to that effect so as to what warrants all these trips?  Actually, 
<br/>you have raised more than enough in your punches that you have been throwing and it has worked 
<br/>well because Members from this side have reacted as well.   You may continue, honourable Sharma. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these 14 months, we have witnessed the poor, 
<br/>fiscal and economic policies.  Under this honourable Minister of Fnance, we see Fiji’s largest deficit 
<br/>budget.  Accept it, he is very historic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over $800 million have been… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- …borrowed.  The youths were told that their loan is forgiven, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they are under a bond.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  Please, allow honourable Sharma to continue with his speech.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, last week, someone met me and said that most of 
<br/>the Special Administrators and Advisors are mostly NFP members.  And he further added on and 
<br/>said, “Hey, has NFP already started their election campaign for 2026?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Who knows, Mr. Speaker, Sir, people are talking.  I urge the honourable Prime Minister, that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>many people are saying that with this honourable Minister for … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Point  of  Order!    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  refer  to  those 
<br/>Standing Orders.  This  honourable Member is  still lying, misinformation  and misleading.    He is 
<br/>saying all the Administrators are NFP supporters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>257 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- To say even ‘most’.  Remotely, it is not ‘most’.  He is making 
<br/>a  generalisation,  telling  a  lie  to  the  people  of  Fiji  that  all  those  Administrators  appointed  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister are NFP supporters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Not all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He used the word, ‘most’.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want him to 
<br/>bring  evidence  and  prove  that  out  of  all  the  Administrators  appointed,  in  all  the  towns  and  city 
<br/>councils that most of them are NFP supporters.  I want him to do that, otherwise, he should be referred 
<br/>to the Privileges Committee, which we will look into. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My ruling on that, since you have indicated generally, imputing proper motives, what else 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have you stated.  But I was waiting for what Standing Orders has he breached.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I remember correctly and if I heard him right, honourable Sharma indicated that that was 
<br/>something he heard, people were making comments.  I would not dare to go that far, because here 
<br/>we are talking about whatever is going to appear in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> the next day, and we just have 
<br/>to take it from there.  If that could be agreed upon then we will leave it at that and ask honourable 
<br/>Sharma to stay focussed and continue with his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it has been 14 months as  a Member of Parliament 
<br/>and we are recognised in the public and they do reach out to us anywhere we are - getting in our vans 
<br/>or in the supermarket, and they come and share what they feel about the country.  So, I said someone 
<br/>told me, and I do not even know or recognise that person, but they recognised me, and they shared 
<br/>their feelings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, I remember someone met me in front of Extra Supermarket and said, “Oh I want to 
<br/>go to India as well on the trip that farmers went to.”  I said, you have to ask the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Sugar.  And he said, “Oh, if they can take the plane to Israel then they can take the plane to India 
<br/>as well and take all of us.”  So, this is the precedence this Government is setting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the honourable Minister of Finance, again, people are saying that there are more gaps 
<br/></span><span>and potholes in  our economy  than our roads.   God forbid,  if honourable  Tabuya was Minister of 
<br/></span><span>Finance, they might have been printing money, who knows.  I urge the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>reconsider certain Ministerial positions and conduct a surprise reshuffle very soon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about vision and empowerment.  When Fiji hosted the first 
<br/>Super Rugby Game between Chiefs and Crusaders in 2016, it not only boosted our economic activity 
<br/>and income, but it also inspired the ambitions of our younger </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> generation both, boys and girls. 
<br/>Today, we have the </span><span>Fijian Drua</span><span>, today we have the </span><span>Fijiana Drua</span><span>, and I congratulate the Fijian Drua 
<br/>for their defeat over Crusaders last week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sport or rugby runs in the blood of every indigenous and every Fijian Mr. Speaker, Sir, and 
<br/>the  </span><span>Fijian  Drua</span><span>  and  the  </span><span>Fijiana  Drua</span><span>  are  platforms  that  will  inspire  and  empower  our  younger 
<br/>generation, this is called empowerment.  This was the vision of the FijiFirst Government under the 
<br/>former Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama.  And the day is not far where Fiji will win the Rugby 
<br/>World Cup.  Success is small steps taken consistently and that day is not far.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prasad, this is what you call a vision, because I have seen the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>of 
<br/>the last eight years and I have seen that he always said that we did not have a vision.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the same vision for a career and sports and to empower our younger generations, FijiFirst had 
<br/>the  same  vision  with  hosting  regional  and  international  games  boosting  economic  activity  and 
<br/>inspiring the younger generations for a career in sports with the Lautoka Swimming Pool project.  
<br/>There has been delays but the Coalition Government has allocated a budget to complete the Lautoka 
<br/>Swimming Pool project and the nation and majority of the youth await the completion of this project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  my  final  words,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  all  the  newly  appointed 
<br/>Prefects in our primary and secondary schools, and I wish you the very best with the responsibility 
<br/>bestowed upon you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My fellow youths, we stand at a very pivotal moment in history today.  Despite the challenges 
<br/>we face, I am filled with hope and optimism because I believe in the boundless potential of our youth.  
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister, I urge you to consider the concerns and voices of our youth because the 
<br/>decisions  you  make  today  will  shape  the  world  our  youth  will  inherit  tomorrow.    The  question  I 
<br/>would like the younger generation to ask themselves is not what the country can do for me but what 
<br/>I can do for my beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, I wish everyone a prosperous 2024.  May God bless us all with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>good health and prosperity.  May God bless our beloved nation, Fiji.  </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for lunch as I 
<br/>have another meeting, especially for what honourable Sharma has just highlighted.  We need to be 
<br/>having a briefing with the group that will be going to Geneva next week because we are members of 
<br/>the Inter-Parliamentary Unit (IPU) and we need to be presenting and receiving some responsibilities 
<br/>as well in the process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament is now adjourned for lunch. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.38 p.m.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>259 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.14 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and our viewers tuning in 
<br/>today from the comfort of their homes and those who are seated at the gallery, ladies and gentlemen; 
<br/></span><span>ni sa bula vina’a</span><span> and  very good afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to give my response to His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame 
<br/>Maivalili Katonivere’s most gracious Address in the opening of the 2024 Parliament Session.  At the 
<br/>outset, Sir, I wish to thank His Excellency for his Address which is the pinnacle of the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s approach for the year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, His Excellency has raised plans for the Government and also raised some issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and in particular, the one that encapsulates the essence of the whole Address, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As leaders, we are required to leave a side our differences for the common good 
<br/>of our people.  We must focus on our shared destiny and commonality rather than our 
<br/>small differences”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as rightly highlighted by His Excellency, unprincipled politicians still continue 
<br/>to initiate mistrust for their own political mileage and this will be a huge curtain in our endeavour to 
<br/>move Fiji forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I now turn my attention to the sentiments alluded to by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Home Affairs and Immigration on the role played by our Law Enforcement – the Police Officers, 
<br/>the Royal Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) and the Department of Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  outset,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  must  acknowledge  the  collaborative  efforts  that  the 
<br/>hardworking men and women in the RFMF and Police do in preserving the safety, stability, security, 
<br/>defense and general wellbeing of all Fijians. Safety and security are paramount for Fiji and it must 
<br/>be taken in as a collective approach by everyone in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, His Excellency has also raised the issue surrounding drugs.  For the past few 
<br/>days, this has been one of the major issues heard inside Parliament. The sudden surge in drugs in Fiji 
<br/>is now a national issue and a very concerning one.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Sir, it is saddening that it has now being politicized for political gain. The issue of 
<br/>surge in drugs in Fiji, as the honourable Minister Tikoduadua rightfully said, has been an inherited 
<br/>one from the laxity of the previous Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  this  has  been  the  wilful 
<br/></span><span>neglect of the FijiFirst Government and as honourable Tubuna has rightfully stated this yesterday 
<br/>that in August 2019, an olive  branch was extended to the Government of the day by the Opposition 
<br/>when they moved a motion inside this august Parliament for a Committee to be set up to investigate 
<br/>the drug problem.  Alarmingly, the FijiFirst Government then opposed the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU. Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>260 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- If this had been set up then, this could have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been resolved by now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  drug  problem  has 
<br/>been scrutinized by Opposition Members, however, they failed to even acknowledge the sacrifices 
<br/>made by men and women who go out on these raids, day and night, who go and board ships.  They 
<br/>even failed to acknowledge those men and women, yet we are called leaders elected by the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the fight against drugs is not only an international or national issue. In fact, 
<br/>it has been a contemporary security issue discussed on various multilateral platforms in the regional 
<br/>and national level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  instead  of  working  together  to  address  this  issue  we,  the  leaders,  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>focusing on the alleged laxity of our law enforcement which is very embarrassing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  echo  honourable  Aliki  Bia’s  sentiments  in  this  august 
<br/>Parliament by stating,  if not  us, then who? If not  now, then when?   It  is  our time to  address  this 
<br/>critical issue together which requires our collaboration and work towards a drug free Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  now  turn  to  address  some  of  the  reforms  and  achievements  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Department of Immigration which will enhance the work of the Department to deliver efficiency.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I wish to inform Parliament that the Immigration Department is in its final stages of 
<br/>relocating to the Lala Ramdin Building at 40 Robertson Road, Suva.  They will provide immigration 
<br/>services from Monday next week, 18</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  This is a big achievement for the Department 
<br/>as the former building had not been OHS compliant since 2021.  The welfare of the staff and the 
<br/>public  as  a  whole  is  important  and  with  the  new  building,  all  these  will  be  achieved.    I  wish  to 
<br/>acknowledge the assistance of the RFMF, the Fiji Navy, Fiji Police Force, Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>and the Public Works Department in the relocation exercise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Cabinet approval, Immigration Laws and Regulations will be 
<br/>reviewed  with  a  focus  on  the  importance  of  security.    The  national  security  theme  areas  will  be 
<br/>covered and proper security assessment and implementation will be ensured for operational activities 
<br/>to meet its objective.  Another focus area of the review of the Immigration Laws will be a focus on 
<br/></span><span>efficiency and deliverance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has also constructed an intelligence structure to disseminate 
<br/>security assessments and provide useful intelligence information to address both, traditional and non-
<br/>traditional threats,  along with strengthening border enforcement and policy framework.  This had 
<br/>spearheaded the development of a 5-Year Strategic Plan for the Immigration Department to support 
<br/>the objective on preserving security integrity and national security. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the development of Fiji’s Foreign Policy will re-evaluate our international 
<br/></span><span>co-operation  and  engagements,  prioritising  border  security  and  protection,  and  exploring  best 
<br/></span><span>security measures at our borders.  The basis of the security pillar is to use effective mechanism to 
<br/>address emerging migratory patterns and monitor movement of illegal migrants and illicit activities.  
<br/>This will form the core rules of our engagement with our development partners through co-operation 
<br/>and discussion aimed at strengthening our bilateral and international agreements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the Department’s mission is to facilitate a seamless accommodation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>261 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>process for inbound and outbound travellers, at the same time, maintaining the rule of law, upholding 
<br/>integrity  and provide  a  balance of security.  This has been implemented by coordinating security 
<br/>assessments to validate any foreign status and to maintain territorial border protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to achieve the right balance between security and facilitation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>are presently establishing an automated system and digitizing the immigration route procedure.  The 
<br/>various migrations pathway will be upgraded through the introduction of a Document Management 
<br/>System  and  Passenger  Information  System.    This  is  very  important  because  we  need  advanced 
<br/>information on the people who are coming into our country.  This will provide essential information 
<br/>to security apparatus and enabled agencies and clients to experience the efficiency of service.   Sir, 
<br/>this is the way forward given that we are in the digital age.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Cabinet’s  decision  to  outsource  Immigration  Administrative  Services  is 
<br/>certainly  a  breakthrough  and  a  turning  point  for  the  Coalition  Administration.    The  outsource 
<br/>initiative for the Government will allow efficient delivery of immigration service that are required 
<br/>on a worldwide scale with the convenience of access to our Fijian diaspora around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot has been said about the migration and the brain-drain that has touched 
<br/>our country.  Interestingly, the Opposition has painted the narrative that people are fleeing because 
<br/>of the change of Government.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to provide some numbers to provide 
<br/>some clarity for the viewers, the people and of course, for Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2016 the total number of people who left our shores was 5,949; in 2017 
<br/>the total number of people who left our shores was 4,765; in 2018 the total number of people who 
<br/>left our shores was 4,944; in 2019 the total number of people that left our shores was 5,365; in 2020 
<br/>the total  number of people of people who left  our shores was 1,016, in  2021 the total  number of 
<br/>people who left our shores was 1,193; and the largest number by far, in 2022 the total number of 
<br/>people who left our shores was 5,335 and in 2023, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was only 3,207. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- The largest brain drain that has happened in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country was by their administration, Mr. Speaker. These are the facts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- A lot has been said about the brain drain.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>figures do not lie, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I hope that gives some clarity to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank, in particular, those border law enforcement officers.  As I already alluded to, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of these border law enforcement officers have to go out at night or day and 
<br/>jump in ships and do searchers, passport checks given the rise in drugs, in some places bullets are 
<br/>being found, the safety of their lives are at risk.  I wish to acknowledge them, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In 
<br/>the Immigration Department, a lot of these are women who are boarding ships and I acknowledge 
<br/>the women and the staff of the Immigration Department and Customs who all go out and protect our 
<br/></span><span>borders while we are at the comfort of our homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  acknowledge  the  Fiji  Police  Force  for  the  big  work  that  they  are  doing  in 
<br/>fighting drugs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That is one of the major things that we have to look at and we 
<br/>acknowledge that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to remind Parliament, let us demonstrate to the world 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that even in the midst of our disagreement, we are united and commitment to the common good.  I 
<br/>urge each and everyone of you to embrace this spirit of cooperation and collaboration. Let us work 
<br/>together, let us cross party lines to build a brighter future to our nation and its citizens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  few  words,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency’s Address and I fully support the motion that is before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just for clarity, the women boarding the ships. What are these? For clarity 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because I do not know what you were referring to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, it is Customs and Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Customs and Immigration? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, it is a lot of clearer now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.-  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members  of  Parliament,  families  and  friends  who  are  joining  us  here  at  the  gallery  and  who  are 
<br/>watching this livestream. </span><span>Vina na cola</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Scripture says in 2 Corinthians 9:15 and I quote: “Thanks be unto God 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for his unspeakable gift.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  unspeakable  gift  in  that  heaven  was  emptied  when  Christ  came  to  live 
<br/>among men, to die on the cross for our sins and his glorious resurrection on Sunday morning is a 
<br/>subject worth contemplating for eternity. I thank God for through Jesus for the life I am able to enjoy 
<br/>this far and for the humble duties that I am privileged to enjoy, and to serve this country in this way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must thank His Excellency the President for his elaborate Address to this 
<br/>august Parliament and the whole of Fiji while Opening the 2024 Session of Parliament, particularly, 
<br/>in his concern and promotion of racial harmony, unity in diversity.  That is what is needed now to 
<br/>spearhead  development  plans  that  are  undertaken  by  public  and  private  sectors  as  shown  by  the 
<br/>resilience of all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I go any further, I wish to remind both sides of Parliament that as 
<br/>honourable Members, we are here for only one purpose and that one main purpose is to be the voice 
<br/>of our people.  People look up to us as leaders, leaders who must uphold the Constitution and the rule 
<br/>of law; Leaders who are here not for personal interest and gain; Leaders who are here and not acting 
<br/>as recruitment agencies for their families and friends; Leaders who are here and not to abuse their 
<br/>powers vested upon them. Leaders who are here not to further their interest of only one religious or 
<br/>social group.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think it is only proper to thank the Coalition Government after one year 
<br/></span><span>of operation of the three projects that have been started. Paramount to the people of Navosa, was 
<br/>what the honourable Prime Minister and his supportive government entourage visit to Keiyasi on 15</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>February, 2024, for the groundbreaking ceremony and phase 1 of the Keiyasi Satellite Town Project.  
<br/>This project was in its planning stage in 2019 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the globe. It is one 
<br/>of the four growth centres in Fiji.  As part of the Ministry of Local Government, Urban Planning and 
<br/>Management programme, it is earmarked as a town.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since Navosa is the major supplier of many agricultural products and the 
<br/>biggest supply of meat industry, we hope that the tarsealing of the Sigatoka Valley Road from Narata 
<br/>to  Keiyasi  will  be  undertaken  soon.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  plead  with  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister that the Savusavu-Buca Bay Highway be tarsealed from Bagasau to Napuka. The Valley 
<br/>Road like the Savusavu-Buca Bay Road seems to be forgotten. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  whatever  the  reason,  the  Government  of  the  day  has  an  obligation  to 
<br/>complete these roads for fairness sake both, economically and for community health and wellbeing. 
<br/>In view of what the Government of the day tries to do in the area, one wonders how the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance can take exceptions to air his personal negative view about the area. I hope it is 
<br/>not a contradiction that will eat away the trust and solidarity of the Government of the day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again the recent </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> report on Monday, 10th March, 2024, the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development  and  Statistics  sadly  and  unashamedly  continued  to  spew  out  his  poisonous  and 
<br/>damaging  venom  about  the  Subdivisional  Hospital  at  Keiyasi,  Navosa,    blaming  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government’s conflict of interest in awarding the contract to Chand’s Engineering Consultant and 
<br/>the allegations about the Construction Implementation Unit.  So what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  no  amount  of  complain  and  jealousy  for  the  FijiFirst  achievements  will 
<br/>change the reality that the hospital is in Navosa until the end of time. The worst part is to continue to 
<br/>argue that the hospital is misplaced and to repeat the content of the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> article, the honourable 
<br/>Minister said, and I quote, “…that the population in Keiyasi is not that many. An ambulance could 
<br/>have been put there, that could save millions of dollars.” This is a perfect observation of a technocrat 
<br/>who is there to save money at the expense of real development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think there is general misconception about the area and the population the 
<br/>subdivisional hospital serves. The honourable Minister keeps on talking about Keiyasi population. 
<br/>For his information Mr. Speaker, Sir, Navosa is a province of its own, formerly known as Colo West, 
<br/>one of the provinces of Vitil Lvu which was abolished in 1945, whereby most of Colo West or Navosa 
<br/>was added to the coastal province of Nadroga. The 2017 census revealed this: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Population 
<br/>Navosa  
<br/>Magodro (Part of Ba Province) 
<br/></span><span>Total  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9,536 
<br/>4,806 
<br/></span><span>14,342 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Keiyasi Hospital currently serves the people of Navosa and the public, 
<br/>not a particular individual or group but the general public, who are now benefiting from easy access 
<br/>to medical services.  Unlike organisations and institutions, such as Global Girmit and Polytech that 
<br/>appeared from nowhere, have now become beneficiaries of the Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I take this opportunity to thank the Vatubalavu Village 
<br/>Adventist Women’s Group who recently supplied vegetables to the Navosa Hospital health workers, 
<br/>the Salaiba Church members who planted vegetables and cash crops at the Navosa Hospital farm and 
<br/></span><span>not forgetting the Sigatoka Central Adventist Youth for clearing the debris under the Sigatoka Old 
<br/></span><span>Bridge as part of their community outreach programme, leading up to the Adventist Global Youth 
<br/>Day which will be celebrated worldwide on 16</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  choosing  the  subject  to  speak  on  from  His  Excellency  the  President’s 
<br/>Address on the Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament is tough. Even though there was not much 
<br/>on the development of youth and sports, however, His Excellency spoke on matters that are important 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and relevant and that will enhance the livelihood of our children and youths.  Notably, His Excellency 
<br/>spoke and emphasised on racial harmony, financial literacy, climate change, et cetera.  I have decided 
<br/>to speak on two topics that I personally feel is of grave importance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have chosen this topic on education because of my concern of the high 
<br/>dropout rate of our education system and the diminishing laws of respect of children to parents and 
<br/>adults.  If the home is the child’s first school fails to train the child, then the second line of defence 
<br/>is the school to deal with a child’s readiness, interest, attitudes and abilities rather than focusing on 
<br/>standardising  children’s  performance  through  tests  and  examination.    Some  years  ago,  a  regional 
<br/>education symposium in the Solomon Islands titled, “Education for What?”  What is the purpose of 
<br/>our education system?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in His Excellency’s Presidential Address at the Opening of the 2024 Session 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Parliament, he alluded to, I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>   “The  formulation  of  the  new  Sector  Strategic  Plan  for  the  next  10  years  is 
<br/>aligned to the needs of the labour market and will also address … a holistic review of 
<br/>our education system, so that it adequately aligned to our needs.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is true that the labour market needs must be met, but not at the expense of 
<br/>the individual development in creativity and character building. This current system of education, as 
<br/>His Excellency the President rightfully asserted, its priority is applying the needs of the labour market 
<br/>or what is commonly called “factory model”.  David Elkind in his book </span><span>“The Hurried Child”</span><span> said, I 
<br/>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“We  have  a  lot  of  failure  in  our  present  system  of  education  because  we  have 
<br/>borrowed  the  factory  model  of  education,  which  pays  little  attention  to  individual 
<br/>differences in mental abilities, learning roles and learning style.  Children are pressed to 
<br/>meet  uniform  standard  as  measured  by  standardised  tests  and  examinations.    Those 
<br/>children  who  cannot  keep  up  in  these  system  as  indicated  by  examination,  are  often 
<br/>regarded as defective vessels and labelled as learning disable.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he further added, and I quote:” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Schools have become increasingly industrialised and product oriented, teachers 
<br/>are unionised, textbooks are standardised on national level and examination has become 
<br/></span><span>mechanised.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Dorn Fromberg, Director of Early Childhood added, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Children discover very quickly that passing tests or examinations rather than 
<br/>meaningful learning is what school is all about. There is no evidence that standardised 
<br/>test makes a difference in learning who is benefiting. Not the communities but large 
<br/>corporation and publishing companies.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to appeal to the powers that be in our education system that 
<br/>meaningful learning to replace the artificial standardised examination and paying little attention to 
<br/>individual differences.  In the book </span><span>Education</span><span>, says and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As the student sacrifices the power to reason and judge for himself, he becomes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>incapable of discriminating between the truth and error and falls an easy prey to and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>265 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is eagerly led to follow tradition and custom.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a distinguish Educationist writing at late 1960 and early 1970s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stated, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Fiji is the most examined country in the whole world, Fiji Intermediate Exam 
<br/>at  the  end  of  Class  6,  Fiji  Secondary  Entrance  after  Class  8,  Fiji  Junior  Certificate 
<br/>Examination at the end of Form 4 and Senior Cambridge at the end of Form 6.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  not  educating  children  through  their  natural  learning  styles  but 
<br/>preparing them as a standardised outcome or product at the end of a factory processing programme. 
<br/>Our primary focus should be character building and responsible citizens should be the aim of our 
<br/>education system instead of supplying material for an expected product at the end of a processing 
<br/>plant.  Instead of being interested in the Intelligence Quotient (IQ), let us be more concerned with 
<br/>Emotional Quotient (EQ).  No wonder in the iTLTB recent report, one of these dailies said that 75 
<br/>percent of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are below the poverty line.  There are more </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>begging on streets, more 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> are criminals and consequently more </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>are drug users.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  whole  scenario  is  not  bright,  perhaps  a  radical  shift  of  our  school 
<br/>curriculum and education priorities may help particularly from being a standardised product of the 
<br/>factory model to education based on character building and recognition of individual differences.   I 
<br/>hope that the present dilemma and period of uncertainty in the Ministry of Education may provide 
<br/>an appropriate environment to enhance this very important education reform of lessening the impact 
<br/>of standardising the children’s performance through tests and exams.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, when we were very young, our parents taught us and expected us to recite by 
<br/>memory some of these quotations from the education’s classic every morning before our devotion.  
<br/>That kind of wrapping up the holistic education approach, I am trying to explain.  The American 
<br/>writer Ellen G. White wrote, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Our ideas of education take too narrow and too low a range. There is a need of a 
<br/>broader scope, a higher aim. True education means more than the pursual of a certain 
<br/>course of study.  It means more than a preparation for the life that now is. It has to do 
<br/>with the whole being, and with the whole period of existence possible to man.  It is the 
<br/>harmonious  development  of  the  physical,  the  mental,  and  the  spiritual  powers.    It 
<br/>prepares the student for the joy of service in this world and for the higher joy of wider 
<br/></span><span>service in the world to come.”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  all  is  said  and  done,  I  would  like  this  august  Parliament  and  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education to focus more on home schooling rather than the system of education saturated 
<br/>examination, standardised tests, standardised test books and standardised teacher union as the rest of 
<br/>the education agenda could be looked after very well by the artificial intelligence.  Therefore, our 
<br/>school for the future should focus more on creative thinking and character building as suggested by 
<br/>the following quotations:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “The greatest want of the world is the want of men.  Men who will not be bought or 
<br/></span><span>sold, men who in their inmost soul are true and honest.  Men who do not fear to call sin 
<br/>by it is right name, men whose conscience, is as true to duty at the needle to the pole.  
<br/>Men who will stand for the right though the heavens fall.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving on to the Great Council of Chiefs, while the emphasis is always on 
<br/>the British Divide and Rule Policy, we hardly mentioned the real injustice and problem was over 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="45">Page 45</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Protection and Protectionism Policy.  When there was a big economic project to be undertaken, the 
<br/>natives  from  the  Indian  subcontinent  were  virtually  scarified  at  the  expense  of  the  natives 
<br/>Protectionism  Policy.    While  hell  was  raging  and  let  loose  in  the  sugarcane  farms  engulfing  the 
<br/>natives  from  the  Indian  subcontinent,  the natives of Vitia (Fijian) were given special privilege to 
<br/>protect their tradition, folklore and way of life in their villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, after exactly 108 years and seeing the Indians had no stopping economically, 
<br/>the first political upheaval was conducted very clearly in the guise of protecting indigenous interests 
<br/>from  Indian  dominance  and  possible  takeover.  The  Indigenous  Protectionism  Policy  was  not 
<br/>working, participation in the mere hard work and self-discipline is the way to go for the </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>who 
<br/>had  to  choose  either  to  live  a  comfortable  economic  lifestyle  or  be  satisfied  with  preservation  of 
<br/>traditional and way of life.  Now 37 years later, we are reviving the Council of Chief to continue the 
<br/>British Colonial legacy of protectionism.  The mindset of the  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>must change, and that they 
<br/>must accept the fact that their non-performance in business is caused by dependency mode and lack 
<br/>of self-discipline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, we are told that 75 percent  of</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> live below poverty line. 
<br/>There are more </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> begging in the streets, criminals and drug users than any other ethnicity in 
<br/>this country. The Suva Bus Stand is home to more</span><span> iTaukei</span><span> than any other ethnic group. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me repeat something I said some time ago. I think we are struggling as 
<br/>a race not because of the migrant race, but because we continue to cling to old ideas and myths. We 
<br/>want things to be the way they were. Old ideas are our biggest liability. They are liabilities because 
<br/>we fail to realize that ideas or way of doing things were as at yesterday, but yesterday is gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to think beyond ethnicity. Ethnic politics has no place in modern 
<br/>state for it creates division and economic chaos. If our mindset and attitude do not change, then let 
<br/>us prepare for the worse scenario and political humiliation in the years to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Council of Chiefs is not serious about understanding and resolving</span><span>
<br/>iTaukei’s</span><span> challenges and myths confronting us, the threat of a major structural erosion of one of the 
<br/>world’s finest and most colourful cultures become a real possibility.

<div><span>[Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to His Excellency the 
<br/>President, Ratu  Viliame Maivalili  Katonivere, for the fatherly  words of counsel  and his 
<br/>impactful  message  marking  the  beginning  of  another  Parliament  calendar  year.    It  was, 
<br/>indeed, a Speech that promoted unity and progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From His Excellency’s  Speech,  we have learned that in  maintaining  our  focus on 
<br/>good  governance  and  wellbeing  of  the  iTaukei,  we  must  promote  peace  and  harmony 
<br/>among all Fijians as its core value.] 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I wish to respond to an earlier question that was raised by 
<br/>honourable Kirpal on the consultations by the iTaukei Land Trust Board (iTLTB) on the conversion 
<br/>of Crown land to </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the honourable Members’ information, the objective of the inquiry is to determine if the 
<br/>claims received from the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowning units are valid and deserve to be processed, in line with 
<br/>the provisions of section 18 of the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 and section 8 of the State Lands Act 
<br/>1945.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 18 of the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “If the Minister is satisfied that the land belonging to any mataqali is insufficient 
<br/>for the use, maintenance or support of its members it shall be lawful for the Minister by 
<br/>proclamation to set aside such State land, or land acquired for or on behalf of iTaukei 
<br/>by purchase, as in his or her opinion may be required for the use, maintenance or support 
<br/>of such mataqali.  Any area so set aside shall be deemed to be an iTaukei reserve.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, section 8 of the State Lands Act 1945 states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When any iTaukei land which has been acquired by the State for public purposes 
<br/>under the provisions of the State Acquisitions of Lands Act 1940 or any other written 
<br/>law  is  no  longer  required  for  such  purposes,  the  Minister,  after  consultation  with 
<br/>Cabinet, may, by order, declare such land to be iTaukei land and such declaration shall 
<br/>be recorded in the name of the unit from which it was acquired in the Register of iTaukei 
<br/>Lands kept under the provisions of section 8 of the iTaukei Lands Act 1905.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the above provisions of the two Acts have clearly set out the objectives of 
<br/></span><span>the  consultations.  Under  the  iTaukei  Land  (iTaukei  Reserves)  Regulations  1940,  the  Reserve 
<br/></span><span>Commissioner is  appointed under the said  Regulations by the Minister to undertake the inquiries 
<br/>mentioned  above.    Further,  under  Regulation  10  of  the  said  Regulations,  the  Commissioner  is 
<br/>required to provide the report of the Commissioner to the Board. Once the Board endorses the Report, 
<br/>it is referred to the Ministry of Lands</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the iTLTB was carrying out these inquiries until 2006, as cases referred to 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Lands  were  stalled  due  to  the  change  in  Government.    Despite  that,  the  iTLTB 
<br/>continued to receive requests from landowning units with insufficient land. However, in 2011, the 
<br/></span><span>Government issued a directive that such claims could no longer be entertained.  Sir, this ended any 
<br/></span><span>hope that the landowning units had.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under this Government, the iTLTB, using its provision as set out earlier, re-
<br/>visited all those received claims since 2006. There was no ulterior motive about these consultations. 
<br/>For honourable Kirpal’s information, I was fully aware of the consultations, and I am satisfied that 
<br/>these were within the bounds of the law.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency, in his Opening Address, had implored in this august Parliament that we are 
<br/>to listen to the voices of the people.  In the last 13 years, the landowning units had been denied their 
<br/>right to be heard on these matters.  We will hear their views and extend to them natural justice.  We 
<br/>cannot love justice and ignore prejudice.  The right is not from the Coalition Government generosity 
<br/>but from the hand of God.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  may  I,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  offer  our  firm  assurance  and 
<br/>commitment to all the communities in Fiji that we will listen and consult with all the stakeholders 
<br/>throughout the process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I quickly respond to honourable Bulitavu’s statement on the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>legislation.    The  review  of  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Act  1944  and  the  iTaukei  Lands  Act  1905  are 
<br/>budgetted in the current financial year. These Acts and the institutions under them had to await the 
<br/>re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) but will be completed before the end of this 
<br/>financial year.  The review of the iTaukei Land Trust Act 1940 and the iTaukei Trust Fund Act 2004 
<br/>will be completed before the end of 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now continue with my response in the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> language.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Mr. Speaker, less than three months ago, the GCC was legally re-established.  The 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  confirmed  Government’s  policy  stance  on  the  GCC.  In  his 
<br/>opening speech, the honourable Prime Minister mentioned the importance of GGC to listen 
<br/>and protect the people of all races in Fiji, in order for peace and prosperity to exist in Fiji. 
<br/>However, that will only be meaningful if iTaukei unique cultural heritage is protected and 
<br/>respected, and historical errors and past injustices are acknowledged - a stark reality that is 
<br/>painfully clear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  Ministry  is  determined  to  work  towards  rectifying  these  through  specific 
<br/>protection mechanisms.  May I add at this point that a new Chair</span><span>man of</span><span> the GCC ha</span><span>s</span><span> been 
<br/>appointed</span><span>, who will then look at the plans brought up by the GCC Review Team</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to foster social cohesion, we must improve the economic position of 
<br/>the iTaukei.  In my visits to the Provinces last year, I saw the unwavering determination to 
<br/>embrace  opportunities  in  leadership,  education,  entrepreneurship,  resource  and  village 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To realise this, my Ministry is undertaking the following initiatives and programmes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that embrace iTaukei concepts:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Economic empowerment of the iTaukei is crucial to national development.   
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Through the Solesolevaki Framework, the iTaukei institutions are taking significant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>steps to assist the iTaukei.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The iTLTB has established four new programmes to assist landowning units in their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei Land Development Fund;  
<br/>iTaukei Wealth Fund;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Landowners Eco-Tourism Projects; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Land Services and Land Development Unit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker,</span><span> we have also re-instated the allocation for the </span><span>Turaga iTaukei</span><span>, </span><span>Turaga Ni 
<br/>Yavusa</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>nd </span><span>Turaga Ni Mataqali</span><span>.</span><span>  They play a very important role within the </span><span>Vanua</span><span>, </span><span>the Church</span><span>
<br/></span><span>a</span><span>nd </span><span>t</span><span>he Government.</span><span>  They are the frontline for </span><span>Vanua</span><span> </span><span>leadership, counselling and in the carrying 
<br/>out  of  traditional  roles.    It  is,  therefore,  important  that  they  be  supported  in  the  effective 
<br/>implementation of their roles.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker</span><span>,  t</span><span>he  iTaukei  Trust  Fund  </span><span>is  assisting  selected  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>entrepreneurs  and 
<br/>businesses with business training, to make them investment-ready and enable them to apply for 
<br/>financial assistance andloans with financial institutions and banks.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>Fijian  Holdings  Limited  </span><span>has  also  opened  a  facility  to  invest  alongside 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowning unit companies so they can convert their resources into economic productivity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker</span><span>, </span><span>Government </span><span>has also assisted with the financing of a feasibility study in the 
<br/></span><span>MSME</span><span> </span><span>and  resource-based  sector  financing</span><span>.    </span><span>That  will  allow</span><span>  Merchant  Finance  Limited  </span><span>to 
<br/>explore financing products in land development and resource-based lending</span><span>.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker</span><span>,  last  year,  we  started  the  </span><span>iTaukei  Resource  Owners  Forum  </span><span>to  better 
<br/>understand the current impediments to the development of their resources.  This helped in mapping 
<br/>out approaches to expedite their participation in national economy.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker</span><span>, m</span><span>y Ministry</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in consultation with the </span><span>Ministry </span><span>o</span><span>f Agricultur</span><span>e</span><span> </span><span>and some 
<br/>private companies, in the development of a casava starch processing plant in </span><span>Fiji.</span><span> </span><span>If </span><span>successful, 
<br/>this project will be a major income earner for cassava growers in </span><span>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker</span><span>, m</span><span>y Ministry </span><span>has been in close discussion with the </span><span>Fiji Development Bank 
<br/></span><span>for the financial support for provincial companies and the result has been positive</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Our </span><span>vision is 
<br/>to be able to uplift the contribution of the</span><span> iTaukei </span><span>in the overall economy of our nation.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker</span><span>,  t</span><span>he  Centre  For  Appropriate  Technology  &amp;  Development</span><span>  (CATD)  in</span><span>
<br/>Nadave </span><span>has transitioned to </span><span>Green </span><span>TVET</span><span>. This </span><span>is a curriculum framework that covers agriculture, 
<br/>manufacturing, building, transport, and renewable energy.  </span><span>The </span><span>CATD</span><span> </span><span>is also working closely with 
<br/></span><span>Australian Pacific Training Coalition </span><span>(APTC) in the implementation of its training programmes.  
<br/></span><span>Please</span><span>,</span><span>  allow  me  to  extend  our  deep  appreciation  to  the  Government  of  Japan  for  their 
<br/>funding of a new classroom and students</span><span>’</span><span> dormitory. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  have  expanded  the  services  provided  by  the  Survey  Unit  of  the 
<br/>Native  Lands  and  Fisheries  Commission  to  be  able  to  carry  out  any  land  survey  for 
<br/>landowning units who wish to develop their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  iTaukei  Land  Development  Grant  for  the  landowning  units  will 
<br/>continue this year.   We are currently analyzing the initial agreements, to ensure that sale 
<br/>price of subdivision lots will be beneficial to the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  year,  we  will  also  implement  a  National  Action  Plan  that  will 
<br/>localise  the  UNDRIP  Convention.    This  will  result  in  the  amendment  of  relevant 
<br/>legislations.  My  Ministry  will  consult  widely  with  relevant  stakeholders  with  a  view  to 
<br/>harmonizing it with their respective mandates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Ministry  will  work  on  strengthening  Vanua  governance  and 
<br/>leadership this year.  The Vanua leadership is at a very challenging crossroad, where we 
<br/>must adhere to the counsel of Prophet Jeremiah, who said, and I quote; “Ask for the ancient 
<br/>path, ask where the good way is, and walk in it.”  This principle has now provided useful 
<br/></span><span>guidance which prompted the GCC at its recent meeting to adopt a structured bottoms-up 
<br/></span><span>approach to addressing leadership and governance of the iTaukei. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  </span><span>will  revisit  past  successful  programmes  that  nurtured  leaders  through  our  formal 
<br/>education system in collaboration with the </span><span>Ministry of Education.  This will be complemented 
<br/>by  the  informal  (</span><span>Vanua</span><span>)  learning  approach.    Also,  a  proposed  provincial  based  cadet 
<br/>programme  will be undertaken in  partnership with the Republic of Fiji  Military Forces.  
<br/>This approach will complement existing programmes, such as </span><span>Na Vuli Ni Sausauvou</span><span> (for 
<br/>future traditional leaders) and </span><span>Vuli Ni Sauvaki Ni Vanua</span><span> (for other traditional roles). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  we  are  also  working  on  strengthening  our  village  governance  and 
<br/></span><span>development.  This is to address the increasing criminal activities including the use of hard 
<br/>drugs in villages and the domestic violence against women and children.  My Ministry, 
<br/>with the endorsement of the Great Council Of Chiefs, will resubmit the village bylaws to 
<br/></span><span>Cabinet for consideration.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Village Improvement Scheme which was reintroduced in the current 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financial year covers three broad areas:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Village beautification. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Sanitation; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Maintenance of evacuation centres. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in December 2023, a GCC Delegation visited China to learn Chinese 
<br/>approach  to  poverty  elimination  at  the  provincial  level.  This  is  significant  as  it  showed 
<br/>China’s commitment to eliminating poverty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Delegation returned with  insights  from  the Chinese experience which will be 
<br/>emulated in Fiji.  With the endorsement of the GCC, we will pilot best practices from this 
<br/>visit in the Rewa Province, commencing this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, may I express our sincere appreciation to the Government of China for 
<br/>their  invitation  and  funding  for  this  trip.    Also,  I  would  extend  my  appreciation  to  the 
<br/></span><span>Vanua</span><span>, Provincial Offices, and all staff of the Ministry for their effort so far. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, the words spoken in this august Parliament reflect not 
<br/>just our collective aspirations as iTaukei but our unwavering commitment to the people of 
<br/>Fiji.  Let us move forward with unity, resilience, and a deep-seated belief in our nation's 
<br/>potential, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, seeking the guidance 
<br/>of our Almighty God.  I believe that is the pathway that will bring peace and prosperity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs will continue to improve its services so 
<br/>that we can leave a legacy of our efforts today that will be enjoyed by generations to come. 
<br/>Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament;  I rise today in support of the motion raised by the honourable Prime Minister and to 
<br/>offer  a  response  to  the  Opening  Address  of  His  Excellency  the  President,  as  a  matter  of  great 
<br/>significance to our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we convene in this august Chamber, we bear the weight of our collective responsibility to 
<br/></span><span>serve the interests of our citizens and uphold the principles of democracy and humanity.  We are 
<br/></span><span>reminded of our duty of care to the people of our beloved nation in ensuring the sovereignty, security 
<br/>and prosperity of our beloved Fiji Islands and her people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Representing  the  diverse  voices  and  aspirations  of  our  people  is,  indeed,  an  immense 
<br/>responsibility and one that we, as democratically elected representatives, must perform to the best of 
<br/>our abilities through the best use of our resources at hand and through continued collaboration in 
<br/>consultation with the people.  Only then can, we, as an island nation, will truly promote harmony of 
<br/>our people and embrace the beauty and the power of our diversity as an island nation, which  will 
<br/></span><span>then truly enable us to realise our full economic potential, alleviate poverty, especially the vulnerable 
<br/></span><span>of the vulnerable in the remote rural and maritime areas of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  coordinating  the  Whole  of  Government  approach  to  implementing 
<br/>Government’s national development priorities, particularly in the rural and maritime areas of Fiji, is 
<br/>obviously the way to ensure that development priorities are met, and Government investments are 
<br/>sustainable.  Investing in sustainable development is critical given the continued reality of the scarcity

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  the  already  limited  development  resources.  Our  people  must  be  given  room  to  cultivate 
<br/>environmentally  friendly,  climate-resilient,  sustainable  and  gender  and  socially 
<br/>inclusive 
<br/>development models that we as an island nation may then document to contribute to the sustainable 
<br/>development of the wider Blue Pacific region in line with the priorities and strategic objectives of 
<br/>the 2050 Blue Pacific Strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster  Management  assumed 
<br/>responsibility for leadership of the Fiji National Shelter Cluster in early 2023 and has been actively 
<br/>working to set the cluster on a firmer foundation for the future collective shelter activity and response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in His Opening Address, His Excellency rightly said that even though our 
<br/>contributions to global emissions is negligible, we like other countries in the Pacific, directly bear 
<br/>the full brunt of climate change on our coastlines, communities, livelihoods and security.  Therefore, 
<br/>inculcating  nature-based,  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  strategies  into  the  fabric  of 
<br/>implementation of our national development priorities in the rural  and maritime areas of Fiji will 
<br/>ensure that the human faces of the impacts of climate change are secured today and empowered to 
<br/>secure the future of their families and future generations as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to sectoral development, Fiji’s water sector faces challenges 
<br/>of the impacts of aging infrastructure and the lack of technically skilled personnel to deliver timely 
<br/>service of maintaining the current water and sewage services.  The foresight in the development of a 
<br/>2050 Water Sector Strategy is a timely one and one that improves water and sanitation services across 
<br/>urban,  rural  and  maritime  Fiji.    However,  this  water  sector  strategy  will  require  the  necessary 
<br/>financial  and technical support  from the Government, private sector and development partners to 
<br/>ensure effective implementation particularly in the rural and maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  regard,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  is  conducting  or  is  continuing  with  the 
<br/>implementation  of  access  to  clean  and  safe  water  for  our  vulnerable,  rural  and  maritime  citizens 
<br/>through the High Risk Water and Sanitation Progamme.  At the same time, we are engaging with 
<br/>potential partners on water management and conservation practices and for professional management 
<br/>of  wastewater  as  part  of  our  responsibility,  to  ensure  protection  of  our  already  vulnerable 
<br/>environment. The Government has already budgeted $500,000 under Head 50 for Sanitation Projects 
<br/>for villages and settlements in this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, aligning the Maritime Transport Act 2013 with international standard and 
<br/>promoting a safe and sustainable maritime sector is essential to ensuring the safety and security of 
<br/></span><span>the rural and maritime population who are heavily relying on maritime transportation for accessing 
<br/></span><span>essential services such as daily commuting to school, health services, access to financial services and 
<br/>other Government services that always require them to travel by boat with associated risks involved.  
<br/>The vast untapped economic potential of the maritime areas of Fiji is one to capitalise on and with 
<br/>the alignment of the Maritime Transport Act 2013 to international standards, the sector is set to attract 
<br/>even more global markets in the near future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  based  on  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  Census  2020,  54  percent  of  the 
<br/>farmland areas fall within traditional tenureship, of which are communally owned </span><span>mataqali, tokatoka, 
<br/></span><span>yavusa</span><span>, and </span><span>kovukovu</span><span> (reserve) land.  The above statistics also correlate with the high poverty rates 
<br/></span><span>noted with most subsistence farmers based on the 2019-2020 Poverty Report by the Fiji Bureau of 
<br/>Statistics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The above statistics indicate that we need to take action now in order to increase the utilisation 
<br/>of arable land in the rural areas, and fully realise the economic potential of the agricultural sector as 
<br/>well as its contribution to GDP, programmes to revitalise the rural and maritime agricultural sector 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>must be prioritised alongside a culture and principle of self-reliance and self-sufficiency.  This is one 
<br/>of  the  main  reasons  for  our  Ministry’s  revamped  Rural  and  Outer  Island  (ROI)  programme  to 
<br/>supplement and assist the Ministry of Agriculture in fast-tracking the improvement of agriculture 
<br/>productivity  and  production  in  the  rural  and  maritime  communities  through  sustainable 
<br/>mechanisation,  focusing  on  land  preparation  and  market  access.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  all 
<br/>Government agencies to contribute towards this great effort to improve production and productivity 
<br/>in the rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As already alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Minister for Rural 
<br/>and Maritime Development earlier this week on the importance of financial literacy in the rural areas, 
<br/>our Ministry is working closely with the Department of Co-operatives and the Ministry of Youth and 
<br/>Sports  on  the  establishment  of  more  financial  cooperatives  in  the  rural  areas.    This  Coalition 
<br/>Government is going to  make a significant mindset change towards a savings culture in the rural 
<br/>settings, and this would require an integrated effort from the Government, private sectors, religious 
<br/>bodies and donor agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also an immense potential for investment in the tourism sector in 
<br/>the rural and maritime areas of Fiji.  Despite its current contribution to our Gross Domestic Product 
<br/>(GDP), there is even more potential for investment in the rural areas, especially through ecotourism 
<br/>and  historical  sites  attraction.    We  need  to  work  together  through  proactive  sustainable  climate 
<br/>resilient  initiatives  to  ensure  sustainable  monetisation  of  those  resources  and  promote  economic 
<br/>empowerment of our rural population going forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Energy Policy 2023-2030 documents Government’s commitment to a resilient, 
<br/>cost effective and sustainable energy sector.  With the frequently rising and constantly fluctuating 
<br/>global prices of fossil fuels, it is imperative to invest in sustainable energy solutions and involve the 
<br/>young generation in the process.  This not only inbuilds a sense of ownership of their future, but also 
<br/>empowers  them  with  the  necessary  knowledge  and  skills  to  innovate  potential  future  renewable 
<br/>energy solutions that are climate resilient and environmentally friendly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s Rural Housing Assistance Programme will also play a pivotal 
<br/>role in growing the rural economy.  Given the significant demand for this programme, the Ministry 
<br/>is working within the guideline of the different housing schemes as approved by the Cabinet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of improving service delivery in the rural areas, for the first time, the Ministry has 
<br/>made available online through the Ministry’s website the approved engineering house plan to assist 
<br/></span><span>rural dwellers.  This will be one of the many designs that the Ministry is considered to provide more 
<br/></span><span>options for our rural dwellers in terms of improving their standard of living in the rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an issue at hand that demands our immediate attention and concerted action 
<br/>pertains to the recent surge in unemployment and poverty rates, a challenge that has cast a shadow 
<br/>of uncertainty over the livelihoods of countless individuals and families across our nation.  In the 
<br/>face of this adversity, it is imperative that we, as representatives of the people, demonstrate, resolve, 
<br/>compassion, and ingenuity in devising strategies to alleviate the plight of those affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In charting a course of action, we must adopt a multi-faceted approach that addresses both 
<br/></span><span>the  immediate  needs  of  the  unemployed  and  the  underlying  structural  issues  contributing  to  this 
<br/>phenomenon.  This necessitates a combination of short-term interventions and aimed at providing 
<br/>immediate  relief,  as  well  as  long-term  strategies  geared  toward  fostering  sustainable  economic 
<br/>growth and creating opportunities for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going forward Mr. Speaker, Sir, an integrated approach is needed in terms of reviewing or

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>formulation of our own unemployment benefits as part of overall safety nets during these challenging 
<br/>times.  Expansion of skills training and retraining is crucial to ensure our graduates meet the labour 
<br/>market demand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to impress upon one of the most striking features emphasised 
<br/>by  His  Excellency  the  President  while  delivering  his  keynote  Address  during  the  Opening  of 
<br/>Parliament on Monday 4th March, 2024 and I quote,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As democratically elected representatives, I ask that you listen to the voices of our 
<br/>people,  not  only  those  who  elected  you,  but  to  all  citizens,  young  and  old,  men  and 
<br/>women.  I urge you to faithfully embrace with resolve the principles of democracy and 
<br/>humanity as enshrined in our Constitution.  In doing so, we will continue to respect the 
<br/>integrity  and  dignity  of  our  Parliament.    We  must  acknowledge  and  recognise  our 
<br/>differences; however, we must be united with one common goal to ensure that we live in 
<br/>a progressive and prosperous nation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yet, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this fell on deaf ears by those on the other side of Parliament.  I was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>flabbergasted in the way the honourable… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laugher) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- …Members on the other side of Parliament boycotted the invitation by 
<br/>His  Excellency  the  President  to  attend  the  cocktail  he  hosted  at  the State House  on  Monday,  4th 
<br/>March, 2024 after the Opening of a new Session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is insubordination in the highest order.  Looking at the calibre of those 
<br/>in the driving seat on the other side of Parliament, I just cannot believe that such actions could have 
<br/>eventuated.  Honourable Members on the other side of Parliament must be living in another planet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.R.  VOCEA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  quote  from  Nelson  Mandela  who  was  being 
<br/>imprisoned in South Africa for 27 years for his protest on apartheid.  One might expect that he would 
<br/>hold at least a small grudge against those in authority when he was released.  But, as he eloquently 
<br/></span><span>said to himself, “As I walked out the door towards the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if 
<br/></span><span>I did not leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I would still be in prison.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  also  closely  following  up  on  the  social  media  postings  by  some 
<br/>Members on the other side of Parliament who do not have the audacity to state whatever they would 
<br/>like to express in here but use the social media platform to attack the Government on almost all of 
<br/>the policies it has implemented.  Not only that … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- That is my right! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.R.  VOCEA.-  …  one  honourable  Member  stooped  so  low  to  post  personal  and 
<br/>derogatory remarks against the leadership of this Government and some Cabinet Minister as well.  A 
<br/>classic example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the contradictory nature in which this honourable Member 
<br/>praised the initiative and the vision of the FijiFirst Party under the banner of a Yellow Ribbon project,

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a paradigm shift in the way society views rehabilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  </span><span>Facebook</span><span>  posting  was  done  on  6</span><span>th</span><span>  December,  2023,  yet  only  a  few  days  later  (27</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>December, 2023), he criticised a component of the Yellow Ribbon project, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“It is deeply concerning to witness the preferential treatment extended to Ratu Inoke 
<br/>Takiveikata  following  his  release  via  Presidential  Pardon.  Such  actions  by  the  Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service raise questions about  equality before the law.  While  all individuals 
<br/>should be treated impartially, this case highlights a disparity in the treatment of convicts.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL. Do not worry!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.    J.R.  VOCEA.-  The  honourable  Member  did  not  realise  that  all  those  who  were 
<br/>pardoned by His  Excellency the President were done according to  law. In addition,  they were all 
<br/>escorted to their respective villages and families by the Corrections officials as part of the Yellow 
<br/>Ribbon Programme.  The commentary by the honourable Member depicts a lack of political maturity 
<br/>and understanding of the Government system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same honourable Member, is very fond of posting 
<br/>malicious  and denigrating remarks about  Government including  one of the fabric of our   </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>
<br/>institution and that is the Great Council of Chiefs. I quote some of his postings which if allowed to 
<br/>continue will only stir ethnic emotions which was the hallmark of our very past darkest moments in 
<br/>our beloved Fiji.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am only remined by what my uncle and former politician who used to live

<div><span>“Politicians  should  be  like  wine.    The  older  the  wine  is,  the  tastier  it  becomes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to rise and contribute to today’s 
<br/>debate  on  the  motion  before  Parliament  which  is  to  thank  His  Excellency  for  his  most  Gracious 
<br/>Speech.  Before I commence, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister and esteemed  Members 
<br/>of Parliament, I just want to remind honourable Vocea of a particular provision in the Constitution. 
<br/>In this particular provision, honourable Assistant Minister, you all flouted before the Elections and 
<br/>you continue to do so, and that is the freedom of expression…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- In light of what is being said, honourable Attorney-General, we started

<br/>been.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>you, but do not argue, accept it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Don’t point!

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Now that I have raised the tone, Sir, I intend 
<br/></span><span>to raise it some more, but I will keep it within the confines of what the President’s Speech has said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Thank you.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Before I forget, Mr. Speaker, I have to correct something.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, my good colleague on the other side who happens to be the Chairman of my 
<br/>Committee, honourable Vakalalabure, I think there is a little bit of a disconnect between him and his 
<br/>Minister.  The figures that you published with respect to immigration, and I quote your honourable 
<br/>Minister in </span><span>FBC News</span><span> just a little while ago who stated that the departure records and I quote, “show 
<br/>that  between  January  and  August,  3,650  Fijians  left  for  education  and  training;  5,552  left  for 
<br/>employment; and 1,946 migrated.”  I think you need to correlate your figures better between you two 
<br/>and the Ministry and then come up with a right one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- We do not twist figures, honourable Minister of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point Of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What is your Point Of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 60 - Relevance.  He talked about 
<br/>the figures without saying what was wrong with those figures.  He did not compare what he said and 
<br/>what the honourable Minister said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is why he gets his math wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you, not merely as an opposing voice within this hallowed 
<br/>Chambers,  but  as  a  conduit  for  the  narratives  and  the  aspirations  of  our  cherished  people.    Our 
<br/>gathering here today is testament to the democratic pillars that began here some 150 years ago… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- …and I include the Legislative Chamber and that particular chair that 
<br/></span><span>you are sitting on, Sir, it was part of the Legislative Chamber.  We must pay homage to that and those 
<br/>principles that we have actually been utilising for the last 150 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those principles and pillars, we need to uphold when it comes to our society.  
<br/>We need to have a forum where diverse perspectives (and I am sure you all agree with that).  We can 
<br/>argue until we are blue in the face.  There is an old Shakespearean saying, Sir, it is part of Hamlet, 
<br/>“the lady doth protest too much”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  structure  my  speech  (as  I  have  said)  under  the  headings  of  His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency’s  Gracious  Speech.    I  am  talking  about  transparency,  shared  destiny,  respect  and 
<br/>recognising differences and sustainable growth, and also with respect to foreign affairs, et cetera.  I 
<br/>may touch a nerve here or two but I think everyone is very thick-skinned and they will understand it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things when we sit in this Chamber, Sir, is public trust.  We are all 
<br/>entrusted with a huge job, and it is public trust.  Unfortunately, in the last 14 months or so, the public

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trust in this Government has gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nonsense! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your evidence? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- How did you assess that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I hope I get a few minutes extra because of the interjections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I find it quite amusing, I think a lot of people do.  As a matter of fact, a lot 
<br/>of public do also, on how they have been making wild accusations about our side and we find it to 
<br/>be very amusing, considering what they are actually insinuating is, in reality, what they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mismatch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- You must remember, this side of Parliament is a political party, you are 
<br/>three.  This side of Parliament is a political party, and that political party was in governance for eight 
<br/>years, not 16 years, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Obviously,  he  cannot  do  the  math  either.    The  FijiFirst  Party  was  in 
<br/>governance  for  eight  years.    And  some  of  us  here  under  the  appointment  of  His  Excellency  the 
<br/>President then, were part of an Interim Government, tasked with setting the foundation of our modern 
<br/>and once very prosperous Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me remind Parliament, it has only been eight years for FijiFirst and I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tell you later on what FijiFirst has done in eight years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Only eight years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, eight years as an elected Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Again, you are being very selective.   Please, remember this all of you.  
<br/>Prior  to  those  eight  years,  they  were  all  presidential  appointees,  protected  under  the  1997 
<br/>Constitution,  Mr.  Speaker,  and  the  2013  Constitution  after.  So,  I  wish  to  warn  the  other  side  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament, be careful and stop continuing to speak against His Excellency the President then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the state of affairs and I wish to acknowledge the scope, the initiatives and 
<br/>reforms  presented  in  His  Excellency’s  Speech,  and  I  must  admit  that  as  I  was  preparing  for  this 
<br/>particular contribution, I look back at the year that has passed and I thought, “Alright, let me be a bit 
<br/>independent even and look back at the year that has passed - a year that we will not get back, and a 
<br/>year in which we handed you (and I know there is going to be a lot of noise here but that is the truth)

<br/>and Fiji was one of the five fastest recovering economies in the world.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This is what we gave them, Mr. Speaker. What did you do with it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  The  people  are  asking,  Sir,  what  did  you  do  with  it?  Well,  there  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extravagant travels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  There  is  tabloid-style  gossip.  There  is  in-fighting,  there  is  secret 
<br/>fundraising, there is stifling in the private sector, there is burying investor confidence into the ground 
<br/>and most of all, disappointing the ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  This  has  been  an  entire  year  and  then  some  confusion  and  absolute 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nothingness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He is imputing improper motives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- What motives? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is publicly known that there has been some suggestion of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>some things. The mention of fundraising, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is under Standing Order 62. Yes, I will allow. Continue, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The mention of fundraising is directed at me, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- There is a suggestion of improper motives. Honestly, Sir, 
<br/></span><span>we fight fair here, we do not go and delve into unsubstantiated facts by someone which I could see 
<br/>who is a bit not well adjusted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Which Standing Order?’

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just fight fair and do not go into personal areas because we all can do that.  I just thought I urge 
<br/>honourable Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, what I heard was that honourable Koya had made a 
<br/>general remark on fundraising, and that is a general remark.  No one has been, kind of, pointed at or 
<br/>feeling vilified but if that does point a finger at you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, then I ask 
<br/>that we take it like a man and let us continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you have said, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we need to fight fair here.  Honourable 
<br/>Sharma has been making a lot of punches as well when he last spoke.  Those were his views and 
<br/>most  were  hearsay  and  we  really  cannot  pinpoint  him  on  that  particular  instance  when  he  said, 
<br/>“People are saying this around the grog bowl and all that”.  That is why we are here.  We need to 
<br/>hear what is coming from the outside, what has been spoken in the streets, et cetera, but let us take it 
<br/>on like a man and be fair as well.  If you can give, you can take it as well. So, I ask that we continue 
<br/>along those lines and let us be fair.  You may continue, honourable Koya.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Sir. I did do some boxing when I was young, Sir, and I tell 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you what, you give me a left hook, I will give you a right upper cut.  Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, this has been nothing, but the year of confusion and I like 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this word, Sir, of ‘nothingness’.  Absolute nothingness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA. –I must say, Sir, this is not us speaking, this is your public speaking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- This is them telling us that what have we gotten in the last 14 months?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Nothingness.  Absolutely nothing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, we heard about reforms, however, we must state that we do not have any 
<br/>confidence  in  the  ability  with  respect  to  those  reforms  that  were  actually  being  programmed  or 
<br/></span><span>proposed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  remember  also,  I  think  it  was  late  back  in  January  2023,  when  the 
<br/>honourable  Attorney-General  jumped  up,  got  into  action  and  said,  “Any  issues  dealing  with 
<br/>Government affairs are to be dealt with by the Coalition Government and its head”.  Mr. Speaker, I 
<br/>think they are not actually being actually respectful to their Prime Minister, they not listening to him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE: Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- They have run a mark, and they are not listening to him and I am sure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Prime Minister, if he has some more hair on his head, he would be scratching it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  security  and  stability,  while  the  reforms  announced  by  His 
<br/>Excellency maybe well intention, I think what needs to be done is that Government has to focus on 
<br/>the basics. I am glad that we have had a very frank admission from the honourable Minister for Home  
<br/>Affairs and Immigration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>283 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and again I relay what the general public is saying, that they 
<br/>do not feel safe.  They do not feel safe! The security, safety and stability are three key drivers of the 
<br/>economy.  Those things drive our economy, and the level of lawlessness has increased dramatically.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issue also is not just isolated with respect to the bad elements of our society and I say this 
<br/>wholeheartedly,  Mr. Speaker, this is  not  just your problem,  this is  our problem too.   It  is  an  ‘us’ 
<br/>problem.  It is something that we must do together.  It is not something about honourable Tikoduadua 
<br/>blaming the previous Government for the drug problem, we did not ask people to come and make 
<br/>drugs here.  None of us did!  We put the necessary things into place, you are making it better, we are 
<br/>all making it better.  Fantastic!  That is what we want to see but, please, stop blaming the previous 
<br/>Government for any ill-will because this issue regarding drugs, et cetera, in society is not…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Again, Sir, they do not listen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, this is not just a problem for Fiji, it is a worldwide problem, and we must do it jointly 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together to actually get this done. That is all we are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is right about the fruit, et cetera. You know you are looking at it and you say, “there are 
<br/>some good fruits and some are bad fruits.” We gave you a lot of good fruits, you still have not opened 
<br/>it. There are fantastic new police stations that we gave you that you still have not opened, honourable 
<br/>Minister. We want to know why? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even the admission by the honourable Minister with respect to the issues 
<br/>faced by the Police Force, again, I congratulate you, honourable Minister, for actually acknowledging 
<br/>that. It is something that we need to do, and we need to do it jointly. We have had a few conversations, 
<br/>Sir, the honourable Minister and myself, and I think we are actually finding some good footing with 
<br/>respect to advancing for the betterment of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the most important things for him is not just doing Home Affairs, he 
<br/>has to ensure that all he does brings back investor confidence because that is what is seriously lacking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA. – When I was a young gentleman, Mr. Speaker, Sir, every time we went 
<br/></span><span>passed Lami, my father used to tell me, “If you see smoke coming out from the cement factory, you 
<br/></span><span>know the economy is working.”  Guess what? There has been no smoke there for 14 months. Nothing 
<br/>is happening. It is just not happening, and this is not us telling you off, it is just critiquing so, please, 
<br/>accept it.  It is not happening. Go and ask the construction people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I am going to tell you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it actually stems from incompetence, and I will 
<br/>tell you where it gets worse. When you move to the Ministry of Finance, the state of the economy, 
<br/>Minister of Finance, is fragile.  Unfortunately, instead of building up the economy, in his second 
<br/>year, he is still trying to create a new national plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by the time he is finished with the new national plan, it will be Election 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time again. What is he going to do with a three year plan? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You’re a joke! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- I am not a joke, people are laughing at you and saying you are not worthy

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of your job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is a great example for you. He used to sit here, and he did for eight years. 
<br/>Eight years, he could have developed a great plan, but he did not, Mr. Speaker, he did nothing. Now, 
<br/>we have got a year of nothing from the honourable Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, disconnect.  He did not even listen to his honourable Prime Minister when he said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Do not increase VAT to that much.”  That tells you about the disconnect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has finally got into the driver’s seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir. He got in, started the car, he actually 
<br/>thought, “Great,  the  engine is  running”, but  guess what?   There is  no wheels  on it, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>because he took them off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what was so wrong with the 5-Year and 20-Year Development Plan?  Why 
<br/>are you wasting resources? You can tweak it but it should not take you that long to do it because 
<br/>guess what? When doing those development plans, our ideas are the same. It is for the betterment of 
<br/>Fiji. We did not put anything in there that was going to ruin Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is too busy with his friends or consultants or whatever they are.  Again, 
<br/>you need to  get  your mathematics right. Three year plan, it could  have taken you two-and-a-half 
<br/>years to get it done. By that time, what are you going to do? Nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now the biggest complaints that we get from the general public is, 
<br/>“Sir, before I used to have some loose change in my pocket, now, I do not even have that.” I asked 
<br/>them why?  He said, “VAT has gone up by 6 percent, cost of living is raised, manufacturing duty has 
<br/>gone up by 3 percent, increase in corporate tax by 5 percent, some have been given no tax.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Maybe, it has been safely stashed somewhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA. – I am coming to that, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a staggering 14 percent increase to businesses, but guess what, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker? That has been passed on to the consumers, let alone the increase in overseas market and I 
<br/></span><span>am going to give you today some live examples of what people have said and how they are actually 
<br/>suffering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these policies are atrocious and misguided.  They do not take care of our 
<br/>people. These stories echo the daily struggles and we have a resilient population, we know that, Sir, 
<br/>but this time the resilience is wearing thin. They deserve the compassion that we give them, they 
<br/>deserve the urgency that we give them to look after them.  Let me take you through the streets, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have had the privilege of conversing with the best information that you can actually get from 
<br/></span><span>taxi drivers. One day, I got in a pair of shorts, T-Shirt and a hat and he did not recognise me.  I asked 
<br/>him, “how are you, Sir?”  He said, “good”.  I asked, “How is it going with the business?”  He goes, 
<br/>“very bad”.  I said, “what is the problem”.  He goes, “the money that I used to make, I do not get it.”  
<br/>I said, “Why? People are not catching your taxi?”  He goes, “All the money that everyone earns goes 
<br/>towards their food bill. How are they going to catch taxi.”

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the corridors of our pharmacy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, people were getting prescribed 20 tablets 
<br/>are going to the pharmacies and only asking for 10 tablets because that is all that they can afford. Our 
<br/>hotel workers now find solace in the fact that they do not have to pay rent and thanks to their village 
<br/>homes, yet, they empathise with those who do not have village homes and were to juggle the soaring 
<br/>cost of living, with fear of the next day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for want of a better word, I know it is being used but it is actually very, very 
<br/>appropriate, the attack on the people, the common man is actually brutal. It is really bad, and we face 
<br/>it every day.  We have people complaining to us every day on basically about the cost of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst addressing also things with respect to climate change, we understand 
<br/>there is also initiatives such as relocation of communities, et cetera, in terms of climate change and 
<br/>investment  in  renewable energy, the steps in  the right direction, but  we need to  combat this with 
<br/>stricter green technologies and stricter environmental protection laws and more substantial effort in 
<br/>global advocacy for climate justice, but I have to put a proviso there, Sir.  We cannot do that if we 
<br/>go in this Parliament and say to ourselves, “we will not support the release of nuclear wastewater 
<br/>into the Pacific Ocean”, and then someone goes and agrees to it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot do that. That is not on. That is not very Fijian of us to be doing 
<br/>that. We are protectors of the oceans; we want to be part of the whole Pacific. We want to be the 
<br/>protectors of our people at the end of the day and the ocean forms a huge part of our life.   We have 
<br/>had numerous calls and letters, et cetera, regarding that and I think it is such, and I cry when I see 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on transparency and accountability, there is a lot that actually has gone on 
<br/>and a lot that needs to happen. But I just wanted to round off, Sir, and I know you are going to give 
<br/>me a few minutes.  I think there is a line that needs to be said.  We go at each other all the time but 
<br/>in order to offend a strong man which we know we are, you tell a lie, but in order to offend are weak 
<br/>man, you tell him the truth. All we have been doing, Mr. Speaker, is telling the truth.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I know these people have gone on for 16 months and until you tell 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me to sit down, I will just read out a quick list of all the things that FijiFirst has done, the -

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen in the gallery, fellow countrywomen and 
<br/>men and to those from around the world who are listening in through the various media platforms; 
<br/></span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>, and in the better part of Fiji we say, </span><span>bula vina’a, bula si’a, mi’au sa bula re</span><span>, but I am 
<br/>reminded that in the better part of Fiji, they say, </span><span>sa malo bula</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  express  my  gratitude  for  the  privilege  to  address  Parliament  today.    I 
<br/>extend my sincere appreciation to His Excellency the President, </span><span>Na i Taukei Bolatagane</span><span> and </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>na  Tui  Macuata,</span><span>  Ratu  Wiliame  Katonivere,  for  his  most  Gracious  Speech  and  for  officially 
<br/>inaugurating the 2024 Parliament of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the perpetual task of ushering a nation into a brighter destiny for her people 
<br/>remains a formidable challenge everywhere around the world, even so true for developing countries.  
<br/>I express my gratitude to His Excellency for providing a roadmap in this Parliament on how those 
<br/>perpetual  tasks  and  formidable  challenges  can  be  met  by  all  of  us,  representatives  of  our  fellow 
<br/>citizens in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency’s articulation of the Government's proposed legislative agenda, policies and 
<br/></span><span>programmes signifies a dedicated commitment to the ongoing reconstruction of an advancing and 
<br/>more prosperous Fiji.  As Members of this Parliament, it is incumbent upon us to fulfil our duty as 
<br/>legislators and work towards delivering Fijians their country’s best days, which we confess, is ahead 
<br/>of us.  I urge us all, that we embrace, "Even in our divide we can, and as one, we surely will." 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are reminded by His Excellency the President that as democratically elected Members, to 
<br/>listen to the voices of our people, not limited only to those who elected us, but to all our citizens 
<br/>young and old, men and women, able and disable, people of all faiths and of all creed. "Even in our 
<br/></span><span>divide we can, and as one, we will." 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we earnestly strive to collectively rebuild our future together as a nation, the 
<br/>Ministry  of  Lands  and  Mineral  Resources  remains  unwavering  in  its  commitment  to  innovative 
<br/>strategies, harmoniously aligned with our annual plans and budgeted programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, 2024, is poised to be a transformative year anticipated for much better performance,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>287 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>creation  of  a  much-enhanced  work  environment,  laser  focus  to  customer  needs,  and  streamlined 
<br/>response times to better serve all stakeholders.  It is our steadfast pledge as a Ministry of Lands and 
<br/>Mineral Resources to usher in a year of uplift across every facet of our operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have laid a challenge to my Ministry this year - every inch of land under 
<br/>our responsibility must be used and it must be used sustainably, utilised for residential, agricultural 
<br/>development, integrated or otherwise and for organised sustainable forestry planned that is in line 
<br/>with our global targets to resist the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and 
<br/>pollution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consequently, the Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources is working with the Department 
<br/>of Town and Country Planning in finalising the State Lands Land Use Plan for Fiji.  Apart from the 
<br/>comprehensive  review  of  the  antiquated  State  Lands  Act  of  1945,  we  are  also  looking  at  critical 
<br/>aspects  of  our  regulations  in  penalties,  revenue  collections,  lease  conditions  and  reassessments, 
<br/>amongst others.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, echoing the sentiments of His Excellency, the importance of agriculture as 
<br/>the backbone of our economy for both food security and export cannot be overstated. In alignment 
<br/>with this vision and to contribute to the diversification of our economy, as well as the generation of 
<br/>income for both rural Fijians and commercial agricultural investments, the Ministry remains steadfast 
<br/>to its commitment, the Fijian Growth.  Our focus persists on persevering as much fertile agricultural 
<br/>land as possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will continue to ensure that all state agricultural land is provided to only 
<br/>those who will plant on it and help maximise its return to benefit not just themselves but the Fijian 
<br/>economy as a whole. Increased collaboration amongst agencies has been reignited with the objective 
<br/>to maximise agricultural opportunities as a tool to alleviating poverty amongst us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry together with the Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of iTaukei Affairs has started 
<br/>in our cluster meetings to work in partnership to retain as much agricultural land as possible.  This 
<br/>brings me to the State Lands known initially as Crown Grants (CGs) and Native Grants (NTs) that 
<br/>was advertised by the iTLTB for consultation in the newspaper.  I want to assure the tenants on those 
<br/>parcels of land, do not panic, do not allow unscrupulous politicians to use you as a battering ram for 
<br/>cheap partisan political points.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The State will honour its leases with you full stop.  Be at peace, plant, live, let your children 
<br/></span><span>go to school, you yourselves go to work, this is your Government and you are valuable citizens of 
<br/></span><span>this country.  Should there be land that is unused in any of these CGs or NTs, these will be identified 
<br/>and  processed  through  the  provisions  of  the  law  of  our  country  to  be  used  for  the  benefit  of  the 
<br/>original </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  mentioned  earlier,  we  place  specific  emphasis  on  the  allocation  and 
<br/>identification  of  State  Land  for  high-return  investments.      This  strategic  approach  aims  to  attract 
<br/>investments and foster the creation of new job opportunities for a broader spectrum of all Fijians. 
<br/>Our commitment to this endeavour remains unwavering as we strive to stimulate economic growth 
<br/></span><span>and prosperity across the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with Government’s commitment to SDG6 in providing access to clean water 
<br/>as a fundamental right of every Fijian and with increase in demand for groundwater resources, for 
<br/>household consumption, agriculture and commercial water bottling, the Ministry has finished and 
<br/>completed the National Groundwater Resource Management Development Policy which will ensure 
<br/>sustainable use and management of one of the world’s finest groundwater resources. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will prioritize services to all its customers by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reviewing existing policies and formulating new policies for the sustainable management 
<br/>of land, minerals and under groundwater resources; and  
<br/>Reviewing our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) at the Ministry to continuously cut 
<br/>out the red-tapes or bureaucratic processes at the same time digitizing some of them; 
<br/>The continual reviewal of the Act or Acts under our purview and its regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to ensure that we strike the right balance between the fulfilment 
<br/>of  our  role  and  function,  support  and  encourage  economic  activities  whilst  ensuring  that  our 
<br/>environment and resources is sustainably protected and managed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, encouraging foreshore development in Fiji presents a promising avenue for 
<br/>economic  growth  and  sustainable  tourism.    Embracing  the  concept  of  building  over  water,  as 
<br/>successfully implemented overseas, can elevate Fiji's tourism industry to new heights. Integrating 
<br/>eco-friendly and culturally sensitive designs, such developments could showcase the stunning natural 
<br/>beauty of Fiji’s coastal areas whilst providing unique and luxurious accommodation to our visitors 
<br/>both local and abroad.  Mr. Speaker, the honourable Kirpal (who is not here now) mentioned the poor 
<br/>delivery from the Ministry to the public sector since the Ministry have not provided any sales data 
<br/>on properties sold in Fiji since last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have mentioned here in Parliament last year that FRCS has stopped giving the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands confidential information.  We then pursued the option with the Ministry of Justice, and on 6</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>November,  2023  we  signed  off  our  Memorandum  of  Understanding  with  them.    Now  due  to  the 
<br/>confidentiality and responsibilities that arise out of the MOU, a separate agreement now has been 
<br/>drafted and is now being vetted by the Office of Solicitor-General for individual registered valuers 
<br/>to sign off on.  Given that it is an initiative by the Ministry with fees involved and with the new 
<br/>cabinet Circular 1/24, that policy needs to go to Cabinet for endorsement before it is available for 
<br/>execution by registered valuers.  We endeavour, Mr. Speaker, to have all of these sorted this month 
<br/>and a Cabinet Paper will be presented and bring out the much-needed data by end of April 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Ministry in alignment with the Ministry of Civil Service has 
<br/>regularised 89 officers who have met the criteria stipulated in the circular for regularisation of the 
<br/>Civil Service.  Out of the 89 officers, 47 were confirmed to their positions, whereas 42 officers had 
<br/>their salary bands upgraded and now regularised as part of the Ministry's retention strategies.  This 
<br/>commitment,  Mr.  Speaker,  reflects  our  dedication  to  fostering  a  supportive  and  conducive 
<br/></span><span>environment  for  our  staff,  recognising  that  a  content  and  well-equipped  team  is  essential  for 
<br/></span><span>achieving organisational goals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this takes me to the point made by the other side on the rise in migration and 
<br/>loss of skilled and professional work force from this country.  Do they not realise, Mr. Speaker, the 
<br/>blame falls squarely on the shoulders of their Government when it was in power!  The numbers that 
<br/>were presented today by the honourable Vakalalabure that 34,797 emigrated from Fiji  between 2012 
<br/>to 2022; that is an average of 3,866 per year.   How do you explain that?  Those they lament about 
<br/>that left in 2023, Mr. Speaker, were the ones who were already planning to leave when they were in 
<br/></span><span>government.  They wanted to throw the blame on us.  In our 14 years being in the Government…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  In  our  14  months  whilst  being  in  Government  (hold  on  a 
<br/>minute) it will be 14 years.  There will be a long ride on that side of Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>They want to throw the blame on us for people who left during the 14 months.  What have they got

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to say about the people who left in 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They must realise, Mr. Speaker, that the world now grapples with circular migration.  World 
<br/>citizens  move,  and  they  move  in  speed.    It  is  inevitable.    New  Zealanders  leaves  for  Australia, 
<br/>Australians leaves for Europe and the United States, our citizens find green pastures in Australia and 
<br/>New Zealand, and also elsewhere and they are quite entitled to do so.  Whilst they are there, they 
<br/>send funds to their families back home.  Our remittance go up, our economy improves, which is what 
<br/>we all agree is needed here in Fiji.  I encourage the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, please see the bright 
<br/>side of what you criticise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all agree, Mr. Speaker, that the recent spate of drug busts in the West is beyond shocking.  
<br/>It wakes us to a dangerous potential that can destroy the nation we all love.  When I was a young 
<br/>prosecutor, Mr. Speaker, more than two decades ago, such finds of drugs that we found recently in 
<br/>Legalega and Maqalevu, could  not  even possibly  be thought of.   As prosecutors, we learn of the 
<br/>trend.  Every crime starts small.  Without detection, it festers.  Without detection, it aggravates.  What 
<br/>is the point that I am making here, Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The find of many tonnes recently simply means that in earlier times, a kilogramme passed 
<br/>through, not detected, 10 kilogrammes passed through. It continues until it is detected and as we have 
<br/>seen recently, tonnes of it. You do not get suddenly tonnes passed through our shores.  What it means 
<br/>is that it festers and it increases over time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- You see the capacity of it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  may  I  ask  who  were  in  charge  when  the 
<br/>kilogramme passed through, when 10 kilogrammes passed through, when 100 kilogrammes passed 
<br/>through and when the first tonne passed through, came through … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- ... our doors, that government, please put your hands up?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the drug problem in our country must now be Parliament’s problem because we 
<br/>are legislators. I am told that in 2019, a motion was moved in Parliament by the then Opposition 
<br/></span><span>Members for a joint committee to combat Fiji’s drug problem. We all know how that day ended.  
<br/></span><span>Instead of trying to win cheap partisan points please revisit that motion and bring it up, you will see 
<br/>that this Government will support it without reservation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  challenge  laid  in  this  Parliament  by  His 
<br/>Excellency  must  not  fall  to  the  ground.  We  must  catch  the  challenge  like  the  Drua  boys  had 
<br/>performed. We must run with the challenge of working bipartisan on all matters that affect us as a 
<br/></span><span>nation.  We must work together on matters that even the Opposition have laid as challenges that they 
<br/></span><span>have heard in their visits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there is no room for fear mongering in this Parliament.  There is no room for 
<br/>generalisation without data as we have heard all day for three days from the Opposition. No room 
<br/>for  marginalisation  from  posts  you  read  on  social  media  unless  you  have  it  on  credibility.    We 
<br/>understand their role as watchdogs of executive decision and so there is no need for marginalisation,

<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generalisation and fear mongering, get used to the chair that you now occupy because it is going to 
<br/>be a long ride for the next 20 years on that side of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government, Mr. Speaker, is a Government for all. There is no political preference for 
<br/>a particular race. This is a Government that was voted into power by all Fijians and we will serve all 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. MEMBERS.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Like the early memories of His Excellency growing up in the 
<br/>cane belt of Macuata,  with all the races that call Macuata their home.  My own memories in  my 
<br/>village in Loa is very clear. For those of you who know Buca Bay will know of Niuloa, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>a parcel of arable land that was initially leased in the 1900s to three families of Indian origin.  I do 
<br/>not know of the original lessees’ name but their offsprings, whom we know when we were children, 
<br/>their names were Kuku Ramu Dasi, Kuku Pitaji, Kuku Nanika, who was the first owner of a Daihatsu 
<br/>van in the whole of Buca Bay.  He was my father’s brother from another mother; Kuku Nanu, Kuku 
<br/>Jihdo (who went on to establish a shop in Kasavu) and of course we all know Kuku Ramutari. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These hardworking men and their wives have sons, one is Ramesh, we called him Tui because 
<br/>he carried my grandfather’s name. Jone Pitaji, son of Kuku Pitaji, carries even my own father’s name.  
<br/>These children are all well established in Savusavu, Labasa, Suva and even beyond. We remain close 
<br/>to this day, Mr. Speaker. Rakesh was the son of Prasad. He is the owner and proud owner of Paradise 
<br/>Digging  Services  Limited,  one  of  the  sub-contractors  of  roads  established  very  well  in  Savusavu 
<br/>today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this is the Fiji His Excellency wants us to recreate and deliver to Fiji and her 
<br/>people.  His Excellency is speaking to us for the Fiji and the multiracialism that made this country 
<br/>the depiction of the way the world should be.  This is the country that we can be remembered for 
<br/>creating and giving to the next batch of young and more vibrant parliamentarians in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to wish all Hindus in Fiji a celebration of </span><span>Holi, c</span><span>itizens of Fiji here and abroad well in 
<br/>the holy month of </span><span>Ramadan </span><span>and to all Christian brothers and sisters a blessed Easter in the month of 
<br/>March.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for your indulgence and I thank His Excellency for his most 
<br/></span><span>gracious Speech, and I support the honourable Prime Minister’s motion.  </span><span>Me lagilagi tiko o Viti.
