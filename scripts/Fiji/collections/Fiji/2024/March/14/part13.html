<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  by  way  of  background,  as  per  the 
<br/>establishment of the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) Act in 1966, it is important for me to, once again, 
<br/>highlight  the  function  of  the  Bank  and,  that  is,  to  facilitate  and  stimulate  the  promotion  and 
<br/>development of natural resources, transportation and other industries and enterprises in Fiji and in 
<br/>the  discharge  of  these  functions,  the  Bank  shall  give  a  special  consideration  and  priority  to  the 
<br/>economic development of the rural and agricultural sectors of the economy of Fiji.  Furthermore, Sir, 
<br/>the Bank is under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of Fiji, and this requires the Bank to provide 
<br/>a six-monthly report to the Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  as  required  under  section  2(1)  of  the  Financial  Management  Act  which  states  that 
<br/>subject to any other Act that  the Government may guarantee the financial liability of an entity in 
<br/>respect of a loan or otherwise but only if the giving of the guarantee is approved by Parliament.  So 
<br/>by way of background, this is why this guarantee comes to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the request from the Bank is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue the facilitation of the Government’s policy by lending to essential sectors of the 
<br/>economy, particularly resource-based sectors including; agriculture, mining and quarrying, 
<br/>manufacturing, transport, communications, storage, small and micro enterprises, wholesale 
<br/>and retail, hotels, sustainable energy from fossils to renewable sources and professional and 
<br/>business  services  which  will  assist  the  disadvantaged  community  to  earn  a  decent 
<br/>livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lend to the resource-based sector that will assist in the development of the agriculture sector 
<br/>and assist the development of the Fijian economy in the long run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue provision of  finance that  can support the growth  of  the nation’s economy  and 
<br/>improve the standard of living for the people, as well as improving their social economic 
<br/>status by assisting them with their needs in making the correct investments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure  that  the  Bank’s  borrowings  are  guaranteed  by  the  Government,  therefore, 
<br/>reducing  the  perceived  risks  associated  with  such  borrowings.  This  will  make  the 
<br/>Bank’s instruments more attractive to investors and should reduce the cost of borrowing 
<br/>to the Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to also state, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the original intention of the Bank was to ensure that 
<br/>the Bank actually took additional risks in providing financing to sectors which, perhaps traditionally, 
<br/>will not be the ones that commercial banks and other financial institutions would like to lend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  Bank’s  lending  portfolio,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bank’s  Audited  Financial 
<br/>Statement  as  of  31</span><span>st</span><span>  December,  2023,  recorded  an  accumulative  total  loan  portfolio  of  $482.73 
<br/>million.  We are representing about 8,561 accounts of $371.04 million in the focus sector, which is 
<br/>what I had stated earlier; and 1,058 accounts, amounting to $111.69 million in the non-focus sector, 
<br/></span><span>compared to $692 million in the 2022 Financial Year.  So, that is a significant change, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Bank’s financial position for 2023, at the end of the financial year, the Bank doubled 
<br/>its consolidated profit to $3.8 million, an increase of about 114 percent when compared to the same 
<br/>period  last  year  which  was  $1.8  million.  This  is  attributed  to  the  increase  in  fee  income  and 
<br/>allowances for interest and fees. The overall asset base stood at $594 million as at 2023 Financial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="71">Page 71</a></div>
<div><span>292 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 2023 and a 5 percent decrease when compared to the $626.2 million in the 2022 Financial Year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While total liabilities declined to $411.7 million, 8 percent decrease from $449.9 million in 
<br/>the year 2022 so with the decrease in total liabilities, the total shareholders’ equity increased by 3 
<br/>percent to $182.2 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As at  the end of 2023  Financial Year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank had total cash and cash 
<br/>equivalent of $179.1 million - an increase of about 72 percent when compared to the same year in 
<br/>2022.    The  increase  was  attributed  to  the  higher  collection  levels  during  the  year  and  that  is 
<br/>understandable (coming out of COVID-19). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Bank’s  borrowing  forecast,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  2024  and  that  relates  to  the 
<br/>Government guarantee that we are seeking from Parliament, the Bank’s total forecasted outlay from 
<br/>1</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2024 to 28</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2025, which is the proposed amount for the 2024 Guarantee, Sir, 
<br/>amounts to $191.26 million as opposed to $211.3 million during the 2023 Guarantee that we  had 
<br/>approved  here in  Parliament.  So,  given that  the Bank’s  forecasted inflow is  only  $61.26 million 
<br/>during the proposed guarantee period, Sir, the Bank requires an additional $130 million to finance 
<br/>the total outlay of $191.26 million. Henceforth, the guarantee that we are bringing to Parliament is 
<br/>for an additional $130 million which is proposed to be raised from the issuance of bonds and other 
<br/>instruments - promissory notes, short term borrowings and RBF financing facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FDB Guarantee, Sir, is requested on an annual basis. That is why we have to bring it 
<br/>again this year.  Given that Parliament only approves to guarantee FDB borrowings for the next 12 
<br/>months period, which is a strategy, I think, also put in place to stringently monitor the risk associated 
<br/>with these borrowings to minimise the risk of exposure to Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the figures highlighted, the outstanding guaranteed borrowings, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>has been declining over the years.  Every time we have been coming to Parliament, the amount has 
<br/>been declining.  For instance, the total approved Government Guarantee for FDB borrowings for the 
<br/>past five years has accumulated to a sum of $920 million, and as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> December 2023, only 25 
<br/>percent - $234.21 million of this accumulated approved guarantee is outstanding by which the Debt 
<br/>Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning is closely monitoring to ensure 
<br/>that associated fiscal risks are mitigated at all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank’s current average lending rate and cost of borrowing as of 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>December, 2023 is 5.67 percent and 1.23 percent respectively.  Additionally, the Bank accommodates 
<br/></span><span>and  delivers  a  variety  of  Government’s  socio-economic  and  directed  lending  policies,  therefore, 
<br/></span><span>request that it continues to be assisted by the provision of guarantees.  I think that is the rationale 
<br/>behind the guarantees as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Bank’s  outstanding  liabilities  guaranteed  by  the  Government,  as 
<br/>mentioned earlier, as of 31</span><span>st</span><span> January 2024 amounts to $227.6 million, of which bond stood at $45.5 
<br/>million - 21 percent; term deposits at $65.1 million - 29 percent; and RBF import substitution and 
<br/>export finance provision at $117.02 million, which is 50 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial implications of this guarantee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as of 30</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, the total 
<br/></span><span>Government guaranteed debt stood at $1.02 billion or 7.7 percent of the GDP.  Accessing the $130 
<br/>million  guarantee  that  we  are  asking  Parliament  to  approve  for  the  Bank,  will  increase  the  total 
<br/>Government  guarantee  exposure  to  $1.2  billion  or  8.7  percent  of  GDP.    I  think  the  honourable 
<br/>Members  of  Parliament  understand  this.  What  that  means  is  that,  if  there  is  a  default,  then  the 
<br/>Government will have to come up with that $130 million.  But the good news is that Bank has never

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>called  on  the  Government  guarantee  to  honour  its  guarantee,  and  the  Bank  continues  to  pay  the 
<br/>guarantee fees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those details, I commend the motion and ask the honourable Members to, please, support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  And 
<br/>before I offer the floor, I wish to inform this august Parliament that I have in front of me a list of 
<br/>speakers who have been identified by both Whips.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Opposition will lead off the batting and that is to be done by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  and  to  be  followed  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for 
<br/>Tourism, Civil Aviation and Education, before we switch back to honourable Koya and then to be 
<br/>rounded  off  by  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and  Small  and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises, and Communications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have been listening very carefully to the motion 
<br/>and I can see that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance was smiling most 
<br/>of the time when he was presenting this because he knows how these Guarantees used to be debated 
<br/>in Parliament previously. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me say from the very beginning of my contribution that we, on this side 
<br/>of Parliament, fully support the motion.  I am a bit worried about what honourable Koya referred to 
<br/>as “year of nothingness”, probably to salvage the Government of the year of nothingness, we have 
<br/>decided to give it our full support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, seriously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just for three key reasons, it is a development bank and 
<br/>the key things about development bank is providing that long-term financial support and the two key 
<br/>words  are  to  support  projects  and  most  importantly,  the  sectors.    We  have  been  talking  about 
<br/>diversifying the economy and this is one of my concluding remarks.  I thank the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, we had some long discussions here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the week, I responded to the request from the Prime Minister’s Office, from Ministry 
<br/>of  Foreign  Affairs  to  have  consultations  with  the  consultant  who  is  here  on  our  Foreign  Policy  - 
<br/>White Paper.  Again, I discussed with Mr. Peter Varghese.  We can come up with a very good Foreign 
<br/>Policy,  at  the  same  time,  where  do  you  converge  with  the  work  that  has  been  undertaken  by  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry of Defence on national security issues because at the end of all these, to support your Foreign 
<br/></span><span>Policy, to support your national security policies, we need a well-functioning economy to provide 
<br/>that support to the policies that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why I am talking about projects and sectors, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is because if we refer back to 
<br/>the Household Income and Expended Survey Reports (HIES), we will come up with the incidents of 
<br/>poverty and particularly in the areas in Fiji.  The honourable Minister for Rural Development has 
<br/>been  talking  about  coming  out  of  dependency  syndrome.    The  honourable  Minister  for  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs has been talking about empowering the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> in their respective communities.  We fully 
<br/></span><span>support  that,  but  we  need  to  be  analytical  as  well,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Where  are  the  incidents  of 
<br/></span><span>poverty in Fiji high?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the work of the Fiji Development Bank (FDB), when we 
<br/>established FDB in Taveuni, in Bua, additional to the one that we have in Seaqaqa and the one in 
<br/>Labasa, the 2018 HIES Report specifically stated that the incidents of poverty in Vanualevu reduced 
<br/>from 53 percent to 48 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>294 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the other contributing factors, I will come to MSMEs because of the Northern 
<br/>Development Programme but FDB played a critical role in the achievement of that.  That is why data 
<br/>is so important and that is why that analytical thinking needs to be there, and then we look at the 
<br/>potentials in the respective areas - not just the rhetoric, not just the statements but we need to do 
<br/>something about it and this is why the development bank providing these finances for projects and 
<br/>the sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have talked about the resource-based sector.  We have heard a lot from the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry.    We  have  heard  a  lot  from  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture.  Let us do something, let us come up with serious plans, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Small and Medium Enterprises, one of the purposes of development banks is to provide 
<br/>banking services principally to cater for the medium to long term needs of agricultural and industrial 
<br/>enterprises with emphasis on small and medium scale industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives and Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications and I also had some discussions.  Again, going back to 
<br/>the  economy  because  when  we  are  talking  about  the  economy,  we  are  doing  our  review  on  our 
<br/>defence and our foreign policies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During our discussions with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, 
<br/>Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications, we have been talking about 
<br/>Fiji  as  a  hub,  hub  for  what?  Let  us  get  into  some  serious  work  so  that  we  can  fully  utilise  that 
<br/>advantage that we have so that we can gain from it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the role of SMEs, Japan thrives.  They started off with small enterprises and they become 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>big players, not only locally but globally as well out of SMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know the effect of the Northern Development Programme. I have talked about the incidents 
<br/>of poverty because SMEs in the North have continued to be assisted from 2008 and I hope that, that 
<br/>still continues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because we need that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have been talking about high unemployment. This will be a solution when we have a lot 
<br/>of SMEs. We do not want people to be employees only, we want employers, and this is why it is so 
<br/>important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the agriculture sector.  As the honourable mover of the motion has correctly stated, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the initial purpose of FDB or the main objective is to facilitate and stimulate the 
<br/>promotion and development of natural resources, transportation and other industries and enterprises 
<br/>in Fiji, and to give special consideration and priority to the economic development of the rural and 
<br/>agricultural sectors of the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we go back to His Excellency’s the President’s Address last year, there 
<br/>was a commitment by Government to set up a special committee for the sugar industry.  I will say 
<br/>that again, in His Excellency’s Address last year, there was in the statement by His Excellency to set 
<br/></span><span>up a special committee to look at sugar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  discussed  with  you,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  a  Chairperson  of  Natural  Resources 
<br/>Committee and being new to Committee work, I did not know where to put that in the Report on the 
<br/>Agriculture  Sector,  but  I  decided  to  put  it  in  the  Chairman’s  foreword.  If  we  can  have  a  special 
<br/>committee, not only to look at sugar, but to look at the whole agricultural sector - sugar and non-
<br/>sugar, because as stated very recently, again, by the honourable Minister for Lands and, of course, in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>concurrence with what His Excellency said, that agriculture is the backbone. Let us do something 
<br/>serious.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We offer our assistance from this end. I know the 2020 Agriculture Policy Agenda and the 
<br/>key  thematic  areas  that  is  in  the  policy  agenda.  From  there,  they  have  worked  out  the  five  key 
<br/>thematics that are there in the Strategic Plan. It is good to have a plan but let us come up with some 
<br/>concrete  work  on  how  to  operationalise  that  plan  so  that  we  diversify  the  economy  and  we  can 
<br/>broaden the economic base.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Natural Resource Sector has a lot of play and that is why we strongly 
<br/>support this motion. Of course, we continue to contribute when Government sees it fit, as consistent 
<br/>with what we have discussed and what has been stated as well by His Excellency in his Address and, 
<br/>of course, the commitments to last year.  Once again, we fully support the motion, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of Opposition for your contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion on the floor for the 
<br/>Government to guarantee the sum of $130 million to the Fiji Development Bank (FDB). The way I 
<br/>see it, Sir, quite simply, FDB’s role is to provide finance for the development of the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we all want the Bank to succeed. There are two parties to the bank; those that 
<br/>manage the bank and those that borrow.  In my view, Sir, what we need is for both to be well educated 
<br/>- the one who manages the affairs of the bank and the one who borrows.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the finest examples of development banks, Mr. Speaker, is the Development Bank of 
<br/>Singapore.  It is dominant in the Asia Pacific region, and it is for that reason, that it is run by people 
<br/>who are well educated, well trained and the borrowers are also  well-educated people who put the 
<br/>money they borrow to good use. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am picking the angle that the education policy of the Coalition Government 
<br/>is critical for the economy of this country and critical for the FDB.  As I have articulated that our 
<br/>policy is in terms of what we provide in scholarships, there is no other country in the Pacific that 
<br/>provides scholarship for its citizenry, like Fiji, and it is a policy of the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  you  know,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  wrote  off  the  debt  of  53,725  people  (young  men  and 
<br/>women) in this country, debts that were valued at about $650 million.  I hear from honourable Koya 
<br/></span><span>that there is nothingness but  I tell you, Sir, that that kind of write-off was heavy lifting of the highest 
<br/></span><span>order anywhere, not even FijiFirst would have thought of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-Mr. Speaker, Sir, I say this because we need education to develop our 
<br/>country.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its very positive report of the economy given 
<br/>out this week, had a paragraph there that Fiji should focus on education and skills training for its 
<br/>people.  So, we are committed to education policies that provide education to our people in the best 
<br/></span><span>way possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about TELS… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Talk about FDB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … and education, I met this lady who came up to me and said, “My

<div><span>daughter is a doctor.  Thank you, she does not have to pay her TELS debt.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- </span><span>Vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- And if you look at that, Mr. Speaker…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Point Of Order.  Order 61 – when speaking, Members 
<br/>must confine their observation to the subject under consideration.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we are talking about the Fiji Development Bank Guarantee.  That 
<br/>is what we are talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about the health of the Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, can I just make a Ruling on that Point 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Order?  Can I humbly ask you just to confine your observations on what is before us? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We are talking about the health of the 
<br/>Bank here and an educated citizenry is very important for the Bank to survive.  We can talk about 
<br/>guarantees but if what you guarantee is wasted, then it will all come to nothing.  That is why we need 
<br/>policies of Government to support the economy of this country, to support the Bank and to support 
<br/>the development of this country.  That is why education is so important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot being said about education.  If you do not support it, if all these 
<br/>misleading  statements,  honourable  Sachida  Nand  said  that  the  FFP  policy  that  they  only  pay  50 
<br/>percent is better than ours where we write off 100 percent”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we want the Bank to succeed, we want our people to know what to do with 
<br/>their money and we need training, we need education, and that is why, it is important to educate our 
<br/>people and that our people in education, we train them to execute. We can have all the best plans but 
<br/>if our people cannot execute, it will fall apart. If they are given loans and they do not know how to 
<br/>use it, if you cannot execute, the Bank will fail.  That is the point that they do not understand, Sir. 
<br/>They do not get it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- We look at Fiji in a holistic way, Mr. Speaker, Sir. What is important 
<br/>is for the other side to realise that our education policies is the best that has been in this country and 
<br/>it is always supported.  Honourable Premila Kumar is bringing Australia saying that Australia do not 
<br/>even give free education.  They used to give free education, but that is history.   You do not know 
<br/>your history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Point  of  Order,  under  Standing  Order  61,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on 
<br/>relevance.  He needs to be instructed to be confined to the subject at hand and he is going all over the 
<br/></span><span>place. He has forgotten that he is in Government now, not in Opposition.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you may continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, do they think about the last 16 years of wastage?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is 16 years of wastage because they did not educate our people properly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mismanagement because they could not train people to execute.  We 
<br/>want people to execute better in this country, Mr. Speaker, that is why education is so important.  
<br/>Without  that,  the  Bank  will  fail.    It  is  obvious  they  cannot  make  the  connection,  that  is  why  we 
<br/>inherited a sorry state of affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  Point  of  Order.    Standing  Order  61.    Are  you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>finished? Just because I got up, he finished.  Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I hear one more 16 years quip from the other side, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will continue reading the list.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  pointed  out  right  at  the  outset,  we  fully  support  this  motion.    I  think 
<br/>sometimes we forget about what actually drives our economy.  Again, one of the most important 
<br/>things  for us  to  always  remember is  that we have guaranteed within our Constitution the right to 
<br/>economic participation, and it is a very important provision within the Constitution.  Section 32(1) 
<br/>reads, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every person has the right to full and free participation in the economic life of the 
<br/>State, which includes the right to choose their own work, trade, occupation, profession or 
<br/>other means of livelihood.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why I say this as a reminder, Sir, for eight years because I served as Minister for Trade, I 
<br/>think also the honourable Minister now who looks after the Ministry of Trade and SMEs has really 
<br/>grasped the issue well.    I think if I remember correctly, he spoke at  the Fiji  Enterprises  Engine 
<br/>graduation ceremony where he mentioned about the entrepreneurial journey and I quote from him, 
<br/>Sir, as it requires a special kind of determination and resilience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am so happy that he actually recognises that and I think what happens is, when we do these 
<br/></span><span>things and the FDB for many, many years has formed a huge part of the life of SMEs and continuous 
<br/></span><span>to do so, it is something extremely important.  If I could just relay some facts and figures, if you look 
<br/>at countries like Indonesia, 60.51 percent of its GDP is actually from these MSMEs and that is quite 
<br/>a  substantial  amount.    Indonesia  quite  surpasses  some  of  the  other  countries,  but  it  is  huge  with 
<br/>respect to their contribution to GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, when we look  at  ours, we have to  put  these things in,  we have to  support these ideas 
<br/>specifically when it comes  to  banks, like FDB.   We also know that the normal  high  street banks 
<br/>generally do not easily accommodate these MSMEs.  These MSMEs and we recognise these very 
<br/></span><span>much a long, long time ago about how they drive the economy and they are the engine for growth 
<br/></span><span>when it comes to that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, a word of reminder to the honourable Minister of Finance, please, remember them during 
<br/>budget time because they do form a huge part of our economy and currently, they all are suffering 
<br/>and we would gladly support this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>

<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, if I may also, Sir, when we talk about MSMEs, we are not actually just talking about 
<br/>one Ministry.  It is the Ministry of Tourism with all our ladies who sell their wares during the tourism 
<br/>season, et cetera; it is the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises and 
<br/>Communications; obviously, it is the Ministry of Agriculture; it is the Office of the Prime Minister’s; 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Sugar;  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection;  Ministry  of  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs,  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts;  Ministry  of  Fisheries  -  these    are  all  the  Ministries  that  are 
<br/>involved  in  MSMEs  and  we  need  to  recognise  that  because  they  really  form  a  huge  part  of  our 
<br/>country’s growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The cooperatives are involved in it and I am really happy to see that the Ministry concerned, 
<br/>Ministry of Trade, is continuing to do that, but they actually need assistance and help, especially in 
<br/>light of the fact, as I have said, high street banks, even though they are flushed with cash, they make 
<br/>it a little a bit more impossible for our MSMEs to survive.  Again, I think we also need to be a little 
<br/>bit mindful of honourable Gavoka, who is the new Minister for Education so he is just promoting his 
<br/>Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think we must also remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I think honourable Gavoka pointed out 
<br/>a very important point that if you have a bank, you need a great Chief Executive Officer (CEO) who 
<br/>is actually going to drive this and I understand that the current CEO is a huge admirer of the MSME 
<br/>sector and he actually does quite a lot for them.  So, all in all, Sir, just being very short and sharp, I 
<br/>am not going to go on about it, maybe out of the year of nothing as we might get a year of something 
<br/>out of this support that we actually render to FDB.  I wholeheartedly support the motion, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I make some comments in support 
<br/>of the motion before Parliament by the honourable Minister of Finance, I thought I will just touch on 
<br/>honourable Koya’s comments in his speech today. I was trying to think of an appropriate word to use 
<br/>when he said that it has been 14 months of nothingness and I came up with one word, - ‘comical’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Koya cannot be serious and say that we have not done anything in 14 months, 
<br/>compared to 16 years.  Let me remind them, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when Mr. Naiqama came out with the 
<br/>report on poverty, he was reporting on the 2019 figures and not 2022 because they would have said 
<br/>that it is COVID-19 related.  That was before COVID-19.  He said that one-third of the population 
<br/>in Fiji is under extreme poverty; one-third, 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services was very polite 
<br/>when he spoke about  health.    I will tell  him a story just for them to  know.   I spoke to  the Chief 
<br/></span><span>Surgeon at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again on Standing Order 61 on 
<br/>relevance. We are debating the Government Guarantee motion that is before Parliament and he is 
<br/>going all over the place.  You had instructed them to be on to the point, it is amazing, I admire you 
<br/>for your patience though, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Yes,  patience  is  for  everyone,  but  I  ask  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister to, please, continue as most of the speakers are in support from both sides.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Very quickly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was speaking to the Head 
<br/>Surgeon of the CWM Hospital and he said that out of the eight Operating Theatres, only three are 
<br/>operational.  So, what these poor doctors have to do, they have to work during the day because of the 
<br/>backlog, and they go and sleep a little bit, then come out at midnight with the nurses and actually 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operate on people. It has been like that for so many years - 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it goes without saying, we have shared the unsustainable debt problem in 
<br/>this country.  They are saying it is COVID-19 related - it is not COVID-19 related, it is because of 
<br/>the wastage in this country that we have arrived at this unsustainable debt problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Point of Order! Standing Order 60 - Relevance.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, you 
<br/>had directed him to speak on the motion, he is still going on - very disrespectful to the decision that 
<br/>you had made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Naupoto.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you are all adults here.  When the Speaker has made a ruling, let us 
<br/>continue to respect and honour that, please, because it is so hard when you think you are in the right, 
<br/>then you want to inform other people, “Look you people were wrong.”  This was the actual thing that 
<br/>happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, can we just focus on orders before us, that is, this motion by the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance on the FDB seeking a guarantee.  That is all we want.  At 
<br/>the  beginning,  it  worked  very  well  as  I  was  listening,  “oh,  this  will  be  short  one.”    As  we  come 
<br/>together to agree, then all of a sudden, we are finger pointing again.  I insist on the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, please, but do continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  on  the  unsustainable  debt,  let  me 
<br/>explain how relevant it is.  That is why it is very important that we support the FDB guarantee so that 
<br/>we continue to broaden the economy and support the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I now be allowed to make my contribution, Sir.  I rise to briefly support the motion by 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance.  The FDB has played a key role 
<br/>in the development of economic progress of Fiji.  I recall with fondness that a former Prime Minister 
<br/>of our country was the CEO of FDB, the late Mr. Laisenia Qarase, and whenever FDB comes up, I 
<br/>recall him with fondness his massive contribution towards the FDB in supporting our country at that 
<br/>time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FDB has a big mandate to support MSMEs in the country in areas such 
<br/>as  agriculture,  sugarcane  farmers  in  particular,  and  also  wholesale,  retail,  hotels,  restaurants, 
<br/></span><span>transportation and service sectors, to name a few.  I just wish to elaborate a bit more on my support 
<br/></span><span>for the motion, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, the FDB has been working very closely with the Ministry of Trade as it had even 
<br/>during honourable Koya’s time, in terms of trying to support our SMEs in terms of, firstly, attaining 
<br/>finance at an affordable rate and also driving development or economic activities in the agriculture 
<br/>sector so that subsistence farming transforms into subsistence and commercial level.  This guarantee 
<br/>will provide an opportunity, and for that reason, this guarantee is supported.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to list out a few key things that the FDB has done over the last 
<br/></span><span>year.  Right now, 93 percent of FDB’s portfolio is catering for three sectors - MSME sector, SME 
<br/>sector and also agriculture.  They have actually started to focus in recent times on agriculture value 
<br/>chain, such  as ginger  and rice, in  particular, and they continue to  focus  on trying to  de-risk their 
<br/>portfolio and that is why right now the request to Government for a guarantee continues to reduce.  
<br/>Sir, it was $280 million in 2022, $150 million in 2023 and now, $130 million in 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  laser  focus  on  women  empowerment,  and  I  know  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Women is  actually very  passionate about  financial  assistance to  women.   For the FDB’s  Women 
<br/>Entrepreneurs Loan in the last 16 months, they have been able to disburse about $3 million to about 
<br/>1,100  women  with  loans.    Of  course,  they  do  have  a  digital  literacy  programme  as  well,  Sir,  in 
<br/>collaboration with Visa International and, apparently, just recently their financial literacy platform is 
<br/>online and 5,500 customers or individuals have clicked on to that literacy programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They also even do outreach programmes every month, at least, 15 on average, reaching out 
<br/>into places, like Kadavu, Rabi and other areas and we continue to try and work with them in their 
<br/>outreaches.  Of course, as alluded to by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of 
<br/>Finance,  there  has  been  a  reduction  in  the  non-provision  in  the  Non-Performing  Loans  (NPL) 
<br/>portfolio in the last 24 months which is very positive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Sir, just an example of a recent support that we have gave out in Kadavu where I 
<br/>was a few weeks ago, we were there to handover bakery equipment to Mrs. Alumita Tuila under the 
<br/>IHRBP funding which is a one-third two-thirds programme.  She was able to get a grant from the 
<br/>Ministry  and  financed  her  one-third  contribution  from  FDB  under  the  Women’s  Entrepreneurs 
<br/>Programme.  Mr. Speaker Sir, today she is supplying more than 120 loaves a day to the community, 
<br/>and that is the type of assistance that we will continue to encourage and foster as we move forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On honourable Koya’s point, we are developing an MSMEs strategic plan which is receiving 
<br/>a lot of positive feedback and the FDB has actually been quite active in contributing  to that plan 
<br/>because we can see that with the well-articulated plan and with some key strategies, we can hopefully 
<br/>grow the contribution of MSMEs to GDP, which is now 18 percent to, at least, double or more in the 
<br/>years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  thought  to  share  with  particularly  the  people  of  Fiji  who  are  listening  in  that  the 
<br/>Government is not giving FDB actual physical funding - we are merely approving a guarantee which 
<br/>would allow them to access finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we speak in support of the contribution, and I fully support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  honourable 
<br/>Members for their contributions and especially thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for 
<br/>his support for the motion on Government guarantee. Just very quickly and briefly, Sir, the point 
<br/>raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition on SMEs, in fact, Government has worked very 
<br/></span><span>closely with FDB to strengthen its reach to agriculture - to SMEs and MSMEs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I could just give you some figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last financial year, the Bank 
<br/>disbursed about $40 million worth of loan to assist in the MSME and agriculture sectors alone. As 
<br/>pointed  out  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives  and 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications,  the  FDB  has  also  introduced  some  new 
<br/>innovative  projects  for  the  SME  and  MSME  sectors,  particularly  for  women,  and  he  gave  the 
<br/>statistics. Women’s loan portfolio represents about 28.6 percent of the Bank’s overall loan portfolio, 
<br/>which is quite impressive.  As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has said, it represents about $3 
<br/></span><span>million and about 1,300 accounts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  just  to  give  you  some  figures  and  put  it  for  record  that  the  Bank  has  recorded  a 
<br/>substantial decrease in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) by 30.2 percent; four times more, compared 
<br/>to the previous financial year and the NPL was $152.3 million.  The Non-Performing Loan value as 
<br/>at June 2022 has now reduced to $116.94 million in June 2023. I think that has been the case overall. 
<br/>A lot of the COVID related loans for businesses that were not able to pay loans during COVID, I am 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Guarantee - FDB 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>told by banks that many of them have cleared that as part of the economic recovery in 2022-2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just quickly clarifying the point raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition in terms 
<br/>of the Household Income and Expenditure Survey Report, I think the media also confused us on what 
<br/>was  in  the  Report.  What  the  report  said,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  75  percent  of  those  who  were  in 
<br/>poverty and not 75 percent of the total </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>population</span><span>.  </span><span>It is the total which was below poverty 
<br/>line.  Of those who were in poverty, 75 percent of them were from the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see a lot of people saying that 75 percent of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> population are living in poverty, 
<br/>that is incorrect, it is 75 percent of those who were already in poverty.  I agree with the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  that  SMEs,  even  in  developed 
<br/>countries,  the  largest  number  of  employment  is  created  in  the  SMEs  micro  enterprises,  small 
<br/>businesses, and they contribute significantly to the GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister was saying to me earlier that FDB’s role, and I agree with 
<br/>him, is to also take a little bit more risk and expand its portfolio in terms of supporting SMEs, MSMEs 
<br/>and those in the agriculture sector. I know, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  My first job was with FDB many years 
<br/>ago and the late former Prime Minister, Mr. Laisenia Qarase, was the Managing Director.  Part of 
<br/>our responsibility in the section I worked in was basically to go and identify these very small micro 
<br/>enterprises and we were looking at loans of $1,000; $2,000; and $3,000.  What we found at that time 
<br/>was that those very small ones were actually very good. They were able to repay their loans on time 
<br/>and it created a lot more economic activity in those areas. So, I agree with all the honourable Members 
<br/>and with the honourable Prime Minister that we need to focus on SMEs and, particularly, in areas 
<br/>where the Bank could take a bigger risk in lending. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the FDB Board and Management.  I think we 
<br/>have a very competent Board, and I am pretty sure that with the new strategic plan going forward, 
<br/>the Bank will serve its intention of promoting those focused sectors that we have identified earlier in 
<br/>our presentations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the honourable Members for supporting the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote.
