<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the gallery 
<br/>and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking interest in 
<br/>the proceedings of your Parliament.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament – ICT Upgrade of Conferencing System 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of all honourable Members, there are only a few works left to complete 
<br/>the overall ICT upgrade of the conferencing system in our Chambers. I have been advised that these 
<br/>will  be  completed  after  this  sitting  and  will  be  fully  functioning  at  the  next  April  sitting.  These 
<br/></span><span>includes the interpretation (captioning) and broadcasting of the vernacular (translation). You may 
<br/></span><span>notice that you are not provided with any listening devices since of this fact that there is no final 
<br/>connection.  It had just arrived after being bought from a New Zealand firm and that should be ready 
<br/>as I have stated in the next sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Translations – Hon. I. Vasu and Hon I. Tuiwailevu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that effect, I have also received notification from the honourable Minister for iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts and the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs that 
<br/></span><span>they will deliver their responses in the vernacular. I can confirm that I have also received the English 
<br/></span><span>translations of their responses, and these will be included in the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>for today. Whatever 
<br/>has been said in this Parliament, you will find after a few seconds being livestreamed in the television, 
<br/>whether it is said in the vernacular, both </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and </span><span>Hindi</span><span>, or is said in English.  That is what you 
<br/>will see on our television.

<div><span>Appointment of Opposition Whip 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I have received and acknowledged official communication from the 
<br/>Office  of  the  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  informing  that  the  new  Opposition  Whip  is  honourable 
<br/>Viliame Naupoto.  I congratulate you, honourable Naupoto, and I also thank the outgoing Opposition 
<br/>Whip, honourable Alvick Maharaj.  He has been holding that position for a long time.  He came in 
<br/>fresh, very young and even unmarried, but his hairstyle has changed a lot and very quickly after being 
<br/>married.
