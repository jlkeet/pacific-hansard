<h3>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THEADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers and 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  speak  in  response  to  His 
<br/>Excellency’s most Gracious Speech at the Opening of Parliament on Monday, 4</span><span>th  </span><span>March, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency had articulated the various issues that the Coalition Government wants to be 
<br/>emphasised and embarked in this calendar year. In His Excellency’s introduction, he emphasised our 
<br/>responsibilities  as  Members  of  Parliament,  and  I  quote  from  Page  4  of  the  </span><span>Uncorrected  Daily 
<br/>Hansard</span><span> on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“As democratically elected representatives, I ask that you listen to the voices of our 
<br/>people, not only to those who elected you, but to all the citizens, young and old, men and 
<br/>women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge you all to faithfully embrace with resolve the principles of democracy and 
<br/>humanity as enshrined in our Constitution. In doing so, we will continue to respect the 
<br/>integrity  and  dignity  of  our  Parliament.  We  must  acknowledge  and  recognise  our 
<br/>differences; however, we must be united with one common goal to ensure that we live in 
<br/>a progressive and prosperous nation.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To me, Mr. Speaker, the quoted statement of His Excellency’s introduction summarises the 
<br/>very  core  of  his  speech.    The  remaining  text  of  His  Excellency’s  Address  basically  covers  the 
<br/>operational plan by the Coalition Government for the year 2024.  The operational plan tries to cover 
<br/>what Government had failed to deliver in 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  respond  to  the  Address  delivered  by  His  Excellency,  I  wish  to 
<br/>review  the  performance  after  the  General  Elections  in  2022  and  the  subsequent  formation  of  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government.    This,  in  my  humble  opinion,  provides  better  reflection  of  what  we,  as  a 
<br/>Parliament can learn going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to gauge the performance of the Coalition Government, I wish to quote part 
<br/>of His Excellency’s Address during the Opening of Parliament on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023, as it reflects 
<br/>the expectations of His Excellency, and I quote from Page 13 of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and further 
<br/>improve  and  strengthen  our  economy  through  sustainable  growth  with  the  ultimate 
<br/>objective of improving the lives of the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  must  be  clear  focus  on  rule  of  law  and  democratic  processes  including 
<br/>transparency, accountability, respect for human rights and freedoms, and listening to the 
<br/>views  of  the  people  through  genuine  consultation.    The  views  of  all  members  of  our 
<br/>communities must be heard and I urge the People’s Coalition Government to ensure all 
<br/></span><span>initiatives and draft legislation must go through consultation process for better outcomes, 
<br/></span><span>to ensure inclusiveness and foster greater ownership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  must  ensure  that  draft  laws  are  deliberated  in  consultation  with 
<br/>relevant  stakeholders  particularly  through  the  Standing  Committee  process.    Petitions 
<br/>must be accommodated so that the voice of the people is heard in Parliament when they 
<br/>seek solutions to issues that are of concern to them.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>79 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  must  continue  to  adhere  to  the  constitutional  doctrine  of  the 
<br/>separation  of  powers  as  a  cornerstone  of  our  democracy  and  the  necessity  for  public 
<br/>servants to perform their duties independently.  Within the Civil Service, there will be 
<br/>more human resource and institutional capacity building to improve the service delivery 
<br/>to ordinary people and for civil servants to have a clear path.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  alluded  to,  we  can  all  learn  from  the  past  to  give  us  a  better 
<br/>understanding going forward.  Please, allow me to express my view on the various difficulties that 
<br/>we are facing now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I vividly remember when the honourable Prime Minister, as the Leader of the Opposition in 
<br/>the  2018  term  of  Parliament,  stated  that  a  lot  of  people,  especially  politicians  and  supporters, 
<br/>expressed that there was a need for all Parties to stick together and kick FijiFirst out.  I remember 
<br/>clearly that the then Leader of the Opposition in his reply stated, “If we kick FijiFirst out, then what?” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Freedom!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- To me, he was 100 percent correct in his statement as there 
<br/>was no immediate plan made when the Coalition formed Government in late 2022.  The Coalition 
<br/>partners, for the whole of 2023, concentrated in keeping the partnership intact, instead of formulating 
<br/>a plan to take Fiji forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Missing a plan to govern initiated this gloom and doom situation.  It is apparent that the lack 
<br/>of direction has drastic consequences on the state of the Fijian economy  and the Fijian lives as a 
<br/>whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji and Fijians are praying and hoping 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that things will turn around and become better.  Cost of living has become too high … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very bad.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- … and life has become unbearable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Brutal!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  In  reviewing  the  first-year  performance,  it  is  vitally 
<br/>important to try and explore the developments during the last 14 months. The comments made by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition in the last term of Parliament 
<br/>is very relevant and true.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  It has happened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Shame!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  to  understand  how  we  have  arrived  to 
<br/>where we are now, let me review our political developments.  Let me start with the most important 
<br/>platform for a true democratic governance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To provide a backdrop, the Government has concentrated on dismantling all the changes that 
<br/>was  incorporated  by  FijiFirst  in  its  first  eight  years  of  governing  and  in  the  Bainimarama-led 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government before 2014.  The Coalition Government has concentrated all its efforts to dismantle 
<br/>every institution and initiative built by FijiFirst and, in my humble opinion, has been a waste of time 
<br/>and resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  To  establish  economic  prosperity  of  a  small  democratic 
<br/>nation like Fiji, we need a multiple layer approach to form the foundation of investment and investor 
<br/>confidence for investors to take the leap of faith and spend.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji needs stability, peace and adherence to the rule of law, as His Excellency the President 
<br/>had articulated. This must be practised right across the board, from the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>the common citizens of our beloved Fiji. There must be accountability and transparency at all levels 
<br/>of our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must be subservient to the Constitution as that provides the guidelines of how we should 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all behave.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to examine the introduction of His 
<br/>Excellency the President’s Address that I had already adhered to. To me, it summarises the core of 
<br/>his delivery and reminds this Parliament of the core principles of a true democratic government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, His Excellency expressed that the Government must be geared towards building unity 
<br/>through social cohesion and further improve and strengthen our economy through sustainable growth 
<br/>with the ultimate objective of improving the lives of our people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The high cost of living, massive unemployment and lack of investment is driving people to 
<br/>our streets. As a consequence, there are more homeless, and more people are begging on our streets 
<br/>with more mentally disadvantaged people abound, due to abuse of drugs all over our main cities and 
<br/>towns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- That is a fact.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I live and work between Nadi and Suva, and the story is the 
<br/>same.  Poverty does not differentiate between a small town in the West and a big city, like Suva, in 
<br/>the Central Division.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  His  Excellency expressed that  there must  be clear focus on the rule of law  and 
<br/>respect for human rights.  In addition, His Excellency stated that Government must ensure that draft 
<br/></span><span>laws  are  deliberated  in  consultation  with  relevant  stakeholders,  particularly  through  the  Standing 
<br/></span><span>Committee process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all aware that the honourable Attorney-General has been making 
<br/>shortcuts by using Standing Order 51 to fast-track Bills. This is in total disregard of His Excellency’s 
<br/>plea, to allow views of all members of the communities to be heard and be assured of better outcomes, 
<br/>inclusiveness and foster greater ownership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>81 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  Bills  passed  in  the  last  term  of  Parliament  did  not  go  through  the  normal  process,  as 
<br/>alluded to by His Excellency the President. It is ironic that the honourable Attorney-General, when 
<br/>challenged, his answer is that he is following processes.  Mr. Speaker, in fact, he is adjusting the 
<br/>process to suit his agenda. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Oh, very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  I  urge  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  to  remove  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and replace him with someone who is prepared to work and carry out 
<br/>the required work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  His  Excellency  also  expressed  that  the  Public  Service  Commission  must  be 
<br/>given power of the existing Constitutional Framework as a central coordinating agency on all human 
<br/>resource matters within the Public Service.  Operational framework and guidelines across the Service 
<br/>will foster more collegiality and coordination for greater efficiency and productivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  highlighted  the  need  to  accelerate  key  structural  reforms  to  encourage 
<br/>efficiency  in  public  service  delivery  by  reducing  waste  and  executing  private  and  public  sector 
<br/>initiative to foster growth in the short term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is apparent that the level of abuse in public sector and the need to strengthen Public Finance 
<br/>Management and related issues needs to be strengthened and this need to be urgently attended to.  
<br/>The need to review transparency, accountability and fiscal discipline is urgently needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government must continue to adhere to the Constitutional doctrine on the separation of 
<br/>powers as a cornerstone of our democracy and the necessity for public servants to perform their duties 
<br/>independently.    I  feel  for  the  career  Civil  Servants,  who  have  been  replaced  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government supporters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Most of the Civil Servants who have been removed are now 
<br/>unemployed or have migrated overseas, which is now the main contributing factor of brain-drain in 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  I  want  to  remind  the  honourable  Attorney-General  that 
<br/>instead  of  coming  to  Government  and  stop  preaching  in  Parliament,  practice  what  Christianity 
<br/>teaches and what Jesus Christ had practised in life.    This is the more reason why the honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister  should  remove  honourable  Turaga  and  put  someone  that  can  abide  by  the 
<br/>Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  encouraged  that  His  Excellency 
<br/></span><span>highlighted the Coalition Government’s progressive agenda and the formation of a new development 
<br/>plan to set initiatives and programmes to sustain growth in the short to medium term.  I am, however, 
<br/>curious on the statistical figures that were made available.  I think the honourable Minister of Finance 
<br/>is cooking up the figures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>82 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A growth of 3.8 percent in 2024 and 3 percent for 2025 must be based on real information…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- … and not on perceived growth.  The debt of $9.9 million is 
<br/>highly  questionable  and  should  be  compared  to  the  payment  of  debt  mooted  around  last  year.  
<br/>Honourable Minister, refinancing is not repayment of debt.    You must agree with me on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am amazed that after giving good growth in the figures above, however, in the next statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cautioned the prediction and emphasised fiscal and debt sustainability due to global risk and change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Change the Minister of Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- To me, the Government already knows a lower growth rate 
<br/>will  eventuate  due  to  lack  of  economic  activities  but  would  not  admit  to  the  fact  and  are  giving 
<br/>excuses beforehand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President highlighted investment in robust and resilience infrastructure 
<br/>and announcing social safety nets for disadvantaged and low-income households.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the  above  investment  should  have  been  carried  out  in  mid-2023  when  the  infrastructure  projects 
<br/>initiated by FijiFirst approached completion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are few areas that I feel should be covered in more detail as it is critical 
<br/>and very important to the development of our people in the rural isolated communities. These are the 
<br/>main  resource-based  sectors  covering  agriculture,  fisheries  and  forestry.  These  resource-based 
<br/>sectors must be a priority as it can assist the resource owners and provide businesses to our people, 
<br/>especially in the establishment of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture is vital for the growth of tourism and most importantly, for food security. It also 
<br/>has  a  very  good  opportunity  for  export  and  improve  foreign  earnings.  The  sector  is  also  human 
<br/>resource intensive which can provide employment in the rural areas and value addition in urban and 
<br/>peri-urban. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fisheries is also an important sector and has provided source of income for our people in the 
<br/>maritime  islands  and  coastal  communities.  It  is  important  to  develop  storage  and  transportation 
<br/>facilities to move these products to urban areas for consumption and value adding for export. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Forestry,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  another  resource  sector  that  can  be  developed,  especially  in 
<br/>value addition. This will provide employment opportunities to our people and contributes positively 
<br/>to export earnings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other two important sectors that I believe need urgent attention is health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and education. These sectors need urgent attention and an increase in allocation of resource.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  remind  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism,  Civil 
<br/></span><span>Aviation and Education that TELS has been replaced by scholarship and that has a bond connected 
<br/></span><span>to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs to boost our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>83 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, give me another two minutes.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji needs investment to boost our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL. – Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- I understand that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Education stated in Nadi recently that the banks are flushed 
<br/>with money and a lot of approved loans have not been drawn done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are three important requirements that I would like to highlight as prerequisites to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fulfilled first before investors will invest: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Government must provide the right conditions for the private sector to invest. 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Investor confidence must be established to push the would-be investors to invest, as I have 
<br/>already alluded to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Government  must  take  the  lead  and  participate  in  local  direct  investment.    Invest  in 
<br/>infrastructure  and  services,  as  these  will  generate  employment  and  energise  the  private 
<br/>sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  plead  with  Government  to  look  at  the  issues  that  confront  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>marginalised people in Fiji attend to their daily issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I implore the Government and honourable Prime Minister to learn from the past 
<br/>year  and  reconsider  the  direction  they  are  taking  Fiji  to.  The  Government  must  re-evaluate  its 
<br/>performance in the last 14 months and make amends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.-  I am asking the honourable Prime Minister to deliver the 
<br/>change that was promised to the people of Fiji.  Fijians expect better than what they have experienced 
<br/>todate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I repeat, I am asking the honourable Prime Minister to deliver the change that was promised 
<br/></span><span>to the people of Fiji.  Fijians expect better than what they have experienced so far.  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister,  honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers,  honourable Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable  Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public present this morning and 
<br/>those joining  through livestream;  </span><span>nu bula  nakwa</span><span> and a very good morning  to  you all,  </span><span>Ramadhan 
<br/>Mubharak</span><span> to all our Muslim brothers and sisters and we wish them well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise before this august Parliament to express my sincere gratitude to His 
<br/>Excellency  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji,  </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  na  Tui  Macuata,  Taukei 
<br/>Bolatagane</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>for his thoughtful and inclusive speech that has resonated well with us all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  reminded  us  of  the  importance  of  our  role  as  Members  of  this  august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament and the need to promote harmony and embrace diversity in our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President shared the importance of leaving aside our differences for the 
<br/>common good of the people.  It is, therefore, crucial that we address the challenges faced by our 
<br/>island nation as we have the ability to enact policies and legislations that prioritise the protection and 
<br/>resilience of all our citizens.   Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  fully  applaud  and  support  the 
<br/>promotion  of  financial  literacy  as  a  way  of  empowering  people  with  financial  security  and  self-
<br/>reliance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s progressive agenda and legislative framework 
<br/>highlighted  by  His  Excellency  the  President  are  people  centred,  visionary  and  provides  a  good 
<br/>platform for our sustainable economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President’s Speech not only marks the dawn of the new 
<br/>Parliamentary Session, but also heralds a solemn summons to greatness.  It is a call that beckons us 
<br/>to rise above the challenges that lie ahead and embrace our role as custodians of the Fijian dream.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With humility and reverence, we, the Coalition Government, accept the mantle of leadership 
<br/>bestowed upon us by the people of Fiji.  It is a privilege and an honour that we do not take lightly.  
<br/>We stand committed to representing the hopes and aspirations of every Fijian, and to forging a path 
<br/>towards a future filled with promise and opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to respond to some of the comments that have been uttered in 
<br/>this august Parliament by some honourable Members on the rule of law.  I wish to remind honourable 
<br/>Opposition Members who were in the last Government that they should be the last ones to lecture us 
<br/>about the rule of law and the adherence to the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some examples that you have noted, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the sacking of the Solicitor-General 
<br/>during  their  term,  the  removal  of  the  Auditor-General  and  the  removal  of  the  Government 
<br/>Statistician.  This Coalition Government has brought freedom and respect for rule of law and real 
<br/>democracy.  The lies and misinformation will not convince the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government is optimistic that the domestic economic growth 
<br/>will certainly return to the pre-pandemic level.  The projected growth rate of 3.8 percent for 2024 
<br/>and 3.0 percent for 2025 is a testament of good financial management and effective policies by the 
<br/>Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, housing is fundamentally a human right enshrined in our 2013 Constitution 
<br/></span><span>and plays a crucial role in the development of our country, as it not only provides shelter, but also 
<br/></span><span>contribute to economic growth.  Over the years, there has been a growing focus on sustainable and 
<br/>affordable housing to address the increasing demands for housing in urban and rural areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as outlined by His Excellency the President, the new National Development 
<br/>Plan (NDP) that is  earmarked to  be  finalised in  June this year, will set  out  our collective efforts, 
<br/>initiatives and programmes for a more sustainable and resilient-built environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with the formulation of the new NDP, the review of the National Housing Policy will 
<br/></span><span>now be aligned to Government priorities to ensure consistencies and a more streamlined coordination 
<br/></span><span>amongst Government, the private sector and non-government organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to convey my sincere appreciation to the New 
<br/>Zealand Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  and Trade  for providing policy  assistance to  the Ministry of 
<br/>Housing to assist with the review of the 2011 National Housing Policy, which is now earmarked for 
<br/>completion this year.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a large proportion of our low-income households, who struggle to afford 
<br/>decent homes have access to our public housing programme managed by the Public Rental Board 
<br/>(PRB).  However, there is still a high demand that needs to be met.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to support the PRB in completing the Lagilagi Low Cost Housing 
<br/>project that will accommodate 36 families </span><span>and further</span><span> plan future development around Jittu Estate 
<br/>for development of affordable and low cost housing units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  ensure  the  transition  to  home  ownership,  the  Ministry  and  PRB  are 
<br/>collaborating  to  design  a  Rent-to-Own  Scheme  for  existing  tenants.  This  Scheme  will  provide 
<br/>households with an opportunity to build equity in a home while renting, making it easier for them to 
<br/>eventually become homeowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry will continue to facilitate and support the implementation of 
<br/>the Public Private Partnership project with  International  Finance Cooperation for developing five 
<br/>sites that will provide around 3,000 housing units. These sites are Raiwaqa, Suva; Nepani, Nasinu; 
<br/>Wainibuku, Nasinu; Davuilevu, Nausori; and Tavakubu, Lautoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  land  development  projects  carried  out  by  Housing  Authority  provide 
<br/>housing options for low and middle income earning families. In December 2023, Covata Subdivision 
<br/>in  Labasa  was  completed,  providing  103  residential  lots.    An  online  portal  was  also  established, 
<br/>providing an efficient and transparent for the public to lodge their applications to purchase a lot and 
<br/>build their own dream homes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Mokosoi  Subdivision  project  in  Deuba  is  near  completion  and  is 
<br/>expected to provide a total of 34 lots with allocation of green areas which the public can use for sports 
<br/>or leisure activities. These projects  create sustainable and inclusive communities for people from 
<br/>various backgrounds and contribute to increasing home ownership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to assist first time homeowners through the First Home Ownership 
<br/>Initiative for those with household income below $50,000, as well who’s earning a household income 
<br/>between $50,000 to $100,000 and may access government grant to buy or build their first home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this financial year, the Ministry approved 113 applications under the First 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Home Ownership Initiative, with a total payout of $1.9 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  review  of  the  income  brackets  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  that  most 
<br/></span><span>deserving low-income households will have access to financial support to meet their housing needs 
<br/></span><span>and help the most vulnerable in society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  will  be  working  with  our  stakeholders  to  promote  and 
<br/>encourage green building practices that will mitigate environmental impact of housing development, 
<br/>while simultaneously improve its resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the implemation of infrastructure upgrades for our informal settlements and 
<br/>providing  access  to  affordable housing options will  continue to  be undertaken by the Ministry to 
<br/></span><span>improve the living conditions of those living in informal  settlements and help them integrate into 
<br/></span><span>formal urban environments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry’s  Informal  Settlement  Upgrade  Programme  will  continue  with  upgrades  for 
<br/>informal  settlements,  providing  settlers  with  access  to  basic  utilities  such  as  water,  sanitation, 
<br/></span><span>electricity, drainage and road.  Upon  completion of the upgrades, settlers  are issued with 99-year 
<br/></span><span>lease titles, providing long term security tenure.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  three  informal  settlements  have  had  their  upgrades  completed  following 
<br/>vigorous challenges with a total of 451 households undergoing lot allocation process to receive the 
<br/>99-year  lease  titles.  These  settlements  are  Ledrusasa,  Nadi;  Cuvu,  Sigatoka;  and  Waidamudamu, 
<br/>Nausori.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, four more informal settlements are in construction phase, and these are in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sakoca, Nasinu; Tavela, Nadi; Field 40, Lautoka; and Tore, Lautoka; with a total of 378 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  the  end  of  this  financial  year,  the  Ministry  will  have  an  additional  four  informal 
<br/>settlements ready for construction phase.  The settlements are Vuniika, Labasa; Wakanisila, Nasinu; 
<br/>Valewaquyaya, Ba; and Delaisaweni, Lautoka; with a total of 350 households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry will also be establishing a National Housing Database which 
<br/>will  be  comprehensive  and  a  centralised  system  that  aims  to  collect,  manage  and  maintain 
<br/>comprehensive and up-to-date data related to the housing sector, including information on housing 
<br/>units, occupancy rates, tenure types, construction materials, property condition and green building 
<br/>initiatives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the long-awaited Local Government Elections stand as a testament to the 
<br/>Coalition Government’s commitment to return democracy, transparency and accountability for all 13 
<br/>Municipalities in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through tireless dedication and perseverance, we have paved the way for a future where every 
<br/>voice is heard and every vote counts. A feat that could not have been achieved without the collective 
<br/>support  of  the  Fijian  Elections  Office,  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General  and  the  13  Municipal 
<br/>Councils.  The support of our development partners cannot go unacknowledged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to respond to the comment made by honourable Hem Chand 
<br/>yesterday on the appointment of Towns and Cities Special Administrators.  He referred to them as 
<br/>political appointees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  I  wish  to  remind  him  that  two  of  the  current  Special 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Administrators were part of the former Minister’s appointees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- The new Special Administrators were appointed based on merit, 
<br/>experience  and  their  potential  to  bring  about  changes  to  their  respective  Municipalities.    I  invite 
<br/>honourable Chand to  the next  Special Administrators  Forum, and he will be able to  witness how 
<br/>knowledgeable and committed they are in their new roles.  The main role of a Special Administrator 
<br/>is to prepare the Municipalities for the Local Government Elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the amendment to the Local Government Act 1972 was just the beginning, 
<br/></span><span>the hard work begins now with civic education, voter education, voter registration and finally, the 
<br/></span><span>Local Government Election. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Strategic  Master  Plan  for  Vitilevu  has  been  completed  and  will  be 
<br/>presented to Cabinet in the coming weeks. We have received overwhelming support and commitment 
<br/>from  all  stakeholders.  The  Ministry  took  control  of  the  project  to  ensure  that  Fiji’s  growth  and 
<br/>development is undertaken in a sustainable manner and is transformative.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>87 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on new town development, Fiji is becoming increasingly urbanised with 
<br/>approximately half of our population living in urban and peri-urban areas.  A significant percentage 
<br/>of Fiji’s GDP is produced in urban areas, and this has added pressure to land due to competing uses. 
<br/>Urbanisation is real and rapid in Fiji, and with it comes its share of positives and challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Urban areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, establishes the space and pace for rural economic development 
<br/>through provision of markets, agro-processing centres and transit points into larger centres. This has 
<br/>led to added pressure on urban services and utilities provision such as road network, efficient and 
<br/>safe water supply, electricity and solid waste collection and disposal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  2023-2024  financial  year,  the  Ministry  commenced  Phase  1  of  three  critical 
<br/>development  projects.   These included Nabouwalu Passenger Terminal,  Nabouwalu  Town Centre 
<br/>and Keiyasi new town development.  The Seaqaqa town development project is being initiated with 
<br/>the market facility project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moving forward, the Ministry will strategically develop Concept Plans for 
<br/>Navua,  Taveuni,  Dreketi  and  Vunidawa  over  the  financial  year,  fostering  sustainable  growth  and 
<br/>community wellbeing, and recognising the importance of rural-urban linkages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  market  development  in  their  respective  municipalities  is 
<br/>conducive to growth of new economic activities. The Mini-Market in Dreketi was completed by the 
<br/>Coalition Government in September 2023, whilst my Ministry is working towards the main market 
<br/>for the Dreketi Satellite Town.  Markets in Savusavu, Nakasi and Levuka will be completed in the 
<br/>2023-2024 financial year, similarly for Levuka, as well as Savusavu and Nakasi Markets.   Taveuni 
<br/>Market will be a key development focus for the 2024-2025 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, together with market development and other infrastructure projects funded 
<br/>by Municipal Councils, we continue to beautify our cities and towns. We wish to ensure that there is 
<br/>a boost in economic activities and for that, we need clean, safe and beautiful cities and towns.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils have been urged to enhance their service delivery to the ratepayers, residents 
<br/>and the community at large. I have challenged the Councils to review and strengthen their internal 
<br/>policies, plans and standard operating procedures to  address  the needs of  our people better.   It  is 
<br/>imperative that we uplift image of the Councils as well the Municipalities and change the way we do 
<br/>business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry,  through  the  Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning, 
<br/></span><span>focussed  on  identifying  and  addressing  process  issues  for  building  and  development  planning 
<br/>approvals.   A pilot project was launched with three Councils that helped further improve process 
<br/>issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, within the first three months, that is, September to November 2023, processing 
<br/>turnaround timelines have significantly improved by 90 percent.  Furthermore, with the digitalisation 
<br/>of building permits, there is an urgent need to review and modernise the Town and Country Planning 
<br/>Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  legislation  that  can  respond  to  the  needs  of  a  dynamic  and  ever-changing 
<br/>environment.  Since the revised process has been implemented, approximately $500 million worth 
<br/>of building developments have been approved by the Department of Town and Country Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, once again, I thank His Excellency the President for his opening Speech, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>am deeply grateful for the opportunity to stand in Parliament and deliver my response.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless Fiji. May God bless us all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and those present  in  the gallery, as  well as those joining  us through social media and 
<br/>various other digital means; good morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to take this opportunity to thank His Excellency for his Speech during the opening 
<br/>of Parliament for 2024.  In his Speech, His Excellency has raised many issues affecting our country.  
<br/>One of the issues he has talked about is maintaining law and order - something for this Government 
<br/>to seriously consider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In my contribution, Sir, I will briefly speak about the law and order situation in the country 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and how it leads people to leave our beloved nation and the impacts of migration on Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a 10 percent increase in overall crime for the month of January this year is 
<br/>alarming.  There is  a serious  concern about  the  worrying increase in  crime against women and  a 
<br/>significant increase in the number of illicit drug cases registered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  crimes  against  women  recorded  a  31  percent  increase  with  252  cases 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>received in January 2024, compared to the number recorded for the same period last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  of  the  252  cases,  17  percent  were  committed  in  the  domestic  setting, 
<br/>primarily by spouses or partners, and women between the ages of 18 to 38 represented the largest 
<br/>number of victims. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is also worrying that Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm cases involving 
<br/>women increased from 139 cases recorded for the month of January 2023, to 167 cases for the same 
<br/>period this year, and rape cases rose from 14 to 35 cases, with some reports recording multiple counts.  
<br/>During the month of January, the most prevalent offences were Assault Causing Actual Bodily Harm 
<br/>(315  cases),  Theft  (280  cases),  Unlawful  Possession  of  Illicit  Drugs  (153  cases),  Burglary  and 
<br/>Aggravated Burglary (138 cases) and Criminal Intimidation (84 cases). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember in the last session of Parliament when I raised that there is a 
<br/>significant increase in the crime rate, the honourable Minister of Finance replied, and I quote; “I do 
<br/>not know where he is getting the figures from.”  These are the official figures released by the Acting 
<br/></span><span>Commissioner  of  Police.    While  my  colleague,  honourable  Koroilavesau,  was  speaking,  I  was 
<br/></span><span>observing the honourable Minister of Finance saying, “lies, lies.”  Let me remind him that we all 
<br/>know who the liar is, in fact, he is the professional liar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will not be wrong if I say that you are the professor of liars. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He was not talking about unemployment at all.  You do not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have any data on unemployment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Sir, one may ask, what is the reason for the huge statistical increase?  The 
<br/>simple answer is, it reaffirms and reflects the way the Coalition Government has performed in the 
<br/>last 14 months.  This reflects the lack of faith the Fijian people have in the Government of the day.  
<br/>When the Government does not respect the law, people also feel they can do the same and with the 
<br/>public’s dissatisfaction with the authorities, a lot of crimes are not reported.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>89 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Acting Police Commissioner agrees there is nepotism, backbiting and 
<br/>mistrust within the Force.  According to the Acting Commissioner, these things happened when there 
<br/>is  a  lack  of  trust  within  certain  groups,  focusing  on  their  own  personal  agendas.    What  personal 
<br/>agendas are we talking about? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is the mess you created in the Police Force. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Taking revenge, recruiting your families and promoting your friends within 
<br/>the Force.  These appointments involving Party supporters, sympathizers, financiers and unsuccessful 
<br/>election candidates indicate the Government’s attempt to exert control over governance structures.  
<br/>Such appointments discriminate against qualified individuals who lack political backing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  colleagues  have  spoken  about  these  Civil  Service  appointments,  Boards,  Special 
<br/>Administrators, and I will just give one example of the appointment of Advisory Councillors.  We 
<br/>were told that the Advisory Councillors would be elected.  I happened to be in the West last week, 
<br/>Sir, and I met a group of friends who told me that one Advisory Councillor went to live in that area 
<br/>just over a month and he was appointed as an Advisory Councillor.  We understand that the Advisory 
<br/>Councillors need to know the people in the area.  They need to know the area itself; they need to 
<br/>know the problems faced by the people in that area.  There are many examples that I can give, Sir, 
<br/>but this gentleman was appointed because he is a supporter of a particular Party in Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, political appointments erode trust in the existing systems and processes, and 
<br/>this  adversely  affects  service  delivery,  institutional  strength  and  leads  to  brain-drain.    The  Fiji 
<br/>National  Provident  Fund  has  noted  an  increase  in  migration  withdrawals  last  year.    It  has  been 
<br/>revealed that the migration withdrawals reached up to $83.8 million last year.  In 2022, it was $42.9 
<br/>million.   The increase in  the migration withdrawals  basically shows the  movement  of our people 
<br/>abroad for better prospects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The steady erosion of the talented, highly skilled portion  of the population is  devastating.  
<br/>While Fiji has historically been a migrant recipient country, during the last four decades, the reverse 
<br/>has been the case.  Emigrants from Fiji were estimated to exceed 222,000 in mid-2019 and almost 
<br/>all  were  in  four  countries  -  Australia,  Canada,  New  Zealand  and  United  States  of  America.  
<br/>Permanent migration in the 1970s through to the early 2000s to Pacific rim countries, largely Fijians 
<br/>of Indian descent, contributed to declining growth rates in Fiji’s population and shifts in the ethnic 
<br/>composition of the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the  waves of emigration that followed many  </span><span>coups</span><span> in  the 1980s  and 2000, skilled 
<br/></span><span>workers and professionals fled vital sectors, such as education, engineering and healthcare, causing 
<br/>skills  shortages.    Migration  has  also  resulted  in  societal  issues  including;  family  dissolution,  a 
<br/>decrease in the proportion of young people from rural areas, and changes to community and family 
<br/>structures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me talk about some of the reasons for brain-drain: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The presence of better career possibilities abroad can cause a brain-drain.  We can create 
<br/></span><span>those opportunities here too, but we do not promote the experience or the qualified people, 
<br/></span><span>we promote our friends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opportunities for growth such as greater jobs, higher living standards and easier access to 
<br/>housing and healthcare.  How can we have higher living standards when the cost of living 
<br/></span><span>has really gone up?  Before the Elections, people were promised that the prices of goods 
<br/></span><span>and services will go down but as soon as the Government came in, 15 percent VAT.

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Educational advancement and innovation.  What is there for those who do not qualify for 
<br/>universities?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Political unrest and instability.  Persecution based on sexual orientation, gender, religion 
<br/>and  political  affiliation.    We  can  see  the  cases  of  the  former  Prime  Minister,  former 
<br/>Attorney-General and former Commissioner of Police, we all know what is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Insecurity and safety are threatened.  I have already spoken about the increase in crime rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me now inform the people of Fiji about the effects/causes of brain-drain: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Brain-drain represents the biggest threat to a country’s population, its negative impact on 
<br/>the economy, leading to poor standard of living including poverty.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Poor  health,  lower  quality  goods  and  services.    The  departure  of  skilled  professionals 
<br/>creates  a  shortage  of  expertise  within  crucial  sectors  such  as  healthcare,  engineering, 
<br/>technology and education.  Last week, I happened to visit a Government hospital.  I went 
<br/>to see a lady doctor who was so kind, she did diabetes check and my blood pressure, apart 
<br/>from the normal check-up.  She told me, “We are facing shortages”.  I really appreciate 
<br/>what the doctors, nurses and professionals are doing.  They are going out of their way to 
<br/>look after their patients and we appreciate that.  How long will they carry on this workload?  
<br/>Out of frustration, they will resign and go.  We need to correct that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Weakened workforce.  When highly skilled individuals leave a country, it results in the loss 
<br/>of intellectual capital and talent pool that could have contributed to innovation, research 
<br/>and economic growth.  Sir, yesterday during lunch break, I went to a bank and there was a 
<br/>long queue and upon inquiry, I was told that those serving are trainees because qualified 
<br/>people have left.  So, it takes a lot of time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This phenomenon, also known as “human capital flight”, meaning that a country in brain-
<br/>drain continuously depletes human capital, eventually falling into a permanent skills deficit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  Author,  Tara  Brian  –  International  Organization  for 
<br/>Migration</span><span>,</span><span> as of mid-2019, more than 222,000 Fiji-born people resided abroad. This is more than 
<br/>double the size of Fiji’s emigrant population in 1990, Sir, which stood at just over 90,000. This figure 
<br/>mostly  refers  to  people  born  in  Fiji  who  live  abroad.    Migration  from  Fiji  to  Australia  peaked 
<br/></span><span>immediately following Fiji’s 1987 </span><span>coup </span><span>with 2,980 settler arrivals during 1987 to 1988. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  </span><span>Migration  in  the Republic of  Fiji:   A Country Profile 2020  </span><span>showed that 
<br/>these figures slowed from the early 2000s onwards with an average of 1,340 new permanent Fijian 
<br/>settlers in Australia each year between 2000 and 2016.  90ust over 1,150 settled permanently in 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the stock of Fiji-born migrants living in Australia increased from about 
<br/>41,000 in 1996 to more than 77,100 in 2019.  However, the average annual growth rate of the Fijian 
<br/>population in Australia increased from about 41,000 in 1996 to more than 77,100 in 2019.  However, 
<br/>the average annual growth rate of the Fijian population in Australia slowed from 3.3 percent between 
<br/>1996 and 2006, to 2.8 percent the following decade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  most  recent  average  annual  growth  rate  of  the  Fijian  population  figure  is  1.4  percent 
<br/>annually between 2017 and 2019.  But these figures have significantly increased in the last 14 months 
<br/>since the Coalition Government has taken over the governance of this country.  People are leaving 
<br/>due to the high cost of living, no job opportunities, increase in crime and drug related offences, police

<br/>and promoting people not on merit but whom you know basis, frustration, and many other reasons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people should know some of the migration impacts on education, medical 
<br/>and other professional  sectors in  Fiji.   The author Tara Brian reports that the large emigration of 
<br/>Fijians of Indian descent from 1987 to early 2000 caused significant skill losses, particularly in the 
<br/>education and health sectors.  Between 1987 and 2004, around 10,700 professionals migrated from 
<br/>Fiji, including architects, engineers, teachers, accountants and medical workers, representing over 
<br/>half of the country’s middle to high-level workforce.  Teachers are thought to be the most prevalent 
<br/>group among  Fijian professionals that departed the nation between 1987 and 2001. Only the best 
<br/>qualified teachers tended to emigrate to work overseas because of the strict qualification criteria in 
<br/>popular emigration destinations, like Australia and New Zealand, which made the shortages in Fiji 
<br/>worse.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is concerned about the departure of qualified healthcare personnel, in 
<br/>addition to teachers.  Fiji was listed as one of the top 10 nations with the greatest physician emigration 
<br/>rates  by  the  World  Bank  in  2011.    Australia  and  New  Zealand  employed  almost  as  many  Fijian 
<br/>physicians as there were in Fiji in 2006, as well as a higher proportion of Fijian nurses and midwives 
<br/>than in their home countries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In 2011, FijiFirst was there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Azmat  Gani,  a  former  Academic  in  Economics  at  the 
<br/>University of the South Pacific and a Senior Economist with the Reserve Bank of Fiji, in his research, 
<br/>reports as per the Fiji Bureau of Statistics 1998 Official Statistics between 1987 and 1997, 52,000 
<br/>Fijians migrated to high income countries.  Between 1986 and 1994, Fiji Indians made up the majority 
<br/>of immigrants, making approximately 84 percent to 90 percent of all emigrants; emigrants of ethnic 
<br/>Fijian descent made about 4.5 percent to 7 percent of all emigrants during that time.  Small numbers 
<br/>of minor ethnic groups have also moved.  Fiji Indians, who were the majority ethnic group prior to 
<br/>1987, are now the second largest ethnic group in the country due to migration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, May 2000 civilian </span><span>coup</span><span> destroyed what little trust was there between the 
<br/>two major races in Fiji, and it is clear that longstanding rivalries and fears still have a big influence 
<br/>on the political structure in Fiji.  It is unlikely that migration would significantly decline in the near 
<br/>to medium term; on the contrary, a rise is anticipated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Land security has long been a major cause of concern for the people of Indian descent in Fiji.  
<br/></span><span>This issue will also remain the main factor influencing Fijian migration patterns until it is resolved.  
<br/>Apparently, as long as destination nations have skill shortages that Fijian expertise can fill, skilled 
<br/>individuals will continue to move from Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Dr. Miliakere Kaitani’s study commissioned by the Global Development 
<br/>Network in 2011, found out that just when looking at the migrants themselves, 59 percent of those 
<br/>who are absent migrants from the households are highly skilled and educated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who was in government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.-  I am talking about when this research was done, not who was governing at 
<br/>that time.  Hence, the report on the economic and social impacts of migration in Fiji supports a theory 
<br/>that migration has led to a brain-drain.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lakshmin Mudaliar, a researcher at the Victoria University of Wellington, claimed in 2017

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that emigration will continue to deplete the human capital of Pacific countries, like Fiji.  Nevertheless, 
<br/>the  expansion  of  higher  education  demand,  the  universality  of  basic  education,  and  our  limited 
<br/>comprehension of obstacles and hindrances to emigration could be contributing to brain-drain in the 
<br/>Pacific region, especially in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what can governments do?  Brain-drain is a major issue for many countries, 
<br/>and Fiji is particularly vulnerable because of its reliance on the workforce for most of its economic 
<br/>growth.  The loss of such employees might have a significant effect on the growth and prosperity of 
<br/>the country.  To tackle this issue, governments must  devise strategies for retaining their qualified 
<br/>workforce.  Re-training and upskilling the local workforce increase job prospects and changes the 
<br/>way multinational firms see developing countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  an </span><span>FBC News</span><span> article  in  July  2022, according  to  the former Minister for Economy,  Mr. 
<br/>Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, the government invested in education to upskill Fijian employees and counter 
<br/>brain-drain.  The tourism sector is the latest industry to see offers from Australia for chefs and this is 
<br/>threatening the manpower in the tourism sector.  He says that Fiji cannot compare itself with larger 
<br/>economies, like Australia and the United States of America, as they provide higher benefits when 
<br/>offering jobs.  Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum stressed that education is key to maintaining experienced people 
<br/>in different sectors of the economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the budget for that year (2022), the FijiFirst Government placed strong emphasis 
<br/>on providing funding for short-term courses, allowing students to complete Year 12, emphasizing 
<br/>the importance of skills qualification and providing numerous incentives for people to pursue training 
<br/>in  those  areas.    The  public  and  private  sectors  were  eligible  for  Masters  and  Doctorate  Degrees 
<br/>offered by the then government.  He emphasized that businesses that choose to support university 
<br/>students will receive a tax break, a 100 percent write-off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our recommendation and way forward is to promote the development of 
<br/>skills  that  satisfy  international  qualification  requirements  and  labour  demand  sectors,  while  also 
<br/>benefitting the domestic labour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, round off there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Examine programmes aimed at encouraging and facilitating the successful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reintegration of returning…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Lal, please, round off now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Alright, I will round off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, because of the good policies of the FijiFirst Government and the hard work 
<br/>of the former Minister for Economy,  Fiji was one of the five fastest recovering economies in the 
<br/>world post-pandemic. The tourism industry was booming, economic prospects improved and there 
<br/>was a lot of optimism.  But everything has been going in the opposite direction since the Coalition 
<br/>Government was sworn in because there is a lack of decisive and visionary leadership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last Session of Parliament, all 55 Members of Parliament voted on a motion to protect 
<br/>our  oceans.    On  the  contrary,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  went  ahead  and  allowed  Japan  to 
<br/>contaminate our oceans.  Then he talks about the Ocean of Peace. Fiji sides with Israel and supports 
<br/>the killings of innocent and vulnerable civilians in Gaza and jeopardizes our international reputation.  
<br/>There are many other examples I can give of the Government’s indecisive leadership, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, but I will leave that to my colleagues.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  a  leadership  that  guarantees  stability,  equality, 
<br/>security and equal opportunities for all Fijians. As the former Prime Minister and Leader of FijiFirst, 
<br/>Mr. Frank Bainimarama, has always said, and I quote, “no one should be left behind”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, believing in each other, working together and helping each 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other guarantees stability, certainty and equality and this is what FijiFirst gave Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Who is your leader? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- One leader. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No running commentary, honourable Ketan Lal.  You have taken us back to 1987 but, please, 
<br/>I would like to implore on each and every one of you and those who are still to make their responses, 
<br/>just concentrate on the delivery made by His Excellency, instead of going back.  All you are doing 
<br/>is digging up old bones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament for morning tea.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.05 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Cabinet, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians; I rise in response to thank His Excellency for 
<br/>his most Gracious Speech in opening Parliament for 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before  I do go on to share the plans for the Ministry, I feel  the need to 
<br/>respond to some of the noise that have come from the other side.  I say this with all sincerity, I wish 
<br/>I did not have to, but it is important for the members of the public to receive the information and to 
<br/>put everything into perspective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this morning, honourable Koroilavesau accused us of lacking direction in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>handling the economy.  But, first, the lack of direction is coming from the Opposition…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL. – Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- … in just the first day of responses to His Excellency the President’s 
<br/>Speech.  It is very clear.  One Member says, “decrease the debt”, another Member says, “increase the 
<br/>debt”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  The  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  says,  “broaden  the  tax 
<br/>base”, another says, “do not increase VAT”. The honourable Leader of the Opposition says, “find 
<br/>alternatives  to  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission”  and  yet,  honourable  Bulitavu’s 
<br/>presentation is talking all about the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why do they not have Shadow Ministers?  Honourable Kumar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been saying, “we do not really need it, we do not believe in it.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- What’s the problem, it is our affairs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- But you all get up and talk about everything and anything, so you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>become the jack of all trade, but a master to none. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- As the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection, I do not 
<br/>even know who to talk to about bipartisanship.  I do not know who is their Shadow Minister.  I ask 
<br/>the question, what is going on with the Opposition?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- What is going on? Are you really united as you say that you are?  Are 
<br/>you really united?  At least on this side of Parliament, we have one  Leader and that is our Prime 
<br/>Minister.  Our responses align to our Leader, the honourable Prime Minister, but here is the problem 
<br/>with the Opposition.  They have one Leader of the Opposition and then there are others from out 
<br/>there, remote controlling what is happening.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Please, FijiFirst, please, choose one Leader and be aligned to your 
<br/>Leader.  The honourable Seruiratu should really be the Leader of your Party, please.  Get on the same 
<br/>page, he is more than capable and, in his speech, he is stately and is all for working together for the 
<br/>good of our people.  But that cannot be said for the rest of them and the remote controllers from out 
<br/>there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Koroilavesau stated there is massive unemployment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- </span><span>Areh! </span><span>There is a huge shortage of labour, just pick up the paper and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>look at the shortage of labour.  So, how can there be huge unemployment?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 22,000 people left in 2022.  That was under which Government?  So, yes, 
<br/>there was exodus during your time too – mass exodus.   And through the Labour Mobility Scheme, 
<br/>this is  what  is  happening.  So, please, do not  try and blame it on the local  or domestic  forces or 
<br/>elements that are happening.  In fact, they shut down the vocational colleges that are supposed to be 
<br/>helping our people to become employed. So, some self-reflection there, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we are following the reflection shared by His Excellency the President 
<br/>at  the  Opening  of  Parliament,  we  were  reminded  of  our  roles  as  democratically  elected 
<br/>representatives, compelling us to listen to all voices in our nation, encompassing every citizen, young 
<br/>and  old,  men  and  women  in  all  their  diversity.  This  directive  highlighted  by  His  Excellency 
<br/>profoundly aligns with the mandate of our Ministry. We are immensely grateful for this call to action 
<br/>which underpins our dedicated efforts and objectives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Provide employment opportunities for people begging on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the streets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- The Assistant Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has outlined our Ministry’s plans for social protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Then why are people there begging on the streets? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  That  is  a  very  interesting  observation  made  by  honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, Mr. Speaker.  In fact, majority of our street people and street kids, did you know, have 
<br/>psychosocial problems and they need to be rehabilitated?  You have never thought of that during 
<br/>your governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Before  they  can  find  meaningful  employment,  they  need  to  be 
<br/>rehabilitated and trained, and then put to employment.  You do not just pull them off the street and 
<br/></span><span>employ  them.  And,  yes,  the  Government  has  plans,  Mr.  Speaker,  to  start  the  first  ever  Drug 
<br/></span><span>Rehabilitation Centre for street kids.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Members interject)

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes, because they have psychosocial issues.  You need to deal with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that first.  He does not get that, maybe, he has never spoken to any of them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- As we stand at the crucial crossroad, Mr. Speaker, for gender equality 
<br/>and  achieving  our  SDG’s  2030  Agenda,  it  is  vital  to  grasp  the  context  we  are  navigating.    The 
<br/>Coalition Government is prioritising these in its proposed National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  midst  of  gender-based  violence,  economic  and  climate  crisis,  emerging  artificial 
<br/>intelligence and the future of work, the challenges we face are unprecedented.  When we reflect on 
<br/>the  data  and  observance  of  International  Women’s  Day  last  week,  and  amidst  the  ongoing  68th 
<br/>Session of the Commission on the Status of Women, it is paramount that our collective discussions 
<br/>and efforts are intertwined with the urgency of propelling gender equality forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I wish to clarify that I am not attending because I am prioritising Parliament.  
<br/>Thank  you,  Sir,  for  making  that  plea,  as  well  as  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  deciding 
<br/>accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- This year, the theme is, “Accelerating the Achievement of Gender 
<br/>Equality and the Empowerment of all Women and Girls by Addressing Poverty and Strengthening 
<br/>Institutions  and  Financing  with  a  Gender  Perspective”,  sets  a  clear  and  ambitious  path  for  us  to 
<br/></span><span>follow.  Solutions to accelerating gender equality and end women’s poverty are widely recognised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to invest in evidence-based policies and programmes that address gender inequality 
<br/>and boosting women’s rights and agency and leadership.  This approach is integral to the Coalition 
<br/>Government’s strategic agenda.  Our vision is clear – to cultivate interconnected initiatives that are 
<br/>deeply  rooted  in  evidence  and  data,  bridging  across  the  entirety  of  Government’s  operations  and 
<br/>reaching every corner of our population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank honourable Virendra Lal for sharing the statistics on the alarming rates of 
<br/></span><span>violence against women and children and, yes, these statistics have not changed for the last 10 years.  
<br/></span><span>Two out of three women still face violence, and that includes technology facilitated gender-based 
<br/>violence or online violence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  such  a  context,  I  am  proud  to  highlight  the  key  flagship  whole  of  Government  Gender 
<br/>Equality Strategic Initiative which includes the National Action Plan to Prevent Violence Against all 
<br/>Women and Girls 2023–2028.  With a $1 million investment from the National Budget, along with

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$6 million commitment by the Government of Australia in the next five years, the implementation 
<br/>has already rolled out this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Prime Minister highlighted in his statement on the occasion of International 
<br/>Women’s Day,  a review would be carried out  at the end of this year to  ensure we deliver  for all 
<br/>women and girls and prevent violence before it starts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  we  have  embarked  on  the  development  of  the  Fiji  Women’s  Economic 
<br/>Empowerment  National  Action  Plan  2024–2029,  approved  by  Cabinet  earlier  this  year.    The 
<br/>commencement  of  this  critical  framework  on  8</span><span>th</span><span>  March  signalled  the  start  of  an  extensive 
<br/>consultation  process  and  in-depth  desk  reviews with  a particular focus on being  anchored in  data 
<br/>analysis from the “Fiji Country Gender Assessment” launched by the Ministry in late 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our commitment to rolling out Fiji Women’s Economic Empowerment National Action Plan 
<br/>(WEENAP), as it is called, by late 2024, at least, by International Women’s Day 2025 is steadfast, 
<br/>aiming to lay a robust whole of Government inclusive and evidence-based groundwork for catalysing 
<br/>transformative change in the economic empowerment of women and girls across Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, additionally, as part of the Public Financial Management Improvement Plan, 
<br/>the  Coalition  Government  has  significantly  taken  strides  in  institutionalising  gender  responsive 
<br/>planning  and  budgeting  as  part  of  our  governance.    This  effort  is  amplified  by  the  Gender 
<br/>Transformative  Institutional  Capacity  Development  Initiative  led  by  our  Ministry,  which  works 
<br/>across  all  Government  sectors  to  build  necessary  capacities  for  gender  responsive  planning  and 
<br/>budgeting.  And as we recall, Sir, in our first ever budget, we were able to achieve, for the very first 
<br/>time in the history of Fiji, a gender responsive budgeting across the three Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In February 2024, in partnership with the Ministry of Finance, we commenced the design of 
<br/>a flagship Accountability for Gender Equality project, with the initial support from the Government 
<br/>of New Zealand.  Expected to launch in late 2024, this five-year project will serve as a cornerstone 
<br/>for tracking  the effective implementation  of  critical  gender policies and initiatives, establishing  a 
<br/>foundation for gender transformative planning and budget allocations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.    Speaker,  Sir,  our  commitment  to  gender  equality  and  women’s  empowerment 
<br/>necessitates a departure from the traditional approach of addressing women rights issues in isolation.  
<br/>By  adopting  the  above  holistic  approach,  we  underscore  the  critical  need  to  acknowledge  the 
<br/>interwoven challenges faced by all women and girls in Fiji, from the alarming rates of gender-based 
<br/></span><span>violence to the barriers in political participation, societal pressures, limited access to reproductive 
<br/></span><span>health  services,  poverty,  scarce  employment  opportunities  and  the  disproportionate  impact  of  the 
<br/>climate crisis.  These issues are not isolated but part of a complex ecosystem affecting Fijian women’s 
<br/>lives in profound ways.  Simplifying these complex problems into detached over-simplified actions 
<br/>will not foster the meaningful change we seek.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is dedicated in driving forward initiatives that not only tackle these 
<br/>challenges  head  on,  but  also  lay  the  groundwork  for  sustainable  progress.  We  are  committed  to 
<br/>transforming Fiji into a nation where gender equality is not just an aspiration, but a realised principle 
<br/></span><span>embedded in every aspect of our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now speak about our Children’s Department.   Fiji is a party to the 
<br/>Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).  This year, we will see us honouring our commitment 
<br/>to the protection of all children under the CRC.  This is especially the case for those deprived of 
<br/>parental care, and those who cannot remain with their families because of abuse or neglect.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can achieve this by legislating our responsibility under CRC to provide protection and 
<br/>assistance to children temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment.  We are not 
<br/>seeking to do this just because of our commitments under a Convention, we are doing this because 
<br/>we, as a Coalition Government, want to elevate and bring to life children’s rights, their development 
<br/>and their wellbeing.  We want to give all Fiji’s children the best future they can possibly imagine.  
<br/>We know very clearly what we need to do to make this happen.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In June 2021, the previous Government received a list of issues prior to submission of the 
<br/>combined  fourth  and  fifth  Periodic  Report  under  CRC’s  implementation.    The  Committee  on  the 
<br/>CRC was concerned about the situation of children deprived of parental care in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee pointed out that the number of residential homes and of children coming into 
<br/>residential care, has increased over the years.  Most children find themselves in residential care due 
<br/>to neglect and poverty, children spend very long periods of time in residential care, and there were 
<br/>no alternatives to residential care such as, foster care.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, the system we have is based on an outdated philosophy of rescue and removal that 
<br/>was developed under the Juveniles Act 1974.  But since the CRC, we know that this approach has 
<br/>become more and more outdated because of its inability to promote children’s holistic development 
<br/>within  their  own  family  and  community.  This  approach  hinders  the  full  implementation  of  our 
<br/>obligations under the CRC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that I take very seriously.  The CRC Committee has asked 
<br/>the Fiji Government to report back on what it is doing to support and prioritise family base care for 
<br/>children who cannot live with their parents.  I am proud to tell you today that we have worked very 
<br/>hard to address this, but we will go further.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year, we have put before Parliament a plan and legislation that responds to the calls from 
<br/>the CRC.  It also frames the Coalition Government’s actions so that Fiji’s children are not just safe, 
<br/>but they are loved and are participating in decisions made about them.  The key plan to advance this 
<br/>is the legislation I would put to Parliament this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do acknowledge the good work of my predecessors, as mentioned by honourable Bulitavu. 
<br/>The  two  Bills  that  will  come  before  Parliament  was  initiated  by  the  previous  Government  -  the 
<br/>Childcare and Protection Bill and the Child Justice Bill.  These Bills have been widely consulted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Draft Bills prioritise family preservation and family-based forms of care. In line with the 
<br/></span><span>guidance under the CRC, they promote prevention of family separation and the need for alternative 
<br/>care,  as  well  as  alternatives  for  child’s  replacement,  in  order  that  the  best  option  can  be  chosen 
<br/>according to the specific situation of the child.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  Bills  explicitly  acknowledge  and  reinforce  the  key  role  of  parents,  families  and 
<br/>communities  in  raising  children  and  protecting  them  from  harm.    They  also  clearly  present  the 
<br/>distinction  between children in  need of care  and protection and children  in  conflict  with  the law. 
<br/>Where duties were confined to responding to the child after being abused, the new Bills define the 
<br/></span><span>Director Children’s duties broadly to encompass prevention, early intervention and response services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inter-agency collaboration is also recognised with the roles of CSOs and traditional leaders. 
<br/>Options for voluntary care plans can be negotiated with the child’s parents where Court Orders are 
<br/>used as a last resort when agreements cannot be reached.  The child, the parents, extended families 
<br/>and traditional community leaders can be actively involved with care planning.  Priority is given to 
<br/>kinship and family base care.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>99 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These two Bills are a key plan in the broader legal and policy framework that we have already 
<br/>introduced  to  protect  children,  including  the  Adoption  Act  2020  and  the  revised  Interagency 
<br/>Guideline  on  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect.    But  they  will  also  advance  the  broader  child  rights 
<br/>aspirations of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  this  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  the  goal  of  the  Ministry  to  bring  to  this  Parliament  a 
<br/>National Action Plan for the Prevention of Violence against Children.  Ultimately, I know you can 
<br/>have the best legislation and policy in the world, but you need the people in our Civil Service, our 
<br/>civil society and the broader Fijian community to support these aspirations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our legislation and policy are the critical </span><span>yavu</span><span> (foundations), or the </span><span>duru balavu</span><span> (posts), of 
<br/>the </span><span>vale vakaviti</span><span> (house), but our newly established Department for Children will be the </span><span>delavuvu ni 
<br/>vale</span><span> (roof rafters).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  I  look  forward  to  a  fruitful  year  as  we  venture  into  new 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achievements. Allow me to conclude with a Bible verse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It always baffles me when there is a Christian verse to be quoted and 
<br/>that is the response from the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I conclude with the quote from Joshua 
<br/>1:9: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Remember that I have commanded you to be determined and confident! Do not be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>afraid or discouraged, for I, the Lord</span><span> </span><span>your God, am with you wherever you go.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>God  bless  our  women,  God  bless  our  children,  God  bless  our  elderly,  God  bless  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vulnerable, and God bless Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to speak 
<br/>on  His  Excellency  the  President's  Speech.    I  join  my  colleagues  who  have  spoken  earlier  in 
<br/>acknowledging His Excellency’s Address to the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  seems  that  the  Government  side  is  not  taking  the  President's  Speech 
<br/>seriously.  Just like their Election promises, they failed to deliver what His Excellency the President 
<br/>announced last year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.– Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Again, this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency stated key priorities, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which I am sure will not be delivered by this confused, clueless and inexperienced Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, almost 15 months has passed, and the Government is still grappling with 
<br/></span><span>uncertainties in steering the country forward.  His Excellency announced that the major priority of 
<br/></span><span>the Government is the formulation of the new National Development Plan - an exercise that should 
<br/>have been completed in the first six months after taking office.  They spent eight years in Opposition 
<br/>criticising Government but prepared no plan to take the country forward.  After 15 months, a plan is 
<br/>being developed but when will it be implemented? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During public consultations, people have asked the Government to reduce the cost of food, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they are asking the cost of food needs to go down now and not how they will do it after the plan 
<br/>is developed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of the public are frustrated and angry, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with poor public service 
<br/>delivery  and  the  high  cost  of  living  which  the  honourable  leader  of  National  Federation  Party 
<br/>promised to reduce, as his first priority, once he is in the Government. It is on record, Sir.  However, 
<br/>he made matters worse by increasing taxes, duties and levies, and, of course, school fees which was 
<br/>increased or reintroduced by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people have noticed that this Government is too busy forming committees 
<br/>and  developing  plans  and  frameworks,  or  busy  with  workshops  and  conferences,  rather  than 
<br/>addressing bread and butter issues and law and order situation in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the economy does well, the country does well and ultimately, people 
<br/>do  well  with  more  money  in  their  pockets,  boosting  consumer  investor  and  business  confidence.  
<br/>Merely saying that people should have confidence will not lead to confidence, like some Ministers 
<br/>preach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was not logical for the Government to increase VAT and duties when global inflation is 
<br/>high.  A terrible recommendation from the Fiscal Review Committee, Mr. Speaker, Sir, which was 
<br/>blindly followed by the Government. Unfortunately, the honourable Prime Minister actually said that 
<br/>15 percent VAT was too high. I hope he would have stuck to that and would not have allowed the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance to go ahead with his plan, and I will tell you why! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the existing global inflationary pressures, the price of imported goods is already high.  
<br/>Why is it high? It is caused by increase in freight and insurance expenses.  Adding more duties and 
<br/>taxes makes the products and services out of reach for many low-income families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. Absolutely brutal! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiscal  Review  Committee’s  recommendation 
<br/>caused more harm than good to our economic recovery where the poor were punished and selected 
<br/>few were rewarded. For example, those earning more than $270,000 had a reduction in personal tax 
<br/>and removal of their social responsibility tax… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame, absolute shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- …causing a revenue loss of $2.2 million.  Who benefitted? The answer 
<br/>is, the rich. The lawyers, the accountants,  the CEOs and the company directors were actually  the 
<br/>beneficiaries, including the Chairman of the Fiscal Review Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, figures do not lie.  There are preliminary indicators of our economy hitting 
<br/>the brakes.  Despite increasing taxes, duties and levies, our revenue collection is down. There is a 
<br/>noticeable slowdown in consumption and new investment lending, and the slow uplifting of approved 
<br/>bank loans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An observation, but not alarming, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2022, our foreign reserves stood at 
<br/>$3.4 billion, sufficient for 6.9 months of imports.  By February 2024, just after 15 months, data shows 
<br/>our reserves dropped to $3.2 billion, covering only 5.1 months of exports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency mentioned that our debt level is around $9.9 billion or 75.6 
<br/>percent of GDP.  In dollar terms, the debt increased while percentage to GDP decreased. We had no

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cyclones, no pandemic, no new projects, but that went up without showing any tangible benefits that 
<br/>help in bringing the food to the table.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that refinancing loans is not loan repayment. Taking money 
<br/>from Paul to pay Peter does not resolve the loan issue, it merely transfers the debt from one source 
<br/>to another.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government had to borrow to protect 
<br/>households and businesses from economic hardships and health-related challenges during COVID-
<br/>19 and earlier cyclones. The borrowed funds were used for fiscal stimulus measures to kick-start the 
<br/>economy and to continue with the development projects, which the Fiscal Review Committee and, 
<br/>of course, the honourable Minister of Finance decided to remove all these incentives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the projects that are on hand are building - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new markets, as you can see in Savusavu and Levuka.  
<br/>Roads.  
<br/>new schools and renovated schools.  
<br/>Hospitals.  
<br/>the Viria Water Project.  
<br/>upgrading of informal settlements which you have heard from the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Housing, who was just microwaving.  Whatever he said was done under FijiFirst.  
<br/>informal settlements, including Cuvu, Ledrusasa and Waidamudamu, the 12 projects which 
<br/>are in the pipeline.  
<br/>bridges such as Toga Bridge in Rewa, Wainawi in Kasavu, Tavualevu in Tavua, Vuniyasi 
<br/>in Nadi, Nayarabale in Cakaudrove, are all bridges designed and executed by FijiFirst.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public  Private  Partnership  Housing  Project  which  the  honourable  Minister  for  Housing 
<br/>mentioned which was initiated by FijiFirst with the completion of land preparation and engagement 
<br/>of International Finance Corporation (IFC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the past 15 months, the Coalition Government has been busy unveiling 
<br/>projects and engaging in ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Now, they should stop lying to the public and in 
<br/>this Parliament that the FijiFirst Government did nothing.  And each time you cut a ribbon, just say, 
<br/>“Thank you, FijiFirst”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> (Honourable Member interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- At least, I am seen to be doing something.  Well, let the public judge 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what FijiFirst did for this nation and we challenge you to do better than us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President also highlighted the importance of financial 
<br/>literacy to empower our people with financial security and self-reliance. Financial literacy was started 
<br/>by the previous Government around 2008 after the global financial crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A National Taskforce on Financial Inclusion was formed. An independent baseline study was 
<br/>conducted in November 2011 to assess the financial competencies of low-income households in Fiji. 
<br/>This  study  was  used  to  develop  the  National  Strategy,  with  the  aim  to  lift  the  levels  of  financial 
<br/>competency of all Fijians. There are many institutions now offering financial literacy programmes, 
<br/>considering the need in our society.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, having said that, I recommend financial literacy session for the honourable 
<br/>Members sitting across. Yesterday, honourable Gavoka, with pride, stated that Fiji is the only country 
<br/>in the Pacific that has made tertiary education free by wiping out TELS loan of $650 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is true, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Australia and New Zealand could not forgive loans, despite being 
<br/>a developed nation, and they also support our annual national budget from where we fund our free 
<br/>tertiary education. The question is, why Australia did not forgive students loan when their GDP is 
<br/>running in trillion dollars?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  they  understand  that  it  is  not  a  sustainable  and  responsible 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- They recognise the inherent challenges of setting aside money every 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year for free tertiary education from their national budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, TELS provided a revolving fund that allowed students to borrow for tertiary 
<br/>education and pay once they are employed to keep the fund revolving. Government will never have 
<br/>the finances to turn every future TELS loan into a scholarship from here onwards. Many of our youth 
<br/>will miss out on acquiring any tertiary education because the loan option is no longer available. So, 
<br/>I ask, Mr. Speaker, can we reconsider the interest of the people of Fiji ahead of personal and political 
<br/>ambitions of SODELPA by re-establishing the loan scheme?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Still on finance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s operational  cost  can be  reduced  if Ministers’ and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Assistant Ministers’ junket trips overseas are cut back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Absolutely!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We have heard how the honourable Minister for Sports flew to the 
<br/>USA and then to Australia to get a visa for Canada to watch Rugby Sevens.  We  have also heard 
<br/>from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Employment’s  many  excursion  trips  to  Australia  to  address 
<br/>workers’ issues out there, neglecting the workers here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the operational cost can also be reduced if we trim the number of Ministers 
<br/>and Assistant Ministers,  plus three Deputy Prime Minister positions in a country with less than a 
<br/></span><span>million people.  So, honourable Minister for Women, Children and  Social Protection, you should 
<br/></span><span>stop talking about leadership on this side, and try and reduce the number on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The operational costs could have been reduced with the timely appointment of a tribunal to 
<br/>look at the dismissal of the Police Commissioner and the DPP who are on full pay.  If FijiFirst would 
<br/>have done this, the media would have gone to town with it.  Imagine three Deputy Prime Ministers.  
<br/>But now, with the so-called free media, they have gone quiet, even the weekly articles from Richard 
<br/>Naidu has stopped.  Now, he is mute under free media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency said that we must be united with one common goal, to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that we live in a progressive and prosperous nation.  For a progressive and prosperous nation, the 
<br/>Government must create stability, safety and security, follow the rule of law, uphold the Constitution; 
<br/>anything less undermines the nation’s progress and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly,  Fiji  is  not  stable  under  the  Coalition  Government.  The  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Education himself has admitted that every

<div><span>time there is any kind of commotion within the Coalition, it is immediately felt in the country.  The 
<br/>worry is that this Government is full of commotions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  urged  all  of  us  to  faithfully  embrace  with  resolve  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>principles of democracy and humanity as enshrined in our Constitution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that political favouritism and nepotism 
<br/>is running rampant.  Individuals affiliated with PAP, NFP and SODELPA, who were unsuccessful 
<br/>candidates or part of the campaign team during the 2022 Elections have been appointed across the 
<br/>Civil  Service,  Boards,  Committees,  Diplomatic  Missions,  Advisory  Councils  and  Special 
<br/>Administrators  to  Municipal  Councils.    To  accommodate  more  of  their  cronies,  now  they  have 
<br/>created advisors in the ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Mr.  Mikaele  Leawere  and  Ms.  Salabula,  both  failed  politicians,  found 
<br/>shelter as advisors on the Ministry of Education’s payroll.  It is quite amusing to see Mr. Leawere as 
<br/>an Advisor, officiating at a prize-giving ceremony. Why should the taxpayers pay them as Advisors 
<br/>for trivial tasks?  I urge the media to uncover these dubious appointments.  One has to just pick up 
<br/>the phone, go to the FEO App, look at the candidates who stood for the elections and see where they 
<br/>are now.  That is all they have to do, and I urge the nation to do this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition partners were not put in power just to handpick their political 
<br/>buddies over career civil servants and meritocracy.  I have heard, but I stand to be corrected, that the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Local Government intends to release all CEOs of Municipal Councils after 
<br/>their  contracts  end.    He  intends  to  appoint  the  Chairman  of  Special  Administrators  as  Executive 
<br/>Chairman, which is a new trend for this Government to reward their cronies.  If this happens, it will 
<br/>completely erode trust in this Government. Taking the job away from the career civil servants and 
<br/>deserving citizens with no political connection in favour of their political buddies is a disservice to 
<br/>the nation.  Is this fair to our voters who put you there?  Whose interest are you looking after?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  accountability  and  transparency  are  two  words  heavily  misused  by  this 
<br/>Government.    Why  is  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  not  disclosing  the  names  of  two  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers who are under investigation by FICAC?  While the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Tourism’s name is out for his alleged involvement in Fiji Airways “travel first pay later” 
<br/>scandal, such glaring inconsistencies erode the principles of good governance and cast doubt on the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister’s credibility, integrity and his leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  any  democracy,  the  taxpayers  can  demand  accountability  and 
<br/>transparency from the Government and the elected Members.  In a recent Fiji Airways exclusive deal 
<br/>“travel first pay later” offered to a selected 200 travellers, the honourable Minister for Tourism and 
<br/>Fiji Airways displayed total disrespect to the taxpayers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  disappointing  to  see  that  honourable  Gavoka  did  not  attempt  to 
<br/>investigate the matter or to seek a response from the Chairman of Fiji Airways Board.  Instead, we 
<br/></span><span>were told by the honourable Minister to leave the airline alone and not much can be done because 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Airways is not a Government company or statutory body.  Is this the type of leadership we want 
<br/>in Fiji?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they have forgotten that it was the taxpayers who bailed Fiji Airways out 
<br/>during COVID-19. We do not want another NBF saga.  The question on everyone’s minds is, why 
<br/>such a small deposit was taken and what due diligence was carried out before approval was granted

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to travel without full payment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to achieve the priorities as outlined by His Excellency needs a strong leader 
<br/>with clear vision.  Unfortunately, the honourable Prime Minister tends to flip flop on critical matters 
<br/>of national importance, causing confusion and uncertainty.  It started with a mini-budget issue.  The 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister wanted a mini-budget but honourable Prasad objected to a mini-budget, 
<br/>so the honourable Prime Minister gave up.  Again, the honourable Prime Minister said 15 percent 
<br/>VAT was too high, but honourable Prasad still went ahead; again, the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>gave up.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, even after admitting the underperformance of certain honourable Ministers, 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister moved away from a much-needed Cabinet reshuffle twice, prioritising 
<br/>political survival over national interest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It does not end here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Parliament agreed not to support 
<br/>the  release  of  Fukushima  wastewater  into  the  Pacific  Ocean,  but  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>without Cabinet approval, decided to support Japan which made SODELPA denounce the decision 
<br/>of the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, without Cabinet approval, the honourable Prime Minister decided not to support the 
<br/>UN resolution calling for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to the people in Gaza which led to the 
<br/>NFP  expressing  its  disagreement  and  disappointment  with  the  Government.  Being  part  of  the 
<br/>Government,  they  were  expressing  their  disappointment  to  the  Government.    This  is  the  state  of 
<br/>affairs.  All these needs to be discussed in Cabinet, not outside Cabinet as they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  actions  cast  a  shadow  over  the  honourable 
<br/>Prime  Minister’s  ability  to  guide  the  country  towards  progress  and  prosperity.    It  shows  that  the 
<br/>Government is in disarray, solving their internal issues rather than putting national issues over their 
<br/>political survival.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister reminded parents to take leadership in their 
<br/>family but today I ask the honourable Prime Minister to take leadership of his Government and listen 
<br/></span><span>to the voices of the poor who are suffering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker,  the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and fellow Members of Parliament; </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka saka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to add my  voice in response to the Address of His Excellency the 
<br/>President at the opening of the 2024 Parliamentary session.  In a speech delivered with statesmanship, 
<br/>yet lined with pragmatism, His Excellency underscored the complementary principles of harmony 
<br/></span><span>and embracing diversity. In grounding those principles, His Excellency recalibrated the landscape of 
<br/></span><span>this august Parliament for a united front with one common goal: to steer Fiji towards enduring peace 
<br/>and prosperity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  our  responsibility  as  parliamentarians  to  not  only  acknowledge  our 
<br/>strengths and successes but also to take up the yoke where we can and work together to progress a 
<br/>united Fiji for the people that we represent.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>105 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, racism has no place in our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.S.  QEREQERETABUA.-  Unfortunately,  I  have  clearly  detected  this  during  the 
<br/>contribution by some honourable Opposition Members. It was, as His Excellency said, and I quote: 
<br/>“…some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust amongst our communities for their 
<br/>own political ends” spreading mistrust and suspicion by making sweeping generalisations attacking 
<br/>individual members without fact.  If you have facts, honourable Members, please, table them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Criticising the write-off of TELS loans worth over $650 million and describing it as not free 
<br/>education because recipients will be bonded, for example, some honourable Members on the other 
<br/>side continue to confuse loans with bonds. Under this Government right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, more 
<br/>than 50,000 families can breathe a sigh of relief as they do not have loans to pay off but can have a 
<br/>salary earner without having a loan repayment connected to their studies, hanging over their heads 
<br/>because of a bond. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to respond now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to some of honourable Premila Kumar’s comments.  
<br/>We  have  received  criticism  from  the  Opposition  that  we  are  only  continuing  the  projects  of  the 
<br/>previous Government. Sir, what I want to say to that is this, these are projects for the people of Fiji 
<br/>that the previous Government was stalling.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- They made announcements, they had allocated budgets, 
<br/>but  no  effort  or  commitment  was  ever  made  to  even  start  the  projects  and  I  will  just  name  two 
<br/>examples.  The first is the Nabouwalu Town Centre Project which was announced in 2016, but six 
<br/>years  after  that,  what  was  done?    Nothing.    The  second  example  is  the  Keiyasi  Township 
<br/>Development, which was announced in 2015 for seven years, what was done?  Nothing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I turn my attention now to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Ministry is 
<br/>pursuing  Fiji’s  interest  under  the  three  pillars  of  sovereignty,  security  and  prosperity,  amidst  a 
<br/>complex  and  dynamic  international  environment.  The  emerging  geopolitical  posturing,  socio-
<br/>economic challenges and a rapidly shifting global order has become the norm now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  sovereignty  pillar,  the  Ministry  will  advocate  for  territorial  integrity  and  the  core 
<br/></span><span>elements of sovereign statehood as enshrined in the UN Charter.  We underscore what defines us as 
<br/></span><span>a nation, our identity, our values and aspirations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry recognises the richness of our cultural diversity. Yet, we exist in an international 
<br/>system where rules require that whatever our views are on issues that matter to us and to our friends 
<br/>abroad, must be consistent with international laws and its practices as a minimum.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  security,  the  Ministry  will  be  guided  by  the  traditional  and  non-
<br/>traditional  aspects  of  this  pillar.  The  Ministry  recognises  the  expanded  definition  of  security  as 
<br/></span><span>encapsulated in  the Pacific  Islands Forum’s  </span><span>Boe Declaration</span><span>.   Bilateral  and multilateral  relations 
<br/></span><span>need to be re-energised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A new framework of order of cooperation within our regional  ‘Ocean of Peace’, currently 
<br/>under construction, will provide the umbrella concept that brings into harmony the 2050 Strategy, 
<br/>the  </span><span>Boe  Declaration</span><span>,  Nuclear  Non-Proliferation,  and  related  regional  initiatives.  This  will  be 
<br/>underscored by the Pacific Way of dialogue, affinity, solidarity and collective action.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  places  particular  importance  on  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s concept of the Ocean of Peace. The concept is premised on Pacific identity and values, 
<br/>the same values that underpin our aspirations for national and regional coexistence, brought about by 
<br/>tolerance,  respect,  freedom  and  peace.  These,  in  turn,  ensure  a  safe  and  secure  region  where  our 
<br/>people can live peaceful and worthwhile lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg, which is the illicit drug trade in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji. While we fight this on many fronts, most of these drugs originate from abroad. At the handover 
<br/>ceremony of the Guardian Class Patrol Boat in Perth, Western Australia, last week, the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister highlighted the growing scope and intensity of transnational organised crime. He then 
<br/>emphasized the need for cooperation and inter-operability of our Pacific family members. No one 
<br/>country can tackle this menace alone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the non-traditional security challenges will converge with regional 
<br/>and  international  programmes  and  frameworks  and  the  Ministry  will  cooperate  with  partners  to 
<br/>champion  Pacific  led  and  Pacific  specific  development  solutions  in  the  economic,  food,  health, 
<br/>climate change, environment, humanitarian and community domains.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, socio-economic issues are fundamental to the prosperity pillar and Fiji’s 
<br/>economy will be promoted and facilitated to improve market access, connectivity, mitigate external 
<br/>challenges, encourage foreign investment, build domestic capacity and develop the skills that Fiji 
<br/>needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Central to our approach on prosperity in international relations is our focus on development 
<br/>and poverty alleviation. These two - development and poverty alleviation, reach into the very heart 
<br/>of our people. Guided by the principle of inclusivity and the distinctive brand of Fijian diplomacy, 
<br/>the  end  goal  is  to  enable  Fiji  to  capitalise  on  strategic  and  comparative  economic  and  social 
<br/>advantages that increase Foreign Direct Investment inflows and investment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in line with the Government’s aim to advancing economic growth, the Ministry 
<br/>will seek development support for the advancement of key enablers or infrastructure construction, 
<br/>for  example,  roads,  ports,  slipways,  shipbuilding  and  telecommunication.  Furthermore,  these  are 
<br/>aimed  at  enhancing  connectivity  and  trade,  improving  competitiveness  and  raising  investor 
<br/>confidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry,  Mr.  Speaker,  has  been  accorded  the  added  responsibility  of  our  diaspora 
<br/></span><span>communities worldwide.  Their contribution to the national economy is well recorded and publicised 
<br/></span><span>and hugely appreciated. Our diaspora community is an extension of our economic space. Their status, 
<br/>connections and wellbeing remain our concern.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, with partners and our diaspora-communities, are developing a Diaspora Policy 
<br/>that recognises their right of choice, movement, potential and also upholds their status and integrity. 
<br/>The Policy will, amongst  other things, examine return and investment  options  within a migration 
<br/>model that recognises their capacity and sense of affinity with Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Foreign Policy of the previous Government expired at the end of 2022.  During this 
<br/></span><span>current year, the Ministry has been guided by a Transition Plan that will run to the end of the current 
<br/>financial  year.  With  determined  diplomacy,  invigorated  multilateral  and  bilateral  approaches,  the 
<br/>Ministry has re-established relations within a fractured region, regained the confidence of our friends 
<br/>and enhanced co-operation with like-minded partners.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>107 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In view of this advancement, the Foreign Policy White Paper will be the guiding document 
<br/>that  spells  out  the  Government’s  statement  on  foreign  policy  in  concert  with  the  National 
<br/>Development Plan, economic, investment, trade and security policies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The White Paper, Sir, is an opportunity to project Fiji to the world; to explain Fiji’s identity, 
<br/>our values and how it sees the region and the world and our ambitions in foreign policy. The White 
<br/>Paper is  also  a platform to  explain to  a domestic audience  where foreign policy fits  into national 
<br/>objectives. The White Paper will serve as the conceptual basis for making decisions on foreign policy, 
<br/>thereby lending a discipline to policy making.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, bilaterial and multilateral relations globally and with our Pasifika neighbours 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are the cornerstones of Fiji’s International Development and a key consideration in the Ministry’s 
<br/>focus. The Ministry prioritises this to enhance cooperation in the areas of trade, agriculture, tourism, 
<br/>fisheries, forestry, health, education, youth, women, socio-economic development, capacity building, 
<br/>connectivity, leadership and especially people to people relations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue to expand its presence and diplomatic footprints globally. This 
<br/>will include the reopening or relocation of Diplomatic Missions, Consulate Generals, the engagement 
<br/>of  Honorary  Consuls  at  strategic  locations  to  improve  effectiveness,  efficiency  and  return  on 
<br/>investments. The Ministry recognises the significance of partnerships in responding to multiple crisis 
<br/>and concerns with events that have significant global impacts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as the global community adjusts to counter various geopolitical, geo-strategic 
<br/>and  development  challenges  against  the  backdrop  of  a  worsening  climate  and  biodiversity  crisis, 
<br/>international cooperation and collaboration has never been more relevant and more in demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  only  six  years  remaining  to  the  target  date  of  2030  in  the  full 
<br/>implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Agenda,  the  Ministry  will  work  together  with 
<br/>partners on the various development blueprints, to ensure better deliveries and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you well know, the Vuvale</span><span> </span><span>and Duavata</span><span> </span><span>partnerships with our Pacific 
<br/>neighbours  -  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  have  advanced  our  aspirations  while  mitigating  the 
<br/>challenges we face.  With the support of our development partners, the wheels of Fiji’s development 
<br/>agenda and economic recovery continue to turn.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji actively engaged in the negotiations of the recently adopted High Seas Treaty or BBNJ, 
<br/></span><span>for the protection of the oceans for the benefit of all. We were among the first countries to sign the 
<br/></span><span>Treaty on the opening day of signing in New York in September 2023.  Works are underway to ratify 
<br/>this Treaty before the 2nd UN Oceans Forum in France in 2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through the Maritime Affairs Coordinating Committee, Fiji continues to 
<br/>progress  work  on  negotiations  of  maritime  boundaries  with  neighbouring  countries.    Fiji  has 
<br/>completed  its  full  submission  on  the  Extended  Continental  Shelf.  This  will  be  tabled  to  the 
<br/>Commission on Limits of the Continental Shelf this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji is actively engaged with other Pacific nations in the negotiations for a legally binding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Global Plastics Treaty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is strategically positioned to capitalise on geo-political developments 
<br/>within the Indo-Pacific region. Our engagement is important in promoting Fiji's economic and social 
<br/>development. Fiji was among the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific (OACP) countries 
<br/>that  signed  the  EU-OACP  (Samoa)  Partnership  Agreement  in  November  2023.  The  ambitious

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Framework, which outlines a Pacific Regional Protocol, emphasises the increasing  importance of 
<br/>aligning such Frameworks to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. We intend to ratify 
<br/>this Agreement in partnership with the Pacific ACP group of countries as soon as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  will  continue  to  channel  efforts  to  secure  leadership  and 
<br/>membership  roles  in  international  and  regional  bodies  and  lobby  to  secure  the  engagement  of 
<br/>nationals into key intergovernmental and international organisations. This will be complemented by 
<br/>the efforts to secure Global Agreements and the affiliation in trade blocs, thereby, securing advances 
<br/>in trade infrastructure and access.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, being the hub and gateway to the region  comes with responsibility. The 
<br/>Ministry will support the public, private and business sector initiatives that are designed to increase 
<br/>trade, market access and support regional associations that create efficient and effective economic 
<br/>infrastructures in the region. Consideration will also be accorded to social and primary sector support 
<br/>and other drivers of economic growth and poverty reduction.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will pursue a renewed Pasifika focus to reinforce regional relations through the 
<br/>historical, cultural and people to people links within Fiji’s hub and gateway status. These are critical 
<br/>stepping stones towards a shared “</span><span>Common Wealth”.  </span><span>Sir, we recognise that the Ministry is called to 
<br/>a role that is much larger than ourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will consider how to put in place a whole of Government 
<br/>machinery where foreign and domestic policies work in tandem and where all arms of Government 
<br/>work together in an integrated strategy of delivery.  As a necessary step, clarity in our direction and 
<br/>our goals enables us to deliver more with less. Our faith, values and principles remain the cornerstone 
<br/>of our Republic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will not be complacent or reactionary but will be audacious in our pursuit of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>excellence, and agile in the ever-changing international environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament; I acknowledge and welcome my fellow citizens seated in the gallery and those tuning 
<br/>in via livestream on the  Walesi</span><span> </span><span>platform or Parliament of Fiji </span><span>Facebook </span><span>live.  My humble greetings 
<br/>to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  comment  on  some  of  the  key  features  of  His  Excellency  the 
<br/></span><span>President of Fiji’s Address at the Opening of the Second Session of Parliament on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are fortunate to live in a country blessed with fresh air, clean water, 
<br/>sunshine, sand, sea, and above all, a God-loving nation.  This nation was built upon the sheer hard 
<br/>work and commitment of all its people, irrespective of race, religion, colour, creed and education.  
<br/>Everyone has paved the path to success by working in unison, and it will only continue if we can 
<br/>provide a conducive and passive environment.  We are so blessed that the 2013 Constitution respects 
<br/>and recognises each and every one who call Fiji their home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stand before you today to share my views on utter incompetence and deceit that has become 
<br/>the trademark of this Coalition Government. For too long, we have been subjected to a never-ending 
<br/>parade of broken promises, lies and sheer negligence at the highest levels of power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government lives up to its promises, as shared by His Excellency.  
<br/>Most of what His Excellency shared in 2023, the Coalition Government failed to deliver.  They made 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>109 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>numerous promises during Election and failed to deliver, despite being 14 months in Government.  
<br/>They continued to do so in failing to deliver what His Excellency had shared in this Parliament.  Let 
<br/>me be clear, this Government’s track record is a disgrace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They promised unity, economic prosperity and a better future for all Fijians. Yet, what they 
<br/>have delivered is division, economic hardship and a mass migration because people simply lacked 
<br/>faith in this Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency addressed us on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023 where he said, and I quote from Page 13 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Your Government’s mission is to build unity through social cohesion and further 
<br/>improve  and  strengthen  our  economy  through  sustainable  growth  with  the  ultimate 
<br/>objective of improving the lives of all the people of Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is guilty of failing to improve and strengthen our economy. The 
<br/>high cost of living is witnessed, and we face the lack of innovation from the Government to mitigate 
<br/>these high costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The racial attacks that plague our society are a direct result of this Government’s failure to 
<br/>promote  unity  and  tolerance.    While  ordinary  Fijians  struggle  to  make  ends  meet,  our  esteemed 
<br/>Ministers jet-set around the word on lavish trips, completely disconnected from the harsh realities 
<br/>faced by those whom they are meant to represent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KUMAR.-  Congratulations,  indeed,  to  this  Government  for  their    unparalleled 
<br/>mastery  of  deception  and  incompetence.  They  excel  in  betraying  the  trust  of  the  Fijian  people, 
<br/>implementing VAT hikes and presiding over a circus of incompetence and self-interest  while the 
<br/>country languishes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Congratulations on lying to the people of Fiji, especially your supporters, who now witness 
<br/>daylight betrayal.  Congratulations on providing hardship to ordinary Fijians with a VAT increase of 
<br/>15 percent.  Congratulations on entertaining us with your Cabinet dramas, while ordinary Fiji suffer 
<br/>in silence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Congratulations and thank you for continuing the FijiFirst policy, while you try to rebrand 
<br/></span><span>some and name it your own.  Congratulations on having new Police Stations for Nadi, Lautoka and 
<br/>Nakasi, and not having an official opening because Fijians will see that those Police Stations were 
<br/>negotiated, planned and built by FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Congratulations on all official opening of the infrastructural projects that 
<br/>FijiFirst has been kind enough to leave you with.  The infrastructure projects they boast of were laid 
<br/></span><span>down by the hard work of the previous Government, yet they shamelessly take credit for that.  Their 
<br/></span><span>inability to deliver on their promises is a slap in the face of every Fijian, who believed in their empty 
<br/>rhetoric.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable  Minister  responsible  for  the  Viria  Water  Project’s  opening,  when  will  you  fulfil  the 
<br/>landowners’ demand you promised them?  Please, deliver accordingly because there are more than 
<br/>300,000 people in the Central Division, waiting for regular water supply.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we hear you, Sir, of your desire to build this nation sustainably, it is rather unfortunate 
<br/>that our colleagues on the other side of Parliament seem to be distracted from the virtues of good 
<br/>governance  and  coherence,  as  it  seems  that  quite  often  than  not,  they  seem  to  be  engulfed  in 
<br/>protecting and promoting the interests of the Coalition partners and, no doubt, if those selected have 
<br/>the necessary skillset and understanding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  highlight  a  few  issues  relating  to  infrastructure.    The  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  had  achieved  sustainable  levels  of  infrastructural  development  and  growth.    Yes,  it 
<br/>required major capital outlay, but it was intended to take us into the future and allow for sustainable 
<br/>development  and  growth,  being  conscious  of  the  changes  in  climatic  conditions  and  the  adverse 
<br/>impacts of natural disasters.  The current Government actions have created nothing, but a significant 
<br/>manufactured catastrophe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  mentioned  about  formulating  the  new  National 
<br/>Development Plan (NDP).  May I ask, what is the wrong with the current one?  Fijians formulated a 
<br/>20-Year NDP with the FijiFirst Government and over the years, it has proven successful.  For the 
<br/>bridges alone, FijiFirst was able to construct 52 new bridges and repaired 200 old bridges.  I urge the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  not  to  try  and  fix  something  that  is  not  broken.    The  consultation  in  the 
<br/>formulation of this new NDP should not be an excuse for the delay in development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is interesting to note that the anticipated economic growth levels of 3.8 
<br/>percent and 3.0 percent for the years 2024 and 2025, we hope that this can be achieved and that too 
<br/>is sustainable.  However, with the Coalition Government’s action or knee-jerk reactions to change 
<br/>things and undo the FijiFirst Government’s progress, we fear adverse implications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, migration has been taking place since the 1980s.  There was a departure in 
<br/>1987,  2000  and  now.    To  achieve  projected  economic  growth  for  this  year,  one  of  the  factors  to 
<br/>encounter is by continuing to invest in our human capital.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is guilty of failing to improve people’s lives.  This is evident from 
<br/>the high  number of people  migrating abroad.  The brain-drain  caused by their  incompetence will 
<br/>haunt us for generations to come, as our best and brightest seek greener pastures elsewhere.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a population under the age of 40 years old migrating.  During FijiFirst time, we were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proud to have 70 percent of our population under 40 years as they are the economic drivers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is heartbreaking to witness our Fijians losing confidence in this Coalition Government and 
<br/>leaving our shores in numbers.  The people who have worked tirelessly to grow and develop our 
<br/>resilient infrastructure, have left our shores, leaving a significant vacuum that Fiji will struggle to fill 
<br/>in the decades.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Could  the  Coalition  Government  foresee  and  analyse  this?    The  country’s  population  is 
<br/></span><span>declining, our childbearing population has moved out and continues to move out, and our market size 
<br/>is shrinking.  Has the Government of the day even risen to realise this fact?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight some concerning issues from my area in the Province of 
<br/>Naitasiri.  I urge the honourable Minister for Home Affairs to strengthen the Police Force, since now, 
<br/>our farmers have become the targets.  Their agricultural produce and livestock are no longer safe.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>111 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Government’s legacy will be one of false promises, incompetence and betrayal.  It is 
<br/>time for them to face the music and answer for their failures.  The people of Fiji deserve leaders who 
<br/>act in their best interest, not in the interest of a selected few.  Enough is enough.  It is time for a 
<br/>change, and it starts with holding this Government accountable for their actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  Benjamin  Franklin’s  wise  words,  “You  may  delay,  but  time  will  not.”    Coalition 
<br/>Government, please, do not delay.  Do not delay development and focus on the country.  Do not delay 
<br/>economic improvement and wellbeing, as His Excellency alluded to in his Speech.  Do not delay 
<br/>agriculture development and financial literacy training.  Do not delay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  an  Opposition  Member  of  Parliament,  my  role  is  crucial  in  holding  the  Government 
<br/>accountable and advocating for the interests of the people.  Thus, I am asking the Government for - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regular  updates  and  reports  on  Government  spending,  policies  and  decision-making 
<br/>processes, to ensure transparency and accountability. 
<br/>fair and just governance practices, including combating corruption, promoting the rule 
<br/>of law, and ensuring that Government officials are held accountable for their actions.   
<br/>policies  that  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  support  small  businesses,  create 
<br/>jobs and reduce income inequality.   
<br/>measures  to  address  social  issues  such  as  poverty,  inequality,  healthcare  access, 
<br/>education and housing affordability. 
<br/>policies that protect the environment, combat climate change and promote sustainable 
<br/>development practices.   
<br/>protection and promotion of human rights for all citizens, including the marginalised 
<br/>and vulnerable population.   
<br/>improvements in public service delivery, including healthcare, education infrastructure 
<br/>and social welfare programmes.  
<br/>meaningful engagement and collaboration with Opposition Members in the decision-
<br/>making process, to ensure diverse perspectives are considered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji needs a Government that is responsive, accountable and serves the needs of the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In His Excellency’s closing remarks, he stated, and I quote from Page 11 of His Excellency’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Address on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“To all our citizens, wherever you are viewing this Address from, I challenge to 
<br/>stay informed about the policies and decisions made by your elected representatives, and 
<br/>to hold them accountable for their actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge all our citizens to continue to engage in constructive, respectful dialogue, and 
<br/>to seek understanding and common ground in our diverse society.  This is a democratic 
<br/>way that we all must value and cherish”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I share the same sentiment and encourage all Fijians, locally and globally, 
<br/>to  stay  informed.    Update  and  familiarize  yourself  with  the  policies  and  decisions  made  at  this 
<br/>Parliament.  Get involved, participate, do not stay silent, and join your Opposition in ensuring that 
<br/>the Coalition Government delivers what it promised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, I feel for most Fijians who are suffering silently because they wanted a change.  I feel 
<br/>for those who struggle to put, at least, one meal on the table.  I pray that the Coalition Government 
<br/>focuses on the welfare of all Fijians.

<div><span>Before  I  take  my  seat,  it  is  only  proper  to  wish  my  Christian  brothers  and  sisters  many

<br/>holy month of Ramadhan and finally, to my Hindu folks, a Happy Holi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for allowing me this time. I thank each and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition and fellow honourable Members of Parliament; firstly, may I congratulate your good-self 
<br/>on the successful Opening of the new Parliamentary term 2024-2025.  Indeed, time and tide wait for 
<br/>no man.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  now  into  the  second  year  of  the  Coalition  Government’s  term  and  your  sterling 
<br/>leadership of the last year in presiding over this Parliament must be commended, especially on your 
<br/>approach towards the encouragement of bipartisan agreements towards matters of mutual interest for 
<br/>both sides of Parliament where our people have looked to us to put their interest before political party 
<br/>preferences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indeed, Sir, this is where your experience comes in handy and given our political journey 
<br/>together in 2014, I am well aware of your intentions towards the development of our people.  </span><span>Vinaka 
<br/>saka vakalevu na nomuni veiliutaki kei na veituberi</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, changing a Government is the political will of the people. We must accept that 
<br/>whilst the three political Parties forming the Coalition Government may have received lesser votes 
<br/>than the FijiFirst Party, collectively, there are more people who made it clear that they want a new 
<br/>direction for Fiji and a new leadership. And it is very important that, as the new Government, we 
<br/>respond to the aspirations of our people, and we respond to why they wanted a new Government and 
<br/>why they wanted the change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am humbled to make my contribution this morning to His Excellency the 
<br/>President’s most Gracious Speech.  Sir, today’s response will be very special and different from all 
<br/>others I have shared in this august Parliament since 2014.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the various issues His Excellency had raised, I wish to 
<br/>take this time to send a special appreciation of the people of Naitasiri Province, the acknowledgement 
<br/></span><span>of each man, woman and child, in the Presidential pardon, allowing the release of the paramount 
<br/></span><span>Chief of Naitasiri, the </span><span>Gone Turaga na Qaranivalu</span><span>, Ratu Inoke Takiveikata.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  actions  of  His  Excellency  the  President,  Ratu  Wiliame  Katonivere,  and  with  the 
<br/>assistance and guidance of the honorable Attorney-General and his Office, freeing the </span><span>Gone Turaga 
<br/>na Qaranivalu</span><span> back into society and enabling him to be back home with his people and his family, 
<br/>is the ultimate response of the cries of the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> of Naitasiri over the many years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he has been in prison. His release is an indication of the willingness and 
<br/></span><span>ability of the ruling Coalition Government to give our people the chance to reconcile as a people and 
<br/></span><span>is a sign of decisive leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  people  of  faith,  irrespective  of  the  various  religious  beliefs  we  practice,  love  and 
<br/>forgiveness is a common value we all aspire to.  Therefore, again, we are most grateful for this act 
<br/>of forgiveness  bestowed upon the  </span><span>Turaga  na  Qaranivalu</span><span> and others who were, likewise, given  a 
<br/>Presidential pardon. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu</span><span>, Coalition Government.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>113 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  led  with  the  powerful  reminder  of  our 
<br/>obligations under the Fijian Constitution to which he spoke of the need to encourage respect for all 
<br/>ethnicities and for the need to foster peace and community unity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, peace is the catalyst for stability and national growth. When peace is at the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>centre of our leadership, our people will be inspired to contribute and to have faith in our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rightfully  said,  His  Excellency  spoke  about  unscrupulous  politicians  who  continue  to 
<br/>instigate  mistrust  amongst  our  communities.  Out  of  all  the  aspects  of  His  Excellency’s  Address, 
<br/>personally for me, that was the defining moment and the most crucial aspect of the path we must now 
<br/>change as laid out by His Excellency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unity in diversity is a responsibility and also an opportunity. Embracing our 
<br/>cultural, ethnic and religious differences must be the responsibility of all our people and for all its 
<br/>leaders - a divine calling that is bestowed on each shoulder of those called to national leadership 
<br/>whether in Government, in the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> or in Church.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leaders are present everywhere, Mr. Speaker, Sir. They exist in the public and private sector 
<br/>and they exist even in our civil society.  Unless and until we accept that we have a responsibility to 
<br/>provide leadership that promotes national security for all our people through the promotion of a fair 
<br/>and non-biased system  of governance;  and the addressing of our major social challenges like the 
<br/>increase in sophisticated crime; increase in unemployment; increase in school dropouts; increase in 
<br/>emigration of our people; and distrust in the institutions of Government, like the Judiciary and the 
<br/>Fiji Police, we will be up against strong opposition and a sure recipe for disaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  most  contentious  issues  confronting  us  today  remains  the 
<br/>expiration of land leases. This is evident in the sugar industry and, likewise, the dairy industry.  Last 
<br/>year, we read about the disturbing news of some landowners refusing the renewal of leases in Tailevu 
<br/>North.  I am certain, Sir, that the landowners may have genuine issues that they wish to be addressed 
<br/>and I am hopeful for wisdom and foresight to guide negotiations around this subject.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Too  often,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  advisors  provide  criticisms  but  do  not  provide  a  solution  to 
<br/>landowners and landowning units. The issue of the Tailevu Futon College dispute is a classic example 
<br/>to learn from. That once beautiful school now lies silent as the Management of this proud College 
<br/>made the decision to relocate to its new location in Sabeto, Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last couple of days, I was also notified that lease holders facing the 
<br/></span><span>renewal of their sugarcane leases have been asked to pay a premium in order for their leases to be 
<br/>extended.  Most of those sugarcane farmers were caught off guard with respect to this alleged demand 
<br/>by iTLTB. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the details of these grievances may very well have an explanation by iTLTB, 
<br/>but  my  request  today  is  for  us  to  be  practical  with  our  demands.  Sugarcane  farmers  are  already 
<br/>struggling to continue farming in this struggling industry and to take further loans to be able to meet 
<br/>their premium demands as a prerequisite to their lease extensions or renewals must be very daunting 
<br/></span><span>and demoralising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the plight of the indigenous landowners is not lost on me. The usual mantra of 
<br/>‘asset  rich  and  cash  poor’  is  a  philosophy  that  must  philosophy  that  must  be  defeated.  Many 
<br/>indigenous landowning units are today devising ways to turn their vacant land into productive </span><span>yaqona 
<br/></span><span>farms, </span><span>dalo</span><span> farms, ginger farms, et cetera.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  most  common  arguments  prevailing  over  land  leases  is  on  the  absence  of 
<br/>compensation for the use of natural resources, like land and sea, and the disparity in lease payment 
<br/>against the wealth and benefits derived by those leasing the land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the Coalition Government to immediately set up a Lease Review Committee to look 
<br/>into the plight of both, landowners and tenants, so that we address these issues once and for all. The 
<br/>iTLTB may not have the ability nor the political will to address  these challenges that we need to 
<br/>resolve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people of Naitasiri, Mr. Speaker, Sir, have asked for compensation for land used by the 
<br/>State over the years without any proper compensation like that which the Fiji National University 
<br/>Nursing School and the Fiji School of Medicine sits on, likewise, the land on which the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji Military Forces at Delainabua sits on. This is not to mention the water catchment areas around 
<br/>Fiji where no lease arrangements exist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  until  Government  does  the  right  thing  and  accepts  responsibility  where 
<br/>previous Governments have failed to properly compensate landowning units, there will continue to 
<br/>be growing mistrust between our landowners and the tenants, as well as against iTLTB and the State.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, His  Excellency spoke on the need for our people to  understand and practice 
<br/>financial  literacy.  I  could  not  agree  more.  There  are  certain  habits  that  we,  Fijians,  must  quickly 
<br/>unlearn, and one of them is to live from pay day to pay day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  importance  of  financial  literacy  has  long  been  recognised  by  previous 
<br/>Governments.  Notably,  the  establishment  of  institutions  such  as  the  Fijian  Holdings  Limited; 
<br/>EIMCOL; the building of Provincial Council-owned buildings, like the Ratu Cakobau House, Ro 
<br/>Lalabalavu House, Namosi House, Macuata House, Takayawa Building and others; were established 
<br/>to promote prudent financial investments for the indigenous people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our friends, the Indo-Fijians and Chinese, are some of the best in the financial management 
<br/>and it would augur well for us to learn from them on how to save for the rainy day; how to establish 
<br/>a side hustle at home, apart from your 8.00 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. job; and most importantly, to save part 
<br/>of your income for your future.  For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, so many civil servants retire without 
<br/>building or owning homes and by the time they retire, they use their retirement funds to build their 
<br/>homes.  As a result, they deplete their funds meant to look after them in their old age, thus rendering 
<br/>them vulnerable to poverty, sickness and other illnesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I look forward to the day the Fijian Holdings and other similar institutions, 
<br/>will encourage our people to practice financial literacy and teach their children to do the same  by 
<br/>having  voluntary  FNPF  accounts  from  as  soon  as  they  can,  having  life  insurance  policies  or 
<br/>investments stashed away. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to report that financial literacy was identified as a crucial part 
<br/>of  our  national  learning  to  be  included  in  the  school  curriculum,  and  this  forms  part  of  the 
<br/>recommendations from the National Education Summit held in Denarau last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, civil servants are the life of any government system and I now wish to thank 
<br/>our Civil Servants for their patience and endurance over the past years as governments have come 
<br/>and gone, and they continue to produce as expected of them.  On their behalf, I ask the Coalition 
<br/>Government to seriously consider in the new financial year probably salary increments for our Civil 
<br/>Servants to counter inflation that we all know continues to challenge the best of us yearly.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>115 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, always boasts some of the best brains and talents in any 
<br/>country, and Fiji is no exception.  We must work to recognise their contributions and  worth, and 
<br/>reward them accordingly.  Everyday, we read of resignations of civil servants as they leave in pursuit 
<br/>of  greener  pastures  either  to  the  private  sector  or  abroad,  leaving  behind  lack  of  institutional 
<br/>knowledge and skills gap. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a review of the salary bands for the many Civil Servants is long overdue.  
<br/>Teachers, for example, have some of the lowest salaries in the Civil Service.  After some 15 years to 
<br/>18 years as a teacher, one can still be receiving $26,000 per annum whereas other professions start 
<br/>at  around  $34,000  per  annum  for  new  graduates  entering  the  Civil  Service  in  their  respective 
<br/>professional cadre of employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last Saturday, the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> carried an advertisement for teacher vacancies 
<br/>in Australia and the salaries being offered range from AU$77,634 to AU$129,713, plus super, based 
<br/>on experience and qualifications level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst being the Minister for Education, I started discussions with two major teacher unions 
<br/>in  Fiji  to  conduct  a  salary  review  with  the  assistance  of  the  Public  Service  Commission  and  the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance, pretty much the same as the Fiji Nurses Association were able to achieve for 
<br/>their nurses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, unless we address these anomalies and put in place proper salary bands for 
<br/>teachers, we will continue to have an exodus of teachers migrating and leaving our shores, resulting 
<br/>in a massive brain-drain and likely deteriorating standard of education of our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  works  that  were  in  progress  at  my  time  at  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education was the review of Assistant Principal’s salary, who were still receiving the same salary as 
<br/>Heads of Departments.  Given the extra responsibilities held by Assistant Principals, was made worse 
<br/>if they were serving in boarding schools against Heads of Departments, there is no incentive to ascend 
<br/>to  such a post.  This  has been the result of the previous Government’s review of the Ministry of 
<br/>Education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, for those schools that are tagged as small schools, the Ministry of Education was in the 
<br/>process of appointing Executive Teachers to these schools, with proper approval process, to assist in 
<br/>the  teaching  and  administration  loads  and  would  be  given  allowances  for  performing  the  role  as 
<br/>Executive Teachers.  Most of these schools are located in the rural and maritime areas, and some are 
<br/></span><span>also providing boarding facilities starting from ECE to Class 8 students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst the return of the Civil Service Day is welcomed, a much-deserved 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>salary adjustment or increase will be much more appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The return of the Higher Salaries Commission is welcomed.  It hopefully means the impartial 
<br/>review and determination of remunerations for top executive positions in the public sector.  I request 
<br/>that  under  the  current  financial  challenges,  a  review  of  the  Permanent  Secretary  remuneration  is 
<br/>warranted  against  the  vast  disparity  in  salary  levels  to  other  levels  of  leadership  within  the  Civil 
<br/></span><span>Service,  for  example,  those  in  the  Deputy  Secretary  and  Director  positions,  and  other  crucial 
<br/></span><span>portfolios in Government Companies and Statutory Authorities and Commissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a simple comment on the White Paper on Foreign Policy, which is 
<br/>to retain the philosophy of ‘friends to all and enemies to none’.  May I urge the Government to review 
<br/>its position with respect to the Israel-Hamas war currently occurring.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- It is crucial that Fiji prioritises the lives of our men and women 
<br/>serving  as  peacekeepers  in  predominantly  the  Middle  East,  and  retain  our  global  recognition  as 
<br/>peacekeepers, promoting global peace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency alluded to the National Education Summit that was held last 
<br/>year.  Indeed, the Summit after many years, was able to bring together professionals involved in our 
<br/>education sector, who collectively identified the needs and vulnerabilities in our education system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On this note, I acknowledge the experience and guidance of two professionals, namely, the 
<br/>former Minister in the SDL Government and long-time Educationist, Mrs. Losena Salabula, as well 
<br/>as  former  Member  of  Parliament,  Mr.  Mikaele  Leawere,  who  were  assigned  to  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education  after  the  2022  Elections.    These  two  individuals  personally  identified  and  made 
<br/>recommendations to the Office of the Minister for Education to hold the National Education Summit 
<br/>to  resolve  the  challenges  of  the  education  sector  collectively  and  holistically.    It  is  this  kind  of 
<br/>professional expertise and experience that our Government needs, to appreciate and learn from, for 
<br/>they hold the institutional knowledge of the education sector that can make a lot of difference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has rightfully stated recently that the education sector in Fiji 
<br/>is a failure, which must be urgently addressed, and I agree with him that the curriculum of learning 
<br/>in schools will be a good place to start with the necessary changes.  Mr. Speaker Sir, the Ministry of 
<br/>Education has re-engaged the services of a former Permanent Secretary, Mr. Tiko, to look into this 
<br/>very Department, given his experience and knowledge of curriculum development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The collapsing of the Ministry of Education Curriculum Advisory Services saw the direct 
<br/>failure of the Ministry to create the necessary curriculum content and address the main perspectives 
<br/>that ought to support education for sustainable development in our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  the  Curriculum  Advisory  Services  Unit  collapsed,  the  specific 
<br/>curriculum specialists were told to go back to school, and the honourable Hem Chand would be well 
<br/>aware  of  this,  taking  all the  instructions  to  do  the  necessary.    I  wonder  who  he  was  taking  those 
<br/>instructions from when the National Curriculum Advisory Services collapsed.  In fact, in collapsing 
<br/>the Curriculum Unit, the previous Government also crippled the very Unit that offers professional 
<br/>support  to  Fiji’s  teaching  workforce  that  plays  a  vital  role  of  curriculum  implementors  in  our 
<br/>classrooms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with limited time, in my response to the Budget Address last year, I had 
<br/>identified two areas of focus needing urgent intervention; being a review of the education curriculum 
<br/>currently taught in schools, as well as the transformation of Fiji’s traditional learning style to embrace 
<br/>online  learning  as  part  of  the  post-COVID  lessons  which  will  primarily  place  Fiji’s  education 
<br/>capabilities alongside the fast-evolving developing world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recently,  online  platform  managers  have  been  in  negotiations  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education and these deliberations have been ongoing for some time.  However, we need 
<br/></span><span>to finalise the implementation of the proposed online learning systems that can assist our teachers 
<br/></span><span>and students make learning a whole lot more interesting and engaging.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our children of this millennium are notably visual learners. You will be surprised at how our 
<br/>young  people  of  today  are  teaching  some  parents  and  older  generation  on  the  use  of  technology, 
<br/>especially mobile phones and computers.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>117 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  fundamentally,  the  Ministry  of  Education  will  need  to  implement  the 
<br/>outcomes  of  the  Education  Summit,  and  crucial  lessons  learnt  from  recent  years’  experiences 
<br/>demands  that  engagement  and  dialogue  with  the  Teacher  Unions  in  Fiji  be  the  cornerstone  of 
<br/>addressing both, the teacher and student concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to briefly share that there has been a lot said over the Fiji National 
<br/>University (FNU) saga that embroiled my leadership. Very little has been shared about the challenges 
<br/>faced by the Office of the Minister for Education during that period, to handle the imminent threat 
<br/>of  a  strike  or  protest  by  teachers  and  students  at  the  University,  which  had  been  brought  to  my 
<br/>attention over various challenges that were at the heart of the FNU Council and its leadership at the 
<br/>time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there was one thing I was certain of, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was that my job was to protect the 
<br/>stability of the Coalition Government and the stability of our economic environment where adverse 
<br/>publicity and instability means the ruling Government  will be  held responsible for its inability to 
<br/>show leadership and resolve potentially destructive incidents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current University of the South Pacific (USP) ongoing impasse with 
<br/>threats  of  a  strike  looming  must  be  handled  with  precision  and  delicate  management.  As  I  have 
<br/>alluded to, the fallout and backlash from such displays of instability threatens public confidence with 
<br/>potentially negative economic ramifications, and given the University is a regional institution, Fiji 
<br/>could face criticism that it has failed to safeguard the interests of the students of the University and 
<br/>that of the member countries who form ownership of the USP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond very briefly to honourable Hem Chand’s comments about 
<br/>the two highly paid consultants that he mentioned.  I had mentioned part of it before.  The honourable 
<br/>Member was referring to Mr. Mikaele Leawere and Mrs. Losena Salabula. For the information of the 
<br/>honourable Member, from  the time their contracts  had expired in  January this year,  an offer was 
<br/>made to them with a reduced rate (over 50 percent) but to-date, they are still coming to work, even 
<br/>though they have yet to get paid.  So, that is the commitment that we need from people like that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  leadership  is  not  easy.  It  demands  the  ability  to  be  decisive  in  our 
<br/>management responsibilities. I am aware that changes have been made at the Ministry of Education, 
<br/>following my exit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You will recall,  Sir, that there is  a very experienced Human Resource personnel  who had 
<br/></span><span>worked hard under your leadership and I had requested for this Officer be transferred to the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of  Education  to  assist  bring  discipline  and  timeliness  in  teacher  transfers  and  management.  The 
<br/>Officer is a highly trained individual and a very experienced Civil Servant in corporate productivity 
<br/>and  business  excellence.  Sadly,  this  individual  is  now  on  suspension  with  full  pay  on  unclear 
<br/>allegations, and I do hope that she will get due justice instead of rewarding those who systematically 
<br/>abuse the Government system over time and practice, causing untold misery and grief to our teachers 
<br/>and subsequently, students and stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will always capture the brave, and those who have the strength of 
<br/></span><span>character to go against popular tide, because they have kept their focus on the end goal, which is, to 
<br/></span><span>achieve the desired results that improve service delivery and reduce risks and unmitigated financial 
<br/>exposure.  I encourage those in leadership at the Ministry of Education to, please, focus on the right 
<br/>goals and work together to uplift the standards of education in our nation equitably.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me additional time.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our people are asking for the reduction in the cost of living. As elected Members of our Fijian 
<br/>Parliament, it is our job to help make our livelihoods manageable, otherwise, we will continue to have an 
<br/>increase in migration, crime and other social ills associated with a depressed economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we promised our people to relieve them of the 
<br/>many challenges we have faced as a nation, and we promised to offer everyone a fairer and more equitable 
<br/>piece of the national pie in leadership and in resources.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You can take my 10 minutes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Thank you, honourable Member.  It must get the approval of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is incumbent upon us to find innovative ways to deliver those promises for our people.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Government to find incentives that will draw investors into Fiji and 
<br/>encourage domestic entrepreneurs. These are the crucial players that we must grow to be able to address 
<br/>issues of employment opportunities and economic stability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank the hard work being done by the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture,  to  expand  Fiji’s  opportunities  for  local  consumer  consumption,  as  well  as  exports  of 
<br/>agricultural  products,  goods  and  services.  I  am  encouraged  with  the  various  programmes  being 
<br/>implemented by this Ministry from – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>its ginger farming workshops; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>the encouragement of women farmers; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>provision of much needed rotavator machines for rural farmers; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>provision of assistance, like soil analysts, for farmers to help them determine the kind of products 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they can grow on a particular land; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>the many other programmes that include the promotion of value added products made available 
<br/>for our local markets, hotels and resorts, with home-grown vegetables and fruits that ease reliance 
<br/>on imports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the right motives and the right people, any industry can become a winner 
<br/>for Fiji, resolving the trade deficit and reversing the import and export status will be fundamental to our 
<br/></span><span>ability to sustain Fiji, not only for national food security, but also for the stability and growth of our 
<br/></span><span>foreign exchange.  I am optimistic that the honourable Minister for Agriculture and his Ministry will be 
<br/>provided  with  the  necessary  resources  and  people  who  will  elevate  and  contribute  to  our  economic 
<br/>stability and long-term growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  end  by  thanking  the  Government  and  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, that despite a lot of challenges faced in the last year under his leadership, we 
<br/>have resolved to persist with our facilitation of change that is responsive to the needs of our people and 
<br/>that assures lasting peace and development. It is easy to make commentaries from the sidelines, but to 
<br/>put your hand up to participate and use your resources to fight an election and become elected, takes a lot 
<br/>of guts, perseverance and commitment.  Today, I remember those who had started the journey to regain 
<br/>Government leadership via democratic process since 2014, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I pay tribute to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, we have a new Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, and I congratulate Ratu Viliame 
<br/></span><span>Seruvakula  and  wish  him  well  in  his  tenure  of  leadership.  Whilst  he  may  have  come  as  a  surprise 
<br/></span><span>appointment to many of us, we will trust the process and respect that the will of God and His calling in

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our seasons of life are always done with a higher planning “because our thoughts are not God’s thoughts, 
<br/>and His ways are higher than ours.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I join His Excellency the President in asking for unity, reconciliation and for a renewed spirit and 
<br/>commitment to serve our people. We learn lessons each day as human beings and what matters is the 
<br/>recognition that our time is limited, hence we must not give up from trying to be better people, better 
<br/>leaders and be committed to the goal of advancing together as a people with a shared vision of not leaving 
<br/>anyone behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Radrodro, for that great response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, you may have noticed that I had given more time for him in making his 
<br/>first speech as a Backbencher, but it is good to hear from him.  So much has been said about him, but it 
<br/>is quite overwhelming and relieving to hear the wisdom that he has attained as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  intend  to  adjourn  Parliament  now  for  lunch  and  when  we  resume,  the  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker will be presiding right up until tomorrow when, for the first time, she will be leading the morning 
<br/>session  as  well.  This  is  done  not  only  to  promote  her  and  the  women’s  wing  and  the  women’s 
<br/>empowerment and all that, but rather to provide opportunities to the Deputy Speaker as well. This has not 
<br/>been done but we have to do it somehow to prepare herself, should a time come for her to take over the 
<br/>leadership of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 1.58 p.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament; first of all, I join all my parliamentary colleagues in congratulating His Excellency the 
<br/>President for the sentiments that underpinned his Opening Address, which is traditionally given at 
<br/>the  beginning  of  each  Session  of  Parliament,  and  recounts  Government’s  policies  and  legislative 
<br/>programmes for the ensuing parliamentary year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President in his Address, rightfully highlighted 
<br/>the need for a united and an inclusive nation. It stands to reasons that unity and inclusivity is the 
<br/>platform  for  peace  and  progress.  Countless  countries  all  over  the  world  had  benefitted  from  the 
<br/>realisation that this platform is the cornerstone of their progress. Countless other countries have failed 
<br/>and continue to fail to progress because of racial discrimination and the politics of exclusion of people 
<br/>on the basis, not only of race, but also on the basis of socio-economic status or of political exclusion 
<br/>of parties and their followers who are not in power.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while I welcome the sentiments and its well-meaning applications 
<br/>in  the  Speech  of  these  sentiments  of  inclusion,  tolerance  and  harmony  by  His  Excellency  the 
<br/>President, I am concerned that the ground reality do not match the sentiments.  I intend to give some 
<br/>specific examples later on as to why this is so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going on sentiments alone, it is tempting to parrot lines of harmony in order to make us all 
<br/>feel good. However, we will be creating an illusion that all is good; that all our problems are going 
<br/>to go away because we believe in sentiments rather than actions.  We want to see the smokescreen 
<br/>of  inclusion  and  harmony  rather  than  face  the  discord  and  disharmony  created  by  some  of  the 
<br/>honourable Members of the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President,  towards  the  end  of  his  Speech,  made  an  appeal  to  all  the 
<br/>honourable Members of this august Parliament to consider sentiments expressed by fellow citizens 
<br/>and bring your concerns to this august Parliament. His Excellency further went on to ask honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament to listen to the voices of the people, not only those who elected you, but to 
<br/>all our citizens, young and old, men and women, and of all backgrounds and beliefs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, I am  not  sure how many Members of the Coalition Government 
<br/>would heed these words and follow the true path of democratic representation of our people. Their 
<br/></span><span>actions and policies in the past year of their governance have not been exemplary, to say the least, 
<br/></span><span>when it comes to democratic representation of all our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a representative of our people, I feel dutybound to bring to light matters that shows that 
<br/>this Coalition Government is not being responsible and accountable when it comes to governance. 
<br/>This Government, like any other, has to place a premium on being responsible and accountable. It 
<br/>cannot be any other way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, some of the honourable Members of the Coalition Government have 
<br/></span><span>shown themselves to be  arrogant, irresponsible and entitled in  the last 14 months, be it in  policy 
<br/></span><span>matters and following the rights and wrongs of applications in following the rule of law as laid out 
<br/>in the 2013 Constitution, or in the personal conduct of its Ministers and Members of Parliament when 
<br/>they have acted in ways that make a mockery of the people whose money they are throwing around. 
<br/>As I have said earlier, I am dutybound that when representatives of this Coalition Government are 
<br/>acting in an irresponsible manner and ways that destroy rather than build this nation, then it is our 
<br/>duty to expose those failures of Government and governance without fear or favour.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this Government, given its very shaky  (and I see some of it still 
<br/>shaking) past months, will do well to listen and act on constructive criticism that can correct their 
<br/>failures and provide pathways towards progress and nation building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in recent sugar industry consultation in the Western Division, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Sugar and his Team did not receive a good reception.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Oh! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Madam Deputy Speaker … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Carry on, honourable Bala. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- … this was evident from the numerous times during the meeting, the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Sugar had to ask the public to respect him. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  is  typical  of  the  entitled  and  arrogant  attitude  of  the 
<br/>representatives of the Coalition Government on the ground.  But the question that we must ask is, 
<br/>what went wrong for the honourable Minister to make this repeated demand for respect?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth is that the people were not disrespectful, for we all know that respect is a two-way 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>street.  You have to give respect to gain respect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, that is an example of the direct opposite that 
<br/>goes against both, the sentiments and the reality of the message when His Excellency, in his Address, 
<br/>said that we need to listen to the voices of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, instead of realising what is happening on the ground and the issues 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that is facing the sugar industry, we hear time and again of building a new sugar mill in Rakiraki.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  building  a  new  mill  will  mean  that  the  declining  number  of 
<br/></span><span>sugarcane  farmers  and  sugarcane  farms  in  Rakiraki  will  have  to  be,  by  magic,  increase  their 
<br/>production for its current tonnage in order to make the mill viable.  The problem is that, instead of 
<br/>fixing problems for the farmers, you want to burden them even further, just so that you can build a 
<br/>mill to keep your Election promises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this lack of planning and proper studies on a project is worse than 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>those politicians like him, who promise to build bridges where there are no rivers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, just to add on sugar matters, when we were in Government, we were 
<br/>criticised for appointing  the former ANZ CEO as the Chairman of FSC, because he was residing 
<br/>overseas.  We ask, what is the situation now?  Whether the Chairman resides here or overseas, where 
<br/>does the honourable Minister normally have his cocktail parties?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President also mentioned an increase in the cane 
<br/>production to 1.8 million tonnes in the 2024 season, compared to 1.6 million tonnes in 2022.  I ask, 
<br/>where are the figures for 2023?  Was His Excellency the President basically misled, then why not 
<br/>2023?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, after talking to farmers, there has to be a miracle to produce 1.8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million tonnes this season. It is easy to say 1.8 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. C.J. Singh interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- No, I will stop there. I know you are getting under pressure, so I will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respect you because of your health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, may I, please, remind you to address the Chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I note the rollout of the consultation towards 
<br/>the  National  Development  Plan  (NDP)  and  would  like  to  remind  this  august  Parliament  that  Fiji 
<br/>already has a short term and a long term NDP that goes into the early 2030s that would serve us 
<br/>equally well. It has provision for reviews and restating of goals, and it would have saved us both, 
<br/>time and money, to use it as a platform rather than embark on a completely new plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister.  I am 
<br/>sure the people of Fiji would like some transparency on the cost of this new NDP and exactly how 
<br/>and why it is required and why there is a need to replace the existing Plans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I make this comment  on the NDP process  because the Coalition 
<br/>Government is full of this thinking and planning exercise, rather than real action on the ground. We 
<br/>face many challenges from the spread of drugs and its impact across our societies and in particular, 
<br/>on our youth.  This is an immediate challenge requiring an immediate response, but all we get is more 
<br/>planning and thinking exercises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have an imbalance on our youth, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the schools, tertiary and 
<br/></span><span>training institutions, and lack of workers on the ground and these days, it is not only qualified workers 
<br/></span><span>but workers in general. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For a small nation like ours, Madam Deputy Speaker, we are now relying on migrant labour, 
<br/>and this does not mean well in terms of how we are taking actions to provide local solutions.  From 
<br/>my  talks  with  the  employers  and  investors,  the  issue  is  not  just  in  terms  of  numbers,  but  more 
<br/>importantly, in terms of reliable and productive labour pools, and the Coalition Government needs 
<br/>to act quickly and address this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the longer we have no action on the ground and we do not move 
<br/></span><span>projects and have policy initiatives to address the ongoing cost of living burdens on so many Fijians, 
<br/>the greater the associated problems of net-migration and loss of human capital will become for Fiji.  
<br/>Our fear is that the current inaction of the Coalition Government and their general inept policies will 
<br/>lead  to  an  irreversible  lapse  situation  in  our  social  and  economic  development  for  our  future 
<br/>generations.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>123 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, next, I turn to Local Government.  Let us turn to the heart of the 
<br/>matter and, that is, the appointment of Special Administrators within our Municipalities.  It has come 
<br/>to my attention that these appointments are nothing more than political favours allocated based on 
<br/>party affiliation rather than on merit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consider  this  situation,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  if  there  are  three  Special  Administrators 
<br/>appointed  to  a  Municipality  -  one  is  from  the  People’s  Alliance  Party  (PAP),  one  from  National 
<br/>Federation  Party  (NFP)  and  one  from  Social  Democratic  Liberal  Party  (SODELPA).    That  is  the 
<br/>reality, no matter how they are going to say, “no” or “yes”, et cetera, those are rubbish. And in some 
<br/>Municipalities, there are more than three Special Administrators, and it falls into the hands of PAP.  
<br/>This type of appointment undermines the very fabric of our democracy and erodes the trust of our 
<br/>ratepayers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  while  I  personally  may  not  harbor  any  grievances  against  the 
<br/>individuals appointed, I stand here today as the voice of ratepayers who have expressed profound 
<br/>concerns over the transparency and fairness of these appointments.  These issues do not lie in the 
<br/>appointments themselves, but extends to the wrong process through which candidates were selected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether the honourable Minister is aware of this, but 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it is a very serious matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- About what? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Yes, I am going to tell you.  You are very good at saying, “what” and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“what”, but it will be a good lesson for you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  has  come  to  light  that  a  fundamental  requirement  has  been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>disregarded, rendering the entire process suspicious in the eyes of the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the advertisement stated that the applicant must be a resident of the 
<br/>municipality (that is what I am talking about) on which they seek to serve.  In some Municipalities, 
<br/>some of the Special Administrators do not reside in the Municipality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Give an example. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-That is not my job, you go and do it.  Why should I give examples. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Because you brought it up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- He doesn’t know the meaning of ‘municipalities’, honestly! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the honourable line Minister to correct 
<br/>this incorrect appointment. And if you really want examples of these appointments, I can give you 
<br/>the list,  but  what  I am  saying  in  this Parliament is  that the appointments are illegal.  You have to 
<br/>accept that as line Minister, but if you have been pressured from someone, that is another matter, in 
<br/>terms of appointment.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am telling this august Parliament, it is an illegal appointment of Special Administrators in 
<br/>some of the Municipalities because they do not reside within the Municipalities, and that is what the 
<br/>advertisement says.  I am not saying, it is their advertisement, not mine, and this is what people are 
<br/>asking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, let us not overlook the imbalance 
<br/>in the gender representation within these appointments.  Despite big talks on gender equality, the 
<br/>reality remains that women are systematically sidelined from positions of influence and decision-
<br/>making within our Local Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Here, we have one Assistant Minister, who goes around the country with  donor agencies’ 
<br/>funds to conduct workshops in the name of empowerment of women.  I want to ask how many Special 
<br/>Administrators are women?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Your time is up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- That is my time, what the hell are you doing there?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as I move towards my closing words, I must thank His Excellency 
<br/>the President for outlining the vision for Government to continue to formalise land tenure agreements 
<br/>to  ensure  security  of  tenure.    During  our  term  in  office  under  the  FijiFirst  Government,  after 
<br/>negotiations with landowners, we secured a development lease at Varavu, Ba, to develop that area.  
<br/>Sadly, some tenants are now issued with a notice to vacate and are caught in a state of limbo. There 
<br/>were big talks in the morning about informal settlements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  also  told  that  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister of Finance had a meeting with some residents some weeks back and he assured them that 
<br/>they do not have to vacate.  So, I hope the honourable Minister will liaise with the line Minister to 
<br/>resolve this issue because there is a real issue in that area right now. You may laugh, you may joke, 
<br/>but this is a serious matter that needs some attention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the sentiments of His Excellency the President is an opportunity for 
<br/>this Government to engage with honesty and commitment so that it can lead his vision for one nation 
<br/>and one people for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let us reflect on the profound word of His Excellency the President, 
<br/>as conveyed in his opening Address to this august Parliament.  His call to uphold the rule of law and 
<br/>democracy resonates deeply within our hearts and underscores the duty we bear as custodians of our 
<br/>nation in future.  Let us not merely pay lip service to those noble ideals but let us embody them in 
<br/>every aspect of our governance to enact tangible change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency’s  recollection  of  his  youth  in  Macuata,  engaged 
<br/>within the reach of Indo-Fijian farming families serves as a moving reminder of the harmony and 
<br/></span><span>unity that can be achieved when diversity is embraced rather than ignored.  It is upon us, as leaders, 
<br/></span><span>entrusted with the welfare of our nation, to heed these calls for unity and inclusivity to bridge the 
<br/>divides that threaten to fracture the fabric of our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is imperative, Madam Deputy Speaker, that we confront these issues head on, relegating 
<br/>them to annals of history and paving the way for a future where every Fijian, regardless of race or 
<br/>political affiliation, is afforded equal opportunities and dignity. Let us commit ourselves to policies 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>125 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and programmes that foster inclusivity, that celebrate the rich mixtures of cultures that define our 
<br/>nation, and that empowers every citizen to realise their full potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Madam Deputy Speaker, let us heed the call of His Excellency the President, again, 
<br/>and  rise  above  the  politics  of  division  and  discord.    Let  us  forge  a  path  forward,  guided  by  the 
<br/>principles of unity, justice and respect for all.  Together, let us build a Fiji where every citizen can 
<br/>hold their head high with pride, knowing that they are a part of a truly great nation - one country, one 
<br/>nation, united in purpose and destiny.  Long live Fiji and her people, live in peace and harmony. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Bala, for your response. I just want 
<br/>you to remember that you have spoken four minutes over time. Now, if any honourable Member who 
<br/>is yet to speak would like to yield some time to the next speaker from your side of Parliament, please, 
<br/>do let Madam Secretary-General know so that she can let me know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I  also  remind all honourable Members to,  please, address  the Chair. Have your little 
<br/>conversations  at  tea  time,  but  I  am  mindful  of  everyone’s  time  here.  So,  I  appreciate  your 
<br/>understanding, thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker of Parliament, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition,   honourable Members of Parliament,   distinguished guests, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good day to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I respond to His Excellency’s most gracious Speech, I wish to address Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>few issues that were brought up by an honourable Member from the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I was a farmer and a Board member of our co-operative before I 
<br/>became a politician.  I have resigned from the Board before becoming a Minister but remained as a 
<br/>member  of  the  co-operative  to  support  aquaculture  and  agriculture  farmers  who  are  struggling  to 
<br/>make ends meet.  Co-operatives in Fiji operate in different sectors across many outer islands and are 
<br/>closely linked with economic and social development.  Is it wrong by law for me to be a member of 
<br/>a co-operative linked with economic and social development in my Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Section 32(1) of the Bill of Rights and Constitution states, and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Every person has the right to full and free participation in the economic life of the 
<br/>State, which includes the right to choose their own work, trade, occupation, profession or 
<br/>other means of livelihood.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You are a Minister now! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Was there any question on conflict of interest and abuse of office to Mr. 
<br/>Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum in his capacity as the Minister of Economy when providing millions of dollars 
<br/></span><span>of Government funds to his brother at the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation by the current Opposition 
<br/></span><span>Member?  No!  Was there any question on conflict of interest and abuse of office to Mr. Bainimarama 
<br/>when employing his family members in various arms of Government?  No!  Now, we have got that 
<br/>out of the way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  respond  to  His  Excellency’s  most  Gracious  Speech 
<br/>delivered in this august Parliament to mark the Opening of the 2024 new Parliament year.  I must

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>acknowledge the words of inspiration and foresight from His Excellency’s timely statement that has 
<br/>set the course, as we navigate the people of Fiji through the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  note  that  His  Excellency  mentioned  the  importance  of  natural 
<br/>resource-based sectors.  The Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry echo the sentiments made and I firmly 
<br/>believe that this is the silver lining to our strive towards prosperity for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are here for only three reasons and, that is, the people, the people, 
<br/>and  the  people  of  this  land  we  call  home.    We  have  been  humbly  reminded  of  the  immense 
<br/>responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices and aspirations of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I will begin with ridges of our Forestry Sector and elaborate on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reefs and beyond for our Fisheries Sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the State Opening of Parliament, His Excellency, in his statement, 
<br/>rightfully stated that despite our negligible contribution to global emissions, we are greatly impacted 
<br/>by the effects of climate change. Our coastal communities are being forced to relocate and our lives 
<br/>and livelihoods impacted in various ways due to the effects of climate change.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in addressing climate resilience, the Ministry will continue its 30 
<br/>Million  Trees  in  15  Years  Programme,  focusing  more  on  survival  and  encouraging  community 
<br/>participation  through  incentive  planting  and  seedling  sales.  This  support  will  extend  to  coastal 
<br/>communities  in  the  restoration  of  mangroves  for  coastal  protection  and  restoration  of  the  coastal 
<br/>ecosystems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  support  our  tree  growing  efforts,  a  new  Plantation  Policy  and  a  Reforestation  and 
<br/>Afforestation Guideline is being developed by the Ministry through the support from its development 
<br/>partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  will  continue  to  address  emissions  through  our 
<br/>Forest Emissions Reduction Programme.  We have completed our first monitoring report which has 
<br/>progressed through the third party audit and should result in the first carbon payments which we have 
<br/>aspired to since the REDD Plus project was implemented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  programme  is  intended  to  be  inclusive,  with  communities  being  consulted  on  the 
<br/>requirements to be met in order to participate and receive the full benefits of compliance and the 
<br/></span><span>standards required under the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we will continue to support our low emission development strategy 
<br/>through  reduced  deforestation  and  increased  plantation  productivity.  Our  support  of  bioenergy  to 
<br/>reduce reliance on fossil fuels and reduce forest waste is progressing through engagement with the 
<br/>Nabou Green Energy and other stakeholders, contributing to the forest energy sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are currently undertaking extensive afforestation and restoration 
<br/>of forests, to ensure sustainable supply from our forests, while they continue to provide the essential 
<br/></span><span>environmental services, including protection of our biodiversity, provision of clean water and overall 
<br/></span><span>health of our forests and oceans through a ridge to reef concept. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency highlighted the need to foster strong partnerships 
<br/>and the Ministry is working in collaboration with its stakeholders, development partners and other 
<br/>Government  agencies,  to  access  climate  funds  to  accelerate  our  response  to  climate  change 
<br/>collectively.  Through the support of the Food and Agriculture Organization, we have submitted a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>127 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>concept  note to  the Green Climate Fund which has  been accepted, and we are progressing in  the 
<br/>development of a full proposal, working together with other agencies with pipeline Green Climate 
<br/>Fund projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, not only has the Ministry sought external collaboration, the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries and Forestry had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ministry of iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs,  Heritage  and  Arts.  Noting  the  access  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  has  with  our  local 
<br/>communities,  it  will  assist  in  the  delivery  of  our  initiatives  and  the  establishment  of  governance 
<br/>within those intended communities to ensure the sustainability and diversification of projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to secure climate finance, it is important to review our policies and 
<br/>legislations to allow for new developments and partnerships.  We are currently reviewing our Forest 
<br/>Act  1992,  to  align  to  the  Climate  Change  Act  2021.    This  is  to  ensure  consistency  of  definition, 
<br/>processes, institutional arrangements and responsibility, and to provide a legal framework that will 
<br/>underpin forest climate change initiatives, including forest carbon trading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  with  the  changing  global  environment  in  terms  of  standards, 
<br/>compliance,  environmental,  economic,  social  and  political  development,  it  is  imperative  that  the 
<br/>Mahogany Industry Development Act 2010 be reviewed.  The Ministry will be undertaking this much 
<br/>needed review, in consultation with all stakeholders with the intention to address good governance, 
<br/>sustainability, compliance to trade requirements, inclusiveness of communities and overall economic 
<br/>growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The REDD Plus Policy of 2010 has been reviewed and is in the final stages of endorsement.  
<br/>This will set the much needed direction required for the forest emissions reduction programme and 
<br/>projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  Code  of  Practice  for  wood  processing  has  been  developed  to  ensure  sustainable  wood 
<br/>processing  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  sawmills  in  terms  of  recovery,  health  and  safety  and 
<br/>protection of the environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to support trade and diversify products from forests, the Ministry is 
<br/>developing partnerships to explore the potential of bamboo and other non-wood forest products, as 
<br/>well as assisting resource owners to effectively participate in our efforts towards value addition.  We 
<br/>are  working  closely  with  resource  owners  through  cottage  industries,  small  enterprises  and  co-
<br/>operatives by providing training and infrastructure to manufacture their products and markets access.  
<br/></span><span>Currently, we are supporting three cottage industries - Gaunavou Co-operative from Vugalei, Kalabu 
<br/></span><span>Youth and Sawakasa Youth.  In addition, we are supporting wood carvers from Fulaga and Kabara 
<br/>through training on product development and marketing their products, and eventually resourcing 
<br/>them with equipment through subsidies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Government,  through  the  Ministry,  continues  to  support  the 
<br/>maritime pine commercial programme for Kadavu and Lakeba, and this work is currently in progress.  
<br/>The  Ministry  is  working  with  all  key  stakeholders,  including  village  communities  in  these  two 
<br/>islands,  to  ensure  that  all  key  compliance  regulations  are  met  prior  to  the  commencement  of 
<br/></span><span>operations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry seeks to develop new technologies and tools to assist in economic development, 
<br/>improve  wellbeing  while  protecting  the  natural  resource-base  and  the  environment.    We  have 
<br/>developed online licensing systems for user ease and using GIS and remote sensing, coupled with 
<br/>the drone technology, to improve our resource assessment and enforcement.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Madam Deputy Speaker, on the topic of innovation, I wish to inform Parliament that this 
<br/>year, the International Day of Forests, which is annually celebrated on 21st March, has the theme 
<br/></span><span>“Forests and Innovation – New Solution for a Better World.”</span><span> We continue to harness new technology 
<br/>to  develop  new sustainable material  from trees,  newer  ways to  better manage our  forests and the 
<br/>products and services they provide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Ministry of Fisheries, we have prioritised the implementation of adaptation strategies 
<br/>to build resilience in the face of extreme weather events and changing environmental conditions by 
<br/>promoting and investing in aquaculture and the culture of coastal commodities.  One of the core focus 
<br/>areas  for  the  Ministry  is  dedicated  to  sustainable  capture  fisheries  and  aquaculture  practices  that 
<br/>ensure  the  long-term  health  of  its  marine  resources  and  support  the  livelihoods  of  our  coastal 
<br/>communities.  We are working to promote responsible fishing practices for our coastal communities 
<br/>and  sustainable  aquaculture  development  to  meet  the  growing  demand  of  the  seafood,  while 
<br/>preserving our oceans for future generations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry recognises the transformative power of technology and 
<br/>digitalisation in revolutionising our fisheries sector.  As a nation heavily reliant on agriculture and 
<br/>fisheries for food security and economic development, we understand the importance of harnessing 
<br/>innovation to enhance productivity, sustainability and resilience in our food systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has installed Vessel Monitoring Systems and electronic 
<br/>monitoring systems on fishing vessels which contribute to sustainable fishing practices and prevent 
<br/>Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing that could occur within our Exclusive Economic Zone. 
<br/>Together with placement of Fisheries Observers on longline vessels, it will ensure compliance and 
<br/>entering of correct data and timely submission of data from any particular area in the sea to the office 
<br/>for documentation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further  to  this,  the  Ministry  is  working  with  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Fisheries  Agency 
<br/>(PIFFA) to develop e-permitting and e-catch documentation systems, to ensure the mass balancing 
<br/>of tuna and tuna like products that pass through Fiji both, as export and re-export commodities, a 
<br/>system that complements the e-payment system provided by the Ministry of Finance, all aimed at 
<br/>ensuring the ease of doing business here in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we are committed through strategic partnerships, capacity building 
<br/>initiatives and investment  in  research and development. We aim to  empower our people with  the 
<br/>tools and knowledge needed to thrive in a rapidly evolving global landscape.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have facilitated consultations for the Aquaculture Development 
<br/>Plan, with involvement of the private sector. The consultation has completed two phases now with 
<br/>the  involvement  of  Fisheries  Technical  Officers  and  the  private  sector.    The  Plan  will  provide  a 
<br/>platform  for  the  private  sector,  Fisheries  Department  and  other  Government  agencies  to  work 
<br/>together  and  allow  the  export  of  highly  valued  fisheries  commodities,  which  will  contribute  to 
<br/>economic  growth  within  the  aquaculture  sector.  Furthermore,  the  promotion  of  aquaculture 
<br/>development is aligned to Strategic Goal 14, which is contributing to the protection of the coastal 
<br/>fisheries resources which has been over-exploited.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Aquaculture Bill is a legislation that protects the interests of the 
<br/>resource owners and investors and needs to be thoroughly reviewed before being tabled to Cabinet. 
<br/>The  forthcoming  review  of  Offshore  Fisheries  Management  Act  2012  and  Regulations  and  the 
<br/>Fisheries Act [Cap158], highlights our dedication to ensure robust legal frameworks, emphasizing 
<br/>extensive consultation processes across Fiji and inter-agency coordination.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>129 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our recent initiatives and ongoing endeavors reflect our dedication 
<br/>to  sustainable  fisheries  management,  economic  development  and  international  cooperation  on 
<br/>initiatives, such as the Fiji National Offshore Fishing Crew Policy and the Fiji National Fish Warden 
<br/>Policy. This aims to promote safety, labour conditions and compliance within the fishing industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  recent  lifting  of  the  ban  on  sea  cucumber  harvesting, 
<br/>accompanied by strict regulations and approved entities, demonstrates our commitment to balancing 
<br/>economic  interests  of  the  people  and  the  sector  with  marine  conservation  efforts.  The  Ministry 
<br/>continues to make a concerted effort, as in these cases, to ensure that the economic well-being is 
<br/>trickled down to the community level where the people will most benefit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has engaged efforts with certain private entities to enhance projects, like the 
<br/>Seaweed Development Project. This is a new direction the Ministry intends to expand the seaweed 
<br/>mass culture in the Northern Division namely; Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove. This will support the 
<br/>farms currently established in the Central and Western Divisions. This highlights our commitment to 
<br/>the  Public-Private  Partnership  and  sustainable  aquaculture  practices,  and  further  reinforces  that 
<br/>concept, that our communities are not only to engage in such efforts constructively but will be able 
<br/>to stand alone eventually and reap the benefits of such projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  remains  steadfast  in  its 
<br/>commitment  to  advancing  Fiji's  Fisheries  and  Forestry  Sectors.  Through  strategic  partnerships, 
<br/>legislative initiatives and proactive measures, we are dedicated to fostering sustainable development, 
<br/>promoting economic prosperity and safeguarding the wellbeing of our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I would like to echo the sentiments of His Excellency, who states and I quote: 
<br/>“…we are accountable of our actions.”  The journey will not be easy, but I would like to remind us 
<br/>all of the purpose we are here for.  Purpose crosses discipline. Purpose is an essential element for all 
<br/>of us and it is the reason why we are here at this particular time in history - our very existence is 
<br/>wrapped around what we are here to fulfil.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish  to  encourage positive, constructive  and respectful  dialogue for this new Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year, 2024.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I stand corrected on the statement I 
<br/>made about yielding time. I have been advised by the Secretary-General that the Business Committee 
<br/>had unanimously agreed that there will be no yielding.  So, honourable Bala, you have just gotten 
<br/></span><span>away with an extra four minutes and honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry may be one and 
<br/></span><span>a half minute. This has been agreed unanimously by the Business Committee so you will be speaking 
<br/>for 20 minutes under the understanding that you use it or lose it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I join my colleagues in expressing my sincere 
<br/>thanks and gratitude to His Excellency the President, </span><span>Na Gone Turaga na Tui Macuata</span><span>, for his most 
<br/>gracious and assuring Address.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency’s Address is assuring because it contains positive 
<br/>statements of great significance to this nation.  The notion of peace, stability, prosperity, inclusivity 
<br/>and security echoes throughout his Address.  His vision for Fiji is a Fiji we all long to see and it is a 
<br/>vision not out of our reach, a vision we can make a reality provided that Government delivers.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth is, many of the intentions raised in His Excellency’s 2023 Parliament Address have 
<br/>not  been  fulfilled  by  the  Government.    On  the  fourth  paragraph  of  Page  12  of  His  Excellency’s 
<br/>Address on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2023, he stated, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“…I urge this august Parliament to embody the collective spirit of resilience and 
<br/>resolve of our people. This will bring hope of a promising future for the citizens of our 
<br/>beloved nation which we call home.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, people are migrating at an alarming rate.  They are looking for new 
<br/>homes elsewhere. A total of 3,207 left our shores in 2023 looking for new homes across the world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, 15,794 left for employment; 10,718 left for education purposes and 
<br/>we know for sure most will not return.  Yes, our people do have the right to seek opportunities to go 
<br/>elsewhere but the huge migration data is telling us that our people are fleeing our shores, fleeing a 
<br/>country that is their birth right, that is their home.  It begs the question, what is Government doing to 
<br/>make Fiji, this place we call home, a better home for everyone?  Could it be that Government has 
<br/>failed to nurture the collective spirit of resilience mentioned by His Excellency?  Instead, what we 
<br/>see today is Government’s silence on increase in racism and nationalism, both ethno and religious.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  during  a  Government  consultation  on  the  Local  Government 
<br/>Electoral Process held in Suva on 25</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, an </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>gentleman, who was not happy 
<br/>with the statement uttered by an Indo-Fijian man, stood and said, “if you are not happy, just go back 
<br/>to where you came from.”  Let me remind Parliament, that that is not freedom of expression, that is 
<br/>racism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Was that man cautioned and arrested for that deplorable attack?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No! Did Government condemn that action?  No!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, silence in the face of injustice is complicity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- To make Fiji a home for everyone irrespective of race, colour or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>creed requires the Government to speak out against racism and promote…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- What number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER. – Please, take your seat, Sir.  Your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.– His speech uttering, inciting … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  and  creating  hostility  and  ill-will.    The  fact  that  the 
<br/>honourable Member gives an example about  social media, what  people say, there are equally the 
<br/>same number or if not more Indo-Fijians making comments on social media.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- What comments? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Racial comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Once you are finished, sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- There are, of course, </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people also, but for him to come 
<br/>into Parliament and use that example, implying that because of Government, this is what they are 
<br/>trying to do, Madam Deputy Speaker, it must stop.  They are insulting His Excellency the President’s 
<br/>call for a decent debate, tolerance and understanding.  I want to register that as a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Tuinaceva, will you, please, take note of that.  Perhaps, if you would like to couch 
<br/>your statement, the allegation that you have made to say that is what was uttered by someone because 
<br/>the other side is saying that it was not the Government’s spokesperson.  However, that is up to you, 
<br/>but this is going to be on the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Yes, honourable Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.– Standing Order 60 - Relevance.  The discussions that have 
<br/>been made by  the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister of Economy is  null and void.  
<br/>Honourable Tuinaceva was basically stating something that had been discussed in the public arena.  
<br/>If the honourable Minister does not want it, that is his problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, I take your point.  I 
<br/>think I would like to go back to words that are likely to promote or provoke feelings of ill-will and 
<br/>hostility  between  communities  or  ethnic  groups  in  Fiji.    Honourable  Tuinaceva,  perhaps,  just 
<br/>couching and giving context to the person to whom you referred. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  make  Fiji  a  home  for  everyone,  irrespective  of  race,  colour  or  creed  requires  the 
<br/>Government to speak out loud on racism.  Fiji does not belong to only one race, it belongs to everyone 
<br/></span><span>who has worked hard to make this country a great nation and we want to make this place we call 
<br/></span><span>home great again - a place where we all feel we belong, where every person feels the courage to 
<br/>speak, feels safe to live and the joy of belonging.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, political stability is crucial for our multi-ethnic and multicultural 
<br/>society to grow. Political stability is enabled with honouring the Constitution. The Government has, 
<br/>on many occasions, undermined the value of justice, equality and transparency that is alive in our 
<br/>Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  consider  the  appointments  of  certain  Permanent  Secretaries,  Board  of  Directors,  as 
<br/></span><span>already being mentioned by my colleagues, Diplomats, Special Administrators and earlier on today, 
<br/>we heard a lot about our Advisory Councillors, et cetera.  Most are failed election candidates or party 
<br/>supporters and do not even meet minimum qualification requirements.  It is called cronyism.  It is 
<br/>wrong, it is abuse of powers.  It breeds political instability, it undermines public trust and confidence 
<br/>in Government.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Government has been accused of dirty, unethical and irresponsible behaviour 
<br/>by  those  sitting  on  the  other  side  of  Parliament,  and  it  is  sad  to  note  that  this  Government  is 
<br/>manifesting the accusation it makes.  The case of the pot calling the kettle black. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in 2023, we have seen breaches of the 
<br/>separation of powers guarded by the Constitution.  We have witnessed the removal and appointments 
<br/>of holders of key Constitutional offices in a manner that did not follow due diligence and process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- I urge the Government to honour the Constitution and respect the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rule of law to prevent grave confusion and our slide into anarchy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, permit me to comment further on issues raised by His Excellency 
<br/>in his Address at the Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  Firstly, the 
<br/>principles  of  democracy  and  humanity  are  enshrined  in  our  Constitution.    They  are,  indeed, 
<br/>fundamental pillars of our society.  Therefore, it is imperative that we ensure that we are not merely 
<br/>paying lip service to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Democracy and humanity must be actively upheld in our governance and policy decisions.  
<br/>Let us uphold respect, integrity and the dignity of this august Parliament by manifesting with action 
<br/>our belief in these Constitutional principles.  It  requires a commitment to open dialogue, genuine 
<br/>consultation and meaningful engagement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I must commend some Ministers and Assistant Ministers for their 
<br/>openness to dialogue and offer assistance on issues that affect people, especially in the rural areas 
<br/>which we presented to their offices.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu turaga </span><span>Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the notion of inclusive development mentioned by His Excellency 
<br/>to improve the wellbeing of citizens is commendable. However, we must remember that inclusive 
<br/>development places the most vulnerable at the centre of development.  Inclusive development ensures 
<br/>that everyone has equitable access to opportunities.  This should be the standard by which we measure 
<br/>inclusivity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Targeted interventions must be prioritized for marginalized and vulnerable communities, who 
<br/></span><span>for too long, have remained in the peripheries of development.  Many of these communities exist in 
<br/>the rural areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusive development reverses the marginalization of these communities.  In this way, we 
<br/>prosper  together.    I  heard  that  His  Excellency  declares  Government’s  commitment  to  rural 
<br/>development, and I can only hope Government has the resolve to see this through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, for more than a year, at 5.00 a.m. school children from Cora and 
<br/></span><span>Nautoloulou Settlements in Wainunu District in Bua, walk more than three kilometres to the main 
<br/></span><span>road to catch a bus to get to school because the roads are so bad, no vehicle is willing to travel it.  I 
<br/>visited the district last month and saw fathers and mothers carrying babies in the hot sun back from 
<br/>the health centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Two Hundred people live in that area.  As long as we continue to hear and witness these types 
<br/>of stories, we cannot say we have inclusive development.  What is being done about to fix their roads, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>133 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to give them the same equitable access to resources and opportunities like the many of us have so 
<br/>that  when  we  speak  about  inclusive  development,  we  stand  with  integrity  and  honour  in  this 
<br/>Parliament and know that we are truly meaning it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam Deputy Speaker, the portion of the road from Bativurewai to Daria is in a bad state 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and urgently needs maintenance and some upgrade work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Adi Eleni Primary School is regularly flooded even during small downpours.  The culvert 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in front of the school is blocked more than a year now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  acknowledge  the  intervention  of  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Health in  the appointment  of Medical  Officers for the Wainunu  and Lekutu  Health Centres.   For 
<br/>almost  six  months,  people  travelled  the  long  distance  to  Nabouwalu  Hospital  to  access  medical 
<br/>services.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, Turaga</span><span> Minister!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when it is high tide or during flooding events, villages of Viani in 
<br/>Navatu  District  wait  for  hours  by  the  roadside  before  they  can  get  home.    The  people  have  been 
<br/>crying for the construction of their crossing.  Inclusive and equitable development, again, I beg the 
<br/>question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, not far from here in Naitasiri, ginger and </span><span>dalo</span><span> farming communities, 
<br/>like  Uluisavudua  in  Sawani,  struggle  without  electricity,  water  and  good  roads.    Although  they 
<br/>contribute  to  economic  development,  they  do  not  enjoy  the  same  basic  infrastructure  as  their 
<br/>neighbours in Suva - just a few kilometres away.  Government has been promising the community 
<br/>electricity since September last year, but it has not happened.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is digital age and yet, students from some rural communities like 
<br/>Navonu in  Cakaudrove hunt  for internet  hotspots miles from their homes to  get  necessary school 
<br/>assignments and projects done.  Internet network needs major improvement in the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Tunuloa, 
<br/></span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Natewa, </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Navatu, </span><span>Tikina</span><span> of Korocau, certain parts of Wailevu West in Cakaudrove, 
<br/>Kubulau in Bua and Matuku in Lau.  For these communities, good internet access means equitable 
<br/>access to opportunities in education, government services, commercial ventures and communication 
<br/>– just as we enjoy here in the Capital.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, villagers of Natua, Vunidamoli and Natuvu in Wailevu West and 
<br/>Nasinu, Korolevu, Navakaka and others along the Natewa West Road are also still waiting for the 
<br/></span><span>electricity grid to be extended to their villages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At Laucala and Naiqaqi Villages, Vunibuabua and Dogoru Settlements in the Tikina Wailevu, 
<br/>they are still waiting  for their solar units Government  promised to  install in  2023.  Similarly, for 
<br/>Nakorovou Village in the Tikina Kubulau and Vatuvonu Settlement in the Tikina Korocau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to convey the appreciation from the people of Keka and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nakobo Villages who got their units done last year. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu, Turaga</span><span> Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I was expecting His Excellency to address carnage on our roads, 
<br/></span><span>considering it is a crisis.  In 2023, we logged the worst in 11 years with road fatalities.  We hit crisis 
<br/>point - 64 percent increase in road fatalities from 2022; 26,000 speeding infringement notices given 
<br/>in only the first six months of a year; 4,000 road accidents from January to December last year, eight 
<br/>deaths happened with a span of two weeks; and 161 accidents recorded within 14 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Risky, reckless, aggressive driving behaviours match statistics.  In 2023, 53 public service 
<br/>vehicle drivers were booked for drugs issues. It is safe to assume that hundred more drivers drive 
<br/>under the influence of illicit substances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Simply,  our  roads  are  killing  fields  and  here,  we  have  the  Government  spin  doctors 
<br/>minimising  the  crisis  to  the  point  of  normalizing  the  carnage.    It  is  unacceptable  that  we  should 
<br/>devalue human life, unacceptable that the right to life of all road users is minimised with the inaction 
<br/>of Government regarding this crisis.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only action that matches the severity of this crisis is good enough.  The highest action 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and level of urgency for the protection of the greatest of rights which is the right to live is warranted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot stand here and say we uphold democracy when we cannot even protect people’s 
<br/>right to life on our roads.  Since October 2018, the Accident Compensation Commission paid $44 
<br/>million in compensation.  But compensations alone are not a panacea for this road safety problem. 
<br/>The solution is in minimising road accidents by implementing proper safety measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there is an evil that has been long lurking but now openly rearing 
<br/>its  ugly  head.    Drug  abuse  and  trafficking  is  slowly  but  surely  choking  our  communities.    It  is 
<br/>overtaking and victimising our children, harming families and violating the foundation, the peace, 
<br/>comfort and security of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drug case for the month of January 2024 recorded a significant 94 percent increase as 169 
<br/>illicit drug cases were registered, compared to 87 the same period last year.  That is according to 
<br/>Police.  Where is Government’s commitment in tackling this scourge before it overtakes us?  We 
<br/>witness a huge human costs other countries are enduring because of this illicit drug trade.  We must 
<br/>act before it is too late. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the number of street dwellers keep growing which is indicative of 
<br/>poverty.  The worst and the sad part is the sudden increase in the number of children below the age 
<br/>of 16 years who are roaming and living on the streets, especially in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the rising report of domestic violence reflects the suffering of our 
<br/>women  and  children.  According  to  Police  report,  crimes  against  women  recorded  a  31  percent 
<br/>increase with 252 cases received in January 2024, compared to the same period in 2023.  In the words 
<br/>of the Fiji Women ‘s Crisis Centre, someone’s life is everyone’s business. Can we see this reflected 
<br/></span><span>in the Government agenda for 2024 in a more serious way? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency echoed a set of words at the very part of His Address.  
<br/>It is a reminder to everyone in this august Parliament on our responsibilities in representing the voice 
<br/>of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our people are groaning under the high costs of living. It is almost 
<br/>everyone  we  meet  on  the  streets  who  are  asking  the  question,  “why  is  everything  so  costly 
<br/>nowadays?”  That is, from food items, clothing, hardware, fuel, transport, rent and everything are 
<br/></span><span>expensive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People are not only complaining but they are also angry.  They are suffering.  Now, it is all 
<br/>over the media and FCCC is saying that consumers can expect to see an increase in bus fare soon.  
<br/>My question to  Government, are you really going to  allow this to  happen?   With all the level  of 
<br/>distress and hardship that people are going through due to high cost of living, are you still going to 
<br/>do that?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, thank you for your patience in  listening.   Before I take my  seat, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allow me to utter the voice of my people from Matuku Island. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  I  want  to  acknowledge  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  accepting  a  submission 
<br/>from the people regarding the airport and the road on the island.  Matuku islanders face a crucial 
<br/>situation. They have one of the largest pine plantations that can easily sustain their building needs, 
<br/>but the cost of milling is just too high - triple the cost of building a similar house elsewhere.  Pine 
<br/>logs are sent to Suva for milling, treatment and then back to Lau for use.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A humble request to the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to support our people 
<br/>with the installation of a mobile timber treatment plant on the island which can be shared amongst 
<br/>the neighbouring islands.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, a big </span><span>kerekere </span><span>to the honourable Minister for Regional Development.   </span><span>Ni yalovinaka</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saka</span><span>, our people need a shed at the jetty in Yaroi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Matuku  Health  Centre  and  its  adjoining  staff  quarters  need 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urgent repair.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Matuku does not have a secondary school.  Parents send their children across to Suva 
<br/>for high school and that comes with huge socio-economic costs.  This too is something they plead 
<br/>with Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I pray our ears willingly hear the cries of our people; I pray our eyes 
<br/>clearly see their plight; I pray our hearts deeply feel their pain and suffering; and our hands and feet 
<br/>hasten to bring them light, joy and hope; and most of all, I pray we remember to truly serve 
<br/>and not wallow in self-indulgence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on the wings of that prayer, I want to thank you for your indulgence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament;  I rise to thank His Excellency the President of 
<br/>Fiji for His most gracious Speech during the opening of this new session of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I go on, Madam Deputy Speaker, I, first of all, would like to respond to some of the 
<br/></span><span>comments made by honourable Members from the other side of Parliament, including a question that 
<br/>was put to me personally yesterday by honourable Ketan Lal. It seems that there is only one side of 
<br/>Parliament  that  has  members  who  are  obsessed  with  this  political  instability.  No  wonder  His 
<br/>Excellency the President mentioned about  unscrupulous politicians promoting instability amongst 
<br/>our community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  fanaticism  with  political  instability  did  not  start  in  this 
<br/>Parliament. It started way back when we were campaigning for Elections up to the point where the 
<br/></span><span>Commander of the Fiji Military Forces was asked to assist Police in maintaining law and order.  Let 
<br/></span><span>us be honest with each other and let us stop this rumour mongering because it takes us nowhere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to honourable Ketan Lal, he had asked a question like if I can recall correctly. Is 
<br/>it  right  for  the  Minister  for  Agriculture  to  take  his  father’s  ashes  in  a  Government  vessel?    My 
<br/>response to that is that it was an official trip by the Minister for Agriculture on his visit to the Lau 
<br/>Group of Islands and I had sought the honourable Prime Minister’s permission, not only for that visit,  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but also to take my father’s ashes on the same trip.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I want to say to you, honourable Ketan Lal, through you Madam Deputy Speaker, is try 
<br/>to get the full picture before you come and mislead Parliament because I have observed you overtime 
<br/>in Parliament.  Talk is cheap. Anyone can say whatever they want, but you need to put your facts 
<br/>right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Go and read the  </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> first, then come and talk to me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am asking honourable 
<br/>Ketan Lal, “Look around you because within your ranks you have people who can teach you about 
<br/>decorum in this Parliament, teach you about respect and teach you about manners.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to extend my gratitude and acknowledge the hard work 
<br/>and dedication of the 98,220 farmers - men, women, young and old, and those with special needs in 
<br/>Fiji. They have made great sacrifices to ensure that there is sufficient nutritious food available for all 
<br/>Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also pay tribute to the men and women staff of the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, 
<br/>who have toiled day and night on trying conditions to see that the Agriculture Sector remains well 
<br/>and alive to feed the citizens of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways has recently organised 
<br/>several agricultural events and initiatives to promote traditional farming methods and support local 
<br/>farmers. These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Field demonstration in Mulomulo, Nawaka, to showcase yam planting techniques. 
<br/>The National Ginger Summit. 
<br/>Training for kava farmers in Bukuya, Ba.  
<br/>The National Turmeric Taskforce Meeting. 
<br/>Distribution of cassava flour machines to women clusters in Ba. 
<br/>Construction of new farm access roads that has started in Cicia with Vanuabalavu, Moala 
<br/>and Lakeba to follow. The same has been done in the Lomaiviti Province on the island of 
<br/>Ovalau which will be followed by Koro and Kadavu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week ended on a high note, as we celebrated International Women’s Day by hosting an 
<br/>inaugural  Women  in  Agriculture  Awards  Night  to  recognise  the  contribution  of  women  to  the 
<br/>agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I fully agree with His Excellency that agriculture will continue to 
<br/>be the backbone of our economy for food and nutrition security and exports. To achieve this, the 
<br/>Ministry is mandated to see that all Fijians are food and nutrition secure, despite the challenges posed 
<br/>by climate change, pandemics and conflicts that disrupt food supply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  has  already  launched  its  Five-Year  Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan for 2024 to 2028, with a vision of a resilient, inclusive, competitive, innovative 
<br/>and  food  secure  Agriculture  and  Waterways  Sector.  This  Strategic  Plan  focuses  on  innovation, 
<br/>collaboration and strategic investments that link with the National Development Plan and are also 
<br/>aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Strategic Development Plan comprises five strategic priorities and these are: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improving food and nutrition security; 
<br/>improving livelihoods for farming households; 
<br/>increasing adoption of sustainable resource management and climate smart agriculture; 
<br/>increasing commercial agriculture; and  
<br/>improving the quality of public sector performance and service delivery.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased that the Ministry, in close collaboration with other relevant stakeholders, now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has a strategic direction to uplift the Agriculture Sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, I would like to outline 
<br/>the Ministry’s priorities for the year 2024 and beyond, supporting the strategic direction and focusing 
<br/>on  benefitting  our  farming  and  vulnerable  communities.    I  had  emphasised  the  significance  of 
<br/>utilising modern and large scale technologies to  enhance agricultural productivity in the crop and 
<br/>livestock sectors since I took office.  By improving mechanisation, we can address the problem of 
<br/>aging farmers, make better use of idle agricultural land, increase efficiency, tackle labour shortages, 
<br/>scale up our economic output and equip our farmers with the necessary tools and knowledge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to develop financial literacy capacity, the Ministry will continue to 
<br/>capacitate farmers by promoting farming as a business.  In collaboration with other stakeholders, the 
<br/>Ministry  conducts  trainings  and  workshops,  tailored  to  farmers’  needs,  covering  topics  such  as 
<br/>budgeting, savings, borrowing and investment, as well as specific agricultural finance concepts like 
<br/>crop budgeting and accessing agricultural loans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  empowering  our  farmers  with  financial  security  and  self-reliance,  the  Ministry  is  also 
<br/>exploring a farmers’ savings scheme model that will best suit categories of farmers to encourage a 
<br/>culture of financial responsibility that can have a positive impact on national prosperity and a secure 
<br/>future.  In addition, the Ministry has also started developing a strategy to use farming as a tool to 
<br/>alleviate  poverty  by  assisting  families  from  marginalised  groups  and  communities  in  Fiji  in 
<br/>collaboration with other Ministries within Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry is among other Government Ministries implementing 
<br/>the Gender Responsive Planning and Budgeting Tool under the lead role of the Ministry of Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection, supported by the Ministry of Finance, Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics.  A total of five capital programmes are currently piloted by the Ministry 
<br/>under this initiative.  The Ministry has established a Gender Mainstreaming Action Group through 
<br/>the Gender Transformative Institutional Capacity Development initiative, to ensure that all policies, 
<br/></span><span>planning, projects and budgeting in the Ministry are gender responsive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  part  of  the  new  5-Year  Strategic  Development  Plan,  the 
<br/>Ministry’s Strategic Priority 2 aims to enhance the agriculture sector’s value adding capabilities to 
<br/>increase  profits  and  enable  entry  into  new,  profitable  markets  for  our  farmers.    This  will  expand 
<br/>production  seasons,  empower  our  women  and  youth  economically,  improve  socio-economic 
<br/>livelihood and address post-harvest losses in agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  achieve  this,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  will  continue  to  provide 
<br/>agriculture value-adding machinery, including equipment and machines for processing cassava flour, 
<br/>virgin coconut oil and other agricultural products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will continue the capacity building programmes in value addition products for 
<br/>farmers and women’s groups in our rural and maritime communities.  By fostering partnerships with 
<br/></span><span>both, domestic and international markets, we will create a more robust network for trade, with fair 
<br/></span><span>pricing mechanisms and support systems in place.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  a  vulnerable  island  nation,  Fiji  recognises  the  urgent  need  to 
<br/>address the impacts of climate change on the agriculture sector.  The Ministry’s Strategic Priority 3 
<br/>focuses on the adoption  of sustainable resource  management and  climate smart  agriculture.  This 
<br/>includes the need to fortify our agricultural practices against the challenges posed by climate change 
<br/>through innovative approaches, in which we envision building resilience within our farming systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  recent  endorsement  of  the  Drainage  (Amendment)  Act  2023  by  Parliament,  the 
<br/>Government  is  undertaking  a  strategic  initiative  to  re-establish  the  Drainage  Board.    This  crucial 
<br/>entity will oversee the management of 103 Drainage Schemes spanning the Central, Western and 
<br/>Northern  Divisions.    This  endeavour  is  poised  to  enhance  support  for  our  invaluable  sugarcane 
<br/>farmers and cash crop cultivators operating within these schemes, fostering growth and prosperity 
<br/>within our vital agriculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  upcoming  development  of  a  comprehensive  National  Waterways  Management 
<br/>Programme is a crucial initiative to address the challenges posed by climate change.  The Programme 
<br/>focuses on maintaining and improving waterways infrastructure to protect critical assets from flood 
<br/>damage and implementing erosion control measures. Additionally, it promotes sustainable land use 
<br/>and development through zoning regulations, flood risk management and restoration of natural water 
<br/>systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways is fully committed to 
<br/>fostering a resilient and inclusive agriculture sector that not only ensures food and nutrition security 
<br/>for  all  Fijians,  but  also  drives  economic  growth  and  sustainable  development,  improves  socio-
<br/>economic  livelihoods  and  alleviates  poverty.  Through  strategic  investments,  innovation  and 
<br/>collaboration,  we  will  pave  the  way  for  a  brighter  and  more  prosperous  future  for  all,  including 
<br/>women and youth in Fiji’s agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Members  of  Parliament;  </span><span>bula, 
<br/>ramram, salam </span><span>and good afternoon to you all.  Change is the rule of nature.  Everyone or everything 
<br/>must  change  with  time  whether  it  be  society  or  the  rules  that  governs  the  society,  eventually  it 
<br/>changes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while the world realises the change that can be brought by climatic 
<br/>events due to global warming, people of Fiji in just the past one year have literally understood that 
<br/>the devastating changes that have been brought to the people of Fiji by this Coalition Government is 
<br/></span><span>far greater, compared to the change that global warming did globally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Where are your facts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Climate change gradually brought about this devastation, but the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  was  in  top  gear  when  it  came  to  changes,  even  if  it  meant  changing  the 
<br/>promises they made during the Elections or the promises they made that was to be brought about in 
<br/>their first 100 days in Government, or in the first six months, or even in the first year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are hearing now is that they cannot do everything in just one year.  I can say this 
<br/></span><span>with confidence that they will continue to say that, even after one whole term that they cannot do 
<br/>everything in just one term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, they will be consistent in only one thing,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>139 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which is blaming the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Although Government Ministers are out attending opening ceremonies, wearing </span><span>salusalu</span><span> and 
<br/>having </span><span>magiti</span><span> for the very projects that we initiated during the previous FijiFirst Government, they 
<br/>fail to give credit to the previous Government.  I wonder if any of the honourable Ministers, during 
<br/>the commissioning ceremony, had stated that the project was initiated by the Coalition Government.  
<br/>The simple answer would be, ‘no’, because I do not recall that they had initiated any new projects in 
<br/>the  last  financial  year.    How  can  they  work  on  new  projects  when  they  cannot  even  maintain  or 
<br/>complete the projects initiated by FijiFirst?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been in Parliament for the past nine years now and this will be the tenth year, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker.  We have seen a lot in the past nine years.  Already, we have had Presidents come 
<br/>to open the new session of Parliament seven times and three times when Presidents have opened the 
<br/>new term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my surprise, His Excellency the President pleaded for the same thing that was pleaded by 
<br/>previous  Presidents  during  the  opening  of  Parliament.  What  used  to  surprise  us,  and  it  is  not  me 
<br/>saying it, it is recorded in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, that Opposition Members back then used to rubbish 
<br/>the Presidential Speech. But do not worry, we, as Opposition Members of Parliament, have ethics 
<br/>and although we may have reservations with the person, we still respect the position and its integrity, 
<br/>and we would not condemn the speech as it has been done in this Parliament previously.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Your leader rubbished the President. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Just listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- For the past many years, the same plea was given to Members of 
<br/>Parliament  that  we  need  to  be  vigilant  in  what  we  say  or  claim  in  Parliament.  Prior  to  2023,  the 
<br/>Government used to do good, but we were blamed for not doing enough and now the Government is 
<br/>doing nothing and we are requested to speak in favor of the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Facts, facts, where is your facts? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, during our time, we used to say, “Do not 
<br/></span><span>do hate speech, do not talk about racism”, but now, we are being asked not to talk about nepotism 
<br/></span><span>and corruption that is becoming the foundation of this Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, we were labeled as racists this morning.  
<br/>Everyone  knows  who  has  given  us  the  blue  book  known  as  the  Constitution,  which  is  based  on 
<br/>equality and equal citizenry. No one here on our side in any shape or form promotes division. We 
<br/>know very well who was doing this during Elections and now as Government, they have started once 
<br/></span><span>again. One of the examples is attempts made to change the Constitution to change the common name, 
<br/></span><span>“Fijian”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- There you go! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  moment  we  speak  about  nepotism,  corruption,  law  and 
<br/>security,  increase  of  illegal  activities,  unemployment,  increase  in  inflation,  hardship  faced  by  the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>poor, what are we told? That the Opposition is not being cooperative and that we need to work hand 
<br/>in hand to resolve these issues. We had been asking for the same cooperation from the Opposition 
<br/>for the past eight years, but did Opposition ever cooperate?  No.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Where is the transparency? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the only agenda they had for the past eight 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years was to remove FijiFirst from government and form the new government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- That was the biggest achievement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Well, it seems like, it is a sin in Fiji now to talk about corruption, 
<br/>rule of law, lack of investor confidence, high rate of inflation, nepotism, breach of the Constitution, 
<br/>et  cetera.    I  am  sorry  to  say  this  but  in  democracy,  the  Opposition  has  the  mandate  to  keep 
<br/>Government  in  check  and  to  keep  the  Government  accountable  for  any  decision  Cabinet  makes.  
<br/>Working with the Government for the betterment of Fiji is one thing but as an effective Opposition, 
<br/>we need to speak against Government and ensure transparency and accountability is in place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was all about change, change and change - changing Chief Executive Officers, Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries, High Commissioners, Board members, company directors, Special Administrators and 
<br/>Advisory Counsellors. All of them were victims because of this so-called change.  We warned people 
<br/>that such changes are not good for the nation because when corruption creeps in, knowledge moves 
<br/>out.  That is exactly what is happening in Fiji.  So many educated Fijians are leaving the country 
<br/>because they know their future is where their knowledge and merit is appreciated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, instead of pleading with us, please, improve the Civil Service which 
<br/>has changed for the worse in the past year. This Government promised permanent establishment for 
<br/>civil servants, but it is one year now, and civil servants are still waiting.  Why are only new appointees 
<br/>getting permanent establishment to retire at 60?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil servants under this Government have the freedom to work the way they want, without 
<br/>tension.  What is happening now is that Ministers and Assistant Ministers are having difficulties in 
<br/>getting the job done because what has been embedded into the Civil Service system is sluggishness 
<br/>and botherless attitude.  Do not rubbish these claims, please, go and improve the system because 
<br/>individuals are suffering. Go and ask those patients who are waiting for hours in lines to be seen by 
<br/>the  doctor,  patients  who  are  waiting  for  months  to  be  operated  on  because  most  of  the  operating 
<br/></span><span>theatres at CWM Hospital are not operational. FijiFirst had made 10 operating theatres, only four or 
<br/></span><span>five are operational at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ask those people who are waiting for normal water supply to their pipes?  The Viria Water 
<br/>Project is on hold just because the rumor is, one Minister, all of a sudden, has manipulated the minds 
<br/>of landowning units that they should claim that the freehold land where the treatment plant is, is not 
<br/>on freehold but theirs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Misleading, water is going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  One such  childish  approach from someone within  the Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government and more than 250,000 people in the Suva-Nausori corridor are suffering.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-There have been a lot of scenarios in the last one year when 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>141 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government Ministers do not spare a moment criticising the past Government but, at the same time, 
<br/>they do not see under their own administration what is happening. The action of one Member of the 
<br/>Coalition Government is affecting how other Members perform their ministerial responsibilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even  some  honourable  Ministers  agree  that  they  in  trying  to  remove  the  civil  servants 
<br/>appointed by FijiFirst, that has led to brain-drain within the system, and they do not have qualified 
<br/>people to  do the job.  Some honourable Ministers were smart enough to  retain some of them, but 
<br/>others are now struggling with their own Ministries.  The institutional knowledge is gone, it will not 
<br/>come back as these educated people took the next available flight out of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  I  have  said  before,  if  you  breed  corruption  and  nepotism, 
<br/>knowledge will take the next available flight to where it is appreciated.  Worst case scenario is that 
<br/>these honourable Ministers cannot even blame anyone because it was the Government’s decision to 
<br/>dismiss the contracts of those qualified people and appoint people based on nepotism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I expected His Excellency’s Speech to address four sections of our 
<br/>society  -  youth,  the  poor,  female  and  farmers.  I  thought  he  would  emphasize  more  about  health, 
<br/>education, agriculture, housing and social protection.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, FijiFirst planted a seed. We watered it daily, the plant grew into a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>healthy tree, it was bearing fruits and then the Coalition Government came in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You just want to create your facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  They  came  in  with  vengeance  and  without  realizing,  they  first 
<br/>trimmed the branches, and with those branches went the fruits, and then they uprooted the tree later 
<br/>on. All the Coalition Government had to do was to keep the tree and reap the benefit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the fruit of the tree was of benefit to the Fijians.  The branches were 
<br/>the projects and positive changes brought about by the FijiFirst Government, and the root of the tree 
<br/>was the National Development Plan. This Government destroyed the tree and now they want to plant 
<br/>a new seed. Very poor strategic planning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- The new National Development Plan distorted the Civil Service - 
<br/></span><span>no new capital project, what is in store for the public is no longer a guess but everyone knows that 
<br/></span><span>there will not be any fruit because there is no tree.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, all this Government had to do was to continue where FijiFirst left, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they would have reaped the benefit as the foundation of a modern Fiji was laid 16 years ago.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Through the </span><span>coup</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- On one side, Government has removed the student loan saying they 
<br/></span><span>have removed the burden of repayment but to balance it off on the other hand, VAT has increased, 
<br/></span><span>the First Home Buyers Grant has been reduced so net effect is zero. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, taxation reforms were well strategized. 
<br/>All that was needed from the Authority was to improve compliance in terms of collecting tax from 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the agents. The Vat Monitoring System (VMS) should have been implemented in other industries as 
<br/>well, especially in small and medium-sized industries because most of the cash dealing takes place 
<br/>in small and medium-sized enterprises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  the Budget  debate,  I mentioned it to  the  honourable Minister of  Finance that $3.7 
<br/>billion revenue is a very ambitious target. The current report from the Reserve Bank of Fiji suggests 
<br/>that collection is well below target set by the Coalition Government. The Government should have 
<br/>maintained the 9 percent VAT and should have ensured that those businesses that are not paying tax 
<br/>to do so.  It is always better to make 10 people pay $10 rather than getting one person to pay $100. 
<br/>The net effect is the same, revenue would be $100, but the burden is shared if all 10 people pay their 
<br/>share.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Businesses are paying rent of $4,000 to $6,000 on a monthly basis, yet they are using cash 
<br/>registers. Implement the use of Point of Sales (POS) with VMS for those businesses as one can only 
<br/>imagine  if  businesses  are  paying  that  amount  of  rent,  what  would  be  their  total  annual  turnover. 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS) needs to crack down on such 
<br/>business practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- What is happening to the National Switch?  When are we going to 
<br/>implement wireless payments so that we can crack down on black economy?  There are millions of 
<br/>dollars that are collected as VAT but not paid to FRCS.  If we work on this, we can bring VAT and 
<br/>duty down on most of the items that will help the poor and the needy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  can  stand  here  and  try  to  paint  a 
<br/>picture that everything is perfect outside the walls of this Parliament, but it is not.  Our people are 
<br/>suffering.  No matter how much paint we put on the walls.  One needs to go to the market and talk to 
<br/>the  market  vendors  or  talk  to  the  farmers.  I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  to  go  to  the 
<br/>sugarcane farmers with security guards, please.  Security is an issue… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… or to the squatter settlements, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the people are waiting for a piece of 
<br/></span><span>land to build their house or talk to the employees who are just earning the minimum wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President said to listen to the people, but Government Ministers are not 
<br/>even sharing their mobile phone contacts.  How will they listen when people cannot even call them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I do not blame them, Madam Deputy Speaker, as selective hearing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a common phenomenon for the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Advisory Councillors are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the Government.  I agree, 
<br/>people  were  handpicked,  but  why  is  the  Advisory  Councillor  of  Vunivau,  Labasa,  is  someone 
<br/>residing in Labasa Town?  Why is the Advisory Councillor of Covata area residing in Lajonia?  Why 
<br/>is the Naduna Advisory Councillor residing in Vunimoli?   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Madam Deputy Speaker, to put this into geography, it is Area A, 
<br/>Area B and Area C.  Someone sitting in Area A is the advisory councillor of Area C.  How is that 
<br/>possible, Madam Deputy Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- They need to be qualified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Who did this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Some of those appointees, Madam Deputy Speaker, cannot even 
<br/>fill any forms or write a letter.  Advisory Councillors are the eyes and ears of the Government but in 
<br/>here, when they do not even reside in the area they are serving, how will they hear the plea of the 
<br/>people they are supposed to serve and what will they tell the Government?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If they were to listen to  the public, they will realise that the air fares with Fiji Airways is 
<br/>getting very expensive.  During the time of FijiFirst, one way air fare to Labasa used to start at $65 
<br/>with a 15-kilogramme luggage.  Now, it is $105 with just a carry-on and if you buy with luggage, it 
<br/>is close to $130 one way.  This is from Suva.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Oh my god!  What is the Minister doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- If we consider Nadi, it starts from $153 ranging up to $295 with a 
<br/>15-kilogramme luggage one way.  That is just local fares.  Very soon, locals who are trying to visit 
<br/>overseas might not be able to afford the air fares and if the Government cannot bring the fares down, 
<br/>please, open our skies to other carriers as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Flying  to  the  USA,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  has  gone  up  from 
<br/>$2,000 to $3,500 return.  Let the competition dictate the aviation industry.  As stated by honourable 
<br/>Kirpal yesterday, we had Qantas ambassadors in this Parliament but now, they seem to be silent when 
<br/>Fiji Airways is increasing air fares.  That reminds me, where is the Fiji Airways Annual Report and 
<br/>why has it not been tabled in Parliament till to-date?  It was the same people sitting in Government 
<br/>who have been asking for this report for the past eight years and we are into the fifteenth month in 
<br/>Government, none of these reports have been tabled in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Are we doing enough to decrease the burden of ordinary Fijians?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not think so, Madam Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When FijiFirst used to help people through Social Protection Programmes, we were told that 
<br/>we were handing out freebees, but I do not understand why, all of sudden, we do not hear this word 
<br/>in this Parliament anymore.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There has been an increase in the budget for the Ministry but when we were doing it, it was 
<br/>freebees  but  when  this  Government  is  doing  it,  it  is  saying  it  is  empowerment.  Why  the  double 
<br/>standard?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, a lot of things had been said in this august Parliament, even last 
<br/>year, but we do not hear it anymore.  As Opposition in the last eight years, they had been asking the

<div><span>Government to do this and do that, but now when they are in Government, they are doing exactly the 
<br/>opposite.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind the Government of what we are all waiting for: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  answers  from  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  whether  he  is  a 
<br/>Director.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>When is the Chairperson of Fiji Sports Council going to be investigated? 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>The report on Walesi investigation from the Deputy Prime Minister.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>The announcement of one new project that the Coalition Government has funded or is going 
<br/>to fund. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>What the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs is doing.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Waiting on the Rarawai Mill and now on the ethanol production. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Singaporeans who are coming to Fiji and the Minister for Sugar was supposed to announce 
<br/>the good news very soon. We are still waiting for the good news, honourable Minister! 
<br/>Hear the total tonnes of sugarcane produced from the honourable Minister for Sugar based 
<br/>on  what  he  claimed  for  year  2023.  It  was  surprising  that  His  Excellency  the  President 
<br/></span><span>compared production of 2024 season to 2022 season. What happened to the statistics of 
<br/></span><span>2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>When the Ministers are going to step down, especially those who are being investigated by 
<br/>Police and FICAC. Please, take the que from our former FijiFirst Minister, Dr. Mahendra 
<br/>Reddy, when he was charged and he did the honorable thing, he stepped down from his 
<br/>ministerial portfolio and  once  his name  was cleared by Court,  he  got  re-appointed  as  a 
<br/>Minister.  But look at these Ministers, they should be ashamed. 
<br/>Still waiting for the Municipal Elections. 
<br/>Still waiting for Advisory Councillors’ Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, let us see some things that Fijians are waiting for: 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugarcane farmers are waiting for the $5 they were promised if the produce more sugar 
<br/>cane compared to 2022.  
<br/>People are still waiting for the roads to fixed all around Fiji.  
<br/>Villagers are waiting for sealing of their roads. Schools are waiting for the roads in front of 
<br/>the school to be sealed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Maritime areas are waiting for boat fares to go down. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>People are waiting for the normal water supply.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>People are still waiting to be connected to EFL grid. 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Patients are waiting for surgeries.  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Parents are waiting when the levy imposed on them by school would be removed.

<br/></span><span>People are still waiting for the land development to build their house.  
<br/>Those areas that had been developed by FijiFirst, people are waiting for their lease and title. 
<br/>Teachers are waiting when the regularisation is going to stop, and proper process will be 
<br/>followed.  
<br/>Nurses are waiting for their working conditions to be improved along with their pay.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Fiji Airways is waiting for the payment that was supposed to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>paid to them for the Israel trip. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All we can expect from this Coalition Government is to sit and wait. Unfortunately, this is the 
<br/>change people voted for, Madam Deputy Speaker.  Now, having realised the change people have 
<br/>voted for, the whole of Fiji is waiting for the 2026 General Election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and let us continue to wait. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, viewers who are watching the live broadcast through television 
<br/>from the comfort of their homes; </span><span>cola vina </span><span>and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I proceed, Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to offer my condolences to the family 
<br/>and the </span><span>Vanua o Yasawa</span><span> for the passing of the </span><span>Turaga Na Tui Yasawa</span><span>, </span><span>i Taukei Vatanitawake</span><span>, the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  take  this  opportunity  as  well  to  congratulate  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Speaker and staff for the refurbishment  of this august Parliament.   I also  take this opportunity  to 
<br/>congratulate the Fiji Drua Team for their home game win against the Crusaders last Saturday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  delighted  to  address  Parliament  today  in  support  of  the  Speech  delivered  by  our 
<br/>President, His Excellency, Ratu Williame Maivalili Katonivere.  His Excellency the President left us 
<br/>with  lasting  motivation  and  promoted  clearly  the  patriotism  to  which  we  all  aspire  as  Fijians.    It 
<br/>provided our citizens with the assurance that Government has done, is doing and will continue to do 
<br/>its best for our citizens, creating solid foundations for the best future for our youth and our future 
<br/>generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It reminded us of our progress and achievements, as well as what we will still have to do.  It 
<br/></span><span>boosts our morale while acknowledging we can always do better.  It affirms our capability to reach 
<br/></span><span>into a bright future, despite our divided pasts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency’s  Speech  provided  every  Fijian  with  the  belief  that  we  can  match  bigger 
<br/>nations and economies through development and prosperity.  For that, we thank His Excellency the 
<br/>President, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, for his excellent and timely reminder.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I stand before you today as the Minister for Youth and Sports to 
<br/>address  this  esteemed  Parliamentary  Session  in  2024.    It  is  an  honour  to  have  the  opportunity  to 
<br/></span><span>discuss the important role that youth and sports play in our society, and the initiatives that we are 
<br/></span><span>undertaking to support and empower our young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while we are proud to report on some of the recent achievements of 
<br/>the Ministry, including the empowerment of young street dwellers through targeted programmes and 
<br/>initiatives, we feel that we still have a lot more to do collectively as a nation to address this issue.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his own words, His excellency shared, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I spent  several  happy years of my  youth  in  Macuata with  Indo-Fijian farming 
<br/>families  during  sugarcane  harvesting  season.    Our  integrated  community  in  Macuata 
<br/>taught  me  many  important  lessons  in  life,  which  include  hard  work,  respect  for  our 
<br/>elders, family unity and respect for other ethnic communities.  The two major ethnic 
<br/>communities in Fiji have always lived in harmony together.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Madam Deputy Speaker, that was a true story of the life of a normal young person living in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>an integrated rural community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the recent visitation of street kids related to drugs and other illegal 
<br/>activities revealed the stories of young people mostly from broken families and the neglected.  The 
<br/>Ministry is trying its utmost to address the needs of the vulnerable youth in our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  your  Coalition  Government  would  continue  to  provide  immediate  support  and 
<br/>opportunities for these marginalised youth, we are calling on every parent to value their families.  It 
<br/>is the cornerstone of human society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is seriously considering the establishment of Rehabilitation Centres around the 
<br/>country to address the current and future impacts of the high usage of drugs in our communities.  I 
<br/>take  this  opportunity  to  thank  all  those  who  have  been  involved  at  the  very  grassroot,  to  address 
<br/>issues of street kids, drugs, HIV/AIDS, violence against women and children, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry organised the first-ever Youth Career Fair across all 
<br/>the  four  Divisions  which  received  an  overwhelming  response  from  young  individuals  eager  to 
<br/>explore various career and entrepreneurial opportunities. The Youth Career Fair provided a platform 
<br/>of interaction with professionals, workshops on essential skills and networking opportunities, leading 
<br/>to  direct  recruitment  and job  offers  for many  attendees.    I  wish to  remind my  friend, honourable 
<br/>Koroilavesau, that there is, indeed, a lot of demand for employment here in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Youth and Sports has discovered a critical strategy 
<br/>for the re-establishment of the National Youth Services Scheme founded in 1993 to help address the 
<br/>unemployment rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accordingly,  recent  studies  show  that  lack  of  economic  opportunities  has  led  to  extreme 
<br/></span><span>poverty within communities, leading young people to loiter around urban centres, live on the streets 
<br/></span><span>and  engage  in  illegal  activities.  Therefore,  the  re-establishment  of  the  National  Youth  Service 
<br/>Scheme  will  not  only  help  the  current  youth  challenges  for  the  Government  but  will  also  hold 
<br/>significant implications in aligning with our commitments to the Sustainable Development Goals set 
<br/>by the United Nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  have  five  Youth  Training  Centres  around  Fiji  that  offers 
<br/>transformative opportunities for young individuals seeking a second chance at education and personal 
<br/>development.    By  focusing  on  basic  agriculture,  carpentry,  organic  agriculture  and  music,  these 
<br/></span><span>Centres aim to provide free training on a diverse range of vocational skills tailored to the interests 
<br/></span><span>and needs of the youth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from our community programmes, last year, 190 trainees graduated from our training 
<br/>centres.  About 60 percent of these graduates have managed to find employment while others entered 
<br/>tertiary institutions for further education or utilised knowledge gained to engage in farming in their 
<br/>respective communities.  This year, 281 trainees have enrolled at our Youth Training Centres and we 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>147 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are optimistic that these young people will complete their courses this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Late last year, the Ministry received a generous donation of musical instruments from the 
<br/>Embassy of China to Fiji, benefitting the Youth Training Centre in Valelevu, Nasinu. This donation 
<br/>will provide students with the necessary tools to excel in their musical journey and foster personal 
<br/>growth and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the reinstatement of the National Youth Council of Fiji after a lapse 
<br/>of eight years and the launch of the Fiji National Youth Policy and Online Registration Dashboard, 
<br/>marked significant milestones for Fijian youth. These initiatives provide guidance and support for 
<br/>youth development, empowerment and engagement in various sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reinstated National Youth Council of Fiji serves as a vital platform for amplifying youth 
<br/>voices  and  channelling  their  concerns  to  the  Ministry.    Its  purpose  is  to  represent  the  diverse 
<br/>perspectives  and  interests  of  our  young  Fijians,  facilitating  dialogue,  advocacy  and  policy 
<br/>formulation that directly address their needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  providing  a  structured  avenue  for  youth  engagement,  the  Council  fosters  inclusivity, 
<br/>empowerment and active citizenship among the younger generation.  Its impact lies in fostering a 
<br/>more responsive and youth-centric approach to governance, leading to policies and initiatives that 
<br/>better reflect the aspirations and priorities of Fiji’s youth population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Indeed, the reinstated National Youth Council of Fiji effectively complements the Ministry’s 
<br/>efforts  in  youth  and  sports  development.    Through  partnership  and  synergy,  both  entities  work 
<br/>towards holistic youth empowerment, fostering a generation of active, engaged citizens contributing 
<br/>positively to society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Youth Entrepreneurship, Madam Deputy Speaker, a country has no greater asset for its 
<br/>future than its youth. The Ministry of Youth and Sports has put a priority on encouraging formation 
<br/>of  cooperatives  and  strengthened  entrepreneurship  through  the  youth  grant,  which  is  truly  an 
<br/>investment in our young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this initiative reflects a broader strategy to harness the energy and 
<br/>creativity  of  the  youth  demographic,  channelling  it  into  productive  and  sustainable  ventures.    By 
<br/>providing  financial  support  and  resources,  the  Ministry  not  only  encourages  entrepreneurship  but 
<br/>also cultivates a culture of innovation and resilience among young people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  on  climate  change,  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  enhancing  our 
<br/>disaster management capabilities to better respond to the challenges posed by climate change.  This 
<br/>includes investing in infrastructure, resources and training to ensure that we are well-prepared for 
<br/>any eventualities. For that, Certificate 1 in Resilience on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster 
<br/>Risk Reduction is also part of the programmes offered at one of our Youth Training Centres, with 
<br/>the intention of rolling this out to the other four Training Centres and even to communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on sports development, in addition to supporting our youth, we must 
<br/></span><span>also recognise the importance of sports in promoting health, unity and excellence.  Sports have the 
<br/></span><span>power to  bring people together, regardless  of their background or differences,  and teach valuable 
<br/>lessons in teamwork, discipline and perseverance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports make up 72 percent of the Ministry’s current budget which include the Government 
<br/>Grants that the Fiji National Sports Commission administer and so far, we have utilised more than 
<br/>70 percent of the $14.1 million allocated for sports.

<div><span>Here  are  some  of  the  highlights  of  our  sports  achievements  that  were  supported  by

<div><span>Fiji Water Flying Fijians set Rugby World Cup 2023 alight on 18</span><span>th</span><span> September as they blew 
<br/>Pool C wide open with a 22-15 win over Australia - their first ever win over the Wallabies 
<br/>since 1954.  Unfortunately, the Team lost the third Quarterfinal to Great Britain with 24-
<br/>30. 
<br/>Fiji attained sixth place in the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara, having amassed 21 gold, 30 
<br/>silver and 40 bronze medals.   
<br/>The Fiji Women’s Deaf Rugby 7s team created history early this year in winning a gold 
<br/>medal for the first time in the Australian Deaf Games.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the first  time, Madam  Deputy  Speaker, our  Ministry, through the Fiji  National  Sports 
<br/>Commission, successfully organised the Community Sports Competition last year that was funded 
<br/>by  the  Fijian  Government.  Minor  sports  like  weightlifting  continue  to  make  their  mark  in  the 
<br/>international arena.  Both amateur and professional boxing are showing greater improvements with 
<br/>new sports administrators.  Fiji will be sending a small delegation to the Paris Olympics 2024 Games 
<br/></span><span>from 26</span><span>th</span><span> July to 11</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2024. The Men’s Rugby 7s team is the current gold medal winner, 
<br/></span><span>while the Women’s team hold bronze. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In other highlights, Madam Deputy Speaker at the reopening of the Aquatic Centre and the 
<br/>National Hockey Turf in Suva on 12</span><span>th</span><span> January this year, the honourable Prime Minister said, and I 
<br/>quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“This facility serves as beacon of global sporting excellence, attracting international 
<br/>events  and  championships,  thereby  positioning  Fiji  as  a  prominent  global  sporting 
<br/>destination.  Consequently,  these  endeavours  significantly  contribute  to  our  economic 
<br/>growth, invigorating our tourism, hospitality, and employment sectors.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Both refurbishments were funded by the Chinese Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, through the Fiji Sports Council, successfully installed the newly refurbished 
<br/>track  at  the  HFC  Stadium  which  is  a  testament  to  the  Government’s  commitment  to  investing  in 
<br/>sports in the country and a healthy lifestyle for all our citizens.  These tracks will provide our athletes 
<br/>with world-class facilities to train and compete, and will, undoubtedly, attract top talents from all 
<br/></span><span>around the country.  Meanwhile, the entire refurbishing process  of the tracks at  the Stadium  cost 
<br/></span><span>around $1.9 million that was initially allocated in the current National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fresh off their pe-season trial in Lautoka a fortnight ago, the Melbourne Storms are set to 
<br/>begin talks with prospective rivals about making Fiji the fourth nation to host a competition match 
<br/>after Australia, New Zealand and USA.  Fiji would become the next country to host a competitive 
<br/>NRL game, with Melbourne Storms keen to play a regular season match in Suva from as early as 
<br/>next year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, an achievement for the Ministry is the passing of Fiji’s National Anti-Doping 
<br/>Policy  and  the  National  Sports,  Recreation  and  Physical  Activity  Policy  to  promote  sports 
<br/>development, physical activity, and healthy lifestyle among all citizens. These policies aim to make 
<br/>Fiji a sporting hub of the Pacific and promote sports tourism opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major undertaking is the establishment of an anti-doping organisation in Fiji to the entire 
<br/></span><span>sports systems to have clean sports advocating, promoting, and coordinating the fight against doping

<div><span>in  sports  in  all  its  forms  to  ensure  doping-free  sport  is  valued.  Your  Coalition  Government  had 
<br/>allocated $386,700 in our current National Budget towards the establishment of our own National 
<br/>Anti-Doping Organization (NADO) secretariat. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sports and the thousands of workers heading overseas, Madam Deputy Speaker, to work are 
<br/>pushing remittance to be another strong sector of our economy. Inward remittances increased to $1.3 
<br/>billion last year which was a new high and doubled the inflow of 2019. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as the Minister for Youth and Sports, I am committed to promoting 
<br/>youth development and fostering a culture of sports excellence in our country. We are working to 
<br/>expand access to sports facilities, enhance sports training programmes and support talented young 
<br/>athletes as they strive for success  on the national and international  stage.    </span><span>I call upon stakeholders, 
<br/>Government, private sector, civil society and individuals to join hands in supporting our youth and promoting 
<br/>a culture of sports participation and excellence.  Together, we can build a brighter future for our nation and 
<br/>empower our young people to reach their full potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Youth and Sports remains committed to creating a 
<br/>nurturing  environment  for  our  youth,  where  their  talents  are  recognised  and  their  aspirations  are 
<br/></span><span>supported by investing in their potential.  We are building a stronger, more prosperous nation for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to respond to honourable Ketan Lal’s allegation yesterday, 
<br/>but I will not stoop low to his level of debate.  My simple message is that please, you are in  this 
<br/>Parliament, grow up and get your facts right. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  you  again  for  this  opportunity  to  outline  the  Ministry’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commitment to delivering to the youths and sports communities in our beloved country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this brings to a close today’s proceedings and 
<br/>I thank you very much for all your contributions.  Thank you for making it lively, yes, we have gone 
<br/>over time.  I may be enforcing stronger tomorrow morning when I start presiding, but I thank you for 
<br/>your contributions.  You will be happy to know that afternoon tea is being served.  However, do not 
<br/>expect dinner, enjoy your dinner at your own homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I now adjourn Parliament until tomorrow morning at 9.30.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.12 p.m.
