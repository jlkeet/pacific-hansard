<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank each and everyone of you for the contributions you have made yesterday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting once more and for all those joining us 
<br/>in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet, thank you for taking 
<br/>an interest in the proceedings of your Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week we will continue to hear the responses to His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/>to Parliament, which was delivered on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  Honourable Members, before we 
<br/></span><span>proceed further, just a reminder to each and everyone of you that as I had stated a while ago, you are 
<br/></span><span>offering your responses to His Excellency’s Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Expunged Words from Daily Hansard 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I heard from two speeches delivered yesterday, one from the Government side and the other 
<br/>from Opposition, saying that it was their right of reply.  Honourable Members, just to be reminded 
<br/>once again that the right of reply will only be given or provided for the mover of a motion. In this 
<br/>particular instance, the mover of the motion is the honourable Prime Minister. He will be offered the 
<br/></span><span>right of reply at the end of your responses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that is very clear and I will make an instruction here that those who stated that it was 
<br/>their right of reply, those words will be expunged from the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. I hope we will agree so 
<br/>we keep with consistency at the same pace. If people are still worried about who made those words, 
<br/>one was made by honourable Esrom Immanuel in his response and also honourable Sanjay Kirpal.
