<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, the Quality Assurance and Assessment Systems.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, on this one, the 
<br/>previous government  removed scaling, effectively  making our children severely  disadvantaged in 
<br/>comparison to other children globally.  The Ministry of Education is effectively working to reverse 
<br/>the decision with the re-introduction of scaling of examinations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You have destroyed the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The third area is enhancing the Teaching Profession and Leadership.  
<br/>Our Ministry intends to strengthen an inspired, empowered and productive teaching workforce.  Our 
<br/>Coalition Government with the intention to motivate and retain staff in the civil service, through the 
<br/>Ministry of Civil Service Circular 2/2024 and Circular 5/2024 mandated all Government Ministries 
<br/>that the retention measures through regularisation of acting appointments, allowing step movements, 
<br/>filling of re-evaluated positions and utilising of alternate pool be effected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Ministry’s regularisation processes began and successfully concluded the exercise.  We 
<br/>have currently confirmed that 1,420 out of the 1,958 officers that have been on acting positions both 
<br/>in the teaching and non-teaching administrative posts.  Some of these officers have been acting for 
<br/>two years up to 20 years from the Vice Principal and below.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much to fix, that is the problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I will share an experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Last week during a seminar at Pacific Harbour, a few women leaders 
<br/>walked  up  to  my  Permanent  Secretary  and  conveyed  their  acknowledgement  to  the  Ministry  and 
<br/></span><span>stated this is what they said to us: “We were about to resign and leave for overseas, but because of 
<br/></span><span>the regularisation process, we stayed back.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were several other messages received by our staff on the same issue.  The Ministry will 
<br/>re-introduce Teacher Competency  Framework  and discussions have begun with  our stakeholders.  
<br/>Teacher qualifications of Secondary Teacher Training Certificate (STTC) and International Diploma 
<br/>in  Tertiary  Teaching  (IDTT)  are  now  regularised  as  of  7</span><span>th</span><span>  February,  2024.    The  arbitrary  non-

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognition of the STTC and IDTT by the previous government in 2021 severely disadvantaged our 
<br/>teachers in many ways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  committed  to  strengthening  Early  Childhood 
<br/>Education  (ECE)  and  Inclusive  Education  to  ensure  that  every  young  child  sent  to  ECE  or 
<br/>kindergarten has access to an equitable, safe and healthy learning environment.  We have planned 
<br/>and are beginning to roll out a restructure that will have dedicated Senior Officers position at the 
<br/>Director level for Special Inclusive Education (SIE) and ECE.  Additionally, in the recent Coalition 
<br/>Government’s decision in 2024 on the roll out of regularisation and step up, this enabled our Ministry 
<br/>to step up the salary of 739 ECE teachers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  Education,  Financing  and  Effective  Governance  is  another 
<br/>priority  area  which  includes  the  review  and  development  of  policies,  regulations  and  resource 
<br/>allocation while  working collaboratively with  all  internal  and external  stakeholders  including  our 
<br/>education partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fifthly,  is  the  Technical  Vocational  Education  and  Training  (TVET),  Non-formal  and 
<br/>Lifelong Learning.  Resurrecting the Unit is crucial as we need to meet the shortage in skills in the 
<br/>current labour market including Tourism.  The Ministry is working closely with the Higher Education 
<br/>Institutes to offer relevant TVET courses while we try to resolve the legal matters pertaining to the 
<br/>failed technical colleges under the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, 32 vocational centres were operational, for 2024 we have scoped and will re-open 
<br/>13 more vocational centres.  It is our intention that every province will have a vocational centre.  The 
<br/>Bose  Levu  Vakaturaga  stressed  the  importance  of  having  skilled  young  people;  skills-set  that  is 
<br/>contextualised according to their community needs. For example, in the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial 
<br/>School  that  was  converted  to  a  technical  college  but  has  been  idle  with  state  of  art  vocational 
<br/>equipment will re-open soon as we work with the Nadroga/Navosa Provincial Council on this issue.  
<br/>We will offer vocational subjects focused on hospitality, carpentry and joinery and even automotive 
<br/>engineering offering viable alternatives for employment and entrepreneurship for our people on the 
<br/>Coral Coast.  Scoping has also begun for Lomawai Secondary School, this is an example of what is 
<br/>happening in one province.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  under  the  New  Scholarship  and  Grants  Scheme,  1,800  grant  awards  has  been 
<br/>allocated for micro-qualification in construction, automotive and tourism and 400 grant awards for 
<br/>apprenticeship incentive scheme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  also  prioritising  Digital  Learning  and  Transformation, 
<br/>Information Technology and cyber safety.  Internet connectivity and accessibility to digital resources 
<br/>is  important  for  all  the  children  in  Fiji.    The  Ministry  will  need  the  support  of  communication 
<br/>providers and relevant stakeholders for connectivity and digitalisation of our remote and maritime 
<br/>scopes.  The initiative by the Coalition Government and partnership with Starlink will see the pilot 
<br/>of  Starlink  in  15  schools  for  2024.    Development  of  content  for  the  digital  platform  needs  the 
<br/>partnership of genuine education partners to ensure that all schools access e-learning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The final seventh thematic area is strengthening of the Education Policy, Planning, Research 
<br/></span><span>and Data. Evidence-based research and data is needed for the Ministry to make informed decisions 
<br/>in consultation with the policies and legislations in place.  This essential unit was also dismantled in 
<br/>the  last  15  years,  so  there  was  a  lack  of  planning  and  directions  for  the  biggest  Ministry  in 
<br/>government.  The absence of the unit impacted planning, monitoring and evaluation of educational 
<br/>activities.  Just this past weekend, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry had our First Senior Management 
<br/>Staff Planning Workshop to finalise our Costed Operational Plans (COP) for the fiscal year, and Staff

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>41 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we had not done since 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Lying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Denarau Declaration which governed the new 
<br/>direction for the Education Ministry will only be fully implemented when the Education Act, relevant 
<br/>laws, policies and programmes are reviewed.  The Minister for Education has already started working 
<br/>in  consultation  with  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General.    I  have  asked  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General to delve into this in his address later this week. Collaboration with the Office of the Attorney-
<br/>General is critical.  The legislation must be current, applicable and futuristic.  If we are to be relevant 
<br/>in the evolving global education landscape incognisance   of the Industrial Revolution 4.0.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reassure this august Parliament that a talented and very competent team at 
<br/>the Ministry of Education ably led by the Permanent Secretary with the passion for education have 
<br/>been working diligently to ensure the old newly developed policies adhere to the required processes 
<br/>and procedures.  An example is the appointment of the new Education Commission and part of their 
<br/>task is to renew the current National Curriculum Framework (NCF). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rome was not built in a day, so it is crucial for the Ministry to get the right 
<br/>bricks, to lay the foundation of the Denarau Declaration framework for the future of the education 
<br/>system for our beloved Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share a significant impact of tourism and civil aviation 
<br/>on Fiji’s economy. Fiji’s economic growth continues on the back of a strong tourism sector, the key 
<br/>driver.    In  2023,  Fiji’s  pandemic  economic  recovery  was  marked  by  an  estimated  growth  of  8.2 
<br/>percent.  This growth is expected to continue, bringing our economy above 2019 levels of GDP by 
<br/>the end of 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last year, we broke records and welcomed 929,740 visitors up by 46.1 percent compared to 
<br/>2022 and by 4 percent compared to pre-pandemic arrivals in 2019.  Markets such as Australia, New 
<br/>Zealand, United States of America and Canada have exceeded past years. Tourism earnings reached 
<br/>$1.7 billion cumulatively in September 2023 surpassing the corresponding 2019 level by 9.5 percent. 
<br/>In  January  2024,  visitor  arrivals  exceeded  previous  records  for  the  same  month  with  a  record  of 
<br/>70,324  visitors.    As  shared  by  His  Excellency,  for  the  first  time  in  Fijian  history,  we  expect  to 
<br/></span><span>welcome one million visitors in 2024; that would be a first for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our connectivity with the rest of the world is not only being restored but 
<br/>also enhanced through our national airline.  The 2024 capacity outlook is expected to grow between 
<br/>8 percent and 10 percent compared to 2023.  Fiji Airways has also considerably invested in its fleet, 
<br/>with the addition of two new A350 aircrafts in 2023. Fiji Airways newest destination is the Nadi to 
<br/>Noumea route with two weekly services.  Fiji Airways currently operates in 24 destinations including 
<br/>10 regional and 14 international destinations with discussions underway to expand more routes. The 
<br/>focus now is to increase code sharing through marketing arrangements with other airlines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry is undertaking initial discussions for a Civil Aviation Master 
<br/>Plan for Fiji, intended to be rolled out this calendar year.  This could be the first Civil Aviation Master 
<br/>Plan established for Fiji.  Additionally, Fiji has an Aviation Policy which is outdated and will now 
<br/>be reviewed in line with imminent changes in the aviation industry.  To meet the International Civil 
<br/>Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  resolution  relating  environmental  protection,  we  are  working  in 
<br/>collaboration with Fiji Airways, Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji, Fiji Airports Limited on reviewing 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s State Action Plan on Carbon Dioxide Emissions. This State Action Plan to ICAO elaborates 
<br/>on  the  activities  Fiji  is  undertaking  to  address  CO2  emissions  from  international  aviation  and  to 
<br/>enable ICAO to measure Fiji’s progress towards meeting the global goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our advocacy for sustainable aviation practices was underscored by my chairmanship of the 
<br/>Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels in Dubai, culminating in a landmark commitment to 
<br/>reduce carbon emissions in international aviation by 5 percent by 2030 towards net zero by 2050.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s efforts to reaffirm the acceptance of Fiji’s bid to host the office of the ICAO  for the 
<br/>Pacific Small Island Developing States and the subsequent signing of the host State Agreement in 
<br/>May 2023 will solidify our role in regional aviation governance. The office will be established in 
<br/>Nadi with ICAO Pacific Island Small Island Developing States officer taking up residence in Nadi 
<br/>in October 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of tourism investments leads, we are looking at 42 projects valued 
<br/>at $3 billion. This will bring in 4,824 rooms.  There are about 1,627 rooms in the construction stage 
<br/>and a few hundred within the next few years.  There are nine tourism project developments planned 
<br/>for 2024, three in 2025 and four in 2026. We are working with big brands such as One &amp; Only Resorts 
<br/>and seeing local investors such as Punja’s Group, expand into the sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the medium-term growth outlook is expected to return to the pre-pandemic 
<br/>trend and average around 3 percent. The loss of labour could negatively impact productivity, while 
<br/>constraints in hotel capacity and high prices could weigh in the growth of tourism in the near future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  shared  by  his  Excellency  and  the  honourable  Assistant  Minster  for 
<br/>Foreign  Affairs  and  Civil  Aviation,  we  will  soon  be  launching  the  National  Sustainable  Tourism 
<br/>Framework (NSTF) 2024-2034.  The Framework lays out a clear policy direction, consisting of a 
<br/>high-level  framework  accompanied  by  an  initial  three-year  Action  Plan  (2024-2027).    One  of  its 
<br/>priorities is to create a competitive destination with diverse experiences. This includes actions such 
<br/>as prioritizing infrastructure and connectivity to less visited tourism regions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will also focus on expanding products and experience, training, mentoring support for 
<br/>start-ups, business development training, peer-to-peer mentoring and advisory services. Target niche 
<br/>and experiential growth segments such as luxury, health, wellness and medical tourism; Meetings, 
<br/>Incentives,  Conferences  and  Exhibitions  (MICE);  sports,  tourism,  educational  tourism,  film 
<br/>productions and experiential and immersive tourism. Essentially, our focus is not only on diversifying 
<br/></span><span>the economy but also on diversifying the tourism sector itself to be able to sustain ourselves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  new  brand  platform,  “Where  Happiness  Comes  Naturally”  and  the  associated  global 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>launch campaign have continued to resonate and perform strongly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s media placements continue to drive impact with our recent billboards in New York’s 
<br/>Times Square.  I am also pleased to share that Tourism Fiji’s social media following is now over one 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last year we have elevated the Fijian brand by hosting major events.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First Spartan Fiji - brought a total of 25 countries with over 3,370 attendees, contributing 
<br/>FJ$6 million to the economy and FJ$2.6 million in media value. 
<br/>First National Rugby League - sanctioned rugby league match delivered a $6.15 million 
<br/>boost to Fiji’s economy.  
<br/>The World Surf League Fiji Pro will return after three years.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>43 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  spirit  of  inclusive  dialogue,  last  year  we  hosted  the  Fiji  Tourism  Convention  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>envisaged this as an annual event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the tourism and civil aviation sectors play a pivotal role in Fiji’s economy. 
<br/>The Government is committed to fostering growth, enhancing connectivity and ensuring sustainable 
<br/>practices in these sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  President’s  Address  has  provided  us  with  a roadmap  for  building  a  more  prosperous, 
<br/>inclusive  and  sustainable  future  for  Fiji  and  its  people.    For  us  in  Education,  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation, we heed his call to action and work together across political divides and national boundaries 
<br/>to realise this vision for our nation and for the world.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, may the God Almighty bless 
<br/>our beloved nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for lunch. When 
<br/>we resume, the honourable Deputy Speaker will be presiding over the sitting. We adjourn for lunch.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 1.56 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, we will continue from where we left off.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and fellow honourable Members of Parliament, </span><span>ni sa bula sia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  an  honour  to  deliver  my  response  to  His  Excellency’s  most  gracious  Speech  in  the 
<br/>Opening of this Session of Parliament.  It was His Excellency’s last Address to Parliament as his first 
<br/>term in office would come to an end in October this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was, indeed, a privilege to have voted His Excellency in 2021 as the FijiFirst nominee for 
<br/>President.  His Excellency as Head of State, a figure above politics, in a very difficult position had 
<br/>to respect the democratic will of the people and be sworn by the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I totally agreed  with  His Excellency.  As democratically  elected 
<br/>representatives, we need to listen to the voices of our people and not only those who have voted us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, His Excellency made the same call in  opening  the 2023 Session 
<br/>where he stated that the views of all members of our communities must be heard and the Coalition 
<br/>Government must ensure that draft laws are deliberated in consultation with relevant stakeholders, 
<br/>particularly through the Standing Committee process. His Excellency used the mandatory ‘must’ and 
<br/>not ‘may’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  apart  from  the  Appropriation  Bill  tabled  in  July  2023  with  14 
<br/>Consequential  Bills,  the  Coalition  Government  in  2023  introduced  an  additional  15  Bills  in 
<br/>Parliament and only one Bill was referred to the Standing Committee for public consultation. This 
<br/>statistic shows that His Excellency’s reminder was not followed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when Bills are not referred to the Standing Committee, it means that 
<br/>we are denying the people’s rights to participate in the law-making process.  Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>if the honourable Prime Minister had not directed the honourable Attorney-General to withdraw the 
<br/>Heritage Bill 2023 which was moved under the Standing Order 51, the statistics would have shown 
<br/>that no Bills was ever referred to the Standing Committee in the last session of Parliament.   The 
<br/>honourable Speaker had acknowledged the swift moved by the honourable Prime Minister, given it 
<br/></span><span>would facilitate bipartisanship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency in Opening the Parliament Session last year outlined 
<br/>that the principled iTaukei statutes will be reviewed. This was to include the iTaukei Affairs Act, 
<br/>iTaukei Lands Act, iTaukei Land Trust Act, iTaukei Trust Fund Act and the iTaukei Development 
<br/>Fund Act. From the five mentioned Acts, only the iTaukei Land Trust Act and the iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>Act made it to Parliament and the rest did not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other 25 </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> related laws that was a core message of the Coalition Government when 
<br/></span><span>they were in Opposition are still nowhere to be seen. The iTaukei Affairs Bill came through Standing 
<br/></span><span>Order 51 in November 2023 with a new amendment that removed the GCC’s veto to appoint five of 
<br/>the eight iTaukei Trust Fund Board members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the last Parliamentary session, the Coalition Government did not 
<br/>introduce any new Bill to establish a new industry or create a new area to enable investment.  For 
<br/>example, the FijiFirst Government in 2021-2022 introduced new Bills such as the Bill for an Act to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>45 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide for the development of informal settlements in Fiji and other related matters; the Investment 
<br/>Bill; Climate Change Bill; the Fiji Institute of Chartered Accountants Bill; and the Industrial Hemp 
<br/>Bill, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, the FijiFirst Government initiated the drafting of the Childcare and Protection Bill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and the Child Justice Bill which is now undergoing executive consultations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Traditional Knowledge and Cultural Expression Bill which is 
<br/>currently going through executive consultation will complement the Heritage Bill 2023 which is still 
<br/>before the Committee and was initiated by the FijiFirst Government in 2017.  The Committee has 
<br/>had roundtable discussions with the consultation team led by the Permanent Secretary for iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs and its consultant, Mr. Tuiloma, so that both Bills can be improved specifically to identify 
<br/>any overlaps and gaps. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, repeated calls have been made by the people that Bills be translated 
<br/>into the vernacular and disseminated widely through CSOs, Provincial Offices, District Advisories 
<br/>for them to understand and prepare a submission before the Standing Committee comes around to 
<br/>conduct  its  public  consultation.    Translation  of  the  Bills  should  be  prioritised  by  the  Solicitor-
<br/>General’s Office and the line Ministries will administer the Bill in collaboration with the Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs and Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs before the Bill passages to Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I humbly request the honourable Attorney-General to strengthen the 
<br/>work relationship between the Office of the Solicitor-General’s drafting department and the Standing 
<br/>Committee.  This has been a challenging area, given the Standing Committee’s communication to 
<br/>the Solicitor-General’s Office are not actioned on time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  when  a  Bill  is  moved  in  Parliament,  like  in  other  jurisdiction,  the  Terms  of 
<br/>Reference (TOR) and the full report of the executive consultation is referred to the Committee.  This 
<br/>makes  it  easier  for  the  Committee  to  do  its  oversight.    This  was  the  practice  during  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, and it provided a clear guideline to assist the Committee in formulating its workplan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  when  a  Standing  Committee  scrutinises  a  Bill,  it  will  need  the 
<br/>cooperation of the drafters and consultants so that it reports back to Parliament in a comprehensive 
<br/>form  of  a  Bill  while it maintains  its  original  intent  per  the  TOR.    This  process  is  very  important 
<br/>because it prevents any law from being subject to amendments time and again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  there  is  also  a  need  for  a  parliamentary  drafter  to  be  based  in 
<br/></span><span>Parliament,  not  only  to  assist  Standing  Committees  on  Bills,  but  also  to  assist  in  drafting  private 
<br/>Members’ Bills, as provided by the Standing Orders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  FijiFirst  Government,  in  a  session  of  Parliament,  passes  an 
<br/>average  of  40  to  50  Bills.    The  Coalition  Government,  as  I  have  mentioned  earlier,  have  not 
<br/>introduced a new Bill so far but only repeals and make amendments to existing laws.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its first year in office, the Coalition Government only brought in 15 Bills, apart from the 
<br/></span><span>Budget Bills and all the other 15 Bills that were originally part of the FijiFirst legislative programme.  
<br/></span><span>In this Parliamentary session, the Coalition Government, as outlined by His Excellency’s Speech, 
<br/>intends to review only 11 existing legislations, including the Traditional Knowledge and Cultural 
<br/>Expression Bill and the other Bill that was alluded to by the honourable Prime Minister this morning 
<br/>- the Banaban Settlement Act that will also be reviewed, so there would be a total of 12 legislations 
<br/>to be reviewed.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition stands ready to assist the Coalition Government to 
<br/>identify  laws  that  need  improvement,  given  the  arising  needs,  and  share  ideas  so  that  new  Bills 
<br/>enabling the expansion of our economy can be enacted and through it, allowing every Fijian to fulfil 
<br/>their dreams and aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency shared his experience as a youth in Macuata, spent 
<br/>with Indo-Fijian families during sugarcane harvesting season.  The honourable Speaker would be 
<br/>very familiar with this experience having served at the then Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) in the 
<br/>Western and Northern Divisions.  Most of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> in the Western and Northern Divisions speak 
<br/>fluent </span><span>Hindi </span><span>and even the Indo-Fijian community do speak the local dialect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our two major ethnic communities in Fiji have always lived together 
<br/>in harmony.  As national leaders, we must set the tone so that many of our political followers can 
<br/>spread the same message.  Unfortunately, most of us sitting on this side of Parliament and also our 
<br/>supporters  face  direct  and  racial  discriminatory  attacks  online  -  keyboard  warriors  constantly 
<br/>labelling FijiFirst as an Indo-Fijian Party or anti-iTaukei.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the reformers post-2006 </span><span>coup</span><span> reviewed the iTaukei institution under 
<br/>the process of the People’s Charter so that the iTaukei Affairs Board, iTaukei Land Trust Board and 
<br/>the iTaukei  Trust  Fund Board play the role of the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) in formulating 
<br/>policies that were for the good governance of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people. Many saw these changes, not done 
<br/>with the prior and informed consent of the indigenous community as anti-</span><span>iTaukei.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  fact,  if  FijiFirst  was  anti-</span><span>iTaukei</span><span>,  then  the  time  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government came into power in December 2022, all the investments of the iTaukei Trust Fund would 
<br/>not be there anymore.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government expanded the iTaukei Trust Fund investment portfolio, and many 
<br/>benefitted in terms of leadership training at Nadave, indigenous studies, publication of traditional 
<br/>writings, et cetera. This has enabled the iTaukei Trust Fund to explore heritage tourism, partnering 
<br/>with  UNDP  under  the  Business  Ready  Support  Scheme  and  most  importantly,  funds  that  were 
<br/>invested by FijiFirst for the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> people has now been used to host the GCC meetings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, FijiFirst in 2015, rolled out the iTaukei Land Development Grant.  
<br/>In 2017, it established the Seed Fund for iTaukei landowners to provide an opportunity for them to 
<br/>participate in any income generating projects of their choice. Now, the Coalition Government has 
<br/></span><span>established a Wealth Fund from the10 percent of iTLTB’s annual earnings to allow landowning units 
<br/></span><span>to buy properties and start business ventures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government introduced the equal lease distribution policy.  Now, the Coalition 
<br/>Government has reintroduced the percentage distribution of </span><span>Turaga iTaukei, Turaga ni Yavusa</span><span> and 
<br/></span><span>Turaga ni Mataqali</span><span>.  The landowning unit members still get their same share basis and the minor’s 
<br/>fund for children to withdraw at the age of 18 which was introduced by the FijiFirst Government is 
<br/>continued by the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, every time a Bill is introduced in Parliament to amend or repeal an 
<br/></span><span>Act  that  was  enacted  by  the  FijiFirst  Government,  the  Coalition  Members,  like  small  children 
<br/>celebrating a revenge, make sweeping statements such as, “this is due to the mismanagement of the 
<br/>previous Government or “these draconian laws by the previous Government” or “today is the day of 
<br/>freedom”, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, these types of statements has fuelled communal differences within 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>47 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our society.  Labelling FijiFirst as anti- </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and making us look like criminals does not assist in 
<br/>trying to establish walking across the aisle.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the incoming Chief Executive Officer of Fiji Revenue and Customs 
<br/>Service works in New Zealand and could be accorded an expatriate rate if he takes office.  On the 
<br/>one hand, honourable Ministers of the Coalition Government are encouraging top jobs to be given to 
<br/>locals but on the very opposite, other honourable Ministers are bringing in people from overseas. 
<br/>There needs to be consistency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  must  give  credit  where  the  Coalition  Government  has 
<br/>implemented  policies  that  are  for  the  betterment  of  all  Fijians,  something  that  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government had prioritised during its term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the last session of Parliament, the Coalition Government focused 
<br/>a lot on FijiFirst’s shortcomings during its term in Government and not the good developments done 
<br/>by FijiFirst that it can further improve and serve the people better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, no Government is perfect and for the last 14 months, the Coalition 
<br/>Government has made its own shares of mistakes and blunders.  Ministers are under investigation, 
<br/>like we see in today’s paper where the Attorney-General is under the spotlight. We heard about the 
<br/>chartered flight to Israel.  Many complaints we read online where Ministers are promising Boards 
<br/>and even intentions to replace the honourable Prime Minister by one of the Deputy Prime Ministers. 
<br/>The  SODELPA  General  Secretary  makes  a  press  conference  while  another  Party  member  goes 
<br/>against  it.  Some  have  gone  publicly  to  say  that  their  Party  is  unfair.  This  kind  of  party  politics 
<br/>prevents Government from serving the people better and slows progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the slow response in service delivery has been one of the people’s 
<br/>growing  concern.  Other  hot  issues  are  the  cost  of  living,  food  prices,  unemployment,  lack  of 
<br/>development, road problems, water and power breakdowns, poverty, drugs and crime rates, to name 
<br/>a few.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Coalition  Government  should  not  only  talk  about  the 
<br/>achievements  that  they  have  achieved  so  far  but  also  improve  on  what  they  can  do  better.    The 
<br/>Coalition Government needs to develop policies that will allow our various communities to integrate, 
<br/>and I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Rural, Maritime Development and Disaster 
<br/>Management  for  bringing  in  the  Financial  Literacy  model  from  China  and  also  the  one  that  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister talked about this morning, the model from India.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  encouraging  to  hear  that  our  domestic  economy  will  surely 
<br/>return to the pre-pandemic level.  It shows that the post-pandemic economic recovery plan initiated 
<br/>by FijiFirst Government in 2021 is bearing fruits. The Coalition Government needs to focus on new 
<br/>capital  development,  given  the  current  2023-2024  Budget  had  no  capital  expenditure  but  only 
<br/>continuing the projects under the FijiFirst Government.  Many have been commissioned and opened 
<br/>by the Coalition Government and what we want to see is that people have access to these facilities 
<br/>whether it is a road, a bridge, hospital or water projects.  Let us put people first. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, despite our debt which is around $9.9 billion due to the pandemic, 
<br/>what was more encouraging is that Fiji, in 2022, became one of the fastest growing economies in the 
<br/>world and this was due to the FijiFirst Government’s economy recovery plan. The Opposition stands 
<br/>ready to assist Government on ideas to grow the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Province of Macuata is so thankful that the relocation of the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people of Nabavatu in Dreketi to their new village site in Nadoiviri will commence this year.  The 
<br/>FijiFirst Government had begun the initial talks of securing the new village site and now the Coalition 
<br/>Government will complete the full relocation process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The relocation will be funded by $5.9 million from the Climate 
<br/>Change Relocation Trust  Fund. The FijiFirst  Government,  in  2018, had set  up this Trust  Fund to 
<br/>support the relocation in Fiji through the Climate Relocation of Communities Trust Fund Act 2019 
<br/>and the Climate Change Act 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji Airways plays a key role in the increase of tourist arrival to Fiji 
<br/>and today, we are reaping the rewards of the FijiFirst Government’s decisive leadership during the 
<br/>pandemic when it supported the loan guarantee for our national airlines, despite many Opposition 
<br/>Members objecting to it at that time. This is the type of issues where His Excellency has asked us to 
<br/>rise above petty politics and be patriotic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), the mechanics 
<br/>of it must be very clear as it will be dealing with many complex cases filled with high emotions.  The 
<br/>Civic  Education  Awareness  programme  that  was  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition in his speech this morning, is very vital.  The South African TRC model had a very simple 
<br/>set of procedures where victims would tell their stories of atrocities that they have not spoken about 
<br/>for years, then the perpetrators are given  a chance to  own up to  their crime and by doing  so, are 
<br/>eligible  for  amnesty.    All  they  must  do  is  to  tell  the  truth  and  do  not  even  need  to  say  sorry,  no 
<br/>apologies, no remorse, no justice and no prosecution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to move this through the Coalition Government with the assistance 
<br/>of its development partners need to bring forward a Bill like the South Africa’s Promotion of National 
<br/>Unity and Reconciliation Act 1995, to establish the TRC, its objectives, roles, functions and powers 
<br/>that  will  guide  the  process  and  at  the  same  time,  consider  the  interests  of  the  victims  and  the 
<br/>perpetrators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, many of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> landowners who have made their land available 
<br/>for sugarcane leases want an increase in CBUL rates.  That was an initiative of the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government  in  2008  and  the  review  of  the  land  rentals  which  still  sits  at  6  percent  of  UCV. 
<br/>Landowners in Macuata, honourable Minister for Sugar, are still waiting for the CBUL payment that 
<br/></span><span>was due in December 2023.  The last payment was made in June 2023 and the FijFirst Government 
<br/></span><span>used to pay it out in every six months basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. C.J. Singh interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- That is according to the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> members in Macuata.  You better 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do that.  If not, they will not vote for you again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it will be challenging for the GCC to be politically neutral, but it 
<br/>should  now  play  a  more  meaningful  role  in  making  recommendations  for  the  welfare,  economic 
<br/>empowerment and good governance of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>people.  It must conduct wider consultations to all 
<br/>Vola ni Kawa Bula (VKB) members and get their free and informed consent before deciding on any 
<br/>questions relating  to  the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  The Coalition Government  must ensure that the GCC does not 
<br/>threaten the State’s role as protector of public interest. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>49 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, people in the rural areas want speedy responses to their applications 
<br/>and requests in terms of Government programmes.  The Coalition Government must ensure that civil 
<br/>servants at divisional and district level as enablers to the implementation of these programmes are 
<br/>very efficient and effective. Decisions on applications should be assessed in a timely manner and 
<br/>communicated to applicants conveniently.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of our people in rural areas get frustrated due to poor services provided. We need to 
<br/>improve  these  areas  and  the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro</span><span>  and  Advisory  Councillors  to  be  used  to  make 
<br/>communities  aware  of  the  various  assistance  available  –  where  to  get  the  application  forms,  the 
<br/>progress of each application in various areas, et cetera. I urge the Coalition Government to pay out 
<br/>the  </span><span>Turaga  ni  Koro</span><span>,  </span><span>Nasi  ni  Koro</span><span>  and</span><span>  Mata  ni  Tikina</span><span>  allowance  on  time  as  they  have  been 
<br/>complaining recently on the delays. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we thank the Coalition Government for continuing the campaign on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the 30 Million Trees in 15 Years initiative that was started in 2019 by the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I agree that our Foreign Policy should maintain that we are friends to all and enemies to none, 
<br/>and it is important that we always promote peaceful solutions. This has been a subject of debate, 
<br/>criticism and emotions boarding on our religious beliefs in terms of Fiji’s stance in the International 
<br/>Court of Justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Israeli  and  Palestine  situation  can  only  be  resolved  through  a  two  State  solution  and 
<br/>premised in the Oslo Accord of 1993. While both need their self-determination as a Sovereign State, 
<br/>a  progressive  withdrawal  of  Israel  in  the  areas  occupied  by  the  Palestinians  should  be  based  on 
<br/>negotiations and mutual trust so that both States are protected and co-exist.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I totally agree with His Excellency that as Parliamentarians, we need 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to work across the aisle more often.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency rightly reminded us by saying, and I 
<br/>quote from His Address on Page 10 of the </span><span>Uncorrected Daily Hansard</span><span> on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Let us not see challenges as mountains but common missions to ascend and resolve 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with open and constructive dialogue, with a view to rebuild social cohesion.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To achieve that, we must move forward, and we cannot be stuck to the past.  The Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government has identified few areas that it will prioritise in this Parliamentary year, and it needs to 
<br/></span><span>focus on it and given that most of it are continuous programmes from the FijiFirst policies, then more 
<br/>sharing of ideas can happen across the floor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the new programmes and policies, the experience from both sides of Parliament can be 
<br/>harnessed to constructively put together ideas that will progress every Fijian.  I will end by the words 
<br/>of the late Nelson Mandela who said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made 
<br/></span><span>missteps along the way. But I have discovered that the secret after climbing a great hill, 
<br/></span><span>one only finds that there are many more hills to climb.  I have taken a moment here to 
<br/>rest, to steal the view that surrounds me, to look back at the distance I have come.  But I 
<br/>can only rest for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, 
<br/>for my long walk to freedom has not ended.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, what worries me a lot is the inabilities of leaders to understand that

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>no one person has the answers to everything. We must move away from the idea that only “me” can 
<br/>do it because it is not true.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the Coalition Government, it is only four years.  Run your leg well as FijiFirst has passed 
<br/>the baton to you after successfully running the last lap.   We are team Fiji, and you will pass the baton 
<br/>to the next team Fiji runner.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the Coalition Government, team Fiji can only win if we play as a team.  Team Fiji needs 
<br/>to establish a legacy for our future generations.  We are the custodians of their hopes and aspirations. 
<br/>It is our finest hour!    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. E.Y.  IMMANUEL.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker, honourable    Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>distinguished dignitaries, ladies and gentleman; a very good afternoon to you all.  I rise today with 
<br/>humility  and  gratitude  to  deliver  my  response  in  this  august  Parliament  to  the  esteemed  Address 
<br/>delivered  by  His  Excellency  the  President  in  my  capacity  as  the  Assistant  Minister  of  Finance, 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I extend my sincere appreciation to His Excellency the President for his insightful 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remarks and unwavering commitment to the prosperity and wellbeing of our beloved nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  echo  the  sentiments  expressed  regarding  the  importance  of 
<br/>inclusive governance and the need to listen to the voices of all our citizens.  Indeed, it is our solemn 
<br/>duty as elected representatives to uphold the principles of democracy and humanity enshrined in our 
<br/>Constitution, and to work tirelessly to ensure the integrity and dignity of our Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President’s  emphasis  on  promoting  harmony  and  embracing  diversity 
<br/>resonates deeply with me. Madam Deputy Speaker, it is incumbent upon us as leaders to foster an 
<br/>environment  of  mutual  respect  and  understanding,  transcending  our  differences  for  the  collective 
<br/>good of our people.  I wholeheartedly pledge to continue advocating for unity and inclusivity in all 
<br/>facets of our governance.  I will try to refrain from being adversarial, but I wish to make a comment 
<br/>in  reply  to  honourable  Ketan  Lal  and  honourable  Aliki  Bia’s  statements.    They  made  wayward 
<br/>statements and generalisations.  The Coalition Government has done so much to start fixing the mess 
<br/>with debts of the last 15 years.  We cannot do miracle in one year.  By attacking the Government, 
<br/>they are exposing their own hypocrisy and the failure of the FijiFirst  Government.   Fiji  has been 
<br/>saved with a change of government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend the Government’s progressive agenda outlined by His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency the President, particularly the ongoing formulation of the new NDP.  The NDP serves as 
<br/>a blueprint or a roadmap for our nation’s growth and development,  guiding  our collective efforts 
<br/>towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It is imperative that we prioritise inclusive 
<br/>and  sustainable  development  ensuring  that  no  one  is  left  behind  as  we  strive  towards  a  more 
<br/>prosperous and sustainable future.  As we embark on the task of formulating a new 3-year, 5-year 
<br/>and 20-year NDP, I am reminded of the critical importance of this endeavour in shaping the future 
<br/>trajectory of our country.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring the successful completion 
<br/>and implementation of the new NDP.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of past policies and 
<br/>initiatives, engaged in extensive consultations with stakeholders and segments of the society across 
<br/>all sectors, and aim to incorporate valuable feedback from our citizens through nationwide public 
<br/>consultations.  I am pleased to report that significant progress has been made in the formulation of 
<br/>the new NDP.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>51 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the onset of the formulation of the NDP, a total of 275 consultations have been planned 
<br/>by the Ministry, starting from 14</span><span>th</span><span> February till 21</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2024 teams from the Ministry of Finance, 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics will be travelling around the country across 
<br/>the four Divisions - Central, Western, Northern and Eastern, to gather views and feedback on the 
<br/>development priorities, policies and strategies for the NDP.  As of last week, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>the teams have completed a total of 250 consultation meetings.  We have consulted a total of more 
<br/>than 11,150 people during this period, of which, around 39.1 percent are women and 32.5 percent 
<br/>are youths.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we can see the lengths the Ministry of Finance has gone to consult 
<br/>as many people as possible and receive valuable inputs for the formulation of a robust NDP.  The 
<br/>people who our team had consulted were very grateful for the Government to hear their pleas, and 
<br/>these people have gambled their hopes to have their needs addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  NDP  will  be  a  dynamic  and  forward-looking  document,  tailored  to  address  the 
<br/>evolving challenges and opportunities facing our nation, a plan that is the People’s Plan.  It will set 
<br/>out a clear vision and strategic objectives for the next three years, five years and 20 years, with a 
<br/>focus on promoting sustainable development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  based  on  the  consultations  we  have  had  so  far,  key  priorities 
<br/>identified  through  our  consultations  include  the  need  to  modernise  our  legislative  framework, 
<br/>strengthen  public  sector  service  delivery  and  address  critical  issues  such  as  infrastructure 
<br/>development, health care, education, police, water and drainage, roads, social and climate resilience. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it has been identified that in the next three years, we the Government 
<br/>need to continue to get our basic rights which will greatly resolve many of the issues that our Fiji 
<br/>citizens are currently facing.  Basics, Madam Deputy Speaker, such as continue to fix the drainage 
<br/>issues, ensuring consistent supply of clean water, providing good health care facilities, improving 
<br/>law enforcement through resourcing the Police and enhancing access to education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, there is a strong emphasis on promoting private sector-led growth, enhancing 
<br/>skills development, fostering youth empowerment to drive economic diversification and innovation.  
<br/>We have also taken proactive measures to ensure gender mainstreaming and inclusivity in our policy 
<br/>formulation process, recognising the importance of empowering women and marginalised groups in 
<br/>our society.  Madam Deputy Speaker, the new NDP is envisioned to be completed by June this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, at the heart of the NDP lies its alignment with Fiji’s international 
<br/></span><span>commitments, notably the UN Sustainable Development Goals. By seamlessly integrating SDGs into 
<br/>our national development agenda, we reaffirm our unwavering resolve to address global imperatives 
<br/>inequality,  environmental  sustainability  while  championing  sustainable 
<br/>such  as  poverty, 
<br/>development and inclusive growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  while  the  new  NDP  will  align  with  SDGs,  Fiji  is  linked  to  the 
<br/>international commitments, necessitating the need to achieve our SDG targets.  The Second Report 
<br/>of the 2023 Voluntary National Review (VNR) openly presents Fiji’s progress and need to address 
<br/></span><span>data gaps in achieving the SDGs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji views the 2030 Agenda, Madam Deputy Speaker, not merely as a global commitment, 
<br/>but  as  intrinsic  to  our  own  development  goals.    The  SDGs  have  become  the  cornerstone  of  our 
<br/>national development planning, guiding our efforts to build a resilient and sustainable future for all. 
<br/>Fiji’s significance stride towards achieving the SDGs is commendable, however, more needs to be 
<br/>done.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, 128 indicators have sufficient data, however Fiji risks missing 75 
<br/>percent of the 97 targets that we could measure. Urgent action is required to accelerate progress and 
<br/>strengthen global partnerships are essential to secure greater financial assistance, capacity building, 
<br/>technology transfer and system enhancement across all 17 SDGs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  with  the  most  disciplined  ambitious  of  fiscal  policies,  it  was 
<br/>challenging for us as a developing country to meet all the SDG targets, in particular, the data and 
<br/>definitional gaps.  I am happy to announce that the assistance of multilaterals in this regard especially 
<br/>the UNESCAP is valuable, and they are happy to continue to assist us about the data and the gaps.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is by no means a criticism of the SDGs themselves, in reflecting holistically with the 
<br/>benefit of the 20/20 vision, we can now embrace the new lens and ambition that we have evolved to 
<br/>adopt, when realising that a more prosperous and sustainable developed large ocean state like ours is 
<br/>within reach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  let  us  acknowledge  the  resilience  of  the  Fijian  economy  amidst 
<br/>unprecedented global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing geopolitical tensions 
<br/>and the escalating impacts of climate change.  Despite these adversities, Fiji has grown remarkable 
<br/>resilience and determination to emerge stronger.  Our economy is poised for a broad-based growth 
<br/>of around 3.8 percent and 3 percent for 2024 and 2025 respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is crucial to acknowledge that we are not immune to the economic headwinds facing the 
<br/>global economy. Our economy, Madam Deputy Speaker, like many others has felt the impact of the 
<br/>pandemic,  disrupting  trade,  tourism  and  investment  flows.    Additionally,  as  a  climate-vulnerable 
<br/>nation, Fiji faces heightened risks from extreme weather events, rising sea levels and environmental 
<br/>degradation, further complicating our economic outlook. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  one  of  the  central  pillars  of  our  economic  strategy  is  fiscal 
<br/>sustainability. We recognise the importance of maintaining sound fiscal discipline to ensure the long-
<br/>term stability and prosperity of our nation. Prudent fiscal management is essential to instil confidence 
<br/>among  investors,  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  safeguard  the  wellbeing  of  our  citizens.  
<br/>However, achieving fiscal sustainability requires a delicate balancing act. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on one hand, we must address the urgent needs of our people, invest 
<br/>in critical infrastructure and provide essential services. On the other hand, we must exercise restraint 
<br/>and discipline to prevent excessive borrowing and accumulation of debt that could jeopardize our 
<br/></span><span>fiscal stability in the long run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is committed to ensuring that debt levels remain sustainable and 
<br/>manageable.  We  have  implemented  measures  to  improve  debt  management  practices,  enhance 
<br/>transparency and strengthen oversight  mechanisms  to  prevent  debt  distress.   Additionally,  we are 
<br/>actively exploring opportunities for debt restructuring and other innovative financing mechanisms to 
<br/>ease the burden on our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  while  fiscal  sustainability  remains  paramount,  we  must  also 
<br/></span><span>prioritise economic growth and climate resilience.  These objectives are not mutually exclusive but 
<br/></span><span>rather complementary. Sustainable economic growth is essential to create jobs, reduce poverty and 
<br/>improve the standard of living for all Fijians. At the same time, we must integrate climate resilience 
<br/>into  our  development  agenda  to  protect  our  people,  infrastructure  and  natural  resources  from  the 
<br/>escalating impacts of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>53 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  path  ahead  of  us  is  fraught  with  challenges  but  it  is  also 
<br/>brimming with opportunities. I am confident together we will all overcome these challenges and build 
<br/>a brighter, more prosperous future for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Early this year, Cabinet had approved the Growth Re-set Initiative Package which is a new 
<br/>phase of economic reforms to be undertaken by the Government. The Growth Re-Set Initiative builds 
<br/>on the work that has already begun through national consultations through the National Economic 
<br/>Summit, Fiscal Review Committee and the Budget development processes. It is focussed on a first 
<br/>phase  of  economic  and  regulatory  reforms  which  are  relatively  easy  to  achieve  by  combining 
<br/>knowledgeable public and private sector skills and experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Government  must  be  seen  to  be  taking  the  decisive  step  to 
<br/>encourage new economic growth measures and should take advantage of being new and changed, 
<br/>and also modernising our law and policy on essential topics including foreign property ownership, 
<br/>investment restrictions, short term and long- term immigration, energy generation, environment and 
<br/>planning laws is very essential to increase private sector participation in our economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Growth Re-set Initiative is jointly managed and implemented 
<br/>by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, SMEs and Communications 
<br/>and I update this august Parliament that progress has been made so far in achieving the objectives 
<br/>under the initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this stage, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the three sub-committees for 
<br/>meeting regularly and trying to look at ways to improve the current processes and areas for efficiency: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Sub-Committee on Immigration and Investment Law and Processes Reform; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Sub-Committee to Review Electricity Sector; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Sub-Committee on Lands, Environment and Planning Law and Process Reforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as you are aware that the Coalition Government has re-established 
<br/>the Strategic Planning Office which is ensuring better coordination and formulation of a strategic and 
<br/>a  robust  development  agenda.    The  Office  will  be  further  resourced  in  the  next  financial  year  to 
<br/>deliver its core outputs especially strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of capital projects and 
<br/>key government initiatives and ensuring value for money. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Cabinet has endorsed the use of guidelines and user manual for the preparation, appraisal 
<br/></span><span>and approval of projects under the Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP).  This will assist in 
<br/></span><span>future decision making on projects to be done taking into consideration value for money and better 
<br/>returns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, a major change from the current practice of appraising new projects, 
<br/>which  the  guidelines  introduce,  is  a  two-stage  process.  One  is  the  Early-stage  Preparation  (Stage 
<br/>One)  which  involves  initial  identification,  research  and  discussion  for  the  preparation  by  budget 
<br/>entities of a relatively simple screening note to be evaluated by the Ministry to determine if a detailed 
<br/>appraisal study (Stage Two) is warranted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reiterate the Coalition Government’s steadfast commitment to crafting a comprehensive and 
<br/>inclusive National Development Plan that engenders enduring national unity, fosters a shared vision 
<br/>and  propels  socio-economic  advancement  across  our  beloved  Fiji.    Through  the  NDP,  the 
<br/>Government will aim to address multiple facets of our citizens plea.  Together, let us redouble our 
<br/>efforts in building a more prosperous, resilient, and sustainable future for all.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and 
<br/>gentlemen – a very good afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, International Women’s Day was celebrated on Friday 8</span><span>th</span><span> March.  
<br/>Women are pillars of strength in our society.  We should always love and respect them.  Women 
<br/>embody  strength,  courage,  fearlessness  and  above  all  resilience.    Happy  belated  International 
<br/>Women’s Day to all women including women Members in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to comment on some of the key features 
<br/>of the statement made by His Excellency the President of Fiji at the opening of the new session of 
<br/>Parliament on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President  had  briefly  touched  on  the  focus  and  future  development 
<br/>direction that the Government will embark on or continue to pursue in this Parliamentary session.  
<br/>Unfortunately, Madam Deputy Speaker, the state of affairs under this Government for approximately 
<br/>the last 15 months has been abysmal.  The future also looks bleak.  The Government has been simply 
<br/>plodding  along  with  no  direction.    The  only  direction  they  seem  to  have  in  common  is  the  Nadi 
<br/>Airport Departure Lounge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No cohesive set of policies, no cohesion amongst the Ministers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Each pulling in different directions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I feel sorry for the honourable Prime Minister because it would appear 
<br/>that his individual Cabinet Ministers are each doing their own thing.  Of course, the former Prime 
<br/>Minister Bainimarama did not have that problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President mentioned that we need to focus on 
<br/></span><span>development and be people centric.  As was confirmed to us at the Budgetary briefing by the Ministry 
<br/>of Finance’s staff at the Opposition office and as the budget books speak for themselves, not a single 
<br/>cent has been allocated in the budget delivered by the honourable Minister of Finance and supported 
<br/>by the honourable Prime Minister on any new projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  We  are  a  developing  country,  we  need  development,  we  need  new 
<br/></span><span>projects and we need new infrastructure.  Please do not tell us that there are billions of dollars of 
<br/></span><span>private sector funds lined up for immediate investment. Most of these supposed new developments 
<br/>simply have attractive artistic impressions on paper only.  We cannot simply rely on private sector 
<br/>investment.  We also need public sector investment to provide more modern day infrastructure which 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government had started.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>55 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- My colleagues from the largest single party on this side of Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will talk about these in more detail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who wrote your speech? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I wrote it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prasad, please do not use debt as an excuse.  In fact, debt under you has increased 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without any single new project or a pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- You lack understanding and know-how to run a modern day economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, please let me give a simple example on how 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the non-allocation of funds or even an ongoing maintenance is impacting ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The general public including students from Viseisei Back Road, Saweni, Vuda Back Road, 
<br/>Dreketi, Vuda Point, Vaivai, Saru, Navula, Wairabetia and other parts of Fiji  have  raised serious 
<br/>concerns regarding bus services to their areas and pathetic road conditions.  Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>two elderly citizens aged 80 and 81years reside at Viseisei Back Road, and they are both sickly.  They 
<br/>have to hire a taxi at least twice a week to go to Lautoka City or to the Health Centre and they pay 
<br/>$30 per trip.  They spend $60 a week on taxi fare, and this is because there has been no bus service 
<br/>in the area since last year.  Sometimes these old men are dropped off 500 metres away from their 
<br/>homes because the Government road is in a pathetic condition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  do  not  blame  the  taxi  drivers  but  the  </span><span>lovo</span><span>  pit potholes  and  the 
<br/>Government.  This  was  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works, 
<br/>Meteorological  Services  and  Transport.  Well  now  in  the  1980s  mode,  renamed  public  works, 
<br/>unfortunately the public works has not benefitted from the honourable Minister for Public Works 
<br/>because this matter has not been addressed by him since it was brought to his attention last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President spoke about commitment to accountability, transparency and 
<br/></span><span>good governance practices in all public sector entities including Public Enterprises.  I agree with His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency the President, but I do not believe the message had been received well by the Coalition 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, since day one, this Government has been assaulting ssection 123 of 
<br/>the  Constitution,  which sets  out  how  transparency  is  created  and  must  be  adhered  to  in  the  Civil 
<br/>Service.  It states in section 123(i), and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Recruitment and promotion based on - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(ii)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>objectivity, impartiality and fair competition; and  
<br/>ability, education, experience and other characteristics of merit.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Section of the Constitution,  like a number  of others,  appear to  be simply  on display by this 
<br/>Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>56 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  lack  of  adherence  to  the  supreme  law  and,  therefore, 
<br/>undermining the rule of law has meant lack of transparency which, in turn, has also meant that service 
<br/>levels to the members of the public have dropped.  People are holding positions when they should 
<br/>not be and for this very reason, many have and are leaving the Civil Service and, indeed, many Fijians 
<br/>have even left our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  an  example,  the  honourable  Acting  Minister  for  Education’s 
<br/>recent announcement to regularise all acting positions, is not just a misguided move, but exposes his 
<br/>and the Permanent Secretary’s complete disregard for the supreme law of the land,...  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  …  the  Constitution,  in  particular  Sections  127(8)(b)  and,  of  course, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 123, and equality provisions under Section 126.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this regularisation has been carried out in an </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> manner by the 
<br/>Ministry of Education.  The violation of the supreme law of the land has meant, as expected, that the 
<br/>Ministry of Education has created more uncertainty in an already unstable environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of deserving teachers who were acting in the leadership positions and who applied 
<br/>for  transfer  for  good  reasons  in  2022  and  in  the  beginning  of  2023,  have  missed  out  during  this 
<br/>regularisation because they do not meet one criterion and, that is, they must have acted in the position 
<br/>for the last six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this morning, I heard from the honourable Minister for Education 
<br/>that  some  teachers  have  been  acting  for  the  last  20  years.    That  is  a  lie,  and  I  think  he  had 
<br/>miscalculated  it.    Despite  the  Ministry  of  Education’s  guidelines  having  no  provision  for 
<br/>regularisation, they still went ahead with the irregular regularisation process, with no transparency 
<br/>but all subjective, meaning, it becomes a free for all.  Anyone with the right connection will get what 
<br/>they want, and many deserving teachers will lose out.  This is what happens when the rule of law is 
<br/>not adhered to.  Chaos, corruption and unchecked power will reign.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, many deserving teachers are so disturbed and disheartened because 
<br/>posts have been confirmed without providing opportunities to those with the right qualification and 
<br/>experience on merit.  As a result, teachers have lost confidence in the system, are frustrated and even 
<br/>more are planning to seek opportunities overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are being welcomed, in particular, in Australia and New Zealand where these Fijian 
<br/>teachers can work in an environment where rules and the processes are actually transparent; with the 
<br/>values of fairness and equality and where selection, appointment, promotion and even regularisation 
<br/>are not determined by your ethnicity, province, religion or whom you know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  in  his  Address,  mentioned  that 
<br/>education will continue to be a priority.  We, on this side of Parliament, fully endorse that education 
<br/>should be topmost priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  education,  and  more  importantly,  access  to  education  is  the 
<br/>cornerstone of individual and societal development.  It plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of 
<br/>individuals and societies, and it assists those individuals and societies to thrive in an ever-evolving 
<br/>world.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>57 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, if education is a priority, why did the Ministry of Education not give 
<br/>priority to teacher transfer and appointment of teachers before the beginning of the 2024 school year?  
<br/>It is the teacher that makes the difference, not the physical classroom.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, students were in classrooms without teachers for weeks and in some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cases even months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- The Ministry of Education created that chaotic situation for not only the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>teachers but also for the students, for the parents and guardians, and for the schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, because of the Ministry’s gross negligence, students lost many days 
<br/>and weeks of learning.  Has the change in Ministers had an impact on the output of the Ministry?  
<br/>What are the highly paid advisors, mainly political mates who have no idea on how to run a modern 
<br/>education system and who were actually appointed without transparency doing?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, what are the plans to recover the lost teaching hours?   
<br/>. 
<br/>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- No plan! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, we also sit in amazement to hear not a peep out 
<br/>of the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations, supposedly the 
<br/>great father of teacher union representation.  His silence is deafening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, by the way, honourable Minister for Education, the Fiji Teachers 
<br/>Union have clarified that there has been no agreement on the irregular regularisation process contrary 
<br/>to your claim that there was collaboration and partnerships with teachers’ unions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Who is telling the truth?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Maybe, honourable Minister, you spoke with only one teacher union and thought that that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was enough.  The word ‘consultations’ has a hollow meaning under this Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, talking about transparency and accountability in Government and 
<br/></span><span>public enterprises.  We still do not know how a private owned company  - Poly Tech, is suddenly 
<br/>getting government grants.  Suddenly, vocational courses that were offered by FNU, which is another 
<br/>debacle, is being offered and preferred by Government to be Poly Tech, the institutional choice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Poly Tech is not Monfort Boys Town or Corpus Christi or Sangam 
<br/>or USP or University of Fiji or even FNU because these organisations that I have just mentioned are 
<br/>not private companies.  I do not know if there is a joining of the dots here.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What was also interesting, Madam Deputy Speaker, is that for the catering at the unnecessary 
<br/></span><span>fanfare last year, the advertisement for expressions of interest went out on Friday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2023 and 
<br/>closed  on  Sunday,  7</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2023,  just  two  days.  Again,  this,  I  believe,  is  most  certainly  not  the 
<br/>transparency that His Excellency was talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  how  fair  and  transparent  and  merit  based  were  the  recent 
<br/>appointments of town and city council Special Administrators?  Special Administrators who have

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been  appointed  are  mostly  failed  candidates  and  supporters  of  National  Federation  Party  (NFP), 
<br/>People’s Alliance Party (PAP) and SODELPA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, Madam Deputy Speaker, Advisory Councillors have also been appointed in this 
<br/>manner.  Many who were very efficient and very effective, had experience and were service oriented 
<br/>to  all,  were  removed  to  make  room  for  the  political  lackeys  of  mainly  NFP.    Where  is  effective 
<br/>governance?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor!  Nepotism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, municipal councils, state-owned enterprises, 
<br/>public  enterprises,  advisory  councillor  bodies  and  statutory  bodies  are  not  there  to  give  jobs  to 
<br/>politicians and supporters of those politicians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, these entities have a particular purpose, and they are there to provide 
<br/>a  service  to  public  or  generate  sustained  profits.  If  these  organisations  are  operated  effectively, 
<br/>efficiently, with professionalism by those selected on merit and have no bias in dealings and process, 
<br/>then it will give confidence to ordinary Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it will give confidence to business houses and investors, both local 
<br/>and foreign.  However, the opposite is happening because the end game by this Government is to 
<br/>treat all State apparatus as means of looking after themselves and their political supporters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- That is the end game for them. Whether organisations do well, or they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>do not do well is secondary to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam  Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and the people  of Fiji who 
<br/>may be listening to this broadcast through </span><span>Walesi </span><span>or livestreaming on radio today, may I begin by 
<br/>acknowledging  </span><span>Na  Turaga  na  Tui  Suva</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>the  ancestral  owner  of  the  land  on  which  the  people’s 
<br/>Parliament stands and the generations past, present and future. </span><span>Vinaka saka vakalevu na veimaroroi.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>I also stand in unison with the honourable Prime Minister in congratulating the Drua Team, the Coach 
<br/></span><span>and Management, for its victory on last Saturday.  All I can say is that the next 15s World Cup cannot 
<br/>come sweet enough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is with a deep sense of honour, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I rise today in support of the 
<br/>motion of the honourable Prime Minister to thank His Excellency the President of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji,</span><span> </span><span>Ratu Kiniviliame Maivalili  Katonivere, </span><span>Turaga Bale na Tui Macuata, Taukei Bolatagane</span><span>,  for 
<br/>his most gracious Speech. After one year, two months and 17 days or 444 days since committing to 
<br/>serve our beloved country with all its challenges and learnings, Madam Deputy Speaker, I remain 
<br/></span><span>very committed to serving my country to the best of my ability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In doing so, I shall first endeavor, Madam Deputy Speaker, to provide some insights into parts 
<br/>of His  Excellency’s most Gracious  Speech before providing a stock-take of what  the Ministry of 
<br/>Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has done and plans to do 
<br/>in 2024-2025.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>59 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, you will recall when I made my Maiden Speech last year, I prayed 
<br/>for the wisdom of King Solomon.  His Excellency’s Speech exudes the same wisdom. His Excellency 
<br/>asked us: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>To listen to the voices of all the people of Fiji; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Respect the dignity and integrity of Parliament;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Guard  against  unscrupulous  politicians  sowing  divisions  and  mistrust  amongst  us  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their own political ends; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Work across the aisles to find common ground on critical issues facing our nation and to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>put our people first.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the People’s Coalition's perspective, Madam Deputy Speaker, we could not agree more. 
<br/>The  People’s  Coalition  Government,  from  the  get-go,  committed  to  several  key  actions  with  an 
<br/>assurance to the people of Fiji that we would involve them and, of course, listen to their views. There 
<br/>has  been  the  fiscal  Review  Committee,  the  Economic  Summit  and  the  Education  Summit.  This 
<br/>approach of listening to the people works well and will continue into the future. We cannot say the 
<br/>same for the other side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We ratified on a bipartisan basis the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) 
<br/>Pillar  2  Supply  Chain.    The  honourable  Prime  Minister  invited  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition to COP28 and honourable Koya attended a meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka 
<br/>in November last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- So! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  I  am  also  happy  to  note  that  the  National  Taskforce  on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pornography was approved in Cabinet and will be approached on a bipartisan basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- I am coming to that also, honourable Premila Kumar.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The signs are positive, and I am sure that we will do more of the same together, heeding the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call of His Excellency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  on  His  Excellency’s  plea  for  us  to  guard  against  unscrupulous 
<br/>politicians  who  wish  to  sow  divisions  in  our  beloved  nation,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has 
<br/>graciously commented that we may be well forgiven for thinking that it may be him but we know it 
<br/></span><span>is not him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I say this, Madam Deputy Speaker, with the best of intentions.  If there is anyone of us in this 
<br/>Parliament that is sowing seeds of division, my humble message to you is this, you have no place in 
<br/>this august Parliament, nor in the new Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we look at His Excellency’s most gracious Speech in totality, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>it  is  really  talking  about  rebuilding  Fiji  from  infrastructure,  the  Truth  and  Reconciliation 
<br/>Commission, speeding up the green transition, updating legislation, et cetera.  The question is, why? 
<br/></span><span>It is very easy.  It is because of the mismanagement of the last 16 years on the other side of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We have an unsustainable debt issue. We have a massive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>drug problem in our country. We have a broken-down health system in our country…  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-… an education system which requires work, et cetera.  But 
<br/>I will honour the exhortation of His Excellency, Madam Deputy Speaker, and say this.  We have a 
<br/>major  task  ahead  of  us  and  we  can  only  solve  it  if  we  work  together  starting  from  this  august 
<br/>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the pursuit of progress and prosperity, let us be guided by the principles of justice, equality 
<br/>and compassion.  Let us continue to rebuild Fiji together where every individual has the opportunity 
<br/>to prosper and progress. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow  me,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  to  share  in  this  august  Parliament  some  of  the  work 
<br/>achieved  and  plans  by  the  Ministry  I  am  honoured  to  lead  and  plan  to  do,  as  we  navigate  the 
<br/>challenges and opportunities that lay ahead. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  global  outlook,  His  Excellency  correctly  points  out  the  return  of  the  nation’s 
<br/>economic activity to pre-pandemic levels with an anticipated growth of 3.8 percent in 2024 and 3 
<br/>percent in 2025 which is positive.  This is against the continued global risks, like the Ukraine War 
<br/>and the escalating tensions in Gaza, which will remain challenges. At present, debt to GDP stands at 
<br/>75.6 percent and as we all agree, is still unsustainable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To this end, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry which I am honoured to lead will do its 
<br/>utmost to try and achieve a higher GDP growth of, at least, 5 percent, hopefully, working together 
<br/>with all the agencies of Government, the private sector and civil society - another concept that the 
<br/>other side does not understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Our Ministry believes that this can be achieved by pushing 
<br/>for an investor friendly environment, drive opportunities for investment and trade growth and push 
<br/>for total digitisation of the Fijian economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the areas where our focus will be to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to strive for an investment friendly environment, especially ease of doing business, 
<br/>collaborating with the private sector;</span><span>
<br/></span><span>continue to drive closer and stronger, broader trade and investment ties with all our partners; 
<br/></span><span>continue to drive for genuine economic diversification; 
<br/>continued focus on regional hubbing agenda; and 
<br/>continued focus on ICT or communications in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to touch on the investor friendly environment and the ease of doing business. Some of 
<br/>us may recall, Madam Deputy Speaker, that when we got into office, a major investor in Fiji had its 
<br/>FJ$30million project at Nadi Airport on hold for some inexplicable reason. This investor has spent 
<br/>at least $800 million, Madam Deputy Speaker, in Fiji over the years and sends as least $30 million 
<br/>in foreign exchange every year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, to have a key investor treated in 
<br/></span><span>such a cavalier manner was not acceptable and was a major concern for investors around Fiji at that 
<br/></span><span>time.  Together  with  the  honourable  Gavoka  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  we  immediately 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>61 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowed the investment to proceed which sent a very clear message to both local and foreign investors 
<br/>that the People’s Government was keen to drive investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since then, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have not stopped with the change in Investment Fiji’s 
<br/>mandate from being a regulated to facilitator of domestic and foreign investment, we are making 
<br/>good progress in terms of driving investment in Fiji. The current investment pipeline stands at $3 
<br/>billion and growing. There is a mood to invest in the country from renewable energy, commercial 
<br/>agriculture, tourism and expansion of existing operations such as Fiji Water recently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have created an Investment Facilitation Committee which is an inter-agency committee 
<br/>which looks at investment bottlenecks and tries to fix them. If they do not move, the Minister gets 
<br/>involved. We have a taskforce to aid with the setup of commercial agriculture and we hope to make 
<br/>some positive announcements soon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The automation of business processes relating to starting a business and the building permit 
<br/>approval  is  underway.  This  pilot  phase  aims  to  automate  25  processes  over  16  agencies.  Whilst 
<br/>automation of these processes are underway as alluded to by the honourable Assistant Minister, there 
<br/>is  another  exercise  to  look  at  business  processes  in  other  key  agencies  such  as  immigration, 
<br/>environment  and  land  called  the  “growth  reset”  before  automation.  We  have  assistance  from  the 
<br/>private sector on this initiative, again something that the other side never did. Together with these 
<br/>continuous reforms, the Ministry is also getting ready for the World Bank successor to the Doing 
<br/>Business Report</span><span>, “</span><span>Be Ready” as it is called which is on the horizon with data collection expected to 
<br/>start at the beginning of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, for investment growth, we are also looking at Policy Frameworks 
<br/>such  as  one  which  will  guide  significant  investment  and  also  a  policy  framework  for  diaspora 
<br/>investment. This is being considered to promote and attract strategic investments into Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Government does hear the frustration of the business community 
<br/>and I can guarantee you, we are taking action.  In terms of the broader trade investment relations, to 
<br/>the honourable Leader of the Opposition, we do have a pretty good trade policy which we inherited 
<br/>from yourselves, it would be tweaked but it is quite good.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s strategic decision to join the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), 
<br/>a 14-member economic club representing 40 percent of the global GDP underlines our readiness to 
<br/>play a proactive role in shaping regional, trade and economic architecture. As the only Pacific country 
<br/></span><span>to join this initiative, Fiji has actively engaged in negotiations across all four Pillars on cooperation, 
<br/></span><span>trade, supply chain resilience, clean economy and fair economy. We intend, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>to bring two further Pillars of the Agreement through this august Parliament on a bipartisan basis 
<br/>namely, Pillar 3 on Clean Economy and Pillar 4 on Fair Economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The entry of </span><span>Google</span><span> can be seen as part of the IPEF early harvest, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>and there are plans Trades Pacific Investment Missions to Singapore and United States of America 
<br/>on the back of this economic club. We also plan to relook at Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic 
<br/>Relations (PACER Plus) but I have to emphasise with full consultation with the private sector.  The 
<br/></span><span>Interim Economic Partnership Agreement ratification subject to Cabinet  approval  will be brought 
<br/></span><span>forward this year which will provide better access for Fiji exports into the European Union.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  trade  missions  have  been  active,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.    In  2023,  our  Trade 
<br/>Commission  based  in  Australia  facilitated  over  $70  million  in  exports  to  these  markets  and  an 
<br/>increase of 15 percent over the previous year adding at least 8.5 percent to the value of Fiji’s overall 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>62 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>exports to Australia and New Zealand.  This year, the Trade Commission aims to facilitate further 
<br/>exports by at least 20 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Trade  Commission  also  contributed  to  key  events  such  as  Spartan  Fiji;  an  adventure 
<br/>tourism race (the first major post-pandemic event) which will continue in 2025.  Last year, we also 
<br/>completed a Trade and Investment Mission to New Zealand and hosted a business forum in Australia.  
<br/>This,  we will see  reverse missions into Fiji  this year  which will stimulate more opportunities for 
<br/>investment and trade.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Trade Mission of North America has had a remarkable year starting with the inauguration 
<br/>the  new  office  in  San  Francisco  Bay,  North  America.    It  also  played  a  crucial  role  in  the 
<br/>transformative </span><span>Google</span><span> Submarine Cable project, as well as the diverse landing station and data centre 
<br/>investments  that  will  occur  over  the  coming  year.    Some  of  our  major  commercial  agriculture 
<br/>ventures are arising from USA.  We are planning a Fiji-North America Business Mission this year 
<br/>aiming  to  potentially  visit  four  states  in  America  and  Canada  fostering  investment  and  trade 
<br/>opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there are 100,000 diaspora in Canada.  The Trade Commission in 
<br/>North  America  has  also  been  instrumental  in  supporting  Fiji’s  exports  and  conducting  market 
<br/>research for key exports to North America.  Notably, it facilitated the purchase of over 50 metric 
<br/>tonnes of mature ginger by the ginger people, a much-needed market for farmers who had been over 
<br/>promised and their crop was not bought last year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  China,  we  have  secured  some  potential  investors  at  least  round  about  US$45  million 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covering noni commercial farming and forestry apart from other areas of investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  economic  diversification,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  development  of  the 
<br/>Medicinal  Cannabis  Industry  as  well  as  a  broader  nutraceutical  economy  including  the  potential 
<br/>billion-dollar kava industry is a key focus of the current Government.  With advent of </span><span>Google</span><span> and 
<br/>second subsea cable, this should drive an expanded ICT industry.  There is a massive opportunity to 
<br/>create very good paying jobs through the ICT industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the BPO industry, which is a key sector, it has undergone very good growth in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2023.  We believe it can rival tourism and have been supporting this industry to-date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moves to reinvigorate the mahogany industry is supported by the Ministry.  This as well, is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>multi-billion dollar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I am also looking at SMEs as a major sector in terms of economic diversification.  It 
<br/>is already 18 percent of GDP.  The Ministry is very committed to develop and harness SME growth.  
<br/>We just had our first MSME Conference last week that was organised by Business Assistance Fiji 
<br/>and it gave us policy makers another opportunity to hear directly from the MSMEs and take stock of 
<br/>what needs to be done. Our bid to improve access to capital for businesses, the Ministry is working 
<br/>with the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the Asian Development Bank on an Access to Capital Bill which 
<br/>will be presented later this year.  This will narrow the financing gap and unlock more investments 
<br/></span><span>into the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in parallel with this, working with UNESCAP, we are developing 
<br/>an  MSME  Strategic  Plan  that  will  pave  a  roadmap  to  grow  the  MSMEs.    We  cannot  talk  about 
<br/>MSMEs without talking about the co-operative business through the </span><span>solesolevaki </span><span>concept, it is a very 
<br/>positive  way  of  developing  business  particularly  amongst  the  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>community.  Last  year,  we 
<br/>conducted over 200 awareness meetings, registered 77 new co-operatives and provided training to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="54">Page 54</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>63 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>over 800 Fijians with a notable 85 percent increase in co-operative registration compared to the same 
<br/>period last year. Critically as the economy diversifies, there is a need for strong standards and will 
<br/>continue to be a priority. Standards in the various sectors of climate change mitigation, construction, 
<br/>food safety and energy management not only will enhance trade opportunities but also ensure that 
<br/>safety, quality and reliability of goods and services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of National Trade, Measurement and Standards will play a key role. In terms 
<br/>of  regional  hubbing,  Fiji’s  status  as  a  regional  hub  continues  to  grow.  It  has  developed  hubbing 
<br/>capacity in shipping and aviation, medical support and education. From an ICT perspective, again 
<br/>the </span><span>Google</span><span> Cable initiatives will bring about a major shift in terms of a regional hub for Fiji from an 
<br/>ICT perspective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  in  terms  of  harnessing  ICT  in  Fiji,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  believe  that 
<br/>digitisation  remains  an  essential  driver  to  social  economic  development  in  our  country.    The 
<br/>Government’s focus is unwavering to provide an enabling, conducive and secure ICT environment 
<br/>for private sector-led growth and to empower our people through financial inclusion and essential 
<br/>digital services. Alongside </span><span>Google</span><span>, the licensing of Starlink will provide options for our people. We 
<br/>are also actively collaborating with the Telecommunications Authority of Fiji to penetrate the final 
<br/>5 percent to 10 percent of our isolated communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of its Global Risk Reports of 2024, it is stated that 
<br/>cyber security is a significant risk. The People’s Government is committed to putting in the necessary 
<br/>policy, legislative and regulatory framework to  ensure a safe and secure  cyberspace  exist for our 
<br/>people. Likewise, the development of the Anti-Scam Taskforce has come forward as a result of recent 
<br/>scamming and cybercriminal activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In closing, Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge us all to rebuild Fiji together. We owe it to our 
<br/>children and to their children. May God bless Fiji, may God bless His Excellency the President, may 
<br/>God bless the honourable Prime Minister and fellow Members of Parliament and may God bless the 
<br/>people of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minster, honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise this afternoon to contribute 
<br/>in  response  to  His  Excellency  the  President’s  speech  for  the  Opening  of  the  2024  Session  of 
<br/>Parliament. Greetings and a very good afternoon to each and everyone present here today, at home 
<br/>and to those listening via other mediums. Before I start my speech proper, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>I  would like to  remind honourable Kamikamica  that  we have been selected by the people of this 
<br/></span><span>nation and we are the single largest party representing this country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the security of a nation is the most solemn 
<br/>responsibility  of  any  Government  and  the  first  priority  of  every  Prime  Minister  and  the  same 
<br/>sentiment has been shared by His Excellency the President on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2023.  Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, crime rate has risen remarkably high within the 14 months of the Coalition being in 
<br/></span><span>power and the behaviour of our Police security is questionable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why  I  said  that  the  Police  security  is  questionable  is  because  under  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>Acting  Police  Commissioner  and  with  tight  security,  methamphetamine  was  stolen.    If  this  can 
<br/>happen in Police stations, then what can one expect from the honourable Minister for Home Affairs? 
<br/>Our  citizens  have  little  or  no  faith  in  the  security  system  of  our  country  and  I  am  requesting  the 
<br/>Government to take some precautionary measures so that their livelihood is protected at all times.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“At the same time, encourage a culture of saving which will allow the development 
<br/>of a sustainable investment plan for their families long term security so we can all prosper 
<br/>together.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, how can it be possible for the iTaukei Land Trust Board to advertise 
<br/>public  consultation  on  State  freehold  land  to  be  converted  into  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  land?    Is  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Lands aware of it?  What will be the consequences?  Madam Deputy Speaker, the Crown 
<br/>grant is transferred subject to provision of the Crown Grant Act upon thorough investigation of the 
<br/>need of a particular State land to members of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span>.  It is done when there is scarcity of land 
<br/>to the members of the </span><span>mataqali </span><span>and not for the sake of some politicians own political gain which 
<br/>seems  to  be  the  main  reason  behind  public  consultations.  The  advertised  consultation  in  the 
<br/>newspaper  show  the  calibre  of  people  who  are  involved  in  this  exercise.    Does  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for iTaukei Affairs know what is happening under his nose? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- I am coming to it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, what will happen to the existing sugarcane farmers who have settled 
<br/>on  this  land,  and  I  know  of  a  few  in  the  Western  Division  and  Vanua  Levu.  I  can  assure  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister that the conversion will have a long-term negative impact to our economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have cane cultivation in Volivoli, Rakiraki where it is almost 
<br/>around 5,158 acres of State land where majority of Fijians are cultivating sugarcane on this land.  In 
<br/>Drasa, Vitogo has 2,296 acres of flat land under sugarcane and producing a good tonnage of cane.  
<br/>We have other cane cultivation areas such as Vatumani with 744 acres, Tovatova has 213 acres and 
<br/>another 6,935 acres, Koro No. 2 has 1,247 acres, Varoko has 103 acres, Vadravadra has 844 acres 
<br/>and for the honourable Minister for Sugar in Rara, Wailevu in Vanua Levu is 1,291 acres and Mosara 
<br/>has 413 acres beside other land listed for consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  what  will  happen  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  who  is 
<br/>harping about increase of cane production? How will he now face the farmers who are leasing on 
<br/>State land? The lessees will be insecure and will reduce planting of cane and production will decline 
<br/></span><span>which will affect our sugar industry.  Similarly, the same happened with the non-renewal of native 
<br/></span><span>lease in the past. Madam Deputy Speaker, farmers are living peacefully in their leased land from the 
<br/>State but if this transfer of Crown grant takes places after consultations, it will take away the current 
<br/>lessees’ livelihood who have been staying since the CSR Colonial days, built houses and have carried 
<br/>out massive developments to the land.  Most of them are aging farmers and will not be able to develop 
<br/>the new allocated lots given to them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, what  about compensation to improvements such as 
<br/>buildings, fence, roads, et cetera? Who will compensate the farmers in the scenario if the </span><span>mataqali 
<br/></span><span>members want to cultivate the entire portion of land?  We will be discouraging investment, and the 
<br/></span><span>conversion will take our country back in terms of growth. The financial institutes will be reluctant to 
<br/>even mortgage these leasehold land due to uncertainty of its terms and conditions.  Honourable Prasad 
<br/>and  honourable  Kamikamica  know  that  presently  there  is  no  big  investment  taking  place  in  our 
<br/>country except the casino, if approved and if I am not wrong, honourable Kamikamica, due to  
<br/>uncertainty with the Coalition partners.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>65 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.-Madam Deputy Speaker, the best way to sought the shortage of land to 
<br/></span><span>mataqali</span><span> unit is  to  have a consultation  with  the honourable Minister for Lands as they have land 
<br/>available  which  are  in  breach  of  lease  conditions  and  the  </span><span>mataqali  </span><span>can  lease  from  the  Lands 
<br/>Department.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I strongly request the honourable Prime Minister to look into this 
<br/>and please consider my request to stop the consultation of State freehold land for the sake of the poor 
<br/>farmers who have been suffering all their lives and struggling for a better livelihood.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.</span><span> - </span><span>I know better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister is not here, being a farmer’s son and coming from a remote 
<br/>rural  area  of  Marasa,  Nadi,  my  parents  toiled  hard  to  feed  my  two  siblings  and  Igave  us  a  good 
<br/>education and how I struggled to succeed in life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As for Schedule A and B, they can proceed with due process, there is no problem with that.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  His  Excellency  alluded  to  good  governance,  where  is  good 
<br/>governance when the delivery level to the public sector is pathetic?  For example, Ministry of Lands 
<br/>has yet to provide the sales data for properties sold in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  if  the  honourable  Speaker  was  here  this  afternoon,  he  will 
<br/>understand the difficulties registered valuers faced at the moment  as they are unaware of the real 
<br/>estate market and where our country stands in the real property market.  It seems that the Permanent 
<br/>Secretary, Director and the Chief Valuer have no clue of when the Ministry of Lands will give this 
<br/>vital information to the valuers.  I cannot understand, without the available data, how is the Valuation 
<br/>Section on the Ministry of Lands assessing rentals and carrying out valuation?  It has been more than 
<br/>a year since they have been finalizing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Fiji Revenue 
<br/>&amp; Customs Service (FRCS) and Registrar of Titles.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I raised this question in the previous sitting and if you remember, 
<br/>the honourable Minister of Lands said that from January this year everything will be sorted out but 
<br/></span><span>nothing has been sorted out so far. Is this what we call efficient service delivery?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  spoke  about  informal  settlements.    Can  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  of  Lands  highlight  this  as  what  I  could  gather  nothing  has  been  done  so  far 
<br/>despite being in Government for more than fourteen months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  on  service  delivery  the  Office  of  the  Attorney-General  must  be 
<br/>proactive.  Getting a certified title and lease copy takes a few days and people coming from the rural 
<br/>areas cannot be coming to Registrar of Titles Office twice or three times a week as some are poor 
<br/></span><span>and cannot afford the bus fares.  The lack of service to our fellow citizens are alarming and delays 
<br/></span><span>their small projects mainly those who want to take loans to invest or improve their standard of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  has 
<br/>always complained of the debt level of previous governments.  However, this Coalition Government

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has significantly increased the debt level despite increasing Value Added Tax (VAT) and putting 
<br/>further burden on our fellow Fijians with no progressive developments to our nation.  The honourable 
<br/>Prasad said that they are increasing VAT to 15 percent so that they can reduce the debt level but in 
<br/>actual fact the debt level has increased, and prediction is that by 2026 the debt level will increase 
<br/>significantly to US$5.2 billion which is about FJ$11.76 billion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.</span><span>–  </span><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  Coalition  Government  has  further 
<br/>burdened our poor fellow citizens with high cost of living, increased cost of basic food items while 
<br/>the Ministers are enjoying overseas trips with hefty allowances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.</span><span>– </span><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, some Fijians only enjoy a single or two meals 
<br/>a day while the wealthy Ministers enjoy lavish meals at a cost to poor fellow Fiji citizens.  Honourable 
<br/>Prasad, where is your so-called strategy to reduce national debt and bring the cost of living down 
<br/>which you have been harping about since you have been in Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- 25 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.-  Is this one of your many false promises to reduce the price of lamb 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>chops so that you can ride in a black ministerial vehicle? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Lamb chops price? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- (Inaudible interjection) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.-</span><span> </span><span>Why, you want to give me some from your supermarket?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Stop pointing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  said  that 
<br/>Government is committed to greater accountability, transparency and good governance.  I have been 
<br/>requested by the people to ask if the honourable Minister for Fisheries accepts or denies that he is 
<br/>one of the shareholders in the </span><span>bech-de-mer</span><span> exporting company on any of the fishing companies in 
<br/></span><span>Fiji?  I hope to get a reply from the honourable Minister in his response which is tomorrow where 
<br/></span><span>the whole nation can know the truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Point of Order!  Standing Order 62(1)- Prohibited references: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“When speaking, a member must not impute improper motives to any other member.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Member is imputing improper motives in terms of what he was referring to 
<br/></span><span>another honourable Member, not only him, but other earlier speakers in terms of the process in hand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, Sir.  I hope you heard that, honourable Kirpal?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what honourable Tuisawau is about 
<br/>accountability and transparency which I am asking.  There is wrong in asking about transparency and 
<br/>accountability of the honourable Minister, and this has been allowed in Parliament by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>67 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker,  the  question  asked  by  honourable  Rinesh  Sharma.    I  would  like  to  inform  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Infrastructure  that  our  fellow  citizens  living  in  Tacirua  have  not  been  receiving 
<br/>reticulated  water  since  2</span><span>nd</span><span>  March.    I  request  the  honourable  Minister  to  look  into  this  as  His 
<br/>Excellency the President mentioned this in his Address and I quote: “The Government is committed 
<br/>to ensure that all citizens have access to clean drinking water.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Just fix your thing first and then bring up some Points of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is disheartening to note that a large section of our population is being deprived of basic 
<br/>necessity, and cartage of water to this area is not regular.  Also, if the honourable Minister can look 
<br/>into the roads at Nabitu, Sigatoka, Marasa, Nadi and the bridge at Buabua, Lautoka which are in 
<br/>pathetic  conditions.    Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  must  be  united  with  the  vision  that  portrays  a 
<br/>strong, secure, peaceful and prosperous Fiji, where people are educated, healthy and manage their 
<br/>resources in an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable way.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.S.  KIRPAL.-  Our  aim  is  to  decrease  poverty,    promote  equal  opportunity  and 
<br/>prosperity and enhance peace and stability to help Fiji achieve its long term development vision.  It 
<br/>can only happen if the Government gives opportunities to our younger generation who are the future 
<br/>leaders of this nation and stop getting people who have left the nation and are returning for their own 
<br/>benefit and agenda.  I hope the honourable Prime Minister will give some serious consideration to 
<br/>this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I end, I would like to remind honourable Gavoka that it is not a free education, because 
<br/>conditions are attached to it, bond (Coalition bond).   He has a habit of going around the bush blaming 
<br/>Fiji Airways when in Opposition, but now he is praising it.  Where has Qantas gone?  Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, fellow Fijians are questioning about the charter flight … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- …to Israel and if the arrears have been fully settled or still pending?  It 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is taxpayer’s money, honourable Gavoka.  Now you are quiet! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I urge the Government to get to your work as time is flying and people are 
<br/>watching.  Serve the nation and do not be obsessed with FijiFirst, as you will not be able to match 
<br/>what the FijiFirst Government did for the poor Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- May God bless this nation, all of us and the Coalition partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members and all joining in the gallery and online; </span><span>aap sabko saadar pranaam, salaam alay kum and 
<br/>ni sa bula vinaka saka</span><span> to all.  We began our Parliament this year in a very holy month.  Our Christian 
<br/>brothers  and  sisters  are  praying  and  fasting  in  preparation  for  Easter  later  this  month.    I  wish 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ramadhan Mubarak</span><span> to our brother and sisters from Islamic faith, as they too embark on a month of 
<br/>fasting and prayers.  Hindus too are marking </span><span>fagunmas</span><span>, as they prepare for </span><span>Holi</span><span> also later this month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This week, there is a World Spiritual Leaders Forum organised in Hydrabad, India, where 
<br/>leaders from different faith traditions are coming together to see how each faith can contribute to 
<br/>peace in a world full of strife.  Terrorists come together and unite in their quest for destruction, so 
<br/>why cannot faith leaders join hands to build peace?  For that, we have to make an effort to learn about 
<br/>each other’s traditions and customs without fear of losing our own identity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  His  Excellency  reminded  us  in  his  gracious  Speech,  we  are 
<br/>blessed with diversity of cultures and faiths.  Yet, while many of us enjoy the different festivals and 
<br/>have  a  basic  understanding  of  each  other’s  beliefs,  narratives  promoting  fear  and  insecurity  have 
<br/>never allowed us to fully embrace each other. Much more needs to be done to allay those fears. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  lamented  that  some  unscrupulous  politicians 
<br/>continue  to  instigate  mistrust  among  our  communities  for  their  own  political  ends.  So,  when  the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  called  himself  a  </span><span>vulagi</span><span>  when  he  was  a  visitor  at  an  event,  this  was 
<br/>drummed up because this was what he had called non-indigenous community.  Even chiefs when 
<br/>they enter a territory beyond their own within Fiji are called </span><span>vulagi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  simplistic  interpretation  is  what  might  be  called,  in  other  countries,  a  ‘dog  whistle’.  
<br/>Some politicians will capitalise on the use of the word to prey on the insecurities of non-indigenous 
<br/>people, to suggest that they are being left out or treated as different.  Many of us with a heightened 
<br/>sense of insecurity are ready to believe the worst, so when we hear this narrative, our fears are made 
<br/>worse. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to also raise the issue on what the previous Member, 
<br/>honourable Kirpal said.  He shared one example of where Native land lease is being converted, and 
<br/>then he used that example to create insecurity among all State land, what if it is converted back and 
<br/>what impact it will have on everyone else?  Things like that causes fear, that is gaslighting what is 
<br/>being shared.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- So, when you see one example like that, instead of finding out why it has 
<br/>been converted, is it being used, is it more necessary for that particular </span><span>mataqali, </span><span> we have used that 
<br/></span><span>to create fear amongst all the people of Fiji.  That is exactly what His Excellency the President is 
<br/></span><span>talking about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  KIRAN.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  even  when  we  have  lived  together  for 
<br/>generations, we do not understand enough the extent of our fears and insecurities relating to other 
<br/>communities.    Those  of  us  who  are  not  indigenous  surely  understand  that  for  the  </span><span>iTaukei,  </span><span>their 
<br/>identity is the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, land, its customs, traditions and its people, and all of these adhere to them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Migrant communities feel insecure that the land they live on to which they form a different 
<br/>but also real attachment, could be taken away from them.  What is the work we need to do as leaders 
<br/>to  ease  the  tension  and  fears  that  these  issues  raise?    Is  it  to  create  more  tensions,  like  we  have 
<br/>witnessed?   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>69 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are surely ways that we can see these issues not as a contest or a competition, but as a 
<br/>way  in  which  we  share  and  co-operate,  work  together,  contributing  different  things,  and  live  in 
<br/>harmony with one another, acknowledging each other’s insecurities and working to make sure that 
<br/>we understand and not create that as a fear. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to acknowledge our past, look at our narratives of the past and how pain, trauma and 
<br/>insecurities have been transferred from generation to generation.  Indenture, </span><span>coups</span><span> and evictions from 
<br/>land have traumatised my community and our sense of belonging.  It does not help when these things 
<br/>keep being drummed up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Melanesians,  Rabi  and  Kioan,  Chinese,  Part-Europeans,  all  have  had  a  history  that  is  not 
<br/>talked about.   We do not  learn  about  it in  schools.   Instead, we rely  on stereotypes passed down 
<br/>between generations.  Political upheavals in the last three decades have impacted every ethnic group 
<br/>and there are scars we carry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the key focus areas for our Government will be to work on 
<br/>healing through the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and building social cohesion so Fiji and 
<br/>its people can reach their full potential beyond these insecurities and fears.  The honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition had shared today that we need to integrate multi-culturalism in all spheres of our 
<br/>life.  That is our intention, Madam Deputy Speaker.  School curriculum will be reviewed to integrate 
<br/>our history much of which was removed by the last Government.  The Coalition Government has 
<br/>reintroduced Ratu  Sukuna Day and added Girmit Day to  celebrate our leaders and remember our 
<br/>history. Truth and Reconciliation Commission will provide a platform for collective healing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Prime  Minister,  under  his  leadership,  the  entire  Coalition  Government  is 
<br/>committed to this process. This may be a difficult walk, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is hard to look 
<br/>within ourselves and do the hard work.  It is easier for us to ignore these things and pretend that 
<br/>everything  is  fine, but  we cannot  go into the future as  a nation, secure  and united, until  we have 
<br/>confronted the demons of the past.  There are painful conversations to be had in our </span><span>vanua</span><span> settings 
<br/>with non-indigenous communities, political prisoners and their communities, as we prepare for the 
<br/>Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to pay tribute and acknowledge the efforts of Major-General 
<br/>Jone  Kalouniwai,  the  Commander  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji  Military  Forces  (RFMF),  for  his  own 
<br/>initiative of healing and reconciliation within the RFMF that he began this month. We know that the 
<br/>RFMF has played a role in many disruptive political events in the past. And as the Commander stated 
<br/></span><span>recently for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to succeed in Fiji, it was important for RFMF 
<br/></span><span>to work on healing and reconciliation from within. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  grateful  that  we  live  in  times  with  leaders  such  as  the 
<br/>Commander and our honourable Prime Minister who are committed to steering the nation forward 
<br/>from its painful past.  I want to invite all segments of our community to engage in the Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation process, including the business community, civil society, the Public Service and the 
<br/>religious groups, to create an environment of learning about each other’s cultures and faith traditions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enabling  a  Muslim  worker  to  quietly  conduct  his  or  her  midday  prayers  at  work  during 
<br/></span><span>Ramadan, or reflecting together in a neutral and non-religious way on the message Easter brings, 
<br/>would be ways in which we could bring people together, show respect and support inclusion.  Only 
<br/>when we have learnt each other’s values in each of our cultural and faith traditions, do we embrace 
<br/>each other’s authenticity and only then do we enable each other to grow to their full potential.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a challenge issue to one and all, to take the time to try and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>learn from others around you, whose faith and ethnic and cultural identities are different from your 
<br/>own.  As one who has spent more than 20 years on this journey, let me assure you that the greatest 
<br/>learning from these engagements is that about oneself. We can learn to see ourselves in a different 
<br/>light, to understand how, within our own faith and traditions, we can do better and serve others better.  
<br/>I look forward to the journey of healing for this nation, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  His  Excellency  for  highlighting  the  wide-ranging  work  of  the 
<br/>Government  to  strengthen  our  core  social  protection  programmes.    Fiji  has  developed  a  national 
<br/>Adaptive Social Protection Strategy and Implementation Plan in 2023 funded by the World Bank.  
<br/>This strategy aims to strengthen the role and performance of the social protection sector in helping 
<br/>households,  communities,  civil  society,  local  government  and  Fiji  overall  in  preparing  for, 
<br/>responding to, and recovering from disasters and in mitigating the impacts of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has recognised the value of adaptive social protection which is defined as building the 
<br/>resilience of households by investing in their capacity to prepare for, cope with, and adapt to shocks, 
<br/>protecting their wellbeing and ensuring that they do not fall into poverty or become trapped in poverty 
<br/>as a result of disaster impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  development  of  Fiji’s  first  Anticipation  Action  (AA)  Framework  in  2023  will  enable 
<br/>financing to be triggered by the forecast of an approaching hazard, instead of only reacting to its 
<br/>impact following the event.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The AA Framework was developed in partnership with National Disaster Management Office 
<br/>and it is funded with the support of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian 
<br/>Affairs  (UNOCHA)  and  World  Food  Programme.    Our  Ministry  has  the  responsibility  for  cash 
<br/>transfer  to  selected  beneficiaries  of  social  protection  programme  and  prepositioning  of  necessary 
<br/>supplies.    This  improves  the  ability  to  deliver  prompt  pay-outs  so  that  those  affected  by  climate 
<br/>shocks can action time-sensitive preparedness and response measures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to guide the staged implementation of the Strategy, the Government 
<br/>has developed its 5 Year Implementation Plan, which identifies two main approaches for enhancing 
<br/>the delivery of the Adaptive Social Protection Strategy, to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>expand social protection benefits and reach in disaster hit communities; and 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implement  community-based  Adaptive  Social  Protection  actions  in  14  priority  districts 
<br/>which are at heightened disaster risks and facing the impacts of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An essential prerequisite for delivering Adaptive Social Protection is investing in a robust 
<br/>and high-coverage social protection system that can deliver benefits in a reliable and timely manner 
<br/>and can be scaled up in times of crisis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  of  the  Adaptive  Social  Protection  Strategy,  the  Government  is  committed  to 
<br/>strengthening  the  design  and  delivery  of  its  portfolio  of  recurrent  social  protection  programmes 
<br/>through  an  ambitious  and  wide-ranging  package  of  reforms  with  the  support  of  the  Australian 
<br/>Government.    These  reforms  are  focused  on  strengthening  programme  inclusion,  efficiency  and 
<br/></span><span>effectiveness, in alignment with the objectives of the 2021 Social Assistance Policy, across the six 
<br/></span><span>major  social  assistance  benefits  administered  by  the  Ministry  of  Women,  Children  and  Social 
<br/>Protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our Ministry is considering several programmes and policy reforms 
<br/>to  ensure  that  beneficiaries  are  receiving  sufficient  support  and  to  enhance  the  coverage  and 
<br/>accessibility  of  the  core  social  protection  programmes.    We  are  currently  undertaking  a  range  of

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>71 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>operational reforms to ensure that the system is delivering support to people in a transparent and cost-
<br/>effective way.  This includes: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>ensuring  that  the  public  have  access  to  information  and  understand  the  social  protection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>entitlements; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>setting up mechanisms for effectively responding to complaints; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>strengthening tools to measure how well Fiji’s social protection system is working. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  digitising  social  protection  and  developing  a  new  automated  integrated 
<br/>beneficiary management system to make it easier and more cost effective for Government to deliver, 
<br/>and for beneficiaries to access social protection. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as His Excellency has laid out this year, we have a lot to do.  To my 
<br/>honourable colleagues in the Opposition, I want you to know that we value your work among your 
<br/>supporters and Party members.  I value the work you do to scrutinise and criticise the Government’s 
<br/>work.    I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  for  his  commitment  to  work  with  the 
<br/>Government on what matters to our people and the nation.  I hope you will also see the value of the 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission on which we are embarking and give to this process your full 
<br/>support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We cannot be effective in this work without your help.  Nothing is more important than for 
<br/>all of us to be able to show our people that our differences in debates in this Parliament are not about 
<br/>enmity or hate.  They are about working together to make our country better and stronger.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that deep in our hearts this is what we all want, and I look forward to hearing from 
<br/>everyone on how we can make our process better, more inclusive and something which will lead to 
<br/>lasting change and that includes, being factual in the way we debate and trying out best not to do 
<br/>gaslighting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look forward to a very productive year, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I wish to say thank you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to you and to Parliament, and may God bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni sa bula 
<br/>vinaka </span><span>and good afternoon to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  respond  to  His  Excellency  the  President,  Ratu  Wiliame 
<br/>Maivalili Katonivere’s Address for Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament last Monday and to 
<br/>thank His Excellency for his most gracious Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, His Excellency the President made some profound announcement with regards 
<br/>to Government policies and plans for the development and advancement of our nation Fiji, which we 
<br/>all need to take heed of and work towards as honourable Members of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  among  the  highest  priorities  of  the  Coalition  Government  is  the 
<br/></span><span>formulation of a new National Development Plan for the nation, as announced by His Excellency the 
<br/>President.  The new National Development Plan will capture our collective vision and aspirations for 
<br/>the future and set key initiatives and strategies that will allow the nation to grow sustainably in the 
<br/>many years ahead of us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to by His Excellency the President, the key fundamental of the Government’s 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development  agenda  is  inclusive  development  to  improve  the  wellbeing  of  all  our  citizens.  The 
<br/>National  Development  Plan  is  anticipated  to  be  finalised  by  June  this  year  before  the  Budget 
<br/>announcement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  highlighted the  commitment  of the 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services to address the significant challenges posed by the increasing 
<br/>burden of Communicable and Non-Communicable Diseases in our population. Non-Communicable 
<br/>Diseases (NCDs) continue to be the main disease burden for our people, contributing to 80 percent 
<br/>of all deaths in the country and 40 percent of premature death.  I am grateful to the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister responsible for the Civil Service for launching earlier this year the Policy and 
<br/>Guideline on Healthy Catering at Government agencies and institutions which should guide how the 
<br/>Civil Service can promote and implement healthy eating and meal preparation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The healthy eating habits to reduce NCDs in Fiji do not start inside our hospitals and nursing 
<br/>stations.  They start and are nurtured in our homes, schools, villages, workplaces, offices and also in 
<br/>the deliberations of this august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The NCD crisis we have will require all our collective efforts and determination to control 
<br/>and stop.  The Ministry of Health and Medical Services is finalising its Wellness and NCS Strategy 
<br/>with the help of our partners, which will guide our effort in addressing NCDs in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, at this juncture, the Ministry is highlighting an uphill battle with the 
<br/>increasing  number  of  HIV  and  AIDS  cases  in  Fiji.    While this is  still  the  tip  of the  iceberg,  it  is 
<br/>commendable for the Government of the day to recognise two significant issues that were pushed 
<br/>under the carpet.  It:: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognises drugs as an issue; and 
<br/>recognised HIV. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  latest  statistics  on  HIV  cases  are  alarming  and  demands  our  attention  and  collective 
<br/>action. From January to December 2023, we have recorded 415 new HIV cases in Fiji, compared to 
<br/>245 cases for the same period in 2022.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Out of these cases, 404 are adults, while 11 cases are children. Three of the children got HIV 
<br/>through  sexual  transmission,  while  eight  children  got  HIV/AIDS  through  Mother-To-Child 
<br/>Transmission (MTCT).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of the total number of patients diagnosed, 298 are reported to be male, 122 female and four 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transgenders. In addition, 31 of these cases were teenagers aged between 15 years to 19 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increase is attributed through increase in active case finding within the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services using Point of Care Testing. Unfortunately, in 2023 alone, Fiji lost 82 lives to 
<br/>HIV which is one to many.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Global AIDS Monitoring Report, Fiji is now one of the top two countries in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Asia-Pacific region with rapidly rising new HIV infections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is aware of the linkage between the use of illicit drugs in the country and the 
<br/>rise in HIV cases.  Activities such as Blue Toothing for IV drugs users and Chem-Sex amongst the 
<br/>younger population are fueling the rise in new HIV cases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is finalising the  HIV Surge Strategy which will facilitate our collaboration with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="64">Page 64</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>73 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>health  partners,  across  Government  Ministries,  and  our  communities  to  strengthen  prevention, 
<br/>increase national HIV testing by 3 percent for key population groups, improve access to diagnosis 
<br/>and  treatment,  reduce  stigma  and  discrimination  relating  HIV  and  AIDS,  and  strengthen  the 
<br/>governance of our HIV response programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I take this opportunity to remind everyone in Fiji that unsafe sexual practices and the use of 
<br/>injectable  drugs  are  contributing  to  the  rise  of  HIV  in  Fiji.    Avoiding  these  risky  behaviours  can 
<br/>prevent you from getting the HIV infection.  I also want to remind everyone in Fiji, that HIV is not 
<br/>a death sentence.  With treatment, people living with HIV can lead a normal and productive life and 
<br/>have children who are free of HIV infections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to address the disease burden in Fiji.  His Excellency the 
<br/>President had highlighted a number of important steps that the Ministry will undertake.  The Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical services is focussed on reviewing and updating a number of critical health 
<br/>legislations such as the Public Health Act 1935, Nursing Act 2010, Radiation Health Act 2009 and 
<br/>the Mental Health Act 2010.  Other health related legislations are also being considered for review 
<br/>as they impact the collaboration and coordination of effort between the Ministry, other Government 
<br/>agencies and the community, in the efficient delivery of health services and the protection of public 
<br/>health in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Talking  on  health  workforce,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Fiji  continues  to  lose  healthcare 
<br/>workers  from  the  Ministry  into  the  private  health  sector  in  Fiji  or  abroad.    Current  global  trends 
<br/>indicate that the movement of healthcare workers will continue for some time due to a global lack of 
<br/>healthcare workers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the world will face a shortage of 10 
<br/>million healthcare workers in 2030, reducing from 15 million in 2020.  These gaps are still significant 
<br/>and  contributing  to  the  movement  and  maldistribution  of  the  healthcare  workers  in  Small  Island 
<br/>Development States (SIDS), such as Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nonetheless, the Ministry has noted that in the case of our nursing workforce, the attrition 
<br/>rate has reduced in the months of November to December 2023, following the implementation of 
<br/>salary  adjustments  and  incentives  for  nurses  which  Parliament  approved  in  2023-2024  National 
<br/>Budget.  This is an encouraging sign, and the Ministry will continue to work with the stakeholders 
<br/>to address human resource need for the immediate and the long-term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On infrastructure improvement, Madam Deputy Speaker, since January 2023, the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>has continued with its health infrastructure improvement programme with the budgetary allocation 
<br/>from the Government, together with the general support of our partners, local businesses, civil society 
<br/>organisations, Hospital Board of Visitors and community members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through  this  collaborative  effort,  the  Ministry  has  implemented  a  number  of  significant 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructural improvement projects that include, amongst others, the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment  of  Nagado  Nursing  Station,  Vatulele  Health  Centre,  Nukuilau  Nursing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Station and Nailaga Health Centre in the Western Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment  of  Dreketi  Health  Centre,  Naqumu  Nursing  Station  and  Savusavu  Health 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Centre in the Northern Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment of Galoa Nursing Station, Korovou Health Centre and the SOPD Clinic at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wainibokasi Hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment of wards and road works at St Giles Psychiatric Hospital.  
<br/>5.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment of the Rose Hall at Tamavua Hospital.

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Construction on the Food and Water Laboratory at Fiji CDC Centre in Namaka. 
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Refurbishment of Cicia Health Centre in Cicia Island in the Lau Group. 
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Construction of a mortuary ramp and admin walkway at Labasa Hospital.  
<br/>9.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Internal renovations and exterior painting of the Mataika House in Tamavua.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A number of infrastructural works are currently progressing, such as the refurbishment of the 
<br/>Nausori Health Centre, the interior painting for Labasa Hospital, and the construction of the Northern 
<br/>Medical Warehouse facility, to name a few.  The Ministry will continue to address the infrastructure 
<br/>improvement needs for all its more than 200 health facilities across the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is aware of the infrastructural issues relating to the 100-year-old CWM Hospital, 
<br/>which have been highlighted a number of times in the media.  The Ministry is engaging with the 
<br/>Ministry of Public Works and Transport and our health partners, to address the immediate and long-
<br/>term infrastructure needs of this Hospital.  We hope to announce this week a health partner support 
<br/>that  will  go  a  long  way  in  addressing  the  short  and  long-term  actions  to  improve  our  hospital 
<br/>buildings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Digital Health, Madam Deputy Speaker, COVID-19 pandemic showed us the value of 
<br/>digital health in augmenting and enhancing the delivery of health care services in Fiji and globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, the Ministry launched its first ever Fiji’s Digital Health Strategy which is aimed at 
<br/>enhancing  the  Ministry’s  communication  and  digital  platforms  and  facilitating  better  disease 
<br/>surveillance,  patient  referral,  supply  chain  and  inventory  management,  resources  planning  and 
<br/>mobilization, and governance of its daily operations.  Our divisional and subdivisional  command 
<br/>centres  operations  will  function  much  more  effectively  with  access  to  a  better  digital  and 
<br/>communication platform.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  strategy  will  assist  in  the  introduction  of  new  digital  health 
<br/>programme such as the immunization information system and telehealth capabilities that will further 
<br/>enhance  health  services  as  well  as  the  storage  and  security  of  confidential  health  information  for 
<br/>patients.  This 5-Year Digital Health Strategy and Implementation Plan with the associated package 
<br/>of  digital  support  will  address  governance,  systems  and  human  resources  in  line  with  the 
<br/>Government's overall digital plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On health programmes, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has targeted the strengthening 
<br/>of a few health programmes that have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic which now need 
<br/></span><span>strengthening and enhancement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is finalising its Primary Health Care Strategy with the support of our partners. 
<br/>The strategy will define the Primary Health Care package that will be delivered at all levels of health 
<br/>services from the nursing station right up to the main referral hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A strengthened Primary Health Care programme will ensure that our population receive the 
<br/>health care they need in a timely manner, fulfilling our Universal Health Coverage targets for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  Fiji’s  immunisation  programme  has  been  exemplary  and  applauded  globally,  the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry  wishes  to  maintain  the  high  immunisation  coverage  for  the  population  of  Fiji.    The  last 
<br/>coverage survey showed a 95 percent coverage overall for all vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccination 
<br/>coverage for the primary doses is also 95 percent for the adult population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With a strong child health programme under the Ministry, Fiji has maintained its neonatal 
<br/>mortality rate of less than 12 per 1,000 live births consecutively over the past five years, meeting the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>75 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>SDG target of less than 12 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2030.  The Ministry will also begin to 
<br/>address and measure our progress towards the SDG targets of less than 25 per 1,000 live births for 
<br/>under five mortality rate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  is  strengthening  the  immunisation  information 
<br/>management system with development partner support in the development of a digital immunisation 
<br/>registration system that will be completed over the next two years.  This will allow defaulters to be 
<br/>traced efficiently, and readily available updated coverage data across the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With development partners support, the Ministry has updated its Immunisation Policy, and 
<br/>rolled  out  the  digital  Bluetooth  monitoring  of  our  Cold  Chain  process,  which  is  the  heartbeat  of 
<br/>vaccination, providing the opportunity for research into the use of vaccines in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, the Early Childhood Development Policy and Implementation Plan was launched 
<br/>through the collaborative effort of our health partners and the government  agencies including  the 
<br/>Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection.  The Policy will 
<br/>ensure  that  the  National  ECD  Advisory  Committee  effectively  guide  the  holistic  development  of 
<br/>more than 88,000 children between the age of 0 years to 8 years in Fiji through access to healthy 
<br/>nutrition, early education and support for the parents. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, inclusive development is an approach within the Ministry of Health 
<br/>and Medical Services is taking in terms of meetings our strategic objectives and most importantly 
<br/>improving the quality of health care for Fijians. For our many health programmes, the Ministry is 
<br/>engaging our community partners and civil society organisations to address the health concerns of 
<br/>our communities and address  the health needs of our vulnerable  communities so that the elderly, 
<br/>babies and children, pregnant mothers, the disabled and those with chronic diseases are adequately 
<br/>addressed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The increased allocation for medical outreach to rural communities, which is decentralized to 
<br/>our  divisions  for  the  first  time  ever  will  ensure  that  our  rural,  hard-to-reach  communities,  and 
<br/>maritime communities are visited by our health teams and their health needs addressed close to their 
<br/>own  homes.  In  fact,  as  I  speak,  a  team  of  Medical  Specialist  led  by  our  Acting  Sub-Divisional 
<br/>Medical  Officer  (SDMO)  Eastern,  Dr.  Luke  Ravula  are  touring  the  islands  of  the  Lau  Group 
<br/>providing medical care and health promotion activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, through the Ministry’s Donor Coordination Unit, we are gradually 
<br/></span><span>building up our capacity to be able to engage effectively with our various health partners and gain 
<br/></span><span>maximum benefit from their support and generosity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  is  grateful  to  the  support  of  local  businesses,  NGOs,  Civil  Society 
<br/>Organisations,  Board  of  Visitors  and  community  groups,  as  well  as  partners  in  DFAT,  MFAT, 
<br/>KOICA, JICA, USAID, China Aid, World Bank, ADB and the UN organisations – WHO,UNICEF, 
<br/>UNFPA, UNDP and the Governments of Australia, New Zealand, USA, China, as well as families 
<br/>and individuals  who have supported the Ministry in its efforts to improve health services provision 
<br/>for the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  wish  to  conclude  with  His  Excellency  the  President’s  Address 
<br/>when he said and I quote, “Let us not see challenges as mountains, but as common missions to ascend 
<br/>and resolve with open and constructive dialogue, with a view to build social cohesion.”  With that in 
<br/>mind, I wish to mention and extend my sincere gratitude and appreciation for the incredible work of 
<br/>our health care workers throughout the country.  One of them was highlighted in the media recently 
<br/>–  the  Medical  Officer  at  Cicia  Health  Centre  in  the  Lau  Group,  Dr.  Rusila  Tikoitoga  who 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>courageously  and  successfully  delivered  twins  last  month  with  limited  medical  resources  at  her 
<br/>disposal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  this  is  not  our  ideal  delivery  plan  for  a  twin  pregnancy  knowing  the  many  risks 
<br/>associated with multiple pregnancies. However, this was the reality at the frontline on that day, and 
<br/>not of her choosing.  Dr. Tikoitoga displayed calmness, quick thinking remembering her training as 
<br/>a  medical  intern,  and  her  dedication  and  faith  to  see  the  young  mother  and  the  newborn  babies 
<br/>through.  Madam Deputy Speaker, Dr. Tikoitoga exemplified many more dedicated and hardworking 
<br/>health care workers in Fiji whose stories we may never hear, who gave their best day in and day out, 
<br/>in spite of the many challenges they face each day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As their Minister, I salute all of them today and I also thank our friends and partners who help 
<br/>to make their work easier each day with their support.  The Ministry of Health and Medical Services 
<br/>cannot do it alone, we need everyone’s contribution to create a healthy population in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, this brings to an end today’s proceedings and 
<br/>I want to thank you very much for your energy today. We will begin tomorrow morning with the 
<br/>next speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  must  admit  that  afternoon  tea  had  been  ready  for  some  time,  but  I  thought  you  might 
<br/>appreciate  us  just  forging  ahead  and  then  giving  you  the  opportunity  to  enjoy  afternoon  tea  after 
<br/>today’s proceedings.  I thank you for your contributions, honourable Members.  Parliament is now 
<br/>adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.
