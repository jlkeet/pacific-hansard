<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s Sitting, all those joining us in the gallery and 
<br/>those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for taking an interest in 
<br/>your Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commonwealth Day 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, we, the member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations generally 
<br/></span><span>known as the “Commonwealth”, once again, come together to commemorate Commonwealth Day.  
<br/></span><span>Every year on the second Monday of March, 56 independent countries from around the world hold 
<br/>celebrations to commemorate this special day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commonwealth  Day  is  a  celebration  of  unity,  diversity  and  the  links  we  share  in  the 
<br/>Commonwealth.  This year’s theme, “</span><span>One Resilient Common Future: Transforming our Common 
<br/>Wealth</span><span>”,  resonates  deeply  with  the  Parliament  of  Fiji,  embodying  the  spirit  of  collaboration  that 
<br/>defines  the  Commonwealth.  It  emphasises  our  shared  responsibility  to  build  a  resilient  and 
<br/>interconnected  world.  On  that  note,  I  extend  a  happy  and  blessed  Commonwealth  Day  to  all 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members and to all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Amended Sitting Times 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, for the purposes of ensuring that all 55 Members have the opportunity 
<br/>to respond to His Excellency’s Address, and also that Parliament can successfully deliberate on the 
<br/>items listed on the Order Papers for this week, the Business Committee had unanimously agreed to

<div><span>International Women’s Day 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, whilst the world celebrated International Women’s Day last Friday, I wish to take 
<br/>this opportunity today to wish all women honourable Members of Parliament a belated International 
<br/>Women’s  Day.    In  commemoration  of  the  International  Women’s  Day,  we  will  have  the  Deputy

<br/>from Monday through to Wednesday.
