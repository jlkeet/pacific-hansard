<div><span>DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE  
<br/>PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That this Parliament thanks His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers  and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament; good morning to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to also acknowledge those Fijians all over the country who 
<br/>are watching us on livestream television or hearing us on radio, and also visitors to Fiji - our tourists.  
<br/>We welcome them most sincerely and thank them for their support of our country. I hope that those 
<br/>who are listening in or viewing us are having good reception wherever they are. We also acknowledge 
<br/>their keen interest in the affairs of our nation and the proceedings of your Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my distinct honour and privilege as Prime Minister to move the motion 
<br/>now being  debated in  Parliament and,  that is, to thank His  Excellency the President  for his  most 
<br/>gracious Address while opening the 2024 Session of Parliament on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I also congratulate  Ratu Meli Derenalagi and our Drua Rugby Team on their victory 
<br/>over  the  Canterbury  Crusaders  at  Churchill  Park  in  Lautoka  on  Saturday.  I  am  fortunate  to  have 
<br/>watched all their three victories at home here in Fiji, the first two by the very slimmest of margins 
<br/>and  also  in  the  last  minute  and  the  last  match  was  quite  a  comfortable  ten-point  margin.    I  also 
<br/>congratulate the coaching staff and management and all who contributed to the performance of the 
<br/>team and to the big crowd that came to see them play.  I also thank the Administrators of Lautoka 
<br/>City and the Fiji Sports Council for looking after the venue for such a great morale-boosting event. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  us  celebrated  Father’s  Day  in  our  churches  and  at 
<br/></span><span>Wesley,  we  also  celebrated  Harvest  Sunday.  I  congratulate  all  the  farmers  in  Parliament  and  all 
<br/>fathers in Fiji, and to all those who were able to present their fruits of their first harvest this year.  
<br/>Congratulations - </span><span>ke se vo na i tei, qai kau mai vale.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At our Father’s Day worship yesterday, we also remembered the fathers who departed this 
<br/></span><span>life during the year since our last Father’s Day.  One of the speakers in church reminded the fathers 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that many of the social ills of today, such as drug and alcohol abuse, violence against women and 
<br/>girls, ill-discipline in schools, et cetera, have all stemmed from the failure of fathers to exercise loving 
<br/>but firm leadership in families and communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his Address, His Excellency encouraged us, as democratically elected representatives, to 
<br/>listen to the voices of our people, not only to those who have elected us, but all our citizens - young 
<br/>and  old,  men  and  women.  He  urged  us  all  to  faithfully  embrace  with  resolve  the  principles  of 
<br/>democracy and humanity as enshrined in our Constitution. By doing so, we respect the integrity and 
<br/>dignity  of  our  Parliament  and  honour  all  Fijians.  His  Excellency  further  urged  us  that  while  we 
<br/>acknowledge and recognise our differences, we must be united with one common resolve to ensure 
<br/>that we live in a peaceful, progressive and prosperous nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency reminisced on his days as a boy growing up in his village 
<br/>and its environs and the people. I am sure we can all relate to his story.  He spent several happy years 
<br/>of  his  youth  in  Macuata  with  the  farming  families  during  sugarcane  harvesting  season.  Their 
<br/>multiethnic and multicultural integrated community in Macuata taught him many important lessons 
<br/>in  life  which  included  hard  work,  respect  for  elders,  family  unity  and  respect  for  other  ethnic 
<br/>communities. The two major ethnic communities in Fiji have mostly lived in harmony together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency,  however,  rued  the  unfortunate  fact  that  some  unscrupulous  politicians 
<br/>continue to instigate mistrust among our communities, for their own political ends. This has led to 
<br/>the perception of communal differences within our society, and His Excellency has pleaded with us, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, to continue to promote harmony and embrace diversity in our 
<br/>nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I was a young boy attending Drekeniwai District School in my village of Drekeniwai, 
<br/>Navatu, Cakaudrove, where my father taught, our house was the Government workers’ billet when 
<br/>they passed through the village or came to work in it.  There were two mail carriers who worked for 
<br/>the post and communications department at that time.  They traversed the coastal villages between 
<br/>Matakunea and Natewa on the Eastern Coast of Natewa Bay riding on their faithful horses.  One was 
<br/>Mamaj and the other was Lachmaiya.  They brought their own pots and pans and some cutlery and 
<br/>utensils because, as my mother told me, they would not be able to eat food prepared in pottery, et 
<br/>cetera, that have been used to cook or serve food that were forbidden in their religions, but my sisters 
<br/>and I could eat any of the food that they prepared for themselves and sometimes, my mother would 
<br/>allow them to cook for the whole family.  They were very kindhearted, honest and cheerful for us the 
<br/>young children in the village, many of us even called them </span><span>Kuku </span><span>Mamaj or </span><span>Kuku </span><span>Lachmaiya and 
<br/></span><span>they loved that.  We were family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not blame any honourable Member who might have looked my way 
<br/>when  His  Excellency  mentioned  those  words  and  I  quote:  “…some  unscrupulous  politicians 
<br/>continue to instigate mistrust among our communities for their own political ends.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I cannot change my past, I can contribute to our joint efforts to change 
<br/>the future of this country, and I will.  His Excellency reminded us of the importance of respectful 
<br/>debates as it has an impact on inter-ethnic relations of our different communities in Fiji, implored us 
<br/></span><span>to  leave aside our differences and strive for the  common good of our people and to  focus on our 
<br/></span><span>shared destiny, our commonality rather than our small differences.  He believes that we can all aspire 
<br/>to these fundamental truths that demonstrate what true leadership is all about. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  also  mentioned  his  belief  that  financial  literacy  will 
<br/>empower  our  people  with  financial  security  and  self-reliance,  encouraging  a  culture  of  financial 
<br/>responsibility that can have a positive impact on national prosperity and ensure for all, a secure future.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister Finance went on his recent official 
<br/>visit to India, I asked him to study the development introduced by Prime Minister Modi to ensure that 
<br/>every person in India (1.408 billion of them) has a bank account.  Every market and street side vendor 
<br/>had a portable credit card terminal or Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) as part of 
<br/>their Financial Literacy and National Savings Encouragement Programmes.  He came back and he 
<br/>told  me  that  he  had  very  fruitful  discussions  with  them  and  ready  to  introduce  some  ideas  to  the 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was inspired to ask the honourable Professor Prasad to do that in  India when I noticed a 
<br/>young caddy pulling a golf player’s bag on a </span><span>qiqi </span><span>or trolley and I said to my caddy, “how much of 
<br/>the $40 fee paid today will get to your family?”  He replied, “Probably none, Sir.”  I told him that 
<br/>$40 would have made a positive impact on a family’s weekly income in Wailea or Nanuku Informal 
<br/>Settlements.  We can emulate what Prime Minister Modi has done in India by providing access to 
<br/>comprehensive financial literacy, supported with the enabling environment and necessary financial 
<br/>resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  all  can  make  informed  decisions  about  savings,  investing  and  managing  our  finances 
<br/>effectively. While His Excellency would like to see Jone who is a dalo farmer and Ram who sells 
<br/>sweets at his cart learn how to manage and have access to finance, I would like the young caddies in 
<br/>golf clubs around Fiji and all market and street-side vendors to be able to do the same, and at the 
<br/>same  time,  encourage  a  culture  of  savings  which  will  allow  the  development  of  a  sustainable 
<br/>investment  plan  for  their  families’  long  term  security.  I,  like  His  Excellency,  would  like  to  see 
<br/>members of our communities learning and sharing from each other’s expertise and experiences so we 
<br/>can all prosper together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a young man, originally from Taveuni, now living in the Wailea Informal Settlement.  
<br/>He has a weak right hand. People in the area pay him to pound their  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, and he does it one-
<br/>handed, using only his left hand. When I saw him in church a few weeks ago, he has a very well-
<br/>developed left arm, strong biceps and triceps and a healthy bank account which a good Samaritan 
<br/>had helped him with. His name is Iowane (not Naivalurua), and I met him many years ago while we 
<br/>were both picking up plastic bottles from along the Suva-Laucala seawall.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this stage, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank all civil servants, Government workers and 
<br/>Provincial and Municipal workers and leaders, captains of industries and the business communities 
<br/>who  have  come  forward  to  support  the  Government’s  efforts  to  formulate  a  new  National 
<br/>Development  Plan.    The  views  of  all  members  of  our  communities  are  now  being  heard  through 
<br/></span><span>meaningful  consultations  and  these  meaning  consultations  dialogue  will  lead  to  better  outcomes, 
<br/></span><span>foster ownership, inclusiveness and social cohesion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He also mentioned the Ocean of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the vision for a united and cohesive 
<br/>Fiji is dovetailed very well with the vision for the Ocean of Peace for the Pacific. I, on many occasions 
<br/>at home and internationally continue to champion the concept of Ocean of Peace. I sincerely hope 
<br/>that the Pacific leaders will discuss and embrace the concept in its next meeting this year to be held 
<br/>in the Kingdom of Tonga in August.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  vision  is  that  we  must  all  come  together  to  promote  and  elevate  peace  for  our  vast 
<br/></span><span>maritime area which is the Blue Pacific. The aim is to promote peace as the highest virtue in the 
<br/>Pacific. We must continue to embrace the Pacific Way of patient dialogue and consensus building as 
<br/>our common heritage and core to our </span><span>Vuvale - </span><span>the Pacific family. The Government will work with 
<br/>other nations, through the Pacific Islands Forum to ensure that the concept of an Ocean of Peace will 
<br/>enhance and not reduce each State’s full sovereignty rights.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our Foreign Policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is guided by three key pillars which focusses on our 
<br/>sovereignty, security and our prosperity. We are currently in the process of developing a framework 
<br/>for our Foreign Policy through a White Paper. The White Paper will clearly define our identity and 
<br/>values, while setting a new direction in expressing our goals, our priorities and our ambitions. The 
<br/>intent is to better position Fiji in its role in the region and globally with clarity in our responsibility 
<br/>as a member of the Blue Pacific Continent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have reviewed our </span><span>Vuvale Partnership</span><span> that was signed by the Australian Prime Minister 
<br/>and I in October of last year, and last week through that </span><span>Vuvale Partnership</span><span>, I received on behalf of 
<br/>the Government of Fiji, the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Republic of Fiji Navy a Guardian 
<br/>Class  Patrol  Boat,  the  </span><span>RFNS  Puamau</span><span>  in  Perth,  Australia.    This  new  addition  will  enhance  our 
<br/>surveillance capability at a period of growing concerns of transnational crime, smuggling and illegal 
<br/>fishing  in  our  EEZ.    In  addition,  it  will  support  our  effort  for  rescue,  emergency  response  and 
<br/>rehabilitation during and after disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  and  the  people  of  Fiji  would  like  to  convey  our  deepest  gratitude  to  the 
<br/>government and the people of Australia for this timely assistance in building our capacity.  This is in 
<br/>addition to the budget support and other assistance they have provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is now in consultation with the New Zealand Government 
<br/>to review the </span><span>Duavata Partnership</span><span> following the election of a new government late last year. Beyond 
<br/>Oceania, we are building stronger ties and cooperation with our development partners including the 
<br/>United States of America, United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Japan, Korea, India, Indonesia, 
<br/>Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia and the European Union. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Clime  Change  and  Environment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  all  recognise  that  climate 
<br/>change is a cross-cutting issue and is an existential threat to our very survival and identity. This is 
<br/>the very reason I strongly support a bipartisan approach in addressing all issues relating to climate 
<br/>change because it requires all hands-on deck. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Good Governance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of my immediate priorities or our immediate 
<br/>priorities  on  assuming  office  as  the  Government  and  as  Prime  Minister  in  my  case,  is  to  ensure 
<br/>collaborative, transparent and accountable decision-making processes in Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2023, the Coalition Government put into place a strategic, robust and clear decision-making 
<br/>machinery  to  support  better  coordination,  formulation  and  implementation  of  policies  and 
<br/></span><span>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of our commitment to good governance and empowerment of local communities, we 
<br/>will work towards the review of the Banaban Settlement Act.  We also plan to hold elections for the 
<br/>Rabi Island Council, complete the naturalisation processes for Rabi and Kioa islanders and at the 
<br/>same  time,  we  will  urgently  address  the  socio-economic  needs  of  the  Melanesian  </span><span>Vasu-i-Taukei</span><span>
<br/>community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Small Grants Scheme under my portfolio will continue to support local communities to 
<br/></span><span>improve  sustainable  livelihoods.    I  have  made  the  assurance  that  all  commitments  made  by  my 
<br/></span><span>predecessor to the communities will be honoured by the Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development Assistance, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will also be focusing on the development and 
<br/>implementation of the Vanua Levu Upgrading and Sealing of Roads Project.  I cannot hear any “about 
<br/>time” from the Vanua Levu Members of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is a flagship project of the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Fiji, to improve access 
<br/>to markets and promote economic activities on Vanua Levu.  It is estimated that the upgrading and 
<br/>resealing of 80 kilometers of roads will cost FJ$300 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Civil Service, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Civil Service plays an integral part in delivering cost 
<br/>effective  Government  initiatives  to  our  people.    The  removal  of  the  contract  arrangements  and 
<br/>increasing of the retirement age to 60 has brought more confidence to our civil servants. We have 
<br/>confirmed a lot of acting appointments that have been acting for over six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amendments have also been implemented to relevant civil service guidelines 
<br/>that will allow ministries to increase the salaries of its deserving officers based on their performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On public enterprises, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State-Owned Entities and public enterprises will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to be supported to improve financial performance, and return, on investment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The re-establishment of the Higher Salaries Commission which came into effect in October 
<br/>last  year  will  promote  transparency  and  consistency  in  the  salaries  of  CEOs  of  all  State-Owned 
<br/>Enterprises.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  will  also  be  a  review  of  the  Fiji  Mahogany  Industry  which  will  be  a  key  initiative 
<br/>undertaken in 2024.  The review will identify the necessary structural reforms to enable an efficient 
<br/>business environment for all stakeholders, in particular, to encourage resource owners to participate 
<br/>in  value  addition  in  the  processing  of  mahogany  products.    In  addition,  the  Mahogany  Industry 
<br/>Development Act 2010 and Mahogany Industry (Licensing and Branding Act) 2011 will be reviewed 
<br/>to ensure transparency, accountability and provide optimum return on the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Information,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  hold  the  portfolio  of  Information  and  National 
<br/>Archives of Fiji. The availability of timely and accurate information is critical in modern society.  
<br/>The public must be informed of all the activities undertaken by their government.  The Department 
<br/>of  Information  will  continue  to  provide  timely  and  effective  dissemination  of  Government’s 
<br/>development  agenda  and  activities  as  and  when  it  happens.    The  Department  of  Information  will 
<br/>continue to nurture improved working relationships with the mainstream media, and this is in respect 
<br/>of the Government’s commitment for free and independent media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President’s  Address  at  the  Opening  of  Parliament 
<br/></span><span>reminded us to focus on our common purpose and not on our differences.  It is my hope and prayer 
<br/>that we work together to build a stronger nation with social cohesion and unity of purpose.  I urge 
<br/>you to deliberate with intention towards unity, thoughtfulness and inclusivity.  To have a meaningful 
<br/>debate, we must commit ourselves to respect one another in considering Government’s legislative 
<br/>agenda, policies and programmes as outlined in the His Excellency the President’s Address.  May 
<br/>the people of this land that we all love be the ultimate beneficiaries of our collective effort.  Together 
<br/>we are stronger.  God bless Fiji, God bless us all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  please,  take  note  that  we  will  follow  the  Batting 
<br/></span><span>Order accordingly and be reminded to keep to the timing.  The first bell will be rung at 18 minutes 
<br/>and the final bell at 20 minutes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; </span><span>ni bula vinaka</span><span> s</span><span>aka</span><span> and a very good morning to you 
<br/>all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to take this opportunity to convey our congratulations to the Drua Team for the 
<br/>win over the Crusaders during the weekend.  We convey our best wishes as well for a belated happy 
<br/>Women’s  Day  to  our  women  and  a  happy  Commonwealth  Day  as  well.    I  also  wish  to  remind 
<br/>Parliament  that  as  we  celebrated  Women’s  Day,  our  Hindu  brothers  and  sisters  celebrated  </span><span>Maha 
<br/>Shivratri</span><span> last weekend and I am also advised that tomorrow, the month of </span><span>Ramadan</span><span> starts with our 
<br/>Muslim communities.  May I, on behalf of this  august Parliament, convey our best wishes to our 
<br/>brothers and sisters of the Muslim faith.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is an honour for me today to stand again in this august Parliament to deliver my response 
<br/>to His Excellency’s the President’s most gracious Address delivered on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 on 
<br/>the occasion of the opening of the second Session of the third Term of Parliament of our beloved Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>       Mr. Speaker, Sir, while doing so, I am mindful of the fact that this response is being delivered 
<br/>in my capacity as the Leader of the Opposition for the first time, and I endeavor to approach it from 
<br/>the lens of national leadership, putting at the forefront the best interests of the nation, and those who 
<br/>call Fiji their home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But first, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it would have been beneficial to this Parliament if some references 
<br/>were made to areas of His Excellency’s Address at last years’ Opening of Parliament that has been 
<br/>achieved, which ones have fallen by the wayside, and those that have spilled over into this years’ 
<br/>Address. Government owes this to His Excellency and to this House - the people’s House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to take my role as Leader of the Opposition in a very positive 
<br/>light.  Consistent  with  the  vison  of  my  predecessor,  I  aim  to  provide  leadership  from  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament that guarantees stability, equality, security and opportunity for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the more I delve on the issue, the more I have come to realise the important 
<br/>role that Oppositions play in a Constitutional and Parliamentary democracy as a check and balance 
<br/>for Government. It is an instrument that provides an opportunity for citizens to be heard, and to be 
<br/>enlightened  on  Parliamentary  systems  and  processes.    On  the  issue  of  check  and  balances,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it is time that our parliamentary system takes serious consideration in reviewing and 
<br/>with the aim to strengthen its accountability framework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        Mr. Speaker, Sir, accountability involves the ways in which public officials, including Members 
<br/></span><span>of Parliament, Ministers, and all public sector bodies can be called to account to answer for their 
<br/>actions.    In  the  absence  of  accountability  mechanisms,  the  people  are  unable  to  ensure  that 
<br/>government act wisely, lawfully and fairly in serving their interests.  This accountability framework, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, includes parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary oversight which are essential for 
<br/>effective  democratic  governance.    I  wish  to  acknowledge  your  high  office,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for 
<br/>taking the lead in this very important area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that being  said,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I feel  it is  important  that we, the Members of this 
<br/></span><span>august Parliament, are fully aware of our roles as representatives of the people of this nation. We are 
<br/></span><span>not here for ourselves.  Previously, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a tendency by Members of Parliament 
<br/>to focus on issues of adversarial politics rather than examining matters that are in the public interest 
<br/>and affect us as a nation. This is unfortunate and must change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my team and I will be working 
<br/>hard. We will ask ourselves tough questions before critiquing Government. We will aspire to work 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with the Government to advance the interests of all Fijians. We will give credit where its due, and 
<br/>strongly criticize where necessary and Members of the other side of Parliament should expect that to 
<br/>commence in our deliberations over the next few days. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will ask Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we work together on the things that unite us 
<br/>as  a  nation  rather  than  those  that  divide.  But  how  much  we  can  do  and  how  much  our  political 
<br/>conversation evolves for the better will be dependent on two key issues, which are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the quantity and quality of information that is shared by the Government both in Parliament 
<br/>and in public spaces; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>by their willingness to listen to and implement the alternative ideas that we may suggest. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the essence of His Excellency’s plea for members of this august 
<br/>Parliament to “…work across the aisle, find common ground on critical issues facing our nation and 
<br/>put the people first…”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow  me,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  speak  on  a  number  of  key  issues  that  were  raised  by  His 
<br/>Excellency in his Address.  We will agree that as a nation viewed from our historical past, we have 
<br/>had many wasted decades.  Members of this august Parliament as current leaders of this nation, it is 
<br/>our duty together with our community leaders and our economic and intellectual elites to look several 
<br/>decades ahead and map out what we would like our future to be, what our national needs are, the 
<br/>challenges and opportunities that will provide us the strategic perspective to guide our nation moving 
<br/>forward. This should be the impetus for our new National Development Plan (NDP). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to only limit our thinking to our four-year term in office is detrimental to 
<br/>our progress as a nation.  In any case, I must thank the Government for having taken the initiative to 
<br/>develop a new National Development Plan, whether this was totally necessary considering that one 
<br/>had been in existence is beyond me.  Regardless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my hope that the new National 
<br/>Development Plan espouses the high values advocated by His Excellency in his Address and which 
<br/>I fully endorse.  This includes the need for Parliament to continue to listen to the voices of the people 
<br/>and that we all aspire to achieve a common goal of a peaceful, progressive and prosperous nation and 
<br/>adhere  to  the  basic  values  of  hard  work,  respect  for  our  elders,  family  units  and  for  other  ethnic 
<br/>communities.    Those  values,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  are  the  requisites  for  a  peaceful,  progressive, 
<br/>prosperous and inclusive Fiji.  It is thus our responsibility to ask ourselves regularly if we should 
<br/>adhere to these values both in and outside of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  same  token,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  grateful  for  the  Government’s  commitment  to 
<br/></span><span>accountability, transparency and the tenets of good governance.  These are noble commitments but 
<br/>they must be practiced and demonstrated to mean anything to the people of this nation.  The actions 
<br/>must match the rhetoric.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would, therefore, urge the Government to continue to respect the guidelines and procedures 
<br/>for the appointment to key positions in Government including leadership in governments statutory 
<br/>organisations and the appointment to our foreign missions.  By flouting these processes, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir,  we  are  denying  career  civil  servants  and  deserving  candidates  the  opportunity  to  utilise their 
<br/></span><span>experience and expertise to the fullest of their abilities in the process of nation building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  be  able  to  transform  our  civil  service  into  an  effective  and  efficient 
<br/>administrative organ, the Government will need to ensure that duly qualified individuals are recruited 
<br/>to key positions within the Service and the way to do that is to follow the established recruitment 
<br/></span><span>process.    Similarly,  appointments  to  Government  Boards  and  Statutory  Organisation  must  follow 
<br/></span><span>suit.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to register my concern at this point in how political allies of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the current Government are being appointed … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B.SERUIRATU.- … to represent Fiji at our foreign missions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  This  was  an  observation  raised  as  an  Achilles  heel  with  past 
<br/>administrations  where  individuals  with  very  little  experience  were  appointed  to  such  important 
<br/>positions. It does not augur well for our development as a nation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I call on the 
<br/>honourable  Prime  Minister  as  Minister  responsible  as  well  for  Foreign  Affairs  to  reconsider  the 
<br/>process of the appointment of our Heads of Overseas Missions. Having the wrong people in positions 
<br/>of leadership in Government agencies and in our foreign missions leads to wastage of resources, lost 
<br/>opportunities, a disgruntled workforce and ultimately an inefficient and chaotic work culture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.-  Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to acknowledge the Government 
<br/>for the Legislative and Policy Reform Agenda that they have in place, but I would suggest that they 
<br/>ensure that due consultations are carried out to ensure that all Government Legislative and Policy 
<br/>Frameworks are inclusive and have considered the views of all our communities.  However, perhaps 
<br/>more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the need to accelerate development, and again I call on the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance to pay particular attention in areas where they are most needed.  The 
<br/>Government is of the view that they are unable to do this due to our current debt levels, but that to 
<br/>me is rather clumsy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National  progress  is  dependent  on  the  ability  of  Government  to  take  risks  and  invest  in 
<br/>development and at the same time investigate ways to broaden its revenue and economic base to be 
<br/>able to mitigate those risks.  That takes critical and innovative thinking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  tourism  has  rebounded  quickly  following  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opening up of international travel – thank you FijiFirst.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Projections are that tourist arrivals will surpass a million this year. 
<br/>This is welcome news for our economy.   The rebound in tourist arrivals may be credited to hotel 
<br/>operators being able to ramp up capacity quickly, but accommodation  capacity has its limits, and 
<br/>investments  in  new  capacity  is  low.    Consequently,  tourism  is  slowly  losing  competitiveness  as 
<br/>cheaper alternative destinations such as Bali and Phuket come online.  An industry contributing about 
<br/>40 percent of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) must be supported. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In his Address, Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President has emphasized a culture of 
<br/>financial responsibility for individuals and households which the honourable Prime Minister has also 
<br/>spoken  on.  The  same  responsibility  should  be  expanded  to  managing  public  finances  by  our 
<br/>Government.   A  stronger  focus  on  reducing  waste,  minimising  duplication  and  eliminating  “red 
<br/>tapism”  for  the  expansion  of  the  private  enterprise  is  critical  to  fostering  growth  in  our  national 
<br/>economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>21 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking on promoting a culture of financial responsibility for individuals and households, I 
<br/>would suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government puts in place mechanisms to support our people 
<br/>and families in the management of finances received through personal remittances from families and 
<br/>friends overseas which had risen to a staggering $1 billion by 2022.  Of course, how those funds are 
<br/>utilized is the choice of the recipient, but the Government has a responsibility to ensure that they are 
<br/>duly informed before they make those choices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the local front, His Excellency the President correctly points to the rich 
<br/>natural  resources  we  have  at  our  disposal.    The  question  is  when  and  how  we  can  utilize  those 
<br/>resources to maximum effect so as to support sustainable growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As an agriculturalist, Mr. Speaker, Sir, now is the time for Government to explore new ways 
<br/>of promoting and boosting agricultural production to support both our rural and national economies, 
<br/>whilst ensuring food security to local consumers. I am aware that a particular Government company 
<br/>is  sourcing  raw  agricultural  resources  from  overseas  to  process,  promote,  and  distribute  as  local 
<br/>products.    Our  hotels  continue  to  import  agricultural  products  to  meet  their  demands  in  terms  of 
<br/>volume and quality. These are not matters of choice. We simply do not have the ability and capacity 
<br/>to supply those markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government needs to critically look at innovative ways to address this 
<br/>issue and I call on the honourable Minister for Agriculture to take the lead in this regard.  Export 
<br/>markets are critical to our economy. In efforts to meet export market demands for </span><span>dalo</span><span> and </span><span>tavioka, 
<br/></span><span>in particular, the negative impacts are felt locally with the exponential rise in local market prices due 
<br/>to shortage of supplies.  This is a trend that will continue to persist if no action is taken to address 
<br/>low agricultural production. I see the need for investments in capacity building and mechanisation 
<br/>so that we can acquire the necessary skills, capabilities and specialised needs to grow our agricultural 
<br/>industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  as  important,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fisheries  and  the  Forestry  Sectors  ought  to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>developed so that economic opportunities in these areas are maximised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar supported the Fijian economy from colonisation through to independence.  However, 
<br/>the industry has relied on price support for survival more recently, but the sugar industry must be 
<br/>helped to transition to a financially sustainable state over the next decade. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Relative to these areas, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government needs a vibrant Trade Policy to provide 
<br/></span><span>an enabling environment and details key policy objectives and strategies that positions Fiji as a trade 
<br/></span><span>hub within the Pacific region and recognises trade as a key driver for growth and development. The 
<br/>Trade  Policy  should  aim  to  enhance  diversification  by  placing  emphasis  on  new  products  and 
<br/>markets. We should seek to gain  competitive advantages through incentives and other benefits to 
<br/>have the edge over the other players in an open  
<br/>market environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful that Government saw it fit to develop a White Paper on our 
<br/>Foreign Policy. Our Foreign Policy must place primacy on Fiji’s interests while seeking long term 
<br/></span><span>mutual cooperation in our bilateral and multilateral engagements.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>        While I am aware that Government is also conducting the National Defence Review, we are 
<br/>strongly  proposing  that  in  order  to  make  sensible  decisions  about  the  defence  and  security 
<br/>capabilities, it is essential to start with a hard-headed reappraisal of our foreign policy and security 
<br/>objectives, and the roles we wish our  country to play, as  well as the risks that we  face in  a  fast-
<br/>changing world. The two must work in tandem, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="13">Page 13</a></div>
<div><span>22 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fail to understand the reasoning behind the concept of Ocean of Peace 
<br/>being championed by our honourable Prime Minister aimed at safeguarding our waters and resources 
<br/>as a region. The concept would appear to overlap with existing regional commitments such as the 
<br/></span><span>2018 Boe Declaration</span><span> and the Blue Pacific 2050 strategy that recognises the increasingly uncertain 
<br/>and volatile security landscape in the region, and which has already envisioned a Pacific Region of 
<br/>Peace.   I call on the honourable Prime Minister to clarify the difference between the concepts of the 
<br/>Ocean of Peace and the Pacific Region of Peace. I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister that he place more emphasis on the more pressing issue of Climate Change rather 
<br/>than coining new concepts which may mean very little to us as a nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all agree that the most critical phenomena threatening peace in our region 
<br/>is Climate Change. The well-being of the Pacific region is threatened by the intensification of the 
<br/>climate  crisis.  As  demonstrated  during  the  review  of  global  performance  to  deliver  against  the 
<br/>ambition  of  the  Paris  Agreement  at  COP28,  efforts  to  reduce  emissions  and  the  consistency  of 
<br/>political commitments with these objectives have continued to fall short of what is needed to avert 
<br/>major consequences for vulnerable countries. We must take action to scale up our domestic response 
<br/>to existing impacts while accelerating our progress to build the resilience needed to address future 
<br/>impacts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  peace  is  fundamental  to  human  existence  and  welfare.  A  Truth  and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission has been mooted. I would beg to offer an alternative approach which can 
<br/>be mainstreamed into our everyday life thus creating better understanding and cohesion between our 
<br/>communities. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that Government consider establishing a comprehensive, 
<br/>ongoing  and  well-resourced  civic  education  system  at  different  levels  of  the  community  to  raise 
<br/>awareness  on  democracy  and  governance,  multi-culturalism,  peace  building  and  law  and  order 
<br/>amongst other things. I would envisage the benefits emanating out of such a system as being more 
<br/>effective and more far reaching than those coming out of the touted Commission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I wish to  end with these three  remarks.   Firstly,  with  all the 
<br/>commitments  being  made  by  the  Government  through  His  Excellency  the  President’s  Address,  the 
<br/>bottom line is, there is an urgent need to return our nation’s finance to a sustainable footing.  That must 
<br/>be a priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  policies  and  programmes  of  Government  must  result  in 
<br/>tangible positive outcomes that address the basic needs and alleviate the sufferings of the grassroots 
<br/>of our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, the people are calling for good governance, transparency and for inclusiveness in the 
<br/>governance processes to eliminate dubious and corrupt  practices that result in  the wastage of our 
<br/>already scarce resources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are the challenges we have on our hand, and which falls squarely on the shoulders of 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister as the Leader of the Coalition Government.   I call on the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to show leadership and find the answers to these challenges.  Everything rises and 
<br/>falls on leadership.  May God bless our beloved Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  after  thanking  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition and the honourable Prime Minister for his motion, I now intend to adjourn Parliament for 
<br/>morning tea.  We will resume when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.55 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to extend my greetings to 
<br/>the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Ministers, 
<br/>Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished guests, members of the 
<br/>public sitting in the gallery and all those tuning in live on the Parliament’s </span><span>Facebook</span><span> channel; </span><span>ni sa 
<br/>yadra vinaka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  speak  in  response  to  the 
<br/>Opening Address by His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, </span><span>na Turaga na Tui Macuata</span><span>, 
<br/>Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, at the 2024 Session of Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would,  firstly,  like  to  thank  the  Almighty  God  for  His  guidance  and 
<br/>direction for the past 14 months.  To my family; my husband Aminiasi; to my children  - Sanaila, 
<br/>Sakiusa, Alowesi, Ruth, Vasiti and Makereta; to my parents, my extended family from Cakaudrove, 
<br/>Bua and Kadavu; and my relatives and my friends; </span><span>vei kemuni kece na kaiciqu, lavo kai, ako kai, 
<br/>lovara kai; vinaka vakalevu na nomuni vei’okoni vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  convene  for  the  commencement  of  this  new  legislative  session,  we  are  not  merely 
<br/>witnesses to a procedural formality, but stewards of our nation’s destiny.  The decisions we make, 
<br/>the policies we craft, and the debates we are engaged in will reverberate through the corridors of 
<br/>history, shaping the course of our future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the State Opening of Parliament for the 2024 Session has signalled the dawn 
<br/>of  a  new  era,  one  defined  by  resolute  commitment  to  unity,  democracy  and  progress.    We  are 
<br/>reminded  about  the  paramount  importance  of  representing  diverse  voices  and  upholding  the 
<br/>principles of democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nation as richly diverse as ours, the pursuit of unity amidst diversity 
<br/>stands as an indispensable pillar of national progress.  As His Excellency has eloquently echoed, the 
<br/>need  of  fostering  harmony  among  Fiji’s  ethnic  communities  and  cultivating  a  spirit  of  respectful 
<br/>discourse and cooperation among  our leaders, indeed, embracing  our collective diversity not  as a 
<br/>source of division but as a well-spring of strength which is paramount to our journey towards a more 
<br/>cohesive and prosperous society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bedrock of any vibrant democracy lies in representing diverse voices 
<br/></span><span>and upholding the principles of democratic governance.   It  is  not  enough  to  pay lipservice to  the 
<br/></span><span>notion of democracy but rather, we must actively strive to ensure that every citizen of Fiji is not only 
<br/>heard but is also genuinely represented in this Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  I  proudly  stand  in  this  Parliament  today  and  having  just 
<br/>commemorated International Women’s Day, it is my hope that I serve and inspire more women with 
<br/>the  same  ability  and  the  same  passion  to  serve.  The  local  elections  being  brought  back  by  the 
<br/>Coalition Government can very well be the pathway to more women participating in our democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the heart of our collective aspirations lies the vision of an inclusive society 
<br/></span><span>where every Fijian irrespective of their background or circumstance has the opportunity to thrive and 
<br/>contribute meaningfully to our nation’s progress.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusive  development  calls  for  securing  social  progress  and  resilience  for  all  people  and 
<br/>ensuring  that  it  will  be  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  I,  therefore,  fully  support  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s agenda efforts on the formulation of the National Development Plan which is being

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consulted at the grassroots level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tourism  Sector stands as  linchpin  of our national  economic vitality, 
<br/>serving  as  a  beacon  of  opportunity  and  prosperity  for  countless  Fijians.    As  we  reflect  on  the 
<br/>remarkable growth and resilience of this pivotal industry, it is incumbent upon us to redouble our 
<br/>efforts to ensure its continued success and sustainability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  statistics  speak  volumes.    In  January  2024  alone,  Fiji  welcomed  70,324  international 
<br/>visitors, marking a 104 percent increase from the previous year.  Such robust growth not only bolster 
<br/>our  national  GDP  but  also  creates  myriad  of  opportunities  for  employment  and  entrepreneurship 
<br/>across our islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this year, we expect 1 million visitors for the first time.  As His Excellency 
<br/>noted, more visitors mean more demand for products and services and also means more revenue for 
<br/>our economy and more Fijians with jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the hardworking staff of the Ministry of Tourism and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Aviation for their hard work and dedication for the past 14 months. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  This  year,  the  Ministry  launched  the  National  Sustainable  Tourism 
<br/>Framework.  It calls for tourism that is sustainable, resilient and inclusive. It will guide the sector in 
<br/>accelerating  a  prosperous  visitor  economy,  ensure  communities  are  empowered  and  part  of  that, 
<br/>prosperity. It calls for greater attention to our diverse cultures and safeguarding our greatest asset, 
<br/>which is our pristine environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know and have seen that when tourism does well, so does other sectors. 
<br/>Next week, we will be hosting the first of three ‘Farm to Fork’ workshops in partnership with the 
<br/>United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization.    The  initiative  essentially  aims  to  familiarise 
<br/>hotel key decision-makings with the produce that are available locally, including fruits, vegetables, 
<br/>dairy products, meat and sea food, and introduce farmers to key decision-makings of the hotel and 
<br/>explore opportunities to enhance utilization and procurement, as well as managing expectations of 
<br/>chefs, food and beverages managers and procurement officers. In this way, the </span><span>dalo</span><span> farmer, as His 
<br/>Excellency had mentioned, they too can secure markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation signed a Memorandum 
<br/>of  Understanding  with  the  National  Trust  of  Fiji  to  promote  more  linkages  to  creative  arts  and 
<br/></span><span>heritage.  Most recently, we have supported the installation of heritage panels around Suva City.  We 
<br/></span><span>will continue to support such synergies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  made  strong  commitments  in  support  of 
<br/>regionalism.  I  am  pleased  to  share  that  in  May,  we  will  be  hosting  the  South  Pacific  Tourism 
<br/>Exchange  (SPTE),  along  the  margins  of  the  Pacific  Tourism  Organization  Board  of  Directors 
<br/>Meeting. This is the first time the SPTE is being held in the Pacific, making Fiji the first in the Pacific 
<br/>to host the event. The SPTE was previously held only in Australia and New Zealand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  last  year,  the  financing  of  the  Fiji  Tourism  Development  Programme  in 
<br/></span><span>Vanua Levu was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors. This is the first of 
<br/>three projects planned over 10 years to help deliver its vision for more sustainable, inclusive and 
<br/>resilient tourism in our second largest island.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  phase  of  the  programme  led  by  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  focuses  on  bolstering 
<br/>tourism in Vanua Levu, including Taveuni, by improving access to and climate resilience of essential

<br/>Savusavu  domestic  Airports,  as  well  as  an  upgrade  to  the  95-kilometre  road  connecting  the  two 
<br/>towns. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Aviation, I am pleased to share a number of legislative reforms we aim 
<br/>to deliver this year, beginning with Fiji’s First Civil Aviation Master Plan.  We will also be reviewing 
<br/>our National Draft Aviation Policy to ensure it meets current needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, airport infrastructure development is equally important to support and sustain 
<br/>our economic development. Today, Fiji Airports manages approximately 6 million square kilometres 
<br/>of airspace with two international airports.  Greening of Fiji Airports is one of the key strategies for 
<br/>2024 and beyond.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  solarisation  and  reduction  of  carbon  emission  activities  include  purchase  of 
<br/>electronic vehicles and changing all the external lights to solar lights and setting up a 3.5 megawatts 
<br/>Nadi Airport Solar System as well.  More initiatives are being looked at by the Sustainable Team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digital  transformation  is  an  important  strategy  as  we  move  towards  contactless  passenger 
<br/>services - the use of Artificial Intelligence and the use of Advance Aviation Technology to achieve 
<br/>efficiency and enhance safety security and passenger experience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Construction  works  at  Labasa  Airport  terminal  will  commence  mid-2024  at  the  current 
<br/>location of the terminal building and more land around the airport is required for future expansion 
<br/>for  a  larger  passenger  terminal  in  future.  This  has  been  identified  in  the  Na  Vualiku  Tourism 
<br/>Development Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Fiji Airports will be embarking on the development of its 10 Year Strategic Plan 
<br/>of 2025 to 2034 in the next few months.  The Plan will inform its three-year rolling Business Plan 
<br/>and Capex Plan aligned to its Master Plan. The future of Fiji Airports remains promising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  part  of  the  Nadi  Airport  Master  Plan,  Fiji  Airports  is  in  the  process  of 
<br/>acquiring a piece of land to access a new cargo facility on the North-West precinct of Nadi Airport.  
<br/>The Sales and Purchase Agreement has been signed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are plans for a transit hotel, retail and commercial space, and this will be progress as 
<br/>part  of  the  landslide  development  at  the  Nadi  Airport.    The  tender  is  out  for  the  Master  Plan 
<br/></span><span>consultancy for the landslide at Nadi and Nausori.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 25 percent of our total income comes from commercial and helps fund our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>core airport operations and infrastructure which is quite costly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  Airports  has  invested  around  $7  million  in  purchasing  three  new  Airport  Rescue 
<br/>Firefighting Trucks for Nadi International Airport. One has arrived in December 2023, and two are 
<br/>expected in July 2024. The works are underway for the replacement of the fire trucks in Nausori, 
<br/>Labasa, Savusavu and Matei, and three new Water Rescue Boats for Nadi by 2026.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, five new aerobridges, costing a couple of million dollars are being procured 
<br/>and these will become available in 2025 because of the length of time it takes to manufacture them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Nausori and 13 other outer island airports are owned by the Government of Fiji 
<br/>and managed by Fiji Airports without any funding from the Government. It costs approximately $15 
<br/>million in 2023 to operate these airports.  Income derived from these airports account for only 25

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent of the annual operating cost. This is apart from the capital expenditures spent by Fiji Airports 
<br/>to upgrade some of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as we stand on the height of a new chapter in Fiji’s history, let us reaffirm our 
<br/>unwavering commitment to fostering growth, enhancing connectivity and championing sustainable 
<br/>practices in the tourism and civil aviation sectors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us embrace the opportunities that lie before us with courage and conviction, mindful of 
<br/>the trust placed in us by the people of Fiji. Together, let us forge a path towards a brighter and more 
<br/>prosperous future for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in closing, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for your 
<br/>dedication, your service and your unwavering commitment to the ideals of democracy and progress.  
<br/>May we continue to work tirelessly in the service of our nation and its people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God bless us all, may God bless Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Opposition Members and my fellow 
<br/>Fijians; </span><span>ni sa bula re, namaste, as-salamu alaykum</span><span>, and a very good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Speech of His Excellency the President has raised some very pertinent 
<br/>issues.  And like me, other Fijians have expressed the need for many of these issues to be highlighted 
<br/>and voiced out in this august Chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  a  span  for  over  14  months,  this  dysfunctional  and  delusional  Coalition 
<br/>Government has not only failed to fulfil the promises they had made before the Election.  They are 
<br/>the very reason why this country is suffering an economic meltdown.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  lack  of  investment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  and  continued  brain-drain  of  thousands  of  our 
<br/>skilled  Fijians  is  a  sign  that  Fijians  no  longer  have  confidence  nor  the  trust  in  this  Collation 
<br/>Government which twisted the truth just to get into power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The Coalition Government was given a very  stable economy and we must 
<br/></span><span>give thanks to the former Prime Minister, Mr. Bainimarama, and the former Minister for Economy, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Khaiyum.  but, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what has happened now is, we can that this Government is 
<br/>unable to cope with the new world challenges and the demands of the Fijian people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is evident that they lack the practical skills needed to run an economy and a country as a 
<br/>government, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Let us face it - our people are suffering.  Among other things, the 
<br/>high cost of living has caused many young Fijians and their parents to re-evaluate their livelihoods 
<br/>and their futures, especially in our rural communities, like Taveuni and Cakaudrove. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The elephant in the room, so to speak, Mr. Speaker, is the mishandling and mismanagement 
<br/></span><span>of the economy by the honourable Minister for Finance, who is more of an academic than someone 
<br/>with practical experience and knowledge. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Minister for Finance who requires committees to determine 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>27 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic policies and then give tax breaks to multinational companies, like Fiji Water, while our 
<br/>local companies suffer.  Forget about sound economic policies when one lacks common sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before the 2022 Elections, there was a slogan by the National Federation Party 
<br/>(NFP) and I clearly remember.  The slogan was, ‘time for a change’.  All those NFP politicians were 
<br/>going on and saying, “It’s time for a change.  It’s time for a change”.   Boy-oh-boy, Mr. Speaker, the 
<br/>change people got was brutal. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many Fijians are left wondering why they supported a political party 
<br/>like NFP, that did nothing to reduce the prices of goods but, in fact, added more burden to the people 
<br/>who have children in schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they claim to provide monetary relief with the ‘Back to School’ assistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and mind you, the truth is that that initiative was started by the FijiFirst Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  But  then,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  they  take  more  from  Fijians,  like  this 
<br/>Government’s fake promise  of free education when, in fact, primary and secondary schools are now 
<br/>charging levies, adding more burden to parents and further straining our economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can clearly see that when responding to issues raised by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Movement, the honourable Minister for Finance starts making personal attacks and unprofessional 
<br/>remarks  as  opposed  to  focusing  on  the  issues  raised.    They  seem  to  have  forgotten  some  basic 
<br/>economics, Sir, but let me teach them some economics today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Higher taxes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, result in an economic slowdown. The social security nets and 
<br/>the automatic stabilizers have not been rolled out efficiently and effectively to mitigate the impact of 
<br/>higher taxes. There are more potholes on our streets and lawlessness has increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Sit down! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There is a Point of Order  being raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIMKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order 60 on relevance.  The 
<br/></span><span>motion was to discuss the most gracious Speech by His Excellency the President.  He is meandering 
<br/>everywhere.  He is trying to follow his leader when he was in Government, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, if you want to stand on a Point of Order, I would 
<br/>implore you, please, quote the Standing Orders, so it will help me and the Secretariat to follow the 
<br/>concern raised by mentioning the Point of Order.  In future. if one raises a Point of Order and does 
<br/>not, kind of, clearly make out the Point of Order that he/she is highlighting, then I will ask you to 
<br/>resume your seat for the speaker to continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lal, the floor is yours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Acting Commissioner of Police cannot even manage his Police Officers 
<br/>who have been committing crimes.  How can he be expected to efficiently manage crime prevention

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in our communities?  Yet, the picture being portrayed to the rest of us is that we are a safe country.  
<br/>No, we are not, Sir.  I, myself, do not feel safe.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government harps about democracy, human rights, safeguarding the 
<br/>vulnerable such as women and children, yet they see it proper to endorse genocide being carried out 
<br/>by Israel on the Palestinian people, including the mass killing of innocent lives, aid workers, hospital 
<br/>workers and thousands of women and children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have a Coalition Government which is selective in its application on 
<br/>policies on fundamental human rights.  We have a coalition Government which lacks humanity.  The 
<br/>NFP was once known for its unity, equality and fulfillment of promises on policies.  Their founding 
<br/>members spoke out whenever a wrong was done and fought for the rights of everyone.  The silence 
<br/>on the part of NFP on the issue of Fiji supporting genocide speaks volumes of how low this once a 
<br/>great Party has become under its current leadership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is,  therefore,  no  surprise  why  some  of  their  own 
<br/>supporters have turned against them.  The Coalition Government has become a joke to the outside 
<br/>world and in the international arena.  We have Ministers who are tasked to protect and look after the 
<br/>welfare of Fijians, they are being disciplined for God knows what, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  But I am sure 
<br/>many Fijians are reading the media articles. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have received complaints daily about the deteriorating road conditions 
<br/>and potholes, but it seems the honourable Minister concerned does not care and is too busy opening 
<br/>projects that were initiated by the FijiFirst Government in the whole of last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a recent issue brought to the attention of the FijiFirst’s Opposition Chambers by residents 
<br/>of Muaniweni, some residents complained that they had no bus service.  According to the residents, 
<br/>the bus company said they will not operate because the road conditions are worse than ever before, 
<br/>thus depriving residents’ access to much needed transportation.  Is this the change promised by the 
<br/>Coalition Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Meanwhile,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  has  proven  to  be  a  colossal 
<br/>waste of taxpayers’ money.  Over the past year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has been a glaring absence 
<br/>of any meaningful plans, actions, policies or direction from his office.  Frankly speaking, Sir, his 
<br/></span><span>performance has been nothing short of pathetic.  There was no need to establish such a Ministry to 
<br/></span><span>begin with, neither is the Ministry performing, nor its Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we have the sugar industry issues.  Perhaps, if the honourable Minister spent more time 
<br/>in Fiji with our farmers addressing their concerns rather than overseas, then he may be making some 
<br/>meaningful contributions in that area too.  But sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister has 
<br/>also failed to perform his duties yet retains one of the most crucial portfolios which impact the lives 
<br/>of our hardworking farmers and their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But to also put a spotlight on NFP again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fijians demand an explanation 
<br/></span><span>from the NFP leader as to why his Party Manifesto is not uploaded on their Party’s website.  The 
<br/>2022  Manifesto  is  a  crucial  document  that  outlines  the  Party’s  vision,  goals  and  promises  to  the 
<br/>people.  It is essential for transparency and accountability in governance.  I do not know the reason 
<br/>behind  this  omission,  Sir.    When  can  we  expect  to  see  this  Manifesto  made  available  for  public 
<br/>scrutiny and evaluation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>29 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  we  have  seen  with  this  incompetent  Coalition  Government  is  the 
<br/>improper use of authority or perhaps, even bribery involved in the windmill project case.  However, 
<br/>Sir, we do understand that an investigation is underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note that the Permanent Secretary Fisheries has been terminated by the Public Service 
<br/>Commission (PSC) but the Chief Executive Officer of the Fiji Sports Council, who had also signed 
<br/>has not been suspended by its line Minister.  Where is the accountability? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we do understand that this agreement was also endorsed by two Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, namely the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Sports.  But we want to know from the honourable Prime Minister why has there  not been any 
<br/>announcement on any investigations on those Ministers and why is it taking such a long time.  If 
<br/>there is any investigation afoot and if persons are found culpable, then they must be terminated and 
<br/>must be referred to FICAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there is a big question here, is someone else behind those Ministers?  Something is 
<br/>very fishy, and God knows what, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  However, on another note, I would like to raise, 
<br/>again,  on  the  basis  of  transparency  and  specifically  a  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  
<br/>Agriculture, is it alright for a Minister to use Government vessel to transport his family and father’s 
<br/>ashes to the Lau Group? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  same  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  this  Coalition  Government  gets  hammered  by  the 
<br/>powerful Opposition, a question in Parliament was raised by the honourable Rinesh Sharma last year 
<br/>with respect to another Minister, namely the honourable Minister for Fisheries and his involvement 
<br/>in the issuance of licence to his own company. The question is still unanswered, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>Honourable Prime Minister, is this what transparency looks like? God knows when this question will 
<br/>be answered. This is going to be the legacy of this Coalition Government. They have talked a big 
<br/>game when they were in Opposition but now it is time to walk the talk. They must continue to protect 
<br/>the 2013 Constitution and continue to follow this important document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must stand for what is right and stand for justice, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Equally concerning is 
<br/>the decline in youth-focused policies by the Coalition Government. It appears that the ship of our 
<br/>nation is sailing without a compass, lacking a clear direction for Fiji’s youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lack of new initiatives and projects means a dearth of employment opportunities for our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>young people, further giving the challenges they face in building a prosperous future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very emotional, but I am not alone in saying this, that vast majority of 
<br/>Fijians do not  support the Coalition Government’s support of  Israel  in the Palestinian-Israel  war. 
<br/>Why is this Government more concerned about supporting Israel and genocide, and not support what 
<br/>is right? Where is the humanity in all these coalition partners?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regardless of our religion, I know for a fact that all of us Fijians are deeply religious people, 
<br/>and we remain deeply connected with each other. If we see are neighbour in trouble or in a problem, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we help out  – we do not  see what  religion  they  are from  or what  religion  they 
<br/></span><span>practice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, God fearing and God loving people will not support the killing of innocent 
<br/>people. God does not teach us to kill innocent people.  If this Government supports genocide, then 
<br/>they lack compassion, love, and above all, they lack humanity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, as we stand before this august Chamber, we are reminded of the weight of the

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibility  of  the  people  we  serve.  Today,  we  have  witnessed  not  only  the  unravelling  of  our 
<br/>economy, but also the betrayal of trust bestowed upon us by our fellow Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government’s  incompetence  has  led  us  down  this  path  of  despair,  where  families 
<br/>struggle, businesses falter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and dreams are shattered.  But let us be clear, we are not 
<br/>here to simply point fingers or assign blame. We are here to demand accountability, to uphold the 
<br/>values of integrity and justice, and to fight tirelessly for the welfare of our nation and our Fijians, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  representatives  of  the  people,  it  is  our  duty  to  hold  those  in  power  and,  especially  the 
<br/>Coalition Government accountable, to speak the truth to authority, and to advocate fiercely for the 
<br/>betterment of our society. We will not falter, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will not yield, and we will not rest 
<br/>until justice is served and the voices of the people are heard.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Lal for that very, very vicious contribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, may I remind you that the motion was delivered by the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, based on His Excellency’s Speech and as such, please, confine your speech to those 
<br/>two issues - the Speech by His Excellency and the motion by the honourable Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, since I have allowed honourable Lal to go on his spree of vilifying everyone that has 
<br/>come across him, including NFP, the issue of Israel on the Gaza, et cetera, as such, I hope you will 
<br/>take it on because I will now allow for responses to come from the other side of  Parliament based 
<br/>on what I have allowed to continue from the speech by honourable Lal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament; I rise in this august Parliament to lend my support to the motion by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech during the Opening of 
<br/>the 2024 Parliamentary year on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency’s  reminder  about  our  responsibilities  as  elected 
<br/>representatives within a democratic framework is timely.  It is a challenge to us all, the Members of 
<br/>this  august  Parliament,  as  well  as  all  of  us  who  call  Fiji,  home,  that  we  all  grasp  the  paramount 
<br/>importance of the duty assigned to us in terms of upholding the principles of democracy and humanity 
<br/></span><span>with unwavering determination and resolve. By embracing inclusivity and unity, we can truly fulfil 
<br/></span><span>the aspirations of our people and we can then begin to build a better future for generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in December of last year, the Coalition Government marked its one year in 
<br/>office.  I  can  admit  that  the  initial  12  months  presented  significant  challenges  for  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government. However, under the steadfast and decisive leadership of the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>and the able assistance of our honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, I am pleased to acknowledge the 
<br/>substantial progress we have achieved together as a nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we have slowly progressed as a nation in the past 14 months, I am 
<br/></span><span>deeply  dismayed that some of us have sadly  found it necessary to  use the tactics of division  and 
<br/>disunity, employing disinformation for political mileage. Regrettably, some elected representatives 
<br/>have even resorted to lies and propaganda to mislead the general public. I heard that honourable Lal, 
<br/>in his previous contribution, has contradicted his leader in everything that he said regarding the need 
<br/>to work together in building up our nation.  If I were the honourable Leader of the  Opposition,  I 
<br/>would be weary of the saying, “something is rotten in the state of Denmark”.  There are some talk of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>instigation in his ranks so it would be best, Sir, for him to start investigation in that direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that we can all take heed of His Excellency’s most gracious advice and rise above such 
<br/>pettiness, to reach across the political divide in bipartisan cooperation so that we can work together 
<br/>in the noble cause of nation building. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  coming  into  Government  came  with  its  challenges;  there  were  a  lot  of 
<br/>expectations to deliver. However, on the back of a post COVID-19 economy and inheriting extremely 
<br/>high debt levels, it was an uphill battle for the Coalition Government. Whilst we acknowledge that 
<br/>meeting  every  expectation  within  the  first  year  of  office  would  not  have  been  feasible  for  any 
<br/>government, I would like to reassure the general public, particularly those in our rural and maritime 
<br/>communities,  of  our  unwavering  commitment  to  their  wellbeing.  We  remain  resolute  in  our 
<br/>dedication to our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial for the general public to understand that the People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government remains diligently committed and we are, all of us, working very hard to ensure a safe, 
<br/>secure and prosperous Fiji for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent on specific goods and services in 
<br/>the last year, we are pleased to observe a decline in the inflation rate from 5.1 percent at the end of 
<br/>last  year  to  3.6  percent  in  January  2024.  This  indicates  that  the  rate  of  the  increase  in  prices  has 
<br/>slowed, compared to December last year. We also made sure that we kept the zero rate on 21 basic 
<br/>food items and added prescribed medicines to that list. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  appreciate  the  insightful  overview  of  our  economy's  trajectory  and  the 
<br/>projections  shared  by  His  Excellency  the  President  regarding  our  anticipated  growth  rates  for  the 
<br/>upcoming years. While the road ahead may be fraught with challenges, it is incumbent upon us to adopt 
<br/>a nuanced approach integrates fiscal prudence with strategic investments aimed at fostering inclusive and 
<br/>sustainable  growth.  I  am  confident  that  with  prudent  fiscal  management,  strategic  investments,  and 
<br/>collective resolve, we can steer through these uncertain times and emerge stronger and more resilient as 
<br/>a nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the hard work and effort put in by the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>through the Strategic Planning Office in the formulation of Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP). 
<br/>The NDP will provide a visionary roadmap for an inclusive integrated effort towards nation building.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I note with appreciation the multiple consultations that are currently underway to ensure that 
<br/></span><span>the voices of diverse stakeholders including communities, civil society organizations, private sector 
<br/>entities and development partners are heard and integrated into the planning process.  This inclusivity 
<br/>fosters  a  sense  of  ownership  and  collective  responsibility  towards  national  development  goals, 
<br/>promoting social cohesion and resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that any government agency also re-strategises and aligns 
<br/>its course to the new dynamics in anticipation of the NDP that will be launched soon.  It is with this 
<br/>regard that my Ministry is also reviewing its 10 Year Strategic Plan 2021-2031.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given our role in the rural and maritime areas, we are also mindful of the upcoming review 
<br/>of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Administration, the re-establishment of the Great Council of Chiefs and the various 
<br/>statutes that govern the </span><span>modus operandi </span><span>of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> communities, not forgetting other Fijian rural 
<br/>communities which comprise the majority of the population that my Ministry serves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  significant  achievements  have  been  reached  in  the  last  two  years  of 
<br/>implementing our Strategic Development Plan. The five Strategic Priority Areas outlined in this Plan

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>focussed  on  supporting  our  vision  of  sustainable  and  inclusive  development  for  productive  and 
<br/>resilient  rural  communities  in  Fiji.  These  broad  strategic  focussed  areas  reflect  the  major 
<br/>development  priorities  and  needs  of  our  rural  and  maritime  communities.  These  development 
<br/>priorities  are  expected  to  remain  with  minimal  revision  but  with  the  inclusion  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government’s vision and priorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the framing of the four core roles of the Ministry, in itself, strategically 
<br/>reaffirms and empowers the Ministry’s staff to live up to what the role describes them to be.  The 
<br/>four core roles for my Ministry are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Development Facilitator and Coordinator; 
<br/>Relationship Manager; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Knowledge Broker; and  
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Risk Reduction, Response and Recovery Coordinator.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to provide some remarks in response to climate change and 
<br/>disaster management.  Fiji is ranked as the 12</span><span>th</span><span> most hazardous country in the world by World Risk 
<br/>Index on the basis of high exposure to natural hazards and relatively low coping capacity.  In this 
<br/>current  cyclone season,  we have been fortunate  not  to  experience the impact  of  a major cyclone.  
<br/>However, we have observed that low depressions bring substantial rainfall leading to flooding and 
<br/>landslides.  It is crucial to acknowledge that we are not exempt from any disaster, as the potential 
<br/>impact on our community and economy remains significant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  echoing  the  sentiments  expressed  by  His  Excellency  in  his  most  gracious 
<br/>Address,  the  Government  maintains  its  unwavering  commitment  to  enact  robust  policies  that 
<br/>effectively  address  the  compounding  challenges  arising  from  climate  change  and  disasters, 
<br/>particularly impacting our vulnerable communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) underscores Fiji's significant exposure, estimating a 
<br/>70  percent  likelihood  of  experiencing  impactful  disasters  related  to  natural  hazards  annually.  
<br/>Research indicates that cyclones and floods could result in average annual losses equivalent to 5.8 
<br/>percent  of  GDP.    These  statistics  underscore  the  urgency  of  the  upcoming  new  Disaster  Bill, 
<br/>earmarked to be tabled in Parliament later this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill is an important milestone for all Fijians and partners, incorporating 
<br/>valuable lessons from past disasters to ensure a legal framework that is adaptive and responsive to 
<br/></span><span>the  evolving  nature  of  such  crises.  This  august  Parliament  might  be  interested  to  know  that  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Prime Minister was also the Prime Minister at that time in 1998 when the current Natural 
<br/>Disaster Management Act 1998 was last passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  proposed  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  in  alignment  with  international  best  practices  and 
<br/>standards for disaster risk reduction and management.  It ensures that Fiji's approach harmonizes with 
<br/>global strategies.  A notable demonstration of this alignment occurred during the Inaugural National 
<br/>Simulation Exercise conducted last year as part of our National Disaster Awareness Week (NDAW) 
<br/>2023.    The  event  brought  together  13  Pacific  Island  Countries  and  key  partners,  fostering 
<br/></span><span>collaboration to strategise and test capabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NDAW, 2023 witnessed the NDMO testing the national and sub-national 
<br/>coordination mechanisms in response to varying scenarios, such as, tsunamis, earthquakes, oil spills 
<br/>and marine search and rescue.  This inclusive and comprehensive approach, integral to the new Bill, 
<br/>reflects its robust, forward looking and visionary nature, positioning Fiji to effectively navigate and 
<br/>mitigate the effects of disasters, if and when they do happen. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>33 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with over 70 percent of our population residing within five kilometres of 
<br/>the coastline, the vulnerability to climate and disaster risks is undeniable.  According to the Pacific 
<br/>Risk  Profile  for  Fiji,  from  2011  to  2020,  the  Government  has  responded  to  nine  major  cyclones, 
<br/>impacting 854,449 people or 95 percent of the population, and causing total damages amounting to 
<br/>US$771.52 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, given this high level of exposure, the Government remains committed to 
<br/>advancing  its  social  protection  programmes.  This  commitment  involves  augmenting  these 
<br/>programmes  with  coverage  designed  to  address  the  impacts  of  climate  and  disaster  shocks.    One 
<br/>significant initiative in this regard is the establishment of Fiji’s Anticipatory Action Framework, the 
<br/>first of its kind in the Pacific.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developed  in  collaboration  with  the  United  Nations  Office  for  the  Coordination  of 
<br/>Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) and other UN partners, this Framework allocates US$2.3 million 
<br/>of the Central Emergency Response Fund for preparedness activities.  It adopts a ‘no-regret’ position 
<br/>in releasing funds to the affected members of the population once various triggers are met, aiming to 
<br/>provide timely assistance to forecasted areas prior to disaster impact. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unrelenting threats of climate change are becoming increasingly evident, 
<br/>especially  for Small  Island Developing States (SIDS), such  as Fiji.   We  know that inhabitants of 
<br/>SIDS are 15 times more likely to die from climate disasters.  Sir, SIDS are particularly vulnerable to 
<br/>the adverse effects of climate change, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events and changing 
<br/>rainfall  patterns.    These  impacts  can  exacerbate  existing  vulnerabilities  and  pose  significant 
<br/>challenges to sustainable development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the relocation of Nabavatu Village is a clear indication of the escalating 
<br/>impacts  of  climate  change  on  our  vulnerable  population.    We  express  appreciation  for  the  recent 
<br/>approval  by  Cabinet  to  proceed  with  the  relocation  of  this  village,  and  we  eagerly  anticipate 
<br/>witnessing the transition from their current tent village in which they have been living in since 2021, 
<br/>to their new Category-5 certified homes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project is one of the many that the Government will have to undertake 
<br/>in years to come.  His Excellency the President has already stated that an additional 44 communities 
<br/>are out there to be looked into.  There is no guarantee that the number will remain at that, and the 
<br/>chances of it increasing is high as the rate of impact of climate change bears itself on our vulnerable 
<br/></span><span>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, COVID-19 has had a profound impact on the Fijian economy, especially 
<br/>on Fiji’s tourism sector.  We are encouraged by the news that visitor arrivals have exceeded pre-
<br/>COVID-19 levels, and they continue to be strong.  Given that tourism plays a pivotal role on our 
<br/>economy, we must collaborate with relevant stakeholders to guarantee a safe, welcoming and secure 
<br/>environment for our visitors to enjoy their holidays.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 44 percent of Fiji’s population reside in rural areas.  While these areas may 
<br/></span><span>be regarded as resource rich, high poverty rates and rural urban drift persist in these areas.  To help 
<br/></span><span>address this disparity, I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry of Rural and 
<br/>Maritime Development is currently working on initiatives that will empower our rural communities 
<br/>and enhance their ability to turn their God-given resources to generate and accelerate wealth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in support of His Excellency’s statement about providing access to financial 
<br/>literacy, the Ministry of Rural and Maritime development and Disaster Management, through our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>
<div><span>34 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Self-Help Programme and Rural and Outer Island Development Programme (ROI), will significantly 
<br/>contribute towards this effort.  The Ministry provides support to income-generating projects and this 
<br/>year is going to engage with organisations through Public-Private Partnerships that will provide the 
<br/>necessary expertise for improving financial literacy in the rural and maritime areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  acknowledges  that  changing  mindsets  and  introducing  a 
<br/>savings  culture  in  rural  communities  cannot  happen  overnight.    It  will  require  good  governance, 
<br/>commitment and passion on the part of the people, as well as effective coordination and cooperation 
<br/>between Government agencies, the private sector, and our religious organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are encouraging and supporting the establishment of more co-operatives so that the idea 
<br/>of </span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> is maintained and enhanced.  This is the strength of our rural people, and we need to 
<br/>maximise those strengths with more income-generating activities and nurture them to become self-
<br/>reliant  and move  away from the dependency  culture that was the common practice in  the last 10 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst  financial  literacy  is  crucial,  ensuring  that  there  is  market  access  for  these  small 
<br/>businesses is equally important.  Our Ministry is doing its best through our existing programmes to 
<br/>ensure that the supply and value chain for any type of business  supported is monitored closely to 
<br/>ensure market access and maximum benefits for our clients. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  already  been  engaging  with  local,  regional,  and 
<br/>international  partners  to  provide  support  in  this  area.    Apart  from  engaging  with  Government 
<br/>agencies, we are also exploring opportunities available with regional organisations. Our engagement 
<br/>with  the  People’s  Republic  of  Korea  for  piloting  of  Saemaul  Undong  and  Saemaul  Geumgo 
<br/>initiatives  are  examples  of  initiatives  that  the  Ministry  is  implementing  as  tools  for  economic 
<br/>empowerment and growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Saemaul Geumgo is a development initiative that will promote the financial cooperative 
<br/>concept among our rural and maritime communities. Under the programme, our rural and maritime 
<br/>dwellers  will be trained  on financial  literacy, savings  culture,  community leadership, and income 
<br/>generation projects. Promoting financial literacy not only enhances individual wellbeing, but  also 
<br/>fosters  economic  resilience,  and  contributes  to  sustainable  development  in  communities  and 
<br/>societies, especially in our rural and maritime areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Saemaul Geumgo initiative or a modified version of it, using our own 
<br/></span><span>solesolevaki</span><span> principles, will be piloted in rural communities and later on, embedded into the existing 
<br/></span><span>ROI programme due to its successful contribution towards rural development in South Korea and in 
<br/>other developing countries of the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the decision of the Coalition Government to institute a Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission. This initiative is not only timely but also essential as we endeavour to 
<br/>advance collectively as a nation. It is my firm belief that to move forward together, we must first 
<br/>address and reconcile the wounds of the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sugar industry was once a stronghold of the Fiji economy. The initiatives 
<br/></span><span>planned to revitalise this vital industry are indeed promising. The targeted increase in cane production 
<br/>to  1.8  million  tonnes  for  the  upcoming  season  demonstrates  a  proactive  approach  to  enhancing 
<br/>productivity and securing the industry's sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  ROI  programme  is  also  targeted  at  assisting  subsistence 
<br/>farmers in  our  rural  and maritime communities who have the potential to contribute to  economic 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>growth.    This  is  the  first  year  of  implementation  and  we  are  committed  to  not  only  support  but 
<br/>enhance  productivity  through  the  provision  of  machinery  and  equipment,  as  well  as  facilitating 
<br/>discussions for market access.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  programme  of  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and 
<br/>Footbridges (CARFF) is an enabler for ease of access to transportation and markets.   In addition to 
<br/>this,  the  Ministry  is  also  administering  the  Seafaring  Entrepreneurship  Assistance  Programme  to 
<br/>provide subsidies for purchasing boats and engines that are used for transportation, as well as for 
<br/>fishing businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also contributes to addressing health issues through its Rural High-Risk Water 
<br/>and Sanitation Programme.  This is a programme that enables access to clean and safe drinking water 
<br/>and better sanitation facilities for rural and maritime communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, there has been assistance provided to schools through the construction of Ecological 
<br/>Purification Systems (EPS) for access to clean drinking water and the construction of ablution blocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am delighted to be part of a government that is people-focused on uplifting 
<br/>living standards and, at the same time, working with the people to transform the way they think and 
<br/>empower them to be resilient and productive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  our  outreach,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime 
<br/>Development  and  Disaster  Management  has  consistently  and  constantly  challenged  our  rural 
<br/>dwelling citizens to co-operate with members of our staff in preparing their Community Development 
<br/>Plans and Disaster Management Plans for their communities, whether it be villages or settlements, 
<br/>and organising themselves to address challenges when they arise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we embark on another parliamentary year, I urge my colleagues in this 
<br/>august Parliament to reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental purpose of our roles which is to 
<br/>serve, rather than to be served. We must remain firm in our dedication to listening to the concerns of 
<br/>our people and using our platform to address their plights effectively. With that, Sir, I commend and 
<br/>fully support His Excellency’s most gracious Speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  Opposition  and  Members  of  Parliament;  a    big  </span><span>bula  vinaka</span><span>  and 
<br/>greetings to those who are watching from the comfort of their homes and to all Fijians tuning in from 
<br/></span><span>anywhere around the world.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I promise to be very brief. I am honoured and grateful to be given the privilege 
<br/>to  reply  or  express  my  thoughts  and  opinion  on  His  Excellency’s  Address  while  opening  the 
<br/>Parliament Session for this year.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, while going through His Excellency’s Speech, I ensured that I look into it not 
<br/>as a politician or a Member of Parliament, but  I challenge myself on how I can look at it like an 
<br/>ordinary Fijian sitting at home.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A farmer may be asking; how relevant is this to me? A fisherman may ask; how will this 
<br/>benefit my family? A carpenter will want to know whether the changes and initiatives will influence 
<br/>their  weekly  salary  or  how  are  we  going  to  bring  about  positivity,  confidence  and  growth  to  the 
<br/>people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, at the outset, my response today is based on this statement, “When the people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are well looked after, the country will prosper, and the nation will grow stronger”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, no matter how may forums, summits, meetings and consultations we do, if we 
<br/>continue to neglect the people and turn a blind eye to their voice and needs, there will be no progress, 
<br/>there will be no economic prosperity, there will be no growth and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- A reminder to the Government of the day, “You are there because the people 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>entrusted their hopes and aspirations of a better family, better community and better Fiji to you”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as policymakers, we need to ensure that the people of this country should always 
<br/>come first because they are the very reason we are represented here as Members of Parliament.  We 
<br/>are not here because of certain businesses and businesspeople.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  We  are  not  here  because  of  some  companies  or  Non-Government 
<br/>Organisations (NGOs). We are here for the very people whose votes gave us the power to become 
<br/>Ministers and Members of Parliament. To the Coalition Government, you need to stop the ‘blame 
<br/>game’ and habitually imputing the past practices of the previous Government as a reason to get away 
<br/>from the expectations of the people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.  BIA.-  Stay  true  to  your  purpose  and  never  deviate  from  the  vision  of  the  great 
<br/></span><span>leaders that have gone before us.  You need to be bounded by the unity and faith of the people of Fiji, 
<br/></span><span>irrespective of their gender, race or ethnicity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, sometimes we hear words on the streets saying, “We need to accept that 
<br/>some  of  the  promises  made  during  the  election  campaign  will  not  be  fulfilled  because  this  is  a 
<br/>Coalition Government.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Let me be frank with the Coalition Government, stop focusing on the issues 
<br/></span><span>within your Coalition partners, stop fighting for survival within the Coalition Government, but fight 
<br/>for the survival of ordinary Fijians who are living from paycheck to paycheck and hoping for a better 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>37 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is time to call for a stop of just using people for our very 
<br/>own political  gain.    For  too  long,  some of us politicians are only seen  during election  campaign, 
<br/>visiting people and going out hearing the voice of the people, but when we are in power, we tend to 
<br/>totally forget the people who voted for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we visited their doorsteps in trying to win their votes but when they come 
<br/>into your various office space, they are told to make appointments and at times, they are given the 
<br/>biggest run around of their life.  Some have found it easier to talk to God than even trying to meet 
<br/>the Ministers in person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  Fijians  even  ran  out  of  credit  after  having  their  phone  calls  being 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transferred about five to six times, just to converse with the Ministers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yes, very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Some people thought they are emailing the guardians of the galaxies because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it takes months for Ministers to even respond to their email. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they need to be at the forefront of serving the people, irrespective of their 
<br/>class in the society.  Try and avoid using the pipeline system to process issues and concerns of the 
<br/>people.  As Ministers, you need to go out more locally, not internationally.  You need to hear the 
<br/>heartbeat on the ground, engage ordinary Fijians in </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session and see the reality of what the 
<br/>people are facing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are elected to defend the interests of the people of Fiji at all costs.  If it 
<br/>takes us to do some sacrifice in our decision-making, do it because of the people and there should be 
<br/>no two ways about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I have observed in the last Parliament sitting, we have spent a lot of 
<br/>time in ‘political talk’ and less ‘people talk’.  We are wasting our time trying to talk about the previous 
<br/>administration, we are too fond of trying to find fault about each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the danger of this when we are too focused on each other, we will forget the 
<br/>people we serve and what is required of us to carry out our roles and responsibilities.  We need to 
<br/></span><span>honour our promise and words spoken during the election campaign, the people of Fiji are observing 
<br/></span><span>and listening, watching every move we make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the people of Fiji need to have the assurance that they are not given false 
<br/>hope but are guaranteed that their interest is well served with the current Government.  It is important 
<br/>that  we  remind  ourselves  not  to  expect  perfection  but  be  committed  towards  progress  and 
<br/>improvement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- To this august Parliament, let us stand together, shoulder to shoulder, with 
<br/>every citizen  of this beloved country, no matter what they are, we will need to fight corruption at 
<br/>every turn.  We should always stand for the very best and quality delivery for all Fijians, caring for 
<br/>all citizens and move our country forward with dignity and honor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude with the saying, “If not now, then when? If not us, then

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>11</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who?”  May God bless Fiji</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker. Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistance  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament and all online and television viewers - </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span>
<br/>and good morning to you all.  I am privileged to reflect on the insightful themes presented in the 
<br/>inaugural  Address  of  His  Excellency  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Fiji,  </span><span>Turaga  Bale  Na  Tui</span><span>
<br/>Macuata, Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere during the Opening Session of Parliament for 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to respond to the key messages articulated by His Excellency 
<br/>covering education, tourism and civil aviation.  I echo the sentiments expressed by His Excellency 
<br/>the President, indeed, education will continue to be a priority.  The Coalition Government has not 
<br/>changed its stance since we came into power to ensure that no child is left behind in our planning and 
<br/>policies in place at the Ministry of Education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know that TELS debt amounting to a total of $650 million, owed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by some 53,725 students was written-off in 2023.  These are 53,725 families across this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Under the new Fijian Scholarship Scheme with a  total budget of 
<br/>$148.2 million has catered to 8,720 new students and continues for the 9,148 existing students.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, no country in the Pacific today provides scholarship for its people like Fiji through the 
<br/>Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- No country, no country, only Fiji with the Coalition Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No debt to the student.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the repair job is huge. Someone talked about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>buildings, school fund – the schools under FijFirst were badly dilapidated...   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- ... and the Government Quarters were in a sorry state.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of Parliament, under the $200 Back to School support for 2024, a total of 
<br/>$42.5 million has benefitted 212,740 students from Early Childhood Education (ECE) to Year 13. 
<br/>Did I hear them saying that FijiFirst did that too? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the successful Fiji National  Education Summit, 
<br/>which I opened on 19</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023 had established a strategic direction which will  transform 
<br/>our  education  system,  thus  building  and  supporting  resilient  Fijians.    With  a  new  direction,  the 
<br/>Ministry must revamp its vision and mission statements along with its guiding principles, values and

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>39 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsibilities.  For  the  information  of  the  august  Parliament,  the  last  Summit  was  the  Suva 
<br/>Declaration in 2005 and it after 18 years then another Education Summit has been staged.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  outcome  of  the  Fijian  Education  Summit  is  the  10  years  Denarau  Declaration  which 
<br/>entails  its  implementation  phase  and  is  taken  into  consideration  its  alignment  to  SDG4  and  the 
<br/>National Development Plan.  The Denarau Declaration launched on 10</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023, focussed 
<br/>on seven major thematic areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, the Curriculum &amp; Sustainable Development which endeavour for learners at all levels 
<br/>of education to access high quality relevant programmes with inclusive examinations and assessment 
<br/>practices and processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Too much talk and no action.
