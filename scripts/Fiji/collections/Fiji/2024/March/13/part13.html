<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- $180.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- $180.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Another lie.  Back-to-School Assistance was a new initiative 
<br/>of the Coalition Government.  In the last two years we have allocated almost $100 million.  In 2023 
<br/>as soon as we came in Government, we provided $200 each to more than 200,000 students as support 
<br/>for back to school.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Point Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Your Point of Order, honourable Lal? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Standing Order Point of order 74(1) - Misleading. The honourable Member 
<br/>had said that we are lying.  Unfortunately, Madam Deputy Speaker, FijiFirst introduced the Back-to- 
<br/>School Assistance of $180 and the Coalition Government just topped it up by $20.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Lal. Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>may continue.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  He has again lied.  I would ask him to provide the evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was a COVID-19 assistance; he is lying.  This is back to 
<br/>school.  Before the children went to school, a month before, this is a new initiative announced by the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me also talk about the cost of living.  You are a joke, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Brutal cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya.  APoint of Order, honourable Deputy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I  rise under Standing Order  74(1)(a).  This is 
<br/>specifically with respect to practices in Parliament. The honourable Minister has been in Parliament 
<br/>for many years, I think he should withdraw. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Are  you  hard  of  hearing  Sir?    I  just  said  Standing  Order  74(1)(a)  - 
<br/>Practices of Parliament.  Please Sir, can you refrain from referring to another honourable Member 
<br/>like you just did. I would like that withdrawn, Madam Deputy Speaker.  He is a senior Member and 
<br/>a former Minister, it would be nice.  We can go on back and forth, honourable Minister but not in the 
<br/>way you just did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Withdraw! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, they learn to take it as well, let me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  if I may just say something right now.  I really 
<br/>do  not  want  to  waste  Parliament’s  time.  I  have  heard  some  words  from  this  side  of  Parliament 
<br/>addressed  specifically  to  a  Member  on  this  side  of  Parliament  and  I  would  like  that  to  stop, 
<br/>honourable Usamate.  Please let us just respect each other and let us carry out the debate as asked of 
<br/>us by His Excellency the President.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Koya forgot what honourable Usamte said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- What did he say? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I responded to him.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>181 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Your Point of Order, honourable Koya. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, you have made a ruling, I think he ought to just 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>keep it at that and leave it at that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is a statement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- It is not about me. I am under Standing Order 74(1)(a).  Do not ask me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the Standing Order, I think I know it better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya.  Let us just continue with the debate, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Deputy Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said at the beginning, I expected this.  Let me just continue to talk about the cost of 
<br/>living. The IMF Report on the level of inflation is very clear and let me just point this out to them. 
<br/>The continued reference and continued misinformation about the cost of living, when honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar was speaking the other day and honourable Nand was talking about the farmers and 
<br/>housewives, one of the farmers from Ba messaged me and this is what he said, “Tell them, prices of 
<br/>flour gone down from $22 for 10 kilogrammes to $15; rice price for 10 kilogrammes has gone down 
<br/>from $25 to $19.  Seems they not doing shopping that is why they….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- They must be going to expensive shops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- There is a sale in that supermarket. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Not with flour and rice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- As we have said, as the Bureau of Statistics and the Reserve 
<br/>Bank of Fiji have said inflation was 5 percent in 2023.  In January it has gone down to 3.6 percent. 
<br/>The trend is very good. The impact of a VAT increase from 9 percent to 15 percent on some of the 
<br/></span><span>household items apart from the basic 21 food items was temporary. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Opposition completely ignores the measures that we put in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget to help those … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It only offsets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- …who needed them. As I said almost $100 million in the last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two years has gone to more than 60,000 families… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  …  and  their  children  to  prepare  them  for  back  to  school 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Social Welfare, Madam Deputy Speaker, was increased by $15 and $25. We increased 
<br/>budget for health services, kidney dialysis, agricultural subsidies; all these came through the revenue 
<br/>that we collected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other important point that I want to make, this is one of the most famous and most well-
<br/>articulated lie in this Parliament over the last two days. This is about the Tertiary Education Loans 
<br/>Scheme  (TELS)  write-off.  The  $650  million  write-off  has  taken  away  the  burden  from  53,000 
<br/>families and their children. These students who came out with a debt burden of $20,000, $30,000, 
<br/>$40,000  and  $50,000  depending  on  the  duration  of  the  course,  were  burdened  with  making  the 
<br/>repayment while they were working.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- That is right! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That income has gone back to the families and is now with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Girmit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- One innovation  we brought  and this  was an idea  from  our 
<br/>Coalition partner SODELPA and very important is that the decision by the Coalition Government 
<br/>has removed that burden and also provided an opportunity.  In fact, with the same amount of money, 
<br/>with less than what they were spending on TELS loans, we are giving more scholarships to students 
<br/>than ever before under TELS. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I was very, very surprised that they cannot differentiate between a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>loan, bond and a scholarship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Microwave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They claimed that because it is a bond, it is not free. In fact 
<br/>when we studied, Madam Deputy Speaker, in the 1970s, 1980s, every student who got a scholarship 
<br/>funded by the government was bonded to serve the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Full time job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  If you did  not  serve the country, if you chose to  leave the 
<br/></span><span>country, you got to pay. With the TELS loan they had the same arrangement.  We heard these stories, 
<br/></span><span>these lies about students wanting to go overseas. They had the same process. You had to either pay; 
<br/>whether you had to pay 50 percent or 20 percent, you still had to pay if you wanted to go.  So, if you 
<br/>sign a bond, you get a scholarship. You graduate, your work in Fiji, you do not pay a single cent.  
<br/>You serve your bond, you go.  That is what we have done.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, let me also say a little bit about the economy, Madam Deputy Speaker, because this is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>another lie that they are advocating and perpetrating in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  The recent Budget (this is to also put the record straight), we 
<br/>had reduced the fiscal deficit from an average of 9.0 percent to 4.8 percent of GDP.  We plan to bring 
<br/>this down further to 3.5 percent on the upcoming Budget.  The reduction in the deficit was critical to 
<br/>put out debt trajectory on a path of sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="36">Page 36</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>183 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am pleased to update Parliament that for the first time of the fiscal 
<br/>year, Government has recorded a net deficit of $114.9 million, equivalent to -0.9 percent of GDP - a 
<br/>surplus.  This is much lower than the targeted net deficit that the Government has already collected 
<br/>of $1.8 billion in revenues which is almost half of what has been forecasted for the year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the first six months, we have managed to achieve almost 99 percent of the budgeted tax 
<br/>revenue.  Compared to the same period last year, the total revenue collection has increased by $458 
<br/>million or 34 percent, and tax revenue are higher by 367 percent or 31 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, non-tax revenue has also increased.  The reason why I am giving you this figure is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because honourable Premila Kumar and some others out there… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…claimed that we will not be able to collect the revenue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the expenditures, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the first six months, Government 
<br/>expenditure totalled $1.9 billion, which represents about 44.1 percent and we agreed that it is lower 
<br/>than what we expected.  But as we approach the second half which is normally the case, we expect 
<br/>expenditure to increase and some of the projects that are there would not be delayed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was this talk about the National Development Plan (NDP), Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>and we heard from the Opposition that there was a plan already.  In fact, that plan was conceived, 
<br/>concocted and what we found out that there were actually incorrect figures.  The data that was used 
<br/>in the plan was incorrect.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The data on the sugar industry was all wrong.  They claimed that the Tonnes of Cane per 
<br/>Tonne of Sugar (TCTS) would be around 5.7 TCTS.  These were the kind of statistics concocted in 
<br/>that plan.  There was no priority, so what we have done as a Government, we have recognised that 
<br/>we need an immediate plan, wo we have  a 3-Year Plan, a 5-Year Plan and a 20-Year Plan because 
<br/>we know as a Government, that we will not be able to achieve everything in three years or five years 
<br/>and that we need a 20-Year Plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, what we will do is we will make sure that we prioritise and make it 
<br/>realistic.  We know that there are certain things that we would not be able to do in three years or five 
<br/>years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They talk about listening to the people.  If you look at the process that we have adopted in the 
<br/>formulation of the NDP, this is the most comprehensive process  - starting from His Excellency’s 
<br/>Office,  to  all  Government  Ministers,  NGOs,  the  public,  we  have  got  a  consultant  who  is  well 
<br/>experienced in development planning, so that is the process through which we will have a plan and 
<br/>that plan will be realistic.  It will be targeted and prioritised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One last point, Madam Deputy Speaker, with respect to the claims made by the honourable 
<br/>Members on the other side and this is laughable.  They talk about democracy, they talk about good 
<br/></span><span>governance, they talk about transparency, they talk about cronyism, they talk about nepotism, they 
<br/></span><span>are behaving like bad losers, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- When you listen to them, I thought that after a year, and as I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have said, I want to thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition because it is important to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recognise that it is we, on this side of Parliament, that has brought real democracy in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- We now have real democracy.  The people in this country are 
<br/>listening  to  them.    Listening  to  the  garbage  that  is  coming  from  the  Opposition,  from  the 
<br/>generalilsation that is coming from them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-What they did, Madam Deputy Speaker, they have talked about 
<br/>the promises we made in the last Election.  In the last Election, they went around quietly, openly, 
<br/>telling the people social welfare will be gone, free school will be gone, scholarships will be gone, 
<br/>your leg will be gone. This is what they are still telling the people…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Who said that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C PRASAD.- … and I know what they are telling. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- But when we came into Government, when they found out, 
<br/>“Aah, all these things that FijiFirst was telling us were lies.  We still got our scholarships better.  We 
<br/>are going to increase in social welfare allowances. We are going to increase in the health Budget.  
<br/>We are fixing health centres.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Maharaj was talking about waiting for a lot of things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, may I please ask you to wind up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am winding up with one last point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau has a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker.  The honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister knows very well his time is up and you had begged us this morning that we 
<br/>should stick to our time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Member,  I  have  just  done  that  with  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Deputy Prime Minister.  Please wind up, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  I  think  honourable  Koroilavesau  did  very  well  today.    He 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worked very hard, and I know you might have been selected to disrupt me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You are not the Deputy Speaker! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Sit down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I will sit down at the instruction of Madam Deputy Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>She has asked me to conclude.  You are not going to bully me here.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>please, wind up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, one last point and I will sit down.  
<br/>This is in response to honourable Maharaj. What I was saying is if they had fixed all health centres, 
<br/>if they had fixed the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, if they had accepted our motion in 2019 to 
<br/>deal with the drugs, we would not be waiting.  We waited and we are here now.  They can wait.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- As I have not received any notification from the Secretary-General to 
<br/>Parliament, we  will  continue  to  listen to  the response from  our final  speaker before we break for 
<br/>lunch.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of  the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, fellow Fijians who are joining us here 
<br/>today at the gallery and all of you who are connecting online - </span><span>bula vinaka, namaste, jai siya ram, as 
<br/>salamu alaykum</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.  As we enter the month of March, I extend my 
<br/>warm  wishes  for  the  joyful  and  peaceful  time  filled  with  spirit  of  renewal.    May  the  upcoming 
<br/>celebrations of </span><span>Holi, Ramadan</span><span> and Easter bring happiness and blessing to you and your loved ones.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise in this august Parliament to deliver my contributions on the 
<br/>Address by His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Fiji.  But, before I do so, I wish to remind 
<br/>the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development 
<br/>and Statistics to, please, go through the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> of past Parliament Sittings, when they were 
<br/>on this side of Parliament.  Now, they are on the other side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I suggest  to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister  and Minister of  Finance  and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics to feel the pulse of the people on the ground and just 
<br/>do not follow the report by IMF.  The report looks merry and rosy, but on the ground, the story is 
<br/>different.  Life is very hard now.  I want to tell you that the people are watching you, not listening, 
<br/>but are watching you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Watching you as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, at the outset, I wish to thank His Excellency for 
<br/></span><span>rightfully highlighting in his Opening Speech that water is a basic need and crucial for our socio-
<br/>economic development. No one can deny the fact that water disruptions have become an everyday 
<br/>issue in all households. It is now an everyday and everywhere issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Viria Water Project is a significant infrastructure project that 
<br/>was  initiated  by  the  FijiFirst  Government,  which  aimed  to  resolve  the  water  supply  issues  and 
<br/>improve the lives of 360,000 Fijians in Fiji’s Suva-Nausori corridor, with an addition of 40 million 
<br/>litres of water per day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With an investment of over $270 million by the Asian Development Bank, the Green Climate 
<br/>Fund and the Fijian Government, this project, based on initial estimates, should have been operational 
<br/>by now.  It was anticipated to be finished in May 2023, followed by a two-month commissioning 
<br/>phase.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the continuous delay from the Coalition Government is sending a 
<br/>negative signal to our development partners.  We have to be mindful that the well-planned projects 
<br/>with implementation timeline on track, secures more investment from our development partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Development partners do not invest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  given  this  delay,  the  relevant  authority  is  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>undertake further investigation to confirm the official launch date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Information on the project's environmental impact or any incorporated sustainability features 
<br/>is  currently  lacking.  Additionally,  monitoring  the  project's  long-term  effectiveness  in  addressing 
<br/>water supply issues and its impact on the Suva-Nausori areas' development would be insightful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By exploring the suggested resources and delving deeper into these areas, we can gain a more 
<br/>comprehensive understanding of the Rewa River Water Supply Scheme for its potential long-term 
<br/>impact.  If the honourable Minister is saying that the project is completed, then why are the people 
<br/>still complaining about the lack of water? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there has been a very strong emphasis on these mentioned areas in 
<br/>His Excellency’s Speech on the plans by the Coalition Government.  However, I would like to remind 
<br/>us today on the saying that goes, and I quote: “Action speaks louder than words”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This also applies to those promises made during campaign time leading up to the Elections.  
<br/>Yes, these promises are to be actioned and not only used as political mileage or vote buying and left 
<br/>as failed promises.  I firmly believe that whatever statement is delivered within this august Chambers 
<br/>should be converted into action.  If not, then they are just mere words.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, many on the Coalition Government side like to use the blame game 
<br/>and it seems they are still campaigning.  This diversionary tactics by the Coalition Government is an 
<br/>attempt to gaslight the nation to keep their campaign narratives alive.  The good thing is, the people 
<br/>of Fiji have opened their eyes and have seen the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The truth is 16 years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Yes, you worry about the magic show.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have seen the cost of living climb to new heights, compounded 
<br/></span><span>by the increase in VAT to 15 percent  which has seen spending drop simply because the ordinary 
<br/>Fijians cannot afford as much as they once did.  The decrease in indirect tax revenue clearly shows 
<br/>that  consumer  spending  habits  has  decreased.    This  is  a  clear  indication  that  our  economy  is 
<br/>contracting, and this is a very worrying trend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency also mentioned in his Speech that the national debt 
<br/>was  $9.9  billion.    The  question  is,  what  was  this  money  used  for?  Over  $800  million  has  been 
<br/>borrowed so far by the Coalition Government and we have yet to see any new development rather 
<br/></span><span>than a re-packaged FijiFirst development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have heard about the National Development Plan that is due out 
<br/>this year by the Coalition Government, but I ask, why does the Coalition Government need to remake 
<br/>something that has already been in place since 2017? We hear from the Minister in charge of this 
<br/>stating  they  will  put  in  new  policy  initiatives,  including  those  contained  in  the  People’s  Alliance 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>187 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Party,  National  Federation  Party  and  the  Social  Democratic  Liberal  Party  Manifestos  will  be 
<br/>reviewed and factored in the new plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Would it not been cheaper and more prudent to have an updated National Development Plan 
<br/>rather than making something new at great cost to the nation? It has been 15 months now since the 
<br/>Coalition Government took over government and the whole nation is wondering what they have been 
<br/>doing all this time.  What have many of them been doing for the past eight years when the FijiFirst 
<br/>was in power?  Did they not have plans and ideas? Clearly, they were not ready and from what I have 
<br/>heard, many of them are still not ready. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  all  in  all,  this  is  an  indication  of  the  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>disconnection and lack of understanding of how the current mechanism works, and the inability to 
<br/>continue to build a nation is worrisome. By way of reverting to the blame game when they know they 
<br/>have nothing to show, no new or viable and good ideas is evident everywhere you look. You can ask 
<br/>almost anyone and they will tell you the same thing, life is very hard now and this is true. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, “any man can sail a ship when the ocean is calm”, Publilius Syrus 
<br/>wrote those words more than 2200 years ago.  We have seen much in the way of finger pointing and 
<br/>verbal attack on us that says, “they did not do the job”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this Government has forgotten that under the FijiFirst Government, 
<br/>Fiji had to endure six cyclones with </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> hurting Fiji to the tune of around $1.8 billion and 
<br/>costing 44 lives. We were also hit by COVID-19 - a global pandemic which brought our economy to 
<br/>its knees and costing us over 1,300 lives.  To prevent stalling the economy, we had to make the tough 
<br/>choices and borrow to keep our economy going.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in ensuring that civil servants were paid in full, even if they were 
<br/>stuck at home.  Any economist would know that it takes years to restart a stalled economy and the 
<br/>repercussions to the people of Fiji would have been extremely serious.  All these, set us back by years 
<br/>of  development  and  what  do  the  people  who  benefited  from  tough  decisions  have  to  say  for 
<br/>themselves  now?    They  showed  gratitude  for  all  the  aid  and  sadly,  many  were  bought  into  the 
<br/>narrative of high debt that only came into existence by helping rebuild after the natural disasters and 
<br/>the pandemic. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everything is relevant,  Madam Deputy Speaker, everything Government builds or creates, 
<br/>there is a ripple effect that affects the whole nation. This Government is very smart to talk about the 
<br/></span><span>shortfalls  of  FijiFirst  but  they  also  failed  to  explain  to  the  people  why  we  did  that.  They  have 
<br/></span><span>hoodwinked  the  people  into  thinking  that  we  did  not  look  after  them  and  sadly,  Madam  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, many of the people of Fiji are gullible enough to have fallen into their negative narrative 
<br/>hook, line and sinker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Rural and Maritime Development Programme by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government in the past years have transformed Fiji’s rural economy and have raised the people’s 
<br/>living standards but now, they are suffering. Crime rate has increased. Stealing of rootcrops as alluded 
<br/>by honourable Shalen Kumar and other honourable Members on this side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and 
<br/>Immigration for attending a meeting on my request and he has heard from the public that the crime 
<br/>rate has really increased. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Minister of Finance, if you are not sure, find it from your team and from your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>boy in Wailoku.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I have already visited them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- You go and visit them and you will find that the crimes committed are not 
<br/>only in Baulevu, but Viria in Naitasiri, Muaniweni and Tailevu and everywhere, the crime rate has 
<br/>increased. Stealing of rootcrops and vegetables are included in that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- As pointed by His Excellency that Government will prioritize a wide range 
<br/>of programmes to revitalise the rural economy and encourage self-reliance, including funding of Self 
<br/>Help  Programmes,  Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and  Bridges,  High  Risk  Water  and 
<br/>Sanitation  projects,  Rural  Housing  Assistance  Programme  and  the  Rural  and  Outer  Island 
<br/>Development Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to reiterate and remind this august Parliament that all these 
<br/>ongoing  Programmes  are  from  the  FijiFirst  Government.  There  is  nothing  new  by  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government but the fact is, we have seen a major rebranding of everything from a microwave budget  
<br/>to a National Development Plan that I am sure will be very similar to the National Development Plan 
<br/>of 2017. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In His Excellency’s Address in 2023, he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Democracy will be broadened and localised further with the empowerment of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>local community to choose their Advisory Councillor through elections.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will admit,  I was cautionary optimistic  that this  Coalition  Government  was going  to  burden the 
<br/>Advisory Councillors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  fully  aware  of  how  people  appreciate  the  provision  of 
<br/>Government assistance and services to our rural community and I am also aware of how difficult the 
<br/>work as an Advisory Councillor is.  As people waited to elect their Advisory Councillors last year, 
<br/>we only saw failed National Federation Party Candidates and their supporters getting appointed to 
<br/>those positions and not elected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  I  hope  the  honourable  line  Minister  is  aware  of  that.  District  Advisory 
<br/>Councillors do play a critical  role in  connecting the people to  the Government  and vice versa, to 
<br/>ensure that people get the real assistance needed by them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  regard,  it  is  very  important  that  the  right  people  are  appointed  for  this  position  - 
<br/>someone that can be a game changer and has the ability to serve the community as a whole. I will 
<br/></span><span>ask the honourable Minister for Rural and Maritime Development and Disaster Management if the 
<br/></span><span>process was followed.  I was told by a reliable source that the list advanced from the Commissioner 
<br/>Office was changed.  I will ask the honourable Minister if Police Clearance was done for the District 
<br/>Advisory Councillors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Who changed the list? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>189 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I eagerly await his reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is critical for an economy to have a robust transport system to 
<br/>enhance movement of goods and persons.  Our maritime community faces this challenge particularly 
<br/>those who reside in non-economical routes.  In addressing this, the FijiFirst Government introduced 
<br/>the  Government  Shipping  Franchise  Scheme.    His  Excellency  had  emphasised  the  need  to  better 
<br/>coordinate for disaster preparedness, response, recovery operations and mitigation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Could  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  Development  on  behalf  of  the  villagers  of 
<br/>Rokovuaka and Narikoso in the Ra Province and the villagers of Matacula and Maumi in Tailevu 
<br/>update us on the construction of evacuation centers?  We have not heard anything so far? The signing 
<br/>was  carried  out  by  the  International  Organization  for  Migration  (IOM)  and  Korean  International 
<br/>Cooperation Agency (KOICA) more than three years ago, but nothing has been seen happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, having $6 million approved under the former Minister, preparedness 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work already done, the project was supposed to start last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- What happened? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- They were overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.-  It  talked about  KOICA supporting the development  under the Saemaul 
<br/>Undong  Programme,  but  this    was  also  Korean  funded,  nothing  happening  so  far.    I  hope  the 
<br/>honourable Minister has not shelved this project because they are FijiFirst projects.  I remind them 
<br/>that our Fijian brothers and sisters will suffer if a disaster hits these areas.  I had visited this area 
<br/>personally, they really need evacuation centers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  stated  twice  that  we  need  to  come  away  from  the  dependency 
<br/>syndrome.  What is the honourable Minister doing differently to ensure that we move away from the 
<br/>dependency syndrome as we are hearing nothing new and only hearing a similar style – microwave 
<br/>statement similar to the honourable Minister for Finance and rebranding FijiFirst programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  honourable  Lynda  Tabuya  yesterday  attempted  to  insult  us  by 
<br/>saying  that  we  are  jack  of  all  trades.    I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  that 
<br/></span><span>complement.  As the saying is, “jack of all trades is a master of none” but often better than “a master 
<br/></span><span>of one”.  Sadly, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government is neither a jack of all trades and 
<br/>definitely most of them are not a master of one except the honourable Minister herself who is an 
<br/>expert in are few fields which everyone knows of.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to remind the Coalition Government to relook 
<br/>at the changes that they are willing to implement, not to be vote buying but to ensure that it will bring 
<br/>about economic stability and sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, it is now 12.43 p.m., we are going to adjourn for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lunch and the bell will ring just before 2.00 p.m.  Thank you, enjoy your lunch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12.44 p.m.
