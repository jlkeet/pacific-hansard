<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.  - Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Members of the Parliament and my fellow Fijians, I rise to lend my voice to the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>191 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>put  forward  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  thanking  His  Excellency  the  President  for  his 
<br/>insightful  and  forward-looking  Address  at  the  State  Opening  of  Parliament.    His  Excellency’s 
<br/>Speech, rich in vision and aspiration, not only paves the way for our collective endeavours, but also 
<br/>reminds us of the weight of our duties to our beloved nation, Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking to the importance of the role that His Excellency plays, I want to say that in the last 
<br/>15 months or so, His Excellency has truly lived up to his constitutional mandate to be the symbol of 
<br/>national unity for our nation. Even when things were tough, His Excellency did not waver, he showed 
<br/>true leadership by accepting the elections results, showing us all how much he values democracy and 
<br/>the choice of the Fijian  people.  It  is  not  easy to  stand strong when there  are so many voices and 
<br/>pressures coming from different directions, but our President did just that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By welcoming the election results, he did not just follow the rules and the Constitution, he 
<br/>showed us what it means to truly respect and trust the process and the decisions of our nation and her 
<br/>people.  This leadership is inspiring, Mr. Speaker, it reminds us that no matter what, we need to stick 
<br/>to our principles like fairness, respect for each other and the peaceful transition of power.  These are 
<br/>the things that keeps our country stable and united.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  in  that  regard,  I  also  would  like  to  wish  to  extend  my  appreciation  to  the 
<br/>Commander and the Ranks of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, the Acting Commissioner and the 
<br/>Officers  of  Fiji  Police  Force,  the  Permanent  Secretary,  the  Director  and  the  Department  of 
<br/>Immigration for their dedication and service to our country.  Their commitment to maintaining peace, 
<br/>ensuring security and upholding the law is the bedrock upon which the confident, safety and well-
<br/>being of our nation and its citizens rest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  as  announced  by  His  Excellency  the  President,  the  National  Security  and 
<br/>Defence  Review  is  envisaged  to  be  a  holistic  assessment.    It  encompasses  not  only  our  military 
<br/>capabilities,  but  also  the  broader  dimensions  of  security  that  are  pivotal  for  a  peaceful  and  a 
<br/>prosperous Fiji. This includes economic security, cybersecurity, environmental security and human 
<br/>security with a particular emphasis on alleviating poverty as a means to enhance national stability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This comprehensive review will enable us to identify critical gaps, align our strategies with 
<br/>the best practices globally and tailor our approach to the unique needs and aspirations of our Fijian 
<br/>society.    It  will  serve  as  a  blueprint  for  transforming  our  security  and  defence  sectors  into  agile, 
<br/>forward-looking  entities capable  of  not  only  deterring  threats  but  also  contributing  to  the  holistic 
<br/>well-being of our nation and its people.  We understand that a nation’s strength is not solely measured 
<br/></span><span>but its military prowess but by the resilience and prosperity of its people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Therefore,  the  National  Security  and  Defence  Review  will  also  explore  mechanisms  to 
<br/>strengthen social safety nets, promote sustainable development and ensure that every Fijian has the 
<br/>opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our nation’s growth. The task ahead is complex and 
<br/>demands a collaborative approach.  We will engage with a broad range of stakeholders, including 
<br/>community leaders, international partners and experts across various fields to ensure that the review 
<br/>is comprehensive, inclusive, with our national values and goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  National  Security  and  Defence  Review  represents  a  pivotal  step  in  our 
<br/></span><span>journey towards a secure, stable and prosperous Fiji.  It is an opportunity to redefine security in a 
<br/>manner that resonates with the needs of our time and reflects our commitment to the well-being of 
<br/>all Fijians.  The review team is expected to present its report to Government in August this year and 
<br/>subsequently to Parliament afterwards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we embark, Mr. Speaker, on this critical review, I seek the support and wisdom of this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>esteemed Parliament, especially the Opposition.  Together we can chart a course towards a future 
<br/>where security is synonymous with opportunity, prosperity and peace for all of our citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the challenges we face today, from transnational crime and drug trafficking to 
<br/>the  threats  posed  by  climate  change  and  natural  disasters,  demand  a  police  force  that  is  not  only 
<br/>robust but also adaptable and equipped with contemporary capabilities.  The security landscape has 
<br/>evolved dramatically, and so must our responses to these challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hold  myself accountable for the current  law and order situation in Fiji 
<br/>today, much of which has been inherited from decisions made in the past. The honourable Maharaj 
<br/>yesterday talked about FijiFirst sowing seeds.  Well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed they sowed many seeds. 
<br/>If FijiFirst wants to take credit for the good and sweet fruits of seeds that they sowed, they must also 
<br/>accept responsibilities for the bad or rotten or sour and poisonous fruits as well that was born out of 
<br/>their administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The negative fruits of these seeds are what we are contending with today.  It is what I am 
<br/>contending  with  today  -  drugs,  police  brutality,  unprofessionalism  and  inefficient  administrative 
<br/>processes.  All of these are now my responsibility and I have to deal with it, I accept it that it is in 
<br/>now on my lap.  It will not change overnight, but I assure Parliament, Mr. Speaker, it will change, it 
<br/>is going to change.  Now having said all that, Mr. Speaker, it is our duty as stewards of this nation to 
<br/>look beyond the vestiges of the past and forge a path towards a future where our security apparatus 
<br/>is capable, resilient and responsive to the needs of our time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to highlight a crucial initiative within our Fiji Police Force 
<br/>known  as  the  “Restore  Blue  Concept”.    This  innovative  approach  is  aimed  at  embedding  human 
<br/>rights at the heart of our policing efforts.  It is about ensuring that every action taken by our police 
<br/>officers aligns with international human rights standards, ensuring that the rights and dignity of every 
<br/>individual and community are respected and also protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The essence of human  rights-based policing  is  to forge a positive, trust-based relationship 
<br/>between the police and the community that they serve.  It is about moving away from any practices 
<br/>that may have previously undermined public confidence in the police such as excessive use of force 
<br/>or human rights violations. These actions not only damage the professional image of our Police Force 
<br/>but also hinder their ability to effectively serve and protect our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By adopting the Restore Blue Concept, we are committed to transforming our Police Force.  
<br/></span><span>This  involves  integrating  human  rights  principles  into  all  aspects  of  Police  work,  from  daily 
<br/></span><span>operations to the very ethos that guide our officers.  It means reviewing and upgrading even their 
<br/>equipment  and  facilities  to  ensure  they  must  meet  the  high  standards  required  for  humane  and 
<br/>effective law enforcement, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  This initiative is not just about avoiding wrongdoing, 
<br/>it  is  about  actively  promoting  and  protecting  the  rights  of  all  Fijians  which  is  fundamental  to 
<br/>maintaining peace, order and the rule of law in our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  echoing  the  wisdom  imparted  by  His  Excellency  the  President,  and  drawing  upon  the 
<br/>lessons of comprehensive security strategies such as those I witnessed in the People’s Republic of 
<br/></span><span>China, particularly the emphasis on public security through poverty alleviation.  We recognise the 
<br/></span><span>intrinsic link between socio-economic stability and national security.  The fight against drugs and 
<br/>transnational crime is not a battle that can be won in isolation. It requires a united front, a coalition 
<br/>of efforts across ministries, governmental departments, and, crucially, within our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  this  end,  my  Ministry  is  committed  to  fostering  stronger  partnerships  with  local  and 
<br/>international  stakeholders,  enhancing  information  sharing  and  intelligence  cooperation,  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>193 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>building the capacity of our law enforcement agencies. This collaborative stance extends beyond 
<br/>the confines of traditional security apparatus to encompass education, social services, and economic 
<br/>agencies, recognizing that preventive measures are as critical as enforcement in this enduring battle.  
<br/>Moreover, we must empower our communities to be the first line of defense against these threats.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community  policing,  public  awareness  campaigns  and  engaging  with  civil  society 
<br/>organisations are pivotal in this regard. We aim to not only disrupt the supply chains of drugs and 
<br/>criminal  networks  but  also  to  address  the  demand  side  by  providing  support,  education  and 
<br/>rehabilitation  services  to  those  affected.    The  battle  against  drugs  and  transnational  crime  also 
<br/>underscores  the  need  for  regional  and  international  cooperation.  In  a  world  where  threats  are 
<br/>increasingly  transnational  in  nature,  our  security  strategies  must  also  be  borderless.  We  will 
<br/>continue  to  strengthen  our  ties  with  the  neighbouring  countries,  international  organisations  and 
<br/>allies to combat these global challenges together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to speak a little bit about drugs in particular. I wish to 
<br/>address a pressing concern that threatens the very fabrics of our society - the pervasive issues of 
<br/>drug in Fiji as we have been hearing throughout, particularly from the Opposition for the   few days 
<br/>that we have been here. The illicit drug trade is not simply a criminal enterprise.  It is a multifaceted 
<br/>scourge that undermines our social, economic and moral structures with a particularly devastating 
<br/>impact on our youth and our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The infiltration of drugs into our communities has far-reaching consequences. It erodes the 
<br/>potential of our young people, drawing them away from education and productive activities into 
<br/>cycles of dependency and of despair. The allure of the drug trade, with its false promises of quick 
<br/>wealth, ensnares not just individuals but entire families and communities, perpetuating a cycle of 
<br/>poverty and lawlessness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Government  is  acutely  aware  of  the  gravity  of  this  issue  and  the  need  for  a 
<br/>comprehensive and multi-pronged strategy to combat it. Our approach is anchored in education, 
<br/>prevention, treatment and enforcement with a particular emphasis on safeguarding our youth and 
<br/>our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Ministry and the Coalition Government is attacking the national drug 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>problem through a four-pronged strategy: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education and Prevention: We are committed to launching national awareness campaigns 
<br/></span><span>aimed  at  educating  our  citizens,  especially  our  young  people,  about  the  dangers  and 
<br/></span><span>consequences  of  drug  use  and  involvement  in  the  drug  trade.  By  strengthening  our 
<br/>educational programmes and community outreach, we aim to build resilience among our 
<br/>youth, empowering them with the knowledge and skills to make informed choices. We 
<br/>will  seek  to  partner  with  other  organisations  that  are  already  doing  this  work  on  the 
<br/>ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Treatment and Rehabilitation: Recognising the importance of compassion and support in 
<br/>addressing  drug  dependency,  our  Government  will  enhance  access  to  treatment  and 
<br/></span><span>rehabilitation services. By providing comprehensive care and support, we aim to facilitate 
<br/></span><span>the recovery and reintegration of affected individuals into society, offering them a path 
<br/>back to a productive and fulfilling life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enforcement and Legal Framework: To disrupt the drug trade and hold those responsible 
<br/>to account, we are bolstering our law enforcement capabilities and reviewing our legal 
<br/>framework.  This  includes  enhancing  inter-agency  cooperation,  both  domestically  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>internationally  to  effectively  tackle  drug  trafficking  networks.  Strengthening  our  legal 
<br/>framework will ensure that penalties for drug-related offences are commensurate with the 
<br/>severity of the crime, serving as a deterrent to potential offenders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On community engagement, the battle against drugs cannot be won by Government action 
<br/>alone.    It  requires  the  active  participation  of  our  communities.    We  foster  partnerships  with 
<br/>community  leaders,  civil  society  organisations  and  international  partners,  to  create  a  united  front 
<br/>against the drug menace.  Through these collaborations, we aim to reclaim our communities from the 
<br/>grip of drugs and restore safety and security for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am also pleased to announce in Parliament that we are working with our 
<br/>development  partners  to  build  a  specialised  Drug  and  Narcotics  Bureau,  reporting  directly  to  the 
<br/>Ministry.  This  new Bureau will, in  my  intention, be singularly  tasked with  effective intelligence 
<br/>gathering, prevention and, of course, the prosecution of those who are responsible for this threat in 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drug issue in Fiji is a battle that we must fight on all fronts.  It demands 
<br/>our  collective  resolve  and  a  comprehensive  strategy  that  addresses  the  root  causes  and  provides 
<br/>suitable  solutions.    Our Government  is  fully  committed  to  this  fight,  for  the  sake  of  our  nation’s 
<br/>present and future, especially for the wellbeing and potential of our young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on immigration and border security, as we navigate the complexities of our 
<br/>national security landscape, addressing the challenges of drugs and transnational crime, we must also 
<br/>turn our attention to the pivotal role of immigration in safeguarding our nation’s borders and ensuring 
<br/>the  orderly  management  of  people  entering  and  leaving  Fiji.  In  this  era  of  globalisation,  the 
<br/>movement  of  individuals  has  exponentially  increased,  bringing  forth  both,  opportunities  and 
<br/>vulnerabilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, modernising our immigration technology and processes is not merely an 
<br/>administrative task.  It is a critical component of our national security strategy.  The advancement of 
<br/>technology in recent years offers unprecedented opportunities to enhance the efficiency, accuracy 
<br/>and  integrity  of  our  immigration  systems.    By  embracing  these  innovations,  we  can  significantly 
<br/>improve our ability to detect, deter and respond to the potential threats at our borders, while also 
<br/>facilitating legitimate travel and fostering economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  this  end,  my  Ministry  is  actively  pursuing  the  modernisation  of  our 
<br/></span><span>immigration infrastructure.  This includes the adoption of advanced biometric systems, which will 
<br/></span><span>enable  us  to  accurately  verify  the  identities  of  individuals  entering  and  exiting  our  country.  By 
<br/>integrating these systems with international databases and watchlists, we can enhance our screening 
<br/>processes and prevent individuals with known criminal backgrounds from entering our shores.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, we are committed to upgrading our data management systems to ensure that 
<br/>they are secure, efficient and interoperable with other national and international security databases.  
<br/>This will improve our ability to share and analyse information, enhancing our collaborative efforts 
<br/>with international partners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the modernisation of our immigration processes also extends…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please round off, honourable Minister. Are you rounding off now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Yes, I am, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>195 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By digitising these processes, we can offer more accessible user-friendly services to visitors 
<br/>and potential residents, thereby, supporting our tourism industry and attracting foreign investment.  
<br/>At the same time, streamlined and transparent processes will reduce opportunities for corruption and 
<br/>malpractice, ensuring that our immigration system operates with the highest standards of integrity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  modernisation  of  our  immigration  technology  and  processes  is  an 
<br/>essential  step  in  our  broader  security  and  development  strategy.    It  reflects  our  commitment  to 
<br/>upholding the rule of law, protecting our citizens, and ensuring that Fiji remains a welcoming and 
<br/>secure destination for legitimate travellers and residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  weaving  together  the  various  strands  of  our  discussion, 
<br/>from  fortifying  national  security  and  modernising  defence  capabilities  to  enhancing  immigration 
<br/>processes and tackling the scourge of drugs and transnational crime, it is evident that our collective 
<br/>endeavour  is  both,  complex  and  critical.  Equally  important  is  our  unified  stance  against 
<br/>misinformation, particularly concerning the rise in crime rates, ensuring that our narrative remains 
<br/>anchored in truth and transparency under the Rabuka-led Coalition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us not forget that our ultimate goal transcends partisan lines - it is the security, prosperity 
<br/>and wellbeing of Fiji and its people. In this spirit, I extend a hand of collaboration to our colleagues 
<br/>across the aisle, inviting them to join us in this noble pursuit. Together, we can build a stronger, more 
<br/>resilient Fiji, where every citizen feels safe, valued and empowered.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  v</span><span>inaka  vakalevu</span><span>  and  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  to 
<br/>articulate our collective vision and reaffirm our dedication to the betterment of our beloved Fiji and 
<br/>its people. I support the motion by the honourable Prime Minister and thank His Excellency for his 
<br/>most gracious Speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much, honourable Tikoduadua. I can understand where 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Maharaj is coming from because afterall, you two were buddies at one time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime Ministers and Ministers  and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise to contribute to the 
<br/>debate on the motion in the name of the honourable Prime Minister  that is before Parliament, which 
<br/>is to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I just quickly remind the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and 
<br/></span><span>Immigration that we have no tree that has fruits that are all sweet that we can handover. If you cry 
<br/></span><span>about the sour one, it will remain sour. If you add a bit of salt or sugar, you may be able to eat it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Sir, instead of complaining, please, do something.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the day His Excellency spoke to us, I was reminded of a memory photo 
<br/>on my </span><span>Facebook</span><span> page eight years ago in a New Zealand Military helicopter as we were travelling to 
<br/></span><span>the devastated areas  ravaged by  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>  to  assess the best  way  we  could  provide  emergency 
<br/></span><span>assistance and help those in need. Fiji led by the Government then stood together, united and tackled 
<br/>the huge task at hand, to provide some immediate relief and build back better, and some still ongoing 
<br/>today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, amazingly only a few months later in August of the same year, the nation 
<br/>came together again as one and cheered our Fiji Sevens Team on to its first ever Olympic Goal Medal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  COVID-19,  the  same  happened.    We  united  as  a  nation,  and  through  some  strong 
<br/>decisive leadership by Government then and operators at the operational and tactical level, we came 
<br/>through. The strategy to expose the virus, through testing, eliminate the virus through isolation and 
<br/>vaccinate, worked. We came through and our economy grew.  We became the fifth fastest growing 
<br/>economy in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I recall these events to highlight an important, if not, the most important 
<br/>point, at least, in my view, of His Excellency’s Speech to us and, that is, I quote: “As leaders, we are 
<br/>required to leave aside our differences for the common good of our people.”  His Excellency, went 
<br/>further to say, and I quote: “We must focus on our shared destiny and commonality rather than our 
<br/>small differences.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have highlighted through my recollection of those past events, we, as a 
<br/>nation, have shown that we can do what His Excellency was imploring us to do. We have done so in 
<br/>the past. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency’s  Speech  to  this  august  Chamber  also  comes  at  a  time  when  our  nation  is 
<br/>facing some major issues.  There is an exodus of Fijians from Fiji to other countries overseas seeking 
<br/>employment, education, and there are those who are migrating.  There is a general shortage of skilled 
<br/>workers.  There is brain drain as well as it was very well articulated by my colleague, the honourable 
<br/>Virendra Lal yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government put in place policies to reverse that brain drain and turn it into a 
<br/>brain drain gain where former Fijians can come back and invest in our country.  This Government, it 
<br/>looks like it will be brain drain gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a sharp rise in crime.  Drugs is at a crisis level.  Yesterday, my 
<br/>colleague, honourable Tuinaceva, highlighted the very unfortunate case of the high number of deaths 
<br/>on our road. The economy is slowing down to 3 percent this year according to IMF.  Life is generally 
<br/>hard on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency’s Speech also comes after a little over one year of the Coalition Government 
<br/>in  power.    So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  Coalition  Government,  it  is  time  for  you  to  defend  your 
<br/>record.  The only problem is that there is very little record, if any at all, to defend. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- This must be the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why they are just trying to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lay blame on FijiFirst to cover their doing very little or nothing at all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after listening to the other side for the past two days, it seems that the other 
<br/>side of Parliament interprets working together or walking across the aisle as a ticket to not being 
<br/>criticised.  Sadly, I have to remind them that it is not the case.  In this, the people’s Parliament, they 
<br/>will be criticized.  You will be asked tough questions by us on this side of Parliament and the sole 
<br/>Government backbencher. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  And  I  hope,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  heard  the  very  wise 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>suggestions from their Government backbencher to them yesterday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You worry about your 16 years.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>197 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  It  is  just  too  bad,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  they  wanted  to  make 
<br/>themselves all Ministers and Assistant Ministers and they missed out on the value of good governance 
<br/>backbenchers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Absolutely! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you well know, the legislature has an oversight 
<br/>role on the Executive.  You are very well aware of this, Sir, and that is why we will never shy away 
<br/>from our job of oversight. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  situation  on  law  and  order  in  the  country 
<br/>demands some urgent attention. There is a growing lack of confidence in our Police Force both, in 
<br/>their capacity to do their law enforcement work and on the integrity within the Force. The recent 
<br/>arrests that included serving Police Officers on the allegation of tampering with the recently seized 
<br/>hard drugs kept as exhibits is quite worrying.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that there is a rot that is setting in the Police Force, and I sincerely 
<br/>hope that I am  wrong.   If there is  a rot, it needs to  be fixed quickly because, Sir, to  successfully 
<br/>smuggle high value contraband like hard drugs into or through a country, a secret segment of the 
<br/>society  is  created  -  the  drivers,  the  transporters,  the  lookouts,  the  sellers,  the  bankers,  and  when 
<br/>enforcement officers or officials become part of that secret segment of the society, the problem is 
<br/>almost impossible to crush, as he had wanted to do when the drugs were discovered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister’s recent comments in the media that drug networks operated with 
<br/>impurity under the previous Administration is quite irresponsible, given the hard work carried out by 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force over the years to fight drugs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I call on the honourable Minister publicly and I call on him again here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in this Chamber to provide evidence to justify his claim.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me remind the honourable Minister in this Parliament of some facts in 2019.  The Fiji 
<br/>Police  Force  established  the  first  ever  Narcotics  Bureau  to  ramp  up  the  fight  against  drugs  and 
<br/></span><span>specialist training was provided to Police Officers to deal with drug-related cases.  Capabilities have 
<br/></span><span>also been enhanced over the years to assist the Police to combat this drug problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Anti-Drug operations across Fiji over the years have resulted in the seizure of green and hard 
<br/>drugs  worth  millions  of  dollars  and  the  perpetrators  have  been  convicted.    According  to  media 
<br/>reports, in 2019, police uncovered a methamphetamine lab in a nightclub in Nadi.  A small-scale 
<br/>methamphetamine lab was also discovered in 2013 and in 2015 in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Way back in 2004, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Police found chemicals big enough to produce 2,200 
<br/></span><span>pounds of crystal methamphetamine in a factory outside Suva.  So, I am not so sure where this ‘doing 
<br/></span><span>nothing’ in the past is coming from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fight against drug is and will continue to be an ongoing operation and it will be a big 
<br/>chunk of the Police Force enforcement work.  Other countries have taken a step further to set up 
<br/>border force to tackle contraband smuggling.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last thing the Police Force need is political interference, which is very evident right now, 
<br/>and I had call out the honourable Minister for Home Affairs publicly on this issue a few times. The 
<br/>Fiji  Police  Force  and  other  enforcement  agencies  need  to  be  resourced,  not  interfered  with.  
<br/>Unfortunately, nothing significant was provided for them in the last Budget.  I hope that there will 
<br/>be an improvement in the next Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the call by honourable Radrodro yesterday to the honourable Pime 
<br/>Minister for Fiji to withdraw its position and its support to Israel’s occupation of and actions in Gaza. 
<br/>This  position  harms  Fiji’s  international  reputation  as  a  peacekeeping  nation  that  is  committed  to 
<br/>lasting peace in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our international reputation as peacekeepers is built on the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>Military  Force’s  professionalism  and  experience.    Our  international  reputation  as  a  peacekeeping 
<br/>nation is equally premised on our ability to stay neutral in regions where Fijian peacekeepers are 
<br/>deployed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  only  by  being  neutral  will  we  be  seen  as  credible  by  the  parties  to  the 
<br/>conflict. Some legal scholars describe our submission as overstepping international law. Perhaps, the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General can enlighten us tomorrow as to who drafted Fiji’s submission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji’s  explicit  support  to  one  party  to  the  conflict  has  diminished  and 
<br/>compromised  our  peacekeeping  reputation  and  high  standing  not  only  in  the  Middle  East  but 
<br/>worldwide, and especially in the Global South. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  highlighted  by  honourable  Radrodro  yesterday,  Fiji’s  stand  at  the 
<br/>International Court of Justice (ICJ) puts our peacekeepers in harm’s way. Yes, there is always an 
<br/>inherent risk to the lives of peacekeepers when they are deployed to peacekeeping missions, as is 
<br/>well known to the former peacekeepers who are in this Chamber.  But taking the side of one party 
<br/>makes  you  an  enemy  to  the  other,  and  I  am  talking  about  the  lives  of  fathers,  mothers,  wives, 
<br/>husbands, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Some, in this Chamber, might even have close relatives serving in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Middle-East missions right now.  My youngest son is currently serving in Iraq.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me turn to something that happened yesterday, and you may have been 
<br/></span><span>listening.    I  was  disheartened  when  after  honourable  Ketan  Lal  asked  his  question  to  the  three 
<br/>Ministers yesterday, the answer came in a form that, sort of, said, ‘how dare you ask that question’.  
<br/>It was followed by a lecture on how he should behave, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those questions where merely questions on transparency and they required 
<br/>simple answers, perhaps, just a ‘yes’ or ‘no’.  I am pretty sure that if they had asked the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister whether they should answer those questions, they would have got a very short and 
<br/>sharp simple military style answer of just saying answer the question and clear your name.  By the 
<br/></span><span>way, we did not cook up those questions on this side. It came from the people, obviously, those who 
<br/></span><span>saw  and  witnessed  and  when  the  people  ask,  they  deserve  an  answer  because  transparency  is  a 
<br/>principle of democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  was  even  more  sickening  to  me  personally  yesterday  was  when 
<br/>honourable Tuinaceva used as an example the words that were spoken publicly  in  a Government 
<br/>organised public consultation on Local Government on 25</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, to highlight the

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>problem of racial hatred rearing its ugly head again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It has nothing to do with the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Make it shown. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- The Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Minister of Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics accused him of inciting racial disharmony. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker wisely ruled against it yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Very bad! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I and other honourable Members in this Parliament 
<br/>have seen the result of racial hatred when it manifests into physical violence.  Racial hatred is the 
<br/>biggest barrier to harmonious and peaceful coexistence in our multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-
<br/>religious nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  had  warned  about  racism  last  year  during  my  Maiden  Speech  in  this 
<br/>Parliament and the incident that honourable Tuinaceva was referring to happened just a few months 
<br/>later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics can choose to bury his head in the sand and 
<br/>pretend that nothing is happening when it comes to racial hatred and racism, and that does not bother 
<br/>me at all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Not just one way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- The reason is that, he is only one, there are 26 of us on this side who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will fight racism and racial discrimination. We will call it out. We will warn people about it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FijiFirst stands for equal citizenry, and we will continue to fight for equality 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for all in this Parliament and outside of this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order!  No banging of the table, please, honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the one question that all that voted for us, those who 
<br/>gave us the privilege to occupy the seats we currently occupy, the 42.55 percent of voters who gave 
<br/>us 26 seats, the 8.89 percent of voters who gave National Federation Party five seats…   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 58 percent said, ‘no’. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- …the 35.82 percent of voters who gave People’s Alliance Party 21 
<br/></span><span>seats and the 5.14 percent of voters who gave SODELPA three seats and even those who did not 
<br/>vote, all asked the same simple question; What are you doing to make lives better? And the answer 
<br/>is, given this Government’s one-year record, it is very little to nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure that the people are fed up with the rhetoric from the other side that FijiFirst did this, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst did not do that, and it just goes on and on because there is very little…

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is the fact.

<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- … that the Coalition Government is doing to better your lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- We are fixing your mess.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will end by echoing to this Parliament, again, the 
<br/>voice of the people.  They are asking, what are you doing to make lives better?  Thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant  Ministers, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>Opposition,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  all  those  watching  online  and  the  television 
<br/>viewers here this afternoon; </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and good afternoon to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  His  Excellency  the  President  along  with  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and the Minister for Education have informed this august Parliament about the commitment 
<br/>of the Coalition Government to education.  Today, I stand to reiterate the same message, education 
<br/>is  the  cornerstone  of  development  in  any  economy  and  Fiji  is  no  exception.    Please  allow  me  to 
<br/>expand the issues that affect the Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  </span><span>Denarau  Declaration</span><span>  emanating  from  the  Education  Summit  would 
<br/>now form the basis of the future direction of the Fiji education sector.  At the heart of that declaration, 
<br/>there are seven thematic areas based on the Terms of Reference of the Fiji Education Commission 
<br/>which has gone through public consultation on Wednesday last week.  Based on this, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, a paper would be drafted to be discussed in Cabinet in the coming days for the roll out of the 
<br/>Education Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the second important challenge that awaits our action is to have a home 
<br/>grown  education  programme  that  not  only  induces  a  strong  sense  of  civic  pride,  patriotism  and 
<br/>productive  citizenry  but  one  that  also  prepares  a  future  workforce  to  meet  the  demands  of  the 
<br/>domestic  and  international  markets  here  and  abroad.  We  will  continue  to  assist  in  the  process  of 
<br/>nation building through education and improving the lives of our fellow kith and kin. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  third  dimension  is  improving  the  actual  classroom  environment,  its 
<br/>physical and social infrastructure pertaining to teaching and learning.  This is in ensuring that we 
<br/></span><span>have  adequate  teachers,  improve  our  pupil:teacher  ratio,  boost  student  morale,  provide  for  the 
<br/></span><span>security  of  teachers  and  students  and  importantly,  improve  the  welfare  of  those  engaged  in  the 
<br/>process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot the fact that more than 90 percent of our schools are faith-based 
<br/>education institutions.  We cannot and must not follow the footsteps of the previous Government in 
<br/>undermining and diluting the foundation values... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  …of  these  faith-based  schools.  The  People’s  Coalition 
<br/>Government is fully committed in upholding those values and we will support everyone to enhance 
<br/>the  same  way  moving  forward.    The  Coalition  Government  is  on  record  of  living  by  its  noble 
<br/>commitments and in respect of the education sector, our budgetary allocations, pragmatic leadership 
<br/>and steps taken to ensure that we provide education for all, speaks volume about itself.  I do not think 
<br/>one needs to  belabour this point as teachers and  students  find themselves in  a more free and just

<div><span>environment for teaching and learning than the period of cynicism in the last 16 years of the last 
<br/>administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the regularization as per MCS Circular 2/2024 and 5/2024, we at the 
<br/>Ministry  are  effectively  correcting  the  irregularities,  inhumane,  inconsistent  and  haphazard 
<br/>appointment processes that was implemented by honourable Hem Chand during his term when he 
<br/>was head of Human Resources at the Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Assistant Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 62. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, are you speaking to me or to him? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- To you, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think he is misleading Parliament; it is not me. He has mentioned my name. It is the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Education. He has mentioned my name, he should withdraw that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Assistant Minister, that Point of Order has been raised on your  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mentioning his name.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He said he was there before. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he was at the administrative during that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  now  correcting  the  wrong  subject 
<br/>combinations for Head of Department (HOD) appointments. For example, a graduate in Commerce 
<br/></span><span>was appointed to HOD Social Science, how was this allowed when there were many others?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  the  prolonged  acting  appointments  of  officers;  officers  acting  here,  there  and 
<br/>everywhere. It was like Hollywood and maybe Bollywood. The officers in the last government would 
<br/>be transferred from pillar to post at the whims of Directors like the FijiFirst was doing for the last 16 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the removal of three counsellor positions was 
<br/>ill conceived, poorly planned and negatively impacted our children.  We are in the process of re-
<br/>instating the Divisional Counsellors and will introduce counsellors in each of the nine districts and 
<br/>appoint counsellors to the large primary and secondary schools throughout Fiji.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are now also correcting the separation of teacher couples. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we continue 
<br/>to be inundated with requests to reunite couples and families.  The last administration must have had 
<br/>a quota of families that needed to be broken up when they were making appointments within the 
<br/>Ministry of Education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  was  also  a  complete  disregard  in  ensuring  ethnic  balance  in  all  our  primary  and 
<br/>secondary schools.  Every appointment or suggestion to HR fell on deaf ears.  The fact that remains 
<br/>that vernacular must be taught at the primary school level and evidence suggests that those whose 
<br/>mother tongue of the vernacular  being  taught should  be the teachers.  In  the last administration,  I 
<br/>believe the honourable Members on the other side disregarded that when they were in the Ministry 
<br/>controlling from the last 16 years in office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Another massive exercise that we embarked on is the review of 
<br/>School  Classification.    I  ask  the  honourable  Members  in  the  Opposition,  how  can  an  Assistant 
<br/>Principal in a small school with a population of 100 students be paid exactly the same salary as the 
<br/>AP in a large school with a student population of 1,100 students?  How was this done? I urge the 
<br/>honourable Opposition Members not to mislead the people of Fiji in this regards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  will  also  be  establishing  HOD  positions  in  schools.  In  2023,  we 
<br/>established  60  HOD  positions  and  remunerated  them  accordingly.    This  year  we  will  establish 
<br/>approximately185 HOD positions.  In the last government, the acting HODs in various schools is an 
<br/>unestablished position where they were doing the work without any remuneration. This is modern 
<br/>day slavery, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry embraces the work before us.  We are implementing decisions 
<br/>and plans based on facts and we will  continue to do so in  line with  the policies of our Coalition 
<br/>Government.  Another fact that I wish to draw the attention of this august Parliament to, is the Pacific 
<br/>Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA) 2021 Report.  The PILNA data shows that the 
<br/>score for Year 4 students in 2021 was lower than in the previous PILNA cycle, PILNA  2018.  The 
<br/>report  also  showed  that  approximately  66  percent  of  Year  4  students  in  Fiji,  two  out  of  three 
<br/>performed at or above the expected level which is three to eight in the PILNA Report 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Schools were closed- COVID-19. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU.- Conversely, approximately 34 percent of the students, one out of 
<br/></span><span>three performed below the expected proficiency level, which is level zero to two.  In other words, 
<br/>even though most Year 4 students were meeting the minimum expected level for numeracy but this 
<br/>is a significant proportion (34 percent) who are yet to meet this level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PILNA findings support intervention in Fiji education system with the goal 
<br/>of strengthening our numeracy, reading and writing instruction leading to improved student learning 
<br/>outcomes.  Other data sets such as that from the World Bank and our very own Status of Education 
<br/>Report  2023  tell  a  bleak  story.    We  are  actively  working  on  changing  this  narrative  with  a  clear 
<br/></span><span>system, processes, transparency and accountability that is now only seen in our beloved Fiji after 16 
<br/></span><span>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  has  also  invested  heavily  in  the  much  talked 
<br/>about literacy and numeracy rate in Fiji as revealed by the regional educational authority body in the 
<br/>PILNA results, as mentioned earlier. I would like to reassure this august Parliament that apart from 
<br/>strengthening our Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) programme in school and the reading unit set

<div><span>up in the Curriculum Advisory Service, we as a Ministry have also extended investment in the library 
<br/>unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Education  advocates  exposure  to  reading  materials  at  an  early  age  to 
<br/>complement the literacy and numeracy curriculum in collaboration with the Australian Government.  
<br/>We have now ventured into community library.  This has begun in a few communities.  An example 
<br/>of  the  success  of  the  partnership  with  community  library  is  the  big  improvement  in  the  Year  8 
<br/>examination results of one of the primary schools in the Eastern Division that was once classified as 
<br/>underperforming school.  We will invest in a mobile library that used to be a practice in the past.  For 
<br/>the rural  communities, we are having  community library set  up.  For our urban students,  we will 
<br/>partner with other government ministries and ensure that we provide adequate reading and student 
<br/>support spaces in the local halls and the communities Fiji wide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the digital world that we are in now, we will need to encourage our 
<br/>children to develop reading habits because most of us sitting in this room will agree with me, and we 
<br/>know too well the benefits of reading and the positive impact it will have on our children who are 
<br/>the future leaders of our nation.  I also want to bring to the attention of this august Parliament, the 
<br/>effort that the Ministry of Education is implementing on accessibility to education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Asset  and  Infrastructure  Services  Unit  continues  to  ensure  that  all  schools  are  either 
<br/>rebuilding or renovating its building adhere to the standard Category 5 disaster resilient structures.  
<br/>Due to climate change, the Ministry has included Disaster Risk and Resilience staff to ensure that 
<br/>the Ministry of Education provides, facilitates and promotes the teaching, learning, administration 
<br/>and  management  of  education  in  Emergencies  and  School  Based  Disaster  Risk  Reduction 
<br/>Programme in the country in accordance with the Ministry’s policies and guidelines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry continues to deliver boats and engines to support 
<br/>student’s transportation to school.  Let me enlighten Parliament that the Permanent Secretary visited 
<br/>the school whereby its students were swimming across the flooded river last two weeks ago in the 
<br/>interior of Viti Levu.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bridge… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Assistant Minister, there is a Point of Order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Standing  Order  60  -  Relevance.    I  thought  we  were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answering to His Excellency’s Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Hold on, let me check. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Prime Minister you are better than honourable Gavoka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  here  to  acknowledge  His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency’s Speech on last Monday and not a Ministerial Statement to figure out or to outlay a work 
<br/></span><span>of a Ministry, please.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Koroilavesau, see we must be happy because he 
<br/>has taken us to Hollywood, Bollywood and now we are coming back.  Continue, honourable Assistant 
<br/>Minister.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  continue  to  deliver  boats  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engines to support students’ transportation to school.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the bridge has been unrepaired since  </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>  in  2016.  The FijiFirst 
<br/>Government  in  2018  campaigned  fervently  in  this  are,  they  have  got  the  vote  but  failed  again  to 
<br/>deliver to the people in the Wainimala areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  the  visit  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  Education  and  Permanent 
<br/>Secretary  of  Rural  Development  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  officers  from  the  Assets  and 
<br/>Infrastructure Unit, we will pursue the building of the bridge and the overall improvement of road 
<br/>infrastructure in this area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Some populations in that area cross the river 27 times to reach 
<br/>education, market and health services.  I wonder how Members from across the floor would fare if 
<br/>they or their children had to cross the cold Wainimala River at least twice a day as early as 5 a.m. to 
<br/>get to work or get to public transportation.  I am certain that they would not fare well at all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has invested in the purchase of three tractors supplied to three 
<br/>Government schools to start with.  The massive land mass need mechanisation for productivity and 
<br/>savings for those boarding schools.  The schools will not only produce its vegetables and root crops 
<br/>to save money but also teach these young people at boarding schools the importance of eating fresh 
<br/>local  produce  and  the  importance  of  the  agriculture  in  our  economy  as  this  can  be  a  source  of 
<br/>livelihood as well for them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  financial  literacy  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  one  of  the  eight 
<br/>curriculum  perspective  in  the  National  Curriculum  Framework  (NCF).    Financial  Education  is 
<br/>incorporated in English, Math and Social Science at the Primary levels 1 to level 8, at Secondary 
<br/>levels from Year 9 and Year 10 in Commercial Studies and Year 11 and Year 12 in Math, Accounting, 
<br/>Economics and English.  Smart with Money Zone Programme, an evolving Ministry of Education 
<br/>Initiative.  This is work in progress.  The Ministry’s Curriculum Advisory Services (CAS) is working 
<br/>on this project.  The programme involves parents creating an account which we call a “Money Zone 
<br/>Account” for their children with a minimum deposit so that the children can start owning an account 
<br/>and managing their own money as they grow up in our beloved Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, education is everyone’s business in today’s modern world and 
<br/></span><span>we  ask  the  Members  of  this  august  Parliament  to  bring  something  positive  to  contribute  to 
<br/>accessibility of our education here in Fiji.  May God bless us all and may God bless Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I call on the next speaker who is the Assistant Minister in the Office 
<br/>of the Prime Minister may I just acknowledge the presence of former Assistant Minister sitting in the 
<br/>gallery, not forgetting the old man from Kalabu behind honourable Aseri Radrodro and Mr. Felix 
<br/>Magnus as well who is the Special Administrator of Nasinu Town Council.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition,  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>fellow Fijians present here today and those connecting on livestream.  I also wish to warmly welcome 
<br/>the Women’s Dorcas Ministry from the Suvavou Village who are here with us this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I begin, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to raise a few issues with regards to what has 
<br/>been raised by the Opposition.  I find the intervention by honourable Naupoto very contradictory.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>205 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As he had known, that in 2019 the FijiFirst opposed the motion to investigate the causes of the drug 
<br/>problem in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Following that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, their leader, Mr. Voreqe Bainimarama 
<br/>assaulted honourable Pio Tikoduadua, of course most of the Members who are here voted him out.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  drug  problem  in  Fiji  is  a  direct  neglect  of  the  previous  FijiFirst 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT  MEMBER.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  the  last  two  days  we  have  heard  from  the 
<br/>Opposition their  very generalist and exaggerated claims 
<br/>of 
<br/>Government to the increase in migration of people overseas. Mr. Speaker, Sir, they had no clue of 
<br/>what is going on. They have no idea of what is being done in this country.  They should be aware 
<br/>that following COVID…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>shamefully 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>policies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>linking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let us listen to the honourable Assistant Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they should be knowing that after COVID-19…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am still speaking, honourable Assistant Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I said that it is best that we listen first to the honourable Assistant Minister. If you want to 
<br/>make comments just hold it for a while until he finishes. You have had your chance, let us give him 
<br/>the opportunity to present what he has prepared. You may continue, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, following COVID-19, there was an open market out 
<br/></span><span>there in Australia and New Zealand and most of our people migrated because of increased salaries. 
<br/></span><span>The Opposition’s claim on the reasons that they have raised with regards to the increased migration 
<br/>is bogus and misleading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  an  issue  that  was  raised  yesterday  by  one  of  the 
<br/>Opposition Members on the statutes for the Council CEOs.  It is essential to clarify that majority of 
<br/>the Council’s CEOs are reaching the end of their term in office and the honourable Minister for Local 
<br/>Government is committed to ensuring a transparent and accountable process for their replacement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To achieve that, the Ministry has meticulously developed the Terms of Reference (TOR) and 
<br/></span><span>Expressions of Interest (EOI) for the engagement of a reputable recruitment agency.  The Councils 
<br/>will collaborate to oversee this process and upon engaging the recruitment agency, then we will work 
<br/>very closely with the Special Administrators to initiate the recruitment of new CEOs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise in this august Parliament to respond to His Excellency the President’s 
<br/>Address.  I would like to thank His Excellency the President for his inspiring and thought-provoking 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Address that was delivered on Monday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are so blessed in Fiji to have such a high chief of high calibre, </span><span>na Turaga 
<br/>Bale na Tui </span><span>Macuata,</span><span> Taukei Bolatagane”</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>who has earned the respect of everyone, including the 
<br/>different races that have called Fiji home.  In addition, as Members of this august Parliament, we 
<br/>should all continue to strive and be conscious of the need to address the relevant needs of the different 
<br/>races that live in this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to share some of the work that I have been undertaking at the 
<br/>Office of the Prime Minister.  When the Coalition Government came into power, one of the saddest 
<br/>things that we noted was the lack of data on where the poor people really live.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was attributed mainly to the previous Government’s inability to provide 
<br/>relevant and reliable statistics on the status of poverty in this country.  Certainly, I fully concur with 
<br/>His Excellency the President when he requested us as democratically elected representatives to listen 
<br/>to the voices of the people, not only those who had elected us but all our citizens, young and old, 
<br/>men and women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we assumed office, we were inundated with calls from some of the 
<br/>poorest  communities  in  Suva,  that  they  needed  to  be  further  supported  with  assistance  from 
<br/>Government.  Instead of taking a knee jerk reaction, we thought that it would be wise to undertake a 
<br/>detailed survey of these communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In June 2023, the Office of the Prime Minister engaged the Fiji Council of Social Services 
<br/>(FCOSS)  to  conduct  a  survey  on  23  informal  settlements  and  poor  communities  along  the  Suva-
<br/>Nausori corridor.  The 23 communities are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Narocake;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Nukutubu;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Kalekana;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Manikoso;  
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>Bali;  
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Marata;  
<br/>7.</span><span> </span><span>Vataleka;  
<br/>8.</span><span> </span><span>Koio;  
<br/>9.</span><span> </span><span>Korolailai;  
<br/></span><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>Wai;  
<br/></span><span>11.</span><span> </span><span>Wairua;  
<br/>12.</span><span> </span><span>Naivikinikini;  
<br/>13.</span><span> </span><span>Valenicina;  
<br/>14.</span><span> </span><span>Rewa;  
<br/>15.</span><span> </span><span>Matata;  
<br/>16.</span><span> </span><span>Naikotokoto;  
<br/>17.</span><span> </span><span>Bua 1;  
<br/>18.</span><span> </span><span>Bua 2;  
<br/></span><span>19.</span><span> </span><span>Matainiborosisi;  
<br/></span><span>20.</span><span> </span><span>Veiraisi;  
<br/>21.</span><span> </span><span>Nabuli Settlement;  
<br/>22.</span><span> </span><span>Naisogowaluvu; and  
<br/>23.</span><span> </span><span>Newtown.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this project, FCOSS went out into these communities to discuss  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and identify their needs, and to conduct community assessments which identified local development 
<br/>challenges.  These challenges were grouped into six categories which included the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environmental Degradation and Risks; 
<br/>Infrastructure and Safety; 
<br/>Education, Health Services and Leadership; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Governance and Social Cohesion; and 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic and Livelihood. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I was briefed on the findings of the Community Assessment Project 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in December last year, I was deeply troubled and burdened.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  you  would  be  surprised  to  note  that  the  data  collected  from  the  23 
<br/>communities along the Lami-Nausori corridor reflected that some Fijian households lack the most 
<br/>basic of household amenities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have Fijians living just an earshot away from our towns and cities in the 
<br/>Central Division that are still using pit toilets.  There are even some households that do not have any 
<br/>toilets and share with their neighbours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, a meeting of the relevant key stakeholders was convened to strategize on 
<br/>how Government could work collaboratively with other NGOs and the private sector to tackle the 
<br/>issues highlighted in the survey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other  issues  highlighted  is  the  frequent  water  disruptions,  unhygienic  waste  disposal, 
<br/>infrastructural issues such as access roads, bridges and health centres, limited access to electricity, 
<br/>social problems like drugs and substance abuse, sex trafficking and crime, security of land tenure and 
<br/>overcrowding, and lack of governance structures in informal settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  result  of  the  survey,  we  have  identified  two  communities  -  Bilo  and 
<br/>Matainiborosisi in Lami, that have been without water for the last 20 years.  Despite being 15 minutes 
<br/>from  Suva  City,  they  are  not  connected  to  any  water  supply.  We  then  took  this  matter  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport and Meteorological Services to put these projects 
<br/>into the pipeline. These two communities will have access to regular water by the end of the year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my Maiden Speech last year, I highlighted the need to address the plight 
<br/></span><span>of descendants of the Melanesians who are currently living in Fiji, more particularly is to explore 
<br/>how the Government can formalise existing land tenancy to ensure that they have more permanent 
<br/>tenancy  arrangements.  To  this  effect,  Government  has  established  an  Inter-Ministerial  Taskforce 
<br/>under the administrative and policy oversight of the Office of the Pime Minister, to oversee and be 
<br/>responsible for the implementation of this initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  started  our  consultation  with  the  three  communities  that  are  in 
<br/>Wailoku, Namara and Matata. We will be finalising the proposal for Wailoku in the next two months.  
<br/></span><span>Sir, as for Matata, the land that they are currently occupying is now included as part of Lami Village.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. – Please declare your interest, honourable Assistant Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA. -  We are indeed thankful to the two Yavusa in Lami – </span><span>Yavusa Nasevou</span><span>
<br/>and  </span><span>Yavusa  Nakurukuru</span><span>,  for  their  generosity  in  accommodating  the  Melanesian  settlements  of 
<br/>Matata.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most of the time, we take the generosity of the landowners for granted but 
<br/>they are fulfilling the role that has to be played by Government which is providing land for those 
<br/>who are in need to be resettled. There are so many landowners, particularly in the urban areas of Fiji 
<br/>who, out of their good faith, provided their land to house other communities. These landowners are 
<br/>namely, those from Kalabu, Tamavua, Suvavou, Kuku, Nausori, Namoli, Naviyago, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sad reality is that most of these landowners suffer silently in poverty but 
<br/>they do not admit it.  When you talk to them privately, they will say life is difficult, </span><span>‘sa rui dredre 
<br/>  inaka  ’. </span><span> Sir, Government  is  hearing their voices,  and we will strongly  consider establishing  a 
<br/>special fund to compensate the landowners for giving their land to be used by other communities in 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, late last year, the Office of the Prime Minister received complaints from 
<br/>Indo-Fijian  families  around  Suva  that  youths  from  squatter  settlements  are  terrorising  them  and 
<br/>stealing green coconuts from their backyard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in January this year, the Office of the Prime Minister organised a ‘Green 
<br/>Coconut Replanting Workshop’ at Vakacoko in Naboro, to increase the supply of green coconuts in 
<br/>the Suva-Nausori corridor. This has not been done by anyone, including your Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Those youth who were previously terrorising Indo-Fijian families will 
<br/>now be able to access the green coconuts that will be planted there.  It is expected that about 10,000 
<br/>coconut seednuts will be planted at Naboro in the next two years and, of course, we are very grateful 
<br/>to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  for  supplying  the  coconut  seednuts  and  organic 
<br/>fertilizer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, environmental degradation, particularly soil erosion in rivers and watershed 
<br/>areas, remain to be one of the biggest problems.  If you travel around the interior of Fiji, along the 
<br/>Sigatoka River and along the Ba River, you will notice this environmental problem.  This problem 
<br/>has been there for more than 20 years but there has been no concerted effort to undertake to rectify 
<br/>the issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this has been made worse by the FijiFirst Government when they created 
<br/>the Ministry of Waterways from the Drainage and Irrigation Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.  
<br/></span><span>Previously, they used to have their engineers – Principal Engineers and Senior Engineers.   However, 
<br/></span><span>when Dr. Mahendra Reddy was the Minister for Agriculture and Waterways, he converted all the 
<br/>engineering posts to administrative posts and there is currently no engineering capacity within the 
<br/>Department to execute these responsibilities.  This is the legacy of the FijiFirst Government.  We 
<br/>have  a  degraded  watershed  system  and  increased  soil  erosion  with  increasing  flooding  in  all  our 
<br/>towns, and we have very limited capacity for people to design new rivers and watershed areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, some honourable Members in the Opposition have commented on the new 
<br/>National  Development  Plan  that  will  facilitate  practical  solutions  to  the  economic  and  social 
<br/></span><span>challenges faced by our people.  We, the Coalition Government, will implement this plan to ensure 
<br/></span><span>that there is lasting progress. We are going down to communities and consulting with them to solicit 
<br/>their voices.  This will be a successful plan, as compared to some of the plans that were formulated 
<br/>by the previous Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  in  2016,  the  FijiFirst  Government  formulated  a  20-year  National 
<br/>Development Plan.  If you look at some of the targets that were set, for the annual average growth 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>209 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>rate from 2016 to 2021, the target that was set was 4 percent to 5 percent, but the actual that was 
<br/>achieved was -1.8 percent.  If you look at the Government debt, the target was to reduce to 35 percent 
<br/>of GDP by 2036.  The actual that was achieved from 2016 to 2021 was around 60 percent.  These 
<br/>figures, again, reveal the poor economic management of the FijiFirst Government.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, when you pay a visit to Lautoka and Ba areas, one of the common problems 
<br/>highlighted by the community members is the extreme destruction of termites on the structures of 
<br/>their residences.  The sad thing about this situation, Sir, is that  no one knows anything or how to 
<br/>address it.  Most of the information that we receive was from local  experts who do not have full 
<br/>knowledge of the technology to address the problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government, for the first time in the history, is recognising the plight of our 
<br/>communities in  Lautoka and Ba, and we have  allocated a provision  of $3 million  to  assist  in  the 
<br/>eradication of termites.  We will be providing free baits to those that have shown evidence of termite 
<br/>destruction, and at the same time, those families that earn less than $30,000 can apply for a relief 
<br/>fund of $5,000 to purchase housing materials.  Those who have an income less than $50,000 will 
<br/>have access to $2,000, which they can use to purchase housing materials.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  again,  I  wish  to  emphasise  that  this  Coalition  Government  cares  for  its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people, and we will do our utmost best to reach out and directly serve the needs of our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue of drugs, the increase in the availability of synthetic drugs such 
<br/>as, Methamphetamine, is a great concern.  The recent seizure of large quantities of Methamphetamine 
<br/>has brought home the message that drugs is here to stay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Marijuana is widely available in most of our communities and we should make every effort 
<br/>to address this issue.  Unfortunately, for the last 16 years, there has been no new initiatives undertaken 
<br/>to  address  this problem.   When  we went  around  the marijuana planting  areas in  the highlands of 
<br/>Noikoro, one of the things that they raised is the lack of introduction of alternative crops that they 
<br/>can grow.  They have raised this with the previous Government, but it has fallen on deaf ears.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last few weeks, you might have noted that we have introduced a new crop in Noikoro, 
<br/>which is the planting of coffee.  We would like to thank the Indonesian Government for the provision 
<br/>of US$25,000 to support the “Smallholder Coffee Project”.  We are going to introduce this in the 
<br/>highlands of Navosa, Savatu, Bukuya, so that people have other alternative crops to plant and, of 
<br/>course, to cultivate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally endorse His Excellency the President’s call to protect and preserve 
<br/>our traditions, culture and language to promote social cohesion amongst the different communities.  
<br/>I  totally  agree  with  this,  but  I  certainly  believe  that  we  need  to  enhance  the  capacity  of  our 
<br/>communities first.  There is a need for strong focus on human and social capital whereby communities 
<br/>are empowered to improve the resilience and livelihoods of their communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On environment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the wellbeing of the Pacific region continues to be affected 
<br/>and threatened by the impacts of climate change.  The Pacific way of life and our cultures have been 
<br/></span><span>defined by the climate and our knowledge and experience of how to manage storms and cyclones 
<br/></span><span>which have impacted our people for generations.  But our resilience is now being tested as the trends 
<br/>and patterns that have defined our  experience  and knowledge continue to change.  We are in  the 
<br/>middle of a rising and warming ocean and the implications are no longer subtle.

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this head up on local climate change and national programmes and 
<br/>activities, I wish to thank His Excellency the President for his most gracious Address in formally 
<br/>opening Parliament. I fully support the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  We  shall  now  press  on,  honourable  Members.    We  have  three  more 
<br/>speakers and after we finish, you can probably have a relaxed time and enjoy your tea break.  Thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery, 
<br/>viewers who are listening in on television, tuning in live on the Parliament livestream, and fellow 
<br/>Fijians; </span><span>ni sa</span><span> </span><span> yadra   inaka saka</span><span> and a very good afternoon to you all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also wish to greet the people of Ra in the usual greetings of the Ra-ssians, “ </span><span>Sa yadra</span><span>”, either 
<br/>in the daylight or moonlight.  </span><span>Au vakayadra ‘iko yani ena vanua o Ra - ena vanua va’uraga o Saivou, 
<br/>Rakiraki, Nakoro’ubu kei Nalawa.  Ni sa yadra, ni ma’a vinaka mai. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  make  my  contribution  to  His  Excellency  the  President’s  most 
<br/>gracious  Address,  allow  me  to  offer  my  condolences  to  the  passing  away  of  the  late  Ratu  Osea 
<br/>Kasami, </span><span>Na i 'aukei Nacokula</span><span>, the Chairperson of the Bose Vanua o Ra, who was laid to rest at his 
<br/>village  in  Dranivau  last  Saturday.    I  also  wish  to  offer  my  condolences  to  the  Mata  Ni  Tikina  o 
<br/>Rakiraki, Mr. Senitiki Vunisa, who was also laid to rest last week at his home island in Malake.  Both 
<br/>gentlemen are very reliable, influential and true sons of Ra. </span><span>Drau qai vano iko ena vakacegu na i 
<br/>‘aukei Nacokula. Vinaka saka vakalevu na cola‘i ni  ‘avi ni vanua saka va‘uraga o Ra. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today to thank and deliver my response to His Excellency the President of the Republic 
<br/>of  Fiji,  </span><span>Na  Gone  Turaga  Bale  Na  Tui  </span><span>Macuata,  Ratu  Wiliame  Maivalili  Katonivere’s  most 
<br/>encouraging and inspirational gracious  Opening  Address  of the 2024 Session  of Parliament.   His 
<br/>Excellency made some very important points, the most important of which was unity and putting 
<br/>national interests above political gain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would say that the Speech by His Excellency was fitting to the 
<br/>vision of the high office and, that is, to be the pillar of national unity. It had encouraged and also 
<br/>advised us leaders of this Parliament on how to conduct ourselves in the coming year and also what 
<br/>our people are expecting from us as national leaders to be doing for the national good, public good, 
<br/></span><span>as well as those who look up to us as leaders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His most gracious Speech called for unity and also talked about wisdom as leaders, that we 
<br/>must possess in making deliberations and comments which we, as influential figures in the society, 
<br/>have power in our words and actions that people will learn from us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  at  pains  to  see  that  sadly,  tribalism  and  egoism  have  been  at  the 
<br/>forefront of national politics and governance by so called leaders over time who, instead of carrying 
<br/>out the crucial business of nation-building, they have contributed instead to tearing down peace, unity 
<br/></span><span>and stability because for them, their own status, their own pockets and their own families have been 
<br/></span><span>more important than that young person, young mother, farmer or villager who needs assistance and 
<br/>who went to the polls because they trusted that we would get to this august Parliament and be true to 
<br/>our words to look after their needs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, many of us get into Parliament and never go back to see the people 
<br/>who gave us their votes. Many of us engage in lies during election campaigns and we get votes using 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>211 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>misinformation and disinformation and these distortions confuse our vulnerable voters to vote for 
<br/>leaders who are only seen during election campaigns and disappear into the forest for the next four 
<br/>years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the business of entering Parliament must be a noble job. We should be role 
<br/>models to aspiring politicians who will come and stand in this very place where I am standing and 
<br/>advocate  for  the  ordinary  person  on  our  streets  and  in  our  communities.  Like  the  words  of  His 
<br/>Excellency, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“I  look  upon  the  honourable  Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  I  am  humbly 
<br/>reminded of the immense responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices 
<br/>and  aspirations  of  our  people.  As  democratically  elected  representatives,  I  ask  that  you 
<br/>listen to the voices of our people, not only those who elected you, but to all our citizens 
<br/>young and old, men and women.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must do away and denounce those politicians that tear down peace, unity 
<br/>and stability in this august Parliament. We must denounce the personalisation of attacks against other 
<br/>politicians,  especially  uncalled  attacks  against  our  women  who  are  already  marginalised  in  a 
<br/>predominantly patriarchal society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to comment on a few areas of Government that we need to put right, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improve on and to develop new ideas for the betterment, progressive and prosperous Fiji.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my province of Ra, there are issues that need to be addressed 
<br/>to assist our people economically, socially and politically. These needs range from infrastructural 
<br/>needs  to  education  and  social  welfare,  and  these  are  very  crucial  issues  which  Government  is 
<br/>obligated to address. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, the cost of living is a crisis around the world right now and Fiji is no 
<br/>exception. I ask the Government to do something to moderate the high cost of living as the grassroot 
<br/>people  and  low  earning  families  are  being  impacted  by  policies  formulated  by  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming from the interior and isolated place in Fiji, life is very expensive, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/>I ask the Government to consider options such as companies need to share the burden of high prices 
<br/>on consumers by reducing their profit margins, which could mean putting more items under price 
<br/></span><span>control.  I advise the Government to do less talk and more action, as currently we are seeing more 
<br/></span><span>talk and no action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for electricity needs, five villages along the Nasau Road Access 
<br/>in  Nalawa,  Ra,  namely  Sawanivo,  Nasau,  Ovalau,  Nubumakita  and  Nukulau  are  requesting 
<br/>Government if it is possible to consider giving them EFL power by connecting electricity from the 
<br/>already existing EFL grid.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also requesting EFL electricity supply to be supplied to the following settlements - 
<br/>Naqaqa, Onabua, Nukulevu and Nasele. The Nasau hospital is located at this place, together with the 
<br/>newly  established  Nasau  Secondary  School  and  the  facilitation  of  electricity  to  the  people  and 
<br/>students of Nasau will transform their lives forever.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tuisawau  and  honourable  Vasu  had  recently  visited  the  Nasau  District  in  the 
<br/>interior of Ra, and I am sure, with the honourable Minister’s concurrence, such a gesture would go a 
<br/>long way in uplifting the lives of our people who will appreciate the Government that is responsible 
<br/>for their needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  same  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  also  looking  forward  with  anticipation  to 
<br/>telecommunication and internet coverage in blackspot areas in Ra, particularly the Nasau and Nailuva 
<br/>Districts where students and teachers continue to climb mountains in order to send emails or to access 
<br/>internet for school projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also requesting the Government through the Ministry of Women, 
<br/>Children  and  Social  Protection  to  consider  constructing  an  Artefacts  and  Handicraft  Centre  in 
<br/>Rakiraki to assist and empower women in Ra financially as there are less employment opportunities 
<br/>in Rakiraki Town.  These issues have been raised mainly at the Ra Provincial Council, and I do hope 
<br/>honourable Minister for Women, that one day the Government will consider this request.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also ask the Government to consider expanding the Ra Maternity Hospital in Navunibitu.  
<br/>Honourable Minister for Heath,  this hospital was established in  1970 serving  coastal and interior 
<br/>communities in Ra with the aim of reducing child mortality rates and improving health care of the 
<br/>expecting mothers.  Around 150 to 200 deliveries are done at the facility per year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of bridges, we are requesting the Government to seriously consider 
<br/>the following existing bridges in Ra, as it has affected the transportation of school children and the 
<br/>people.  The Raravou Bridge in Nailuva which was washed away during </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> in 2016 and the 
<br/>Waimari Bridge which was washed away during </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  also  asking  the  Government  to  consider  looking  at  the  Vatukacevaceva,  Natabu  and 
<br/>Drana  Bridges,  including  a  new  request  or  proposal  for  the  construction  of  Nakorovou  and  Toki 
<br/>Village Bridges in Nakorotubu as school children have to cross these rivers in order to catch their 
<br/>transport to go to school.   School children and people in these areas are stranded for long hours and 
<br/>at times with wet clothes, reaching home late in the night or in the wee hours of the morning, waiting 
<br/>for the water level to recede in order to get home due to poor bridge conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister  for Sugar this morning (unfortunately he is  not 
<br/>here),  that  they  are  still  considering  whether  to  build  a  full  operational  sugar  mill  or  just  a  juice 
<br/>extraction mill in Ra.  This is the same old idea he proposed last year, yet no action has been taken.  
<br/></span><span>I  wish  to  advise  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar  that  the  people  of  Ra  are  expecting  a  fully 
<br/></span><span>operational  sugar mill and not  a juice extraction factory as that was the  promise made by certain 
<br/>Coalition partners, honourable Prime Minister.  The construction of this intended fully operational 
<br/>sugar mill as promised, will help local residence with employment opportunities and our farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to touch on the call by His Excellency in the fight against crime and 
<br/>drug trafficking.  The illegal narcotics and methamphetamine use amongst youths is a concern in Fiji.  
<br/>The distribution of hard drugs had spiralled out of control and is a far bigger disaster than climate 
<br/>change.  Month after month, it is either </span><span>marijuana</span><span> seizures or arrests over possession of illicit drugs, 
<br/></span><span>none more dangerous than the highly addictive illegal crystal methamphetamine, a strong drug that 
<br/></span><span>affects the central nervous system, and the one that is widely distributed throughout the country and 
<br/>the Pacific region.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions estimated that funds from illicit 
<br/>drug activities were more than $10 million annually and that local traffickers could make between 
<br/>$5,000 a day from the sale of cocaine and methamphetamine in the domestic market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>213 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji continues to fight the war on drugs since 1980s and recently hard drugs 
<br/>are now more easily available on the streets in major towns and cities.  Increasing news coverage on 
<br/>the use and sale of hard drugs in Fiji, particularly methamphetamine, has brought to light the need to 
<br/>raise awareness on the dangers and prevalence of illegal narcotics and methamphetamine use among 
<br/>youths.    Tragically,  our  worst  fears  in  </span><span>iTaukei  </span><span>villages  is  that  methamphetamine  or  ice  is  easily 
<br/>accessible  as  lollipops,  which  means  our  children  and  youths  are  being  viciously  targeted  by 
<br/>unscrupulous drug kingpins.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Police Force could not tackle the illegal drug trade alone, and aside 
<br/>from  law  enforcement  partners  in  Fiji  and  the  region,  community  support  is  needed  through  the 
<br/>sharing of information to be able to disrupt these illegal networks and safeguard our communities 
<br/>from the devastating impact of illicit drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  ask  the  newly  established  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  (Bose  Levu 
<br/>Vakaturaga) to  urgently  look  into a solution to  drug trafficking as majority of those involved are 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> youths who are unemployed in our cities and towns.  Provisions should be made by the </span><span>Bose 
<br/>Levu Vakaturaga</span><span> and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs in trying to shift unemployed youths back to 
<br/>their villages to utilise their idle land to earn a living. I am also calling on the Judicial Officers to 
<br/>pass higher sentences for hard drug offences as a deterrence to the offender and other persons from 
<br/>committing similar offence and the protection of the community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  we  continue  our  journey  towards  2024,  we  must  always  stop  to  give 
<br/>thanks for the many blessings that God has bestowed upon us. We must show gratitude for what we 
<br/>have.  Despite  our  challenges,  we  are  abundantly  blessed.  Never  take  anything  for  granted.  Give 
<br/>thanks for each breath of life, each sunrise and each sunset. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that together we can take our nation to new heights. We 
<br/>will be united and we will be a nation that will stand forever more. May God bless this nation for us 
<br/>all. Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and 
<br/>members of the public in the public gallery, </span><span>dou bula maleka na marama mai Nadonumai. Vinaka 
<br/>vakalevu nomudou yaco tiko mai</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address the motion before this esteemed Parliament and extend my 
<br/>gratitude to His Excellency the President for his most gracious Speech on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 marking 
<br/>the formal Opening of the 2024-2025 Parliament Session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President spoke eloquently on the infrastructure sector 
<br/>particularly on the plans moving forward. Infrastructure, as we are aware serves as the foundation of 
<br/>the nation's economic growth and development. It encompasses a wide range of physical structures, 
<br/>facility systems that support and enable economic activities. Before responding on areas highlighted 
<br/></span><span>by His Excellency the President, please allow me to briefly touch on significant changes the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>have made in the past year or so when the Coalition Government came into power. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A significant critical issue is good governance and change management.  These are two areas 
<br/>which we focused on and started off in the Ministry. By way of definition, governance encompasses 
<br/>the system by which an organisation is controlled and operates, and the mechanisms by which it, and 
<br/>its people, are held to account. This was very critical for the Ministry given its size, the services it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>delivers and also the significant budget it is allocated with. Most importantly, services provided by 
<br/>the Ministry has direct impact on the livelihood of people and development. Mr. Speaker Sir, with 
<br/>the sorry state of our national infrastructure both in urban and rural areas, the need for change cannot 
<br/>be overstated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  governance,  the  appointment  of  the  new  Boards  for  all  Commercial  Statutory 
<br/>Authorities under the Ministry is an effort to set a new strategic direction. In the process, the Board 
<br/>have also unearthed governance issues from the FijiFirst Government. The finding is a testament of 
<br/>poor  governance  by  the  previous  government  which  shows  lack  of  accountability,  lack  of 
<br/>transparency, conflict of interest and ineffective Board members. This also calls for a major overhaul 
<br/>of the governance system and setup by the FijiFirst Government. A specific example of the FijiFirst 
<br/>failure, corruption and mismanagement is the Fiji Roads Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new Board of FRA was appointed in April 2023 and they immediately identified systems 
<br/>and governance breakdowns and a huge cash flow crisis that was crippling FRA. Fiji Roads Authority 
<br/>had fully utilised its 2022-2023 Budget allocation within five months by 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2022 without 
<br/>any capital expenditure funds for the remaining seven months. The Board had literally no capital 
<br/>funds to operate since its appointment.  This was worsened by huge FRA arrears owing to contractors.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the extensive damages caused by delayed maintenance in the road infrastructure 
<br/>in the whole country, contractors, suppliers, key services providers had not been paid when we came 
<br/>in since January 2023. Some workers had to be laid off. This cash flow crisis had a significant impact  
<br/>on the delivery of services by FRA with mounting public complaints and outcry due to the continuing 
<br/>deterioration of road systems.  The Board had no choice but to take immediate steps to address the 
<br/>crisis by its line Ministry under the Ministry of Finance in terms of securing overdraft facilities and 
<br/>paying off arrears to contractors amounting to $40 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contractors were able to be mobilised from May 2023 to-date throughout the year enabling 
<br/>us to catchup on delayed works.  This also required the commissioning of a Special Audit for the 
<br/>three-year  period  from  July  2020  until  the  same  month  in  2023  which  revealed  the  total  cost  of 
<br/>variations  and  escalation  totalling  $405  million.    These  variations  were  largely  facilitated  and 
<br/>approved by the former FRA Board, with concurrence of the Minister of Everything.  This is a very 
<br/>significant amount and exceeded the annual capital budget approved for each of these three years and 
<br/>is equivalent to about 10 percent of the national budget.  Other findings include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Preliminary and feasibility studies were not carried out; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Changes in project scope after tender was awarded and fresh tender was not called for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>significant changes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Inconsistencies noted in cost escalation formulas; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Retention Funds owed to contractors were utilised by the Authority due to its cash flow 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crisis; and  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>There was no specific allocation or budgets for emergency works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  specific  examples,  for  the  Nadi  Four-Lane  Upgrade,  the  original  contract  was  $65 
<br/>million, project completion of $116.8 million, cost overrun $50.9 million.  It should be noted that the 
<br/></span><span>Office of the Auditor-General in its 2018-2019 Report stated that Fiji Roads Authority paid $623,250 
<br/></span><span>for  bouganville  plants  without  a  proper  tender  as  stipulated  in  Fiji  Roads  Authority  Procurement 
<br/>Procedures where purchases of over $100,000 should be tendered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the Queen Elizabeth Drive from $61.9 million, this escalated to $65.7 million, 
<br/>acost overrun of $3.7 million.  This Queen Elizabeth Drive project general coincided with the sale of

<div><span>State </span><span>tiri</span><span> land in Nasese initiated by the FijiFirst Government with zero consultation with current 
<br/>residents and the </span><span>Tui</span><span> Suva and his people. This is a total disregard of the key stakeholders.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government to Punjas and Tian Lun Investments Pty Limited who indicated that they would invest 
<br/>$600 million for a major hotel and high-end residential complex.  Previous Cabinet decisions had 
<br/>specifically decided that these </span><span>tiri</span><span> lands were for State use for a good reason, given its location but 
<br/>this was denied by the FijiFirst Government.

<div><span>Tian Lun was registered on 13th September, 2018 by a Chinese National as sole shareholder.  
<br/>At one point the shareholding value changed from $6 million to $250,000.  He did not file any annual 
<br/>returns between 2016 and 2022 and did not file a scheme plan or start work within 12 months as 
<br/>required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The company profile is totally dubious and due diligence by FijiFirst Government just failed.  
<br/>The question is, why did not the FijiFirst Government cancel the development lease when conditions 
<br/>of the lease were not fulfilled in first 12 months?  Was the Queen Elizabeth Drive project of $65.7 
<br/>million for these two businesses, one of which ended in failure? What was this project for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  This  4.25  kilometer  road  cost  $15.4  million  a  kilometer.  
<br/>Imagine how many rural roads, bridges where children and villagers are still struggling, we would 
<br/>have fixed with the $65.7 million.  Such developments are criminal, as Queen Elizabeth Drive could 
<br/>have been upgraded with $10 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Go and see the photos. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- The Coalition Government will not allow such blunders and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dubious developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, His Excellency the President in his Speech 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>encouraged the need to invest in robust and resilient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You should be Minister for Photos. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- While there are works funded through the Government budget, 
<br/></span><span>FRA acknowledges the assistance from development partners. The Ministry through FRA has utilised 
<br/></span><span>a total of $270.7 million across the three Divisions in 2023, including 526 roads as part of the Rip 
<br/>and Remake Programme and also spanning 300 kilometers in length. It has accelerated the Pothole 
<br/>Repair Programme, so if you move around, you will notice a 70 percent reduction compared to when 
<br/>we came in December where there were potholes everywhere.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- There is  emphasis on Climate Resilience Road Project, for 
<br/>example,  a  prolonged  much  needed  project  is  the  Toga  Bridge  which  was  commissioned  at  the 
<br/>beginning of this year  after long delays by the FijiFirst Government probably because they were not 
<br/>FijiFirst voters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO  F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  They have been  disconnected  from  the main  road network 
<br/>during  heavy  downpour  and    high  rainfalls.    There  are  other  low  lying  areas  which  have  been 
<br/>neglected  with  sea  level  rise  and  poor  drainage  systems.  I  thank  the  honorable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture for the revival of the Drainage Boards.  These are areas such as Cautata which have not 
<br/>been touched on in the last 30 years and it continues to flood, so we taking action on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  Fiji  Transport  Infrastructure  Restoration  Project,  we  acknowledge  the 
<br/>assistance  of  the  Australian  Government  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  for  the  Pacific,  a  total 
<br/>package of $117 million supporting the Fiji Roads Authority in the renewal or resealing. We have 
<br/>also secured progress with our development partners such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 
<br/>and others for the design and due diligence for the additional 40 bridges and three jetties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government has also signed an Agreement with the People’s Republic of China 
<br/>for a $300 million road upgrade in Vanua Levu which will benefit thousands of Fijians in terms of 
<br/>improved access to schools, health facilities, businesses and markets. This will involve sealing 82 
<br/>kilometers in Natewa West Coast, Nabalebale, Naviavia, Dawara and Nabouwalu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  speaking  of  rural  roads  and  connecting  the  unconnected,  the  re-
<br/>establishment of the Public Works Department remains a priority and this is strategically driven by 
<br/>the incoming Permanent Secretary. The Ministry has taken some proactive measures in purchasing 
<br/>necessary machines as part of the $5 million allocated for the financial year and this has gone through 
<br/>the Tender Boards.  The dismantling of the PWD by the FijiFirst Government is a national disaster 
<br/>of major proportions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Government facilities have deteriorated  in the last 16 years 
<br/>under  FijiFirst.    Just  go  around  the  country  and  look  at  the  PWD  depots,  government  quarters, 
<br/></span><span>hospitals  and  others.  Sir,  PWD  teams  used  to  man  the  CWM  Hospital,  Government  House  and 
<br/></span><span>Parliament on a 24-hour basis, just imagine and you dismantled that, this was taken away by you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  The  Department  of  Government  Buildings  and  Architects 
<br/>have completed a draft National Building Code which will undergo further consultation with some 
<br/>key agencies. The Department continues to service the Ministry and Government in terms of scoping, 
<br/>drawing and costing of new government buildings and maintenance. We have also initiated meetings 
<br/></span><span>with the Ministry of Health regarding CWMH and plans are in place to immediately start upgrading 
<br/></span><span>within the next two to three weeks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a question on why was the Construction Implementation Unit (CIU) created and 
<br/>shifted from PWD? If you analyse the Office of the Auditor-General’s Report, there was basically 
<br/>no basis for it, no technical basis or professional basis for moving away the technical people from 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>217 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there into that office.  The conclusion is, when you look at the contractors they hired or engaged, 
<br/>most of them are in the list of the  
<br/>FijiFirst finances.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In terms of circulation of public funds - robbing Peter to pay 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Paul to finance the FijiFirst.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- When FijiFirst dismantled the PWD, 108 assets worth $8.6 
<br/>million were transferred out.  This included backhoes, graders, cranes, tip trucks, land cruisers, et 
<br/>cetera.  So, I am asking where are they because I do not see any sign of them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  rural  roads  and  bridges,  these  are  in  a  deplorable  state  as  mentioned  by  the 
<br/>honourable Member from Ra and we continue, as you can see in terms of maintaining that upgrading 
<br/>with the budget we have.  We are doing our best in terms of current resources, but it is not enough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In this regard, let me reassure, honourable Ratu Niudamu that we have visited that areas he 
<br/>has mentioned including crossing flooded streams. I am not sure whether some of them have cross 
<br/>flooded streams.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Those will be addressed soon including Energy Fiji Limited 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contractors who are now working in Navosa, after that they will come to Nasau.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  is  doing  its  best.  We  are  undergoing  as  a  matter  of  priority  a 
<br/>scoping, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of the rural bridges and roads in terms of looking at a mix of financing 
<br/>from the regular budget and also there have been discussions with development partners in  terms of 
<br/>progressing that as a project itself.  Given the ongoing challenges faced by our villagers and the need 
<br/>to ensure our rural life remains attractive,  rural infrastructure upgrades remain a high priority for the 
<br/>Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the employment they have spoken about, most of the movements overseas, they 
<br/></span><span>started it with the Labour Schemes and now they are complaining about it. When it was initiated, it 
<br/></span><span>was  meant  for  those  who  were  farmers  in  the  villages  but  unfortunately  there  were  some  skilled 
<br/>Fijians who went in that Scheme. So, that is the area which is currently being addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  was  shocked  when  a  claim  by  MWH  now  Stantec,  a  road  engineering  services 
<br/>engaged after PWD was dismantled landed on my table amounting to $23.8 million for services from 
<br/>2014 to 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Are you making a Ministerial Speech? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Why should the people of Fiji pay for a FijiFirst Government 
<br/>blunder?  Why  should  we  pay?  If  I  had  my  way,  the  FijiFirst  Party  and  its  officials  should  be 
<br/>surcharged.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, $23.8 million divided by how many of you? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We deduct it from your pay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This is a direct consequence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  the  President  also  addressed  water  and  sanitation  and,  of  course,  this  is 
<br/>ongoing. We have continued to progress that and push for that in terms of urban water projects.  The 
<br/>connecting households. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- No water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Rural Water Projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- No water in Tacirua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-These projects have benefitted thousands of households and 
<br/>some  of  the  notable  Rural  Water  Projects  were  just  commissioned  in  Nasaibitu,  Tailevu,  Fulton 
<br/>Primary  School,  Ra  and  Maumi.    However,  one  thing  I  have  noticed  is  that  when  developments 
<br/>happen, the villages who are near those developments have not been connected. So, I am asking what 
<br/>were they doing in the last 16 years? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have worked hard in terms of that.  The honourable Assistant Minister has mentioned the 
<br/>Bilo Water Project, we have moved that forward.  In terms of Momi Village where the Marriot Hotel 
<br/>is located, that was just left aside. So, a lot of that has now being brought forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  visited  Vusama  Village  in  Natadola.    There  are  few  villages  and 
<br/>settlements there, they are still unconnected but we are now working on that. You regularly repeat 
<br/>that we are not doing anything.  As I mentioned here, these are just a few. There are hundreds of 
<br/>other projects, Sir. They are working day and night to complete it. Water is a basic need and we need 
<br/>to push on with it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is another one which was neglected, the Denarau Island Wastewater. 
<br/></span><span>In the last 16 years, despite the increasing number of hotels there, they have not done anything to 
<br/></span><span>expand the capacity until the systems started breaking down.  Thank you to honourable Minister of 
<br/>Finance for agreeing to the financing of that, even though it will be more than $10 million, so we 
<br/>will stagger that  out.  That  was a major disaster.  You nearly destroyed the tourism industry, but 
<br/>luckily we came in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If there was no change of government, the whole economy would have collapsed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water catchment roads from Vaturu to Nasealevu were in a deplorable state.  We could not 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>even go up, so I do not know what was happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Too much talk. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>219 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- When we went to do our </span><span>sevusevu </span><span>in Nagado Village, they 
<br/>were really happy and they said, “You are the first Government Minister for us to see in 20 years.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- They lied to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I do not know whether they lied to me or not, but I know they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were telling the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On water catchment leases, again, these are areas which need to be rationalised.  Some are 
<br/>there and some have not been transferred to Water Authority of Fiji.  Thank you to my predecessor 
<br/>and the FijiFirst Government who have been working on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, I have to mention the Viria Water Project.  As a Government, we do not run down 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the other Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Members and an honourable Government, we acknowledge that project which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a major project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  this  opportunity  in  support  of  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister’s  motion  that  this  Parliament  thanks  His  Excellency  the  President  for  his  most  gracious 
<br/>Speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate before Parliament.  
<br/>Over to last few months, I was grateful to have had the chance to meet so many of our fellow Fijians 
<br/>to hear their stories and to understand their concerns.  Their input has been invaluable in shaping our 
<br/>platform, and we will continue to listen to their needs and concerns as we take on the responsibilities 
<br/>of public office. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a democratic society, the Opposition plays a crucial role in holding the 
<br/>Government accountable and ensuring that the interest of all citizens are represented in the decisions 
<br/>made by those in power.  I am honoured to be part of this vital function and we are committed to 
<br/>using our voice to fight for a better future for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency the President, in his Speech, reiterated that to revitalise the 
<br/>sugar industry, a number of initiatives have been developed to increase cane production to 1.8 million 
<br/>tonnes  in  the  2024  season,  compared  to  1.6  million  tons  in  2022.    To  support  the  diversification 
<br/>within the industry, alternative livelihood programmes will be developed to augment farmers’ income 
<br/>against world market price fluctuations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s sugar industry supports the livelihood of thousands of Fijians  - the 
<br/>benefit of cane growing standards beyond the fields and crushing mills.  The industry drives rural 
<br/></span><span>development such as upgraded rural roads, giving farmers access to agriculture inputs and machinery 
<br/></span><span>for their farms, and access to markets, urban centres, schools and health services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  order  to  increase  cane  production,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar 
<br/>needs to work in collaboration with the existing sugarcane farmers, and at the moment, such is not 
<br/>happening.   The honourable Minister should respect the sugarcane farmers of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- In nearly all the consultations done so far by the honourable Minister last 
<br/>year and this year, farmers are very disappointed.  According to the farmers, the honourable Minister 
<br/>quickly reverts on defending mode, starts finger-pointing and creating argument with the respected 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- I wish to remind the honourable Minister that he must remain courteous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and maintain professionalism at all times, as he is the executive arm of Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, majority of the farmers are over 50 years old and even with sickness, they 
<br/>do their farm work seven days in a week to keep the industry going.  But here is a Minister, in Fiji’s 
<br/>history, that does not have any respect and regard for these hardworking farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wisht to remind Parliament and take on a flashback to the Maiden Speech 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the honourable Minister where he said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Our approach is bottoms up and people centered and not bottom down of model 
<br/>imposition.  We are here to serve and not to be served. We are here to be directed by the 
<br/>people and not to dictate them.  We are here to listen and no to lecture.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, he is just doing totally the opposite of this.  Therefore, I urge the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to sack the honourable Minister for Sugar if he wants a better vibrant future for our 
<br/>beloved sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  leadership  of  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar,  cane  production  will  never 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase as he is daydreaming that only he can improve the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the additional guaranteed price of $6.38, the Coalition Government has 
<br/>failed to mitigate inflation, high cost of living, hidden costs in hiring of labourers, food costs in the 
<br/>camps, transportation costs of bringing the labourers and sending them back after harvesting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a $1 per tonne was given to the farmers who are part of the manual gang, 
<br/></span><span>last week. This was assured by the honourable Minister but was delayed. However, farmers are yet 
<br/>to receive a $5 per tonne on extra tonnage, compared to 2022 season.  This is yet to be paid as this 
<br/>was another promise to the farmers by the honourable Minister.  I urge him to fast-track the process 
<br/>and pay the farmers as promised as soon as possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, last year, the farmers had to pay an average extra of $10 per tonne more to 
<br/>the labourers for harvesting that brought the overall amount to close to $30 per tonne.  In the 2023 
<br/>season, all these costs I have stated earlier on has surpassed $50 per tonne for manual gang, leaving 
<br/></span><span>aside the production cost. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the 2024 season, farmers are anticipating that these figures will increase.  
<br/>With the increase in VAT, rising food costs and other associated hidden costs, farmers will basically 
<br/>be left with nothing.  The truck drivers, owners, cane cutters are all affected because of the rising 
<br/>costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>221 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  world  price  was  all  time  low,  the  FijiFirst  Government  gave  a 
<br/>guaranteed price of $85 per tonne. Now, since there has been an increase in the world sugar price 
<br/>and with farmers struggling with high costs of production and high cost  of living, I challenge the 
<br/>Coalition Government to give the farmers a guaranteed price of $110 per tonne.  That will sustain 
<br/>the farmers for the next three years.  Also, this was promised to the farmers by the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister of Finance during the Election campaign and I hope he will stick to his 
<br/>promise.  This will greatly assist in mitigating high costs associated with cane farming, as I have 
<br/>stated earlier on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, now is the time for the Ministry of Sugar to revamp the mills, repair the rail 
<br/>trucks, railway network, install new cage bins, service the constant out of order tractors so that during 
<br/>the harvesting season and after, farmers are not affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the brink of harvesting, then the cane access roads are upgraded 
<br/>which frustrates the farmers.  Therefore, I am pleading with the honourable Minister for Sugar that 
<br/>his  Ministry  must  plan  well  ahead  in  advance  in  terms  of  maintenance  of  cane  access  roads  and 
<br/>shallow crossings.  I urge him to work closely with the Cane Access Road Committee in ensuring 
<br/>that these roads are ready well before the harvesting commences.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have dwelled at length only about the sugar industry for the simple reason 
<br/>and, that is, during my visits to the farmers, these are the issues that have been brought up to my 
<br/>attention by the farmers.  And as a sugarcane farmer myself I am well aware of the hardship we all 
<br/>face.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge the Coalition Government, in particular, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Sugar to work hand in hand in keeping the sugar industry afloat and must work in collaboration with 
<br/>the stakeholders and give much needed respect, care and assistance to our beloved sugarcane farmers 
<br/>of this nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the adherence of the Constitution and the doctrine of the separation of 
<br/>powers, the honourable Attorney-General has a lot of influence in the chaotic appointments in the 
<br/>legal fraternity, which were made contrary to conditions stipulated in the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Leader, Mr. Bainimarama, and former General Secretary, Mr. 
<br/>Sayed-Khaiyum,  have  suffered  greatly  in  the  political  persecution  initiated  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  and  the  Coalition  Government.    I  suggest  that  they  stop  preaching  to  us  in 
<br/></span><span>Parliament and quoting from the </span><span>Bible</span><span>, but start practising what Christianity actually teaches and 
<br/></span><span>what Jesus Christ had practised in life.  This is the more reason that the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>should remove honourable Turaga and put someone with integrity, work ethic and who can abide by 
<br/>the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to ask the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity 
<br/>and Industrial Relations, what is the use of these Boards he says were created to listen to the public, 
<br/>when none of the honourable Ministers have been answering their phones?  If they had listened to 
<br/>the public, they would have taken away the 6 percent VAT and replaced the tax deduction to the rich 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Water company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Check your facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the honourable Minister for Public Works, Transport 
<br/>and  Meteorological  Services,  I  will  request  the  honourable  Minister  to  stop  being  obsessed  with

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FijiFirst.  With more than a year, there is no improvement on the roads, to be honest, in regards to all 
<br/>rural roads, the roads in the urban and peri-urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.-  Yes, because he is not doing his job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Because of the road conditions, the people are also suffering, apart from 
<br/>the cost of living, the rise in inflation, et cetera.  So, I will request the honourable Minister to stay 
<br/>back in Fiji for a while, please, do not go out.  Stay back in Fiji, move around and fix all the roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- No water at Nasinu, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, he should be the next one to be sacked. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the road from Naqalotu to Tawava and to Lomati Road to join the road from 
<br/>Daviqele is yet to be completed.  This is in Kadavu.  Mr. Savenaca has been texting and asking me 
<br/>to ask the honourable Minister to, please, stay back in Fiji and complete this road.  The first cut of 
<br/>this road was done by FijiFirst and now this road is overgrown.  Can the honourable Minister, please, 
<br/>complete this road? Once this road is completed, the roads South of Kadavu from Vunisea, will be 
<br/>done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to thank the honourable Minister for Home Affairs and 
<br/>Immigration on his talk on drugs.  This would be a very good time to test all the honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament do that we can give our people the confidence that we do not indulge in the taking of 
<br/>drugs, as he has said. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We should fight this danger on all forms.    Sir, I would also like to ask him, how many seeds 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>did he plant when he was in government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- He ran away because the seeds were budding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, His Excellency also spoke about leadership and our 
<br/>observation  is  that,    the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  and  Acting  Minister  for  Education  has  betrayed  his  own  colleague  by  taking  up  the 
<br/>education ministerial portfolio… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>…and we are happy to hear the contribution made by honourable Radrodro compared to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister’s.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can see a new SODELPA for the 2026 Elections under honourable Radrodro as Party 
<br/>leader.  The old politicians that damaged SODELPA over the years are slowly resigning one by one. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Gavoka’s Party leader term will expire this month. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Point of Order, honourable Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Standing  Order  60  –  Relevance.    Whilst  the  honourable 
<br/>Pillay’s utterances are somewhat entertaining, he is meandering right away from His Excellency’s 
<br/>Speech.    He  started  talking  about  the  inner  works  of  SODELPA.    Mind  your  own  business, 
<br/>honourable Pillay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Relevancy.  Before I give the okay, he has finished talking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow the Speaker to look into the Standing Order that has been highlighted or quoted so then 
<br/>I would be able to make a Ruling, whether you continue or you will be asked to just resume your 
<br/>seat.  But this one here, as we have done quite cleverly, I will ask honourable Viam Pillay to continue 
<br/>and be mindful.  You have sacked so many people now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  As I have said, the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism,  Civil  Aviation  and  Education’s  party  leader  term  will 
<br/>expire this month, and it is time to elect a young model leader, like honourable Radrodro. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- In FijiFirst, our leaders have our support, and they will never betray us, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while the SODELPA leader has thrown one of his own members under the bus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, FijiFirst did not run on dictatorial rules in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the past, as stated by honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-  FijiFirst  has  strong  decisive  leadership,  that  leadership  would  get  rid 
<br/>most  of  your  problems  which  this  Government  is  facing  in  five  minutes.    No  dilly-dally,  in  five 
<br/>minutes, honourable Members.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for giving me the opportunity and I 
<br/>hope  this  Government  will  consider  the  Opposition’s  criticisms  as  constructive  which  can  be  a 
<br/>catalyst for all positive change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Pillay.  You have been a long serving Member, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your words are not really full of wisdom, but I thank you for your contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the sitting today and I thank you all for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your contributions.  I now adjourn Parliament until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.34 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
