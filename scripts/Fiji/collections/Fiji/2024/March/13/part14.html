<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome – Women’s Dorcas Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, before we move on, I would like to highlight two issues that has come 
<br/>before me whilst listening intently to the speeches, but before I do so, I would like to acknowledge a 
<br/>tour group from the members of the Women’s Dorcas Ministry of Suvavou Seventh-day Adventist 
<br/>Church and their team leader is Ms. Leba Volau.  </span><span>Ni bula vinaka mai, vinaka vakalevu</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Contempt of Parliament – Hon. K.V. Ravu 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue I would like to bring to your attention, honourable Members, is that I would 
<br/>like to address an issue that I have picked out after having reviewed the Uncorrected </span><span>Hansard Report</span><span>
<br/>for  yesterday,  Tuesday,  12</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2024  and  this  is  with  respect  to  the  reference  made  by  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  to  section  72  of  Schedule  1  of  the  2018  Code  of 
<br/>Conduct. For the information of honourable Members, the Code of Conduct Bill was moved on the 
<br/>First Reading under Standing Order 84(1) on 30</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2018.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights tabled its Report on 4</span><span>th </span><span>April, 
<br/>2019  and  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  86,  their  Chairperson  then  moved  that  it  be  sat  down  for 
<br/>consideration  by  the  Committee  of  the  Whole  of  Parliament  on  a  future  sitting  date.    Due  to  the 
<br/>Prorogation in 2019, the Bill had lapsed and was restored to the Order Paper on 8</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2020 
<br/>and that status remained until the Dissolution of Parliament in 2022.  In essence the Code of Conduct 
<br/>Bill 2018 had lapsed entirely.  In that respect, since it was never enacted, it is not a current law and 
<br/>therefore it is out of order to quote nor apply any of the clauses that were contained in the lapsed Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, it is pertinent to reiterate that deliberately misleading Parliament is a 
<br/>very serious matter and may be viewed as Contempt of Parliament.  It is equally important to ensure 
<br/>that whilst speaking in Parliament, one needs to be factually correct and this has been highlighted by 
<br/>the honourable Deputy Speaker when she was presiding; here, you need to present the facts and you 
<br/>have to be very factual since we do not want to mislead the members of the public.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In that respect, honourable Members, I will call on honourable Minister Ravu if you could 
<br/>kindly withdraw your statement on the reference to the Code of Conduct Bill 2018</span><span> </span><span>accordingly, and 
<br/></span><span>since you still have seven days to correct what is in the </span><span>Hansard Report </span><span>and the statement will be 
<br/></span><span>expunged from the </span><span>Hansard Report </span><span>for Tuesday, 12</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU. -Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I withdraw that statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will ensure that the statement is expunged, as I have stated earlier from the Minutes of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the meeting held yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
