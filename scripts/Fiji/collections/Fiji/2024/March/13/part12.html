<h3>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- 80.</h3>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- 80. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Are you sure now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Yes,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker.  I  am  questioning  that  my 
<br/>Point of Order has been asked. He stands up and blabbed away without a Point of Order. I am trying 
<br/>to explain, what he is trying to get into.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you.  Honourable Members, I am reading Standing Order 80  - 
<br/>Personal  explanation  and  I  quote:  “A  member  may  explain  matters  of  a  personal  nature  with  the 
<br/>permission of the Speaker.”  I do not think this was a personal nature, maybe your Point of Order 
<br/>should have been clarification but we take your point. Thank you honourable Koroilavesau, , please 
<br/>take your seat.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Madam Deputy Speaker, irrelevant Point of Order, makes no 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sense. What he claims that there was massive unemployment in the country, that is what he said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Of course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  And  let  me  tell  him,  this  is  the  kind  of  motherhood 
<br/>generalisation  without  any  facts  that  they  are  bringing  into  Parliament.  Let  me  just  tell  you  the 
<br/>situation in the formal sector, average…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister, please take your seat.Your Pont 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Order, honourable Member?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, now I refer to Standing Order 81. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Which is Response to Misrepresentation?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Continue please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you. I understand there is a percentage on increase of 
<br/>employment in Fiji. That does not explain our people on the streets and in our areas who are not

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being employed. So, it is the responsibility of Government to get them employed. If people have 
<br/>been moved out from here and have gone overseas, … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- … that is the responsibility …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroilavesau, I beg your pardon, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Order 81(2) states and I quote; “An explanation must be succinct, strictly relevant 
<br/>to the reference, and not introduce any new matter.” So, please be succinct in your Point of Order on 
<br/>the point raised by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. Do not bring in are new matter please, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- The reason that I have explained, the issue that he has raised 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and my point of view when I raise the issue in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We take your point. Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau. Continue, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Deputy Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I know they have a plan to disrupt me. Let me … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Absolute lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The reference to massive unemployment in the country is a 
<br/>lie, is a motherhood generalisation without any figures, without any statistics.  Let me just give you 
<br/>an example, Madam Deputy Speaker, this is FNPF data.  In 2022 and 2023, in fact in 2023, the formal 
<br/>sector employment return stood more than pre-pandemic levels and Madam Deputy Speaker, average 
<br/>salaries in the formal sector as per FNPF data also increased by 12.46 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are contradicting themselves, in fact, the demand for labor, all the indicators from the 
<br/>Bureau  of  Statistics,  Reserve  Bank  of  Fiji,  International  Monetary  Fund,  World  Band,  Asian 
<br/>Development Bank and the business community recognises that we have a tight labor market, there 
<br/>is shortage of labor, people are looking and sometimes they cannot even find a skilled labor. So, this 
<br/></span><span>claim that there is massive unemployment in the country is just bogus, designed to mislead.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Hogwash is coming from that side. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Let me give another example, Madam Deputy Speaker, of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>generalisation of bogus claims and I know why they do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Because you used to do it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Because they have got nothing else to talk about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All of them said, “we just heard someone talk about fiscal policy, wrong fiscal policy.”  In 
<br/>fact  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  to  his  credit  recognised  and  made  some  very  good 
<br/>insights into the economic problems that we have and in fact he made some good suggestions about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>179 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>broadening the tax base.  Let me just read and I urge all honourable Members on the Opposition side 
<br/>to  read  the  concluding  statements  from  the  International  Monetary  Fund  which  conducts  an 
<br/>independent analysis, looks at the data and consults the business community.  It put out the Report 
<br/>yesterday and this is what they said about fiscal policy amongst many others, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The fiscal stance reflected in the 2023-2024 Budget remains broadly appropriate 
<br/>as a moderate fiscal consolidation balances medium term goals, a narrowing output gap 
<br/>and  accommodated  monetary  conditions.  The  Fijian  authorities  have  made  impressive 
<br/>progress  in  mobilising  domestic  revenue,  although  spending  has  also  increased.    The 
<br/>2023-2024  Budget  appropriately  included  revenue  and  unseen  measures  and  VAT, 
<br/>corporate  tax  and  departure  tax  as  well  as  removing  certain  tax  concessions  and 
<br/>incentives.  Total fiscal impact of the budget is estimated at 4.6 percent of GDP.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is what the IFS is also saying.  They would have ideally liked us to remove zero VAT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on basic food items; we did not.  We added, Madam Deputy Speaker, one more item. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It was already there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- And we added Prescribed Medicine to make it 22 items, they 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had forgotten.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Stop lying!  It was already there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They have forgotten, Madam Deputy Speaker, that under their 
<br/>dictatorial rule and the FijiFirst rule, they had 15 percent VAT without any exemptions. Those are 
<br/>the people who are sitting there. We in the Opposition then advocated for zero VAT on basic food 
<br/>items and the list that we provided in 2018 of 21 food items were copied from our manifesto and 
<br/>implemented before the last elections. That is what they did. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- This is what the IMF Report is saying. Let me also give other 
<br/>examples of lies.  The honourable Lal claimed that the Back-to-School Assistance was started by 
<br/>FijiFirst. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
