<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE  
<br/>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers, and honourable Members of Parliament and fellow Fijians who are watching and listening 
<br/>this morning. </span><span>Bula vinaka</span><span> and good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, President of the Republic of Fiji

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>151 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili Katonivere, President of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>for his Address to Parliament on the Opening of the 2024 Session of Parliament where His Excellency 
<br/>reminded the Members of Parliament of their, I quote: “…immense responsibility that comes with 
<br/>representing the diverse voices and aspirations of our people…”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  has  urged  Parliament  to  fulfil  its  obligations  and  I  fully  support  that  call. 
<br/>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  has  also  encouraged  all  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament to, I quote: “…listen to the voices of our people, not only those who elected you, but to 
<br/>all citizens, young and old, men and women.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in essence, His Excellency had demanded of us several things that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can be summarised simply as this: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That we feel the heartbeat of our people on the ground, and when we do that, we try and 
<br/>connect our heartbeat to the heartbeat of our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Work together and listen to each other. 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Get the job done. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improve the way we do business, deliver quality and timely service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the honourable Prime Minister to listen to the heartbeat of 
<br/>the people, because I am not convinced that his Government, his Coalition of political partners is 
<br/>doing that. While I commend the Government for completing the projects initiated under the previous 
<br/>administration, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to move his Ministers to action, instead what 
<br/>we see in the delaying and deferring of what the real issues are on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the world is experiencing turbulent times, we only must look at the 
<br/>increase in global conflicts, supply chain disruption, global inflation and environmental and social 
<br/>pressures from climate change.  Fiji is not immune to this.  The impact is well evident here at home. 
<br/>The call is urgent. Does Fiji have the leadership ready to lead through trouble times? Does Fiji have 
<br/>the  leadership  mindset  that  will  successfully  lead  us  through?  Can  this  Government  craft  a  way 
<br/>forward that is hopeful, genuine and inspirational for all? Madam Deputy Speaker, governing with 
<br/>Coalition  partners  is  a  significant  challenge,  especially  when  the  Coalition  needs  to  improve  its 
<br/>performance and start to deliver on its promises.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I call on the honourable Prime Minister to review how he is leading 
<br/>his  Coalition  and  form  a  government  that  will  serve  the  better  interest  of  our  people  and  take  us 
<br/></span><span>forward.  If the task is becoming too difficult, throw out a lifeline to those who can help build a better 
<br/></span><span>Fiji for our people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  there  appears  to  be  a  deep  confusion  in  the  Government  about 
<br/>developing a clear forward strategy and implementing priorities. As I have moved around Fiji, spoken 
<br/>with vendors, employees, families, farmers and business owners, I have heard a consistent message 
<br/>of disappointment in this Coalition Government.  There are deep and real concerns about our cost of 
<br/>living.  Many families are finding they are in survival mode, working out what bills get paid and how 
<br/>to continue living with less in their pockets.  I ask the question of this Coalition Government, is your 
<br/></span><span>leadership bringing a change for the better?  Are your policies bringing a change for the better? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBRS.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, another concern is the compromise in 
<br/>keeping Fiji safe and its borders secure.  We have become a target for organised crimes.  They have 
<br/>exploited gaps in the integrity of our people and our systems.  The mounting evidence is that Fiji is 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a transit point and destination for hard drugs.  There has been a loss in the confidence of our Police 
<br/>Force as the guardians of our streets and communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Previous years you did nothing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  ask  the  question  of  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Home  Affairs  and  Immigration,  with  drugs  so  easily  accessible  and  drug-associated 
<br/>crime impacting so many in our community, is your leadership effective in making Fiji a safer place?  
<br/>Are your policies effective in making Fiji a safer place? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I express my concern on the mass exodus of our people to Australia 
<br/>and New Zealand.  As the honourable Attorney-General rightly pointed out in the news on 7</span><span>th</span><span> March 
<br/>this year that this brain drain weakens our nation's potential.  I applaud the honourable Attorney-
<br/>General for his honesty and ask the Coalition Government – what are your plans to address this brain 
<br/>drain?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when people have confidence in a nation and leadership, they invest 
<br/>in that nation and make it their home and place of belonging.  This Government is failing to build 
<br/>credible opportunities for its people and secure their confidence so they can say with pride – Fiji, 
<br/>Forever Fiji!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I turn to one of this Government's initiatives: the re-establishment 
<br/>of  the  Great  Council  of  Chiefs  (GCC).    This  newly  reassembled  body  needs  to  be  accessible, 
<br/>reachable, available and willing to serve in the true heart and spirit of </span><span>vakaturaga</span><span>. The fact that the 
<br/>Colonial Administration gave the name to the assembly of chiefs reveals its history and legacy.  The 
<br/>name is outdated in my view and the GCC needs to be rebranded.  It is out of touch and connected 
<br/>to a troubled past, not our future.  We live in the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century where the name of this assembly of 
<br/>chiefs should resonate with the principles and purpose it will serve in moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the re-establishment of the GCC was a significant political platform 
<br/>in  our  last  election.    However,  the  GCC's  continued  relevance  is  not  connected  to  politics  but  is 
<br/>dependent on its ability to serve the best interest of its people.  The GCC’s true value will come about 
<br/>as it stays within its purpose of preparing and encouraging the hearts of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> to invest in the 
<br/>right areas of life and education, to challenge and lead the way in developing self-reliance and drive 
<br/>a  shift  of  attitudes  for  advancement  rather  than  entitlement,  from  characteristics  of  selfishness, 
<br/>dishonesty  and  indiscipline  to  true  principles  of  </span><span>cakacaka  vata,  veiwekani  vinaka,  veilomani,  vei 
<br/>dokai</span><span> and </span><span>duavata</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.-  </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- This is the key to realising and utilising the God-given gifts that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lie within each of us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, like all initiatives led by this Government, the whole community 
<br/>has many expectations of the GCC.   I therefore, ask the honourable Prime Minister what return on 
<br/>investment we will see.  Will this initiative lead to better lives and a better Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Yes! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  reflecting  on  His  Excellency’s 
<br/>Address  to   Parliament, I note the absence of any reference to  the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  
<br/>Given the uniqueness of Fiji’s sporting heritage and our deep natural talent across this nation, by now 
<br/>sports being one of our premium assets.  The success of the Rio Olympics and the repeat success at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="6">Page 6</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>153 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Tokyo Olympics were highlights we celebrated. Yet, despite that world-class success, we have 
<br/>not capitalised or effectively utilised it in terms of what Fiji could have reaped.  Simply, we are not 
<br/>achieving all that we can from sports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those celebrations are now a distant memory than a foundation on which we built to harness 
<br/>greater  sporting  excellence.  Rugby  is  just  not  an  afternoon  game  but  a  pathway  to  become  a 
<br/>powerhouse, a brand, a pathway for our players and coaches.  Through the boots of our rugby players, 
<br/>the world has come to know of Fiji better. Our sporting engagement is not limited to rugby.  We 
<br/>compete  in  netball,  volleyball,  swimming,  basketball,  hockey,  soccer,  weightlifting,  yachting  and 
<br/>athletics to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our sports are also a platform for nation building, economic inflows 
<br/>through remittances, developing the Fiji brand and building a friendly space for diplomatic relations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, sports has a great role to play in nation building. I propose that the 
<br/>Government consider the establishment of a Fiji Institute of Sports or Centre of Sports Excellence to 
<br/>train and develop our athletes to compete at an elite level.  Our performance at regional competitions 
<br/>are declining illustrating that we need to take the necessary development steps and invest more in 
<br/>what we have. By investing in the sports industry, we create better opportunities for our hardworking 
<br/>sportsmen and sportswomen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, furthermore sports can be better integrated into a foreign policy so 
<br/>that the achievements of our sports people can strengthen our international relations. This is about 
<br/>maximising what we have, expecting the best economic benefits and building our nation and moving 
<br/>it forward.  As a small island nation, we have to be creative and innovative to be able to play above 
<br/>our weights.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our nation’s future lies in the hands of our youth.  They are critical 
<br/>in  shaping  our  country’s  growth  and  development,  and  their  empowerment  is  vital  to  boost 
<br/>productivity.  We need to work together to ensure our young people are open to change and they 
<br/>share  our  unified  vision  of  moving  the  country  forward.  It  is  important  that  as  a  nation  we  must 
<br/>understand that empowering youths goes merely beyond giving them a voice, it is about equipping 
<br/>them to use that voice effectively and contribute positively to the society. With this, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, I strongly propose a review of the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  This is to pave the way 
<br/>for a more focused and a proactive approach to develop our youth and sports separately. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank His Excellency for his emphasis on the key pillars of our 
<br/></span><span>foreign policy.  I believe our foreign policy should ultimately be above connecting the world to Fiji 
<br/>to achieve our well-being and prosperity as a nation. To accomplish this, we must have our house in 
<br/>order.  The world will connect to Fiji when we are seen as a safe and stable destination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURAU.-  The  world  will  connect  their  investment  to  Fiji  when  they  are 
<br/>confident that we are good managers of our economy. The world will support and cooperate with Fiji 
<br/></span><span>when they know that we are consistent in our decisions and uphold international norms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, our peacekeepers are a stable part of our 
<br/>foreign policy engagement, yet this Government has chosen to take sides in the very area that our 
<br/>peacekeepers are serving. These decisions, in my view, needs to be revised or will disrupt how we 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>add value and gain value as a longstanding partner of the United Nations Peacekeeping Missions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while we discuss and debate policies, the real issues that confront 
<br/>us now are the bread and butter issues that our people face.  The figures released by the Reserve Bank 
<br/>of Fiji paint a grim reality. The cost of food in our nation increased by 3.4 percent in January 2024, 
<br/>exacerbating the burden of our already struggling population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  The  harsh  reality  is  that  major  businesses  are  thriving  while 
<br/>families are left digging deeper into their pockets to afford a decent meal. Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>the  writing  is  on  the  wall.  The  people  of  Fiji  are  not  facing  a  mere  inconvenience  but  an  uphill 
<br/>challenge against the rising cost of living that threatens the very fabric of our society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Brutality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Update that information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.-  Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it would be wonderful if we are able to 
<br/>still remember the words by His Excellency the President that we need to listen to each other.  I hope 
<br/>the other side would do that this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, as Members of this esteemed Parliament, 
<br/>we are reminded by His Excellency that it is not only our duty but our moral obligation to question 
<br/>the rationale behind policies that exacerbate the suffering of our people. The Coalition Government 
<br/>must answer to the people. What justification can there possibly be for imposing such hardships in 
<br/>the name of change? Is this the change they promised - a heavier load for the already weary shoulders 
<br/>of our citizens? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we cannot afford to idly watch our people suffer. Action is needed, 
<br/>and  it  is  needed  now.  The  Government  has  taken  steps  such  as  subsidising  fuel,  reducing  Value 
<br/>Added Tax on essential goods and controlling food prices. While these measures have provided short-
<br/>term  relief,  they  must  be  better  targeted  at  those  in  need  and  on  tight  budgets.    The  Coalition 
<br/>Government would do well to understand and accept that they need to roll up their sleeves and do 
<br/>the real work now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, before the last elections, some of the Coalition partners made all 
<br/></span><span>sorts of statements about selling Fiji Airways. I commend the Coalition Government for keeping Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Airways, a national asset and realising how it serves our tourism objectives and national economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Nobody said that!

<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Who said it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  please  order!  Please  allow  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member to continue with his speech. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to 
<br/>exercise decisive leadership that develops stability in this Coalition Government and this nation. We 
<br/>live in turbulent times, and turbulent times demand leadership that can take us forward to a stronger 
<br/>future. Fiji needs stronger and able leaders who can carry the burden of taking Fiji forward - men and 
<br/>women whose loyalty to the country is unquestionable and who will give us hope for a better future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, an increasing number of people are losing faith and confidence in this Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA. – Where is the fact? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA. – The writing is on the wall! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL. – Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in conclusion, I urge the Members of 
<br/>this august Parliament to think anew and act anew; our people are listening, watching and asking 
<br/>questions that need to be heard and answered. In response, let us try to feel the correct pulse of our 
<br/>nation and not assume or pretend that last year’s pulse is accurate today. Let us stand up, step out and 
<br/>move the nation forward with wisdom and courage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Madam Deputy Speaker, let us work together to unite our people and give them the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>courage, confidence and hope to build a better future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I applaud your leadership of this august Parliament and the guidance 
<br/>you have provided to oversee the roles and functions of this Parliament.  I convey my best wishes to 
<br/>the honourable Speaker and to you, Madam Deputy Speaker as you lead our Parliament through its 
<br/></span><span>second session. God bless Fiji, </span><span>vinaka saka vakalevu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  fellow  Fijians;  I  rise  to 
<br/>respond to the most gracious Address by His Excellency the President on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank His Excellency for his wise counsel and strong leadership 
<br/>for all Fijians.  His humble plea to the leaders in this Parliament to continue the promotion of harmony 
<br/></span><span>and embrace diversity in our nation demonstrates the essence of his Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency was forthright in calling all of us to work towards 
<br/>lasting peace and harmony for our beloved nation.  He made this plea after pointing out that some 
<br/>unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust amongst communities for their own political 
<br/>ends.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, since the beginning of the sitting of this Parliament from Monday, 
<br/>we have noticed two sides of the coin of the Parliamentary Opposition, as far as the tone of the debate 
<br/>is concerned.  One would have expected that all the honourable Members of Parliament across the 
<br/>floor would heed the example set by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, but this did not happen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  few  became  vitriolic  and  demonised  the  Coalition  Government  with  their  wild  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unsubstantiated claims.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Go wash with the hogs!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  honourable  Member  of  Parliament,  honourable  Ketan  Lal,  obviously  despises  the 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics and the National Federation Party.  He is a perfect example of what His 
<br/>Excellency pointed out.  The honourable Member’s communal agenda is clear from his utterances.  
<br/>All I will say to him and a few others is that, you can continue with your diatribe, but this Government 
<br/>will continue to build a foundation for lasting peace, harmony and unity in diversity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the context of the labour market, His Excellency pointed out that 
<br/>social justice is the key term for achieving peace and harmony through decent work and a sustainable 
<br/>employment for all.  And that is exactly what the Coalition Government has done and will continue 
<br/>to do in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  FijiFirst  Government  dismantled  all  the  structures  of 
<br/>consultations and amended laws to create an environment of insecurity and fear.  It was a one-way 
<br/>traffic, and now they have the audacity to point fingers at us when we are trying to fix all the wrongs 
<br/>they did.  They made all sorts of wild allegations.  What a farce! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, since coming into power, this Coalition Government has: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allowed  workers  dismissed  unfairly  or  terminated  under  the  pretext  of  the  COVID-19 
<br/>pandemic, being an act of God, to return to work, particularly the Air Terminal Services 
<br/>and Fiji Airways workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revoked  the  COVID-19  Mandatory  Vaccination  at  Workplace  Regulations  2021,  and 
<br/></span><span>allowed workers terminated under these regulations to re-apply and return to work without 
<br/></span><span>restrictions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>extended the retirement age of the civil servants from 55 years to 60 years, including the 
<br/>municipal workers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>removed  fixed-term  contracts  for  civil  servants  and  employees  of  municipal  councils, 
<br/>providing them with job security that they had been yearning for, for ages, and this is also 
<br/>extended to all the State-Owned Enterprises including Government Statutory Authorities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>promoted  good  governance  through  consultative  approach  rather  than  the  dictatorial 
<br/>approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consultative approach to also lawfully dismantle the existing worker laws and policies, to 
<br/></span><span>allow for social advancement - all the draconian laws that they had put in place unilaterally.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>157 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency is quite firm about advancing social justice both, at 
<br/>home  and  abroad.  which  he  first  advocated  during  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) 
<br/>Conference in Geneva in 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To support this commitment, Government has confirmed its participation to join the Global 
<br/>Coalition for Social Justice focusing on the theme </span><span>Bridging Gaps and Building Alliances</span><span>. The theme 
<br/>this  year  provides  an  opportunity  to  foster  dialogue  on  actions  needed  to  achieve  social  justice, 
<br/>especially in an environment of uncertainty, conflict and weak institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Coalition Government has brought back to life tripartism.  The 
<br/>people of Fiji need leaders who listen to them, care for them and do justice to them. Institutions such 
<br/>as the Employment Relation Advisory Board, the National Occupational Health and Safety Board 
<br/>and  the  National  Employment  Centre  Board  and  the  like,  are  crucial  for  creating  peaceful  and 
<br/>harmonious industrial relations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Listen to the voices of the people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, due to non-compliance to ILO Convention 
<br/>144 on Tripartite Consultation, Fiji was seriously cited at the ILO under the previous Administration, 
<br/>(this is history it will remain there and will repeat it), for failing to comply with the very Conventions 
<br/>that they had ratified.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, through tripartism the Ministry is able to conduct a comprehensive 
<br/>review of the Employment Relations Act, as well as discuss policy matters relating to employment, 
<br/>productivity and workplace relations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  review  of  labour  laws  is  aimed  at  reversing  the  unilateral 
<br/>amendments done by the former Government to curtail fundamental rights of workers and workers 
<br/>organisations, including trade union leaders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  vividly  remember  the  incident  when  my  former  colleague,  the 
<br/>National  Secretary of the Fiji  Trades Union Congress  (FTUC)  - Mr. Felix Anthony, was  arrested 
<br/>from his home in front of his family at 10.00 p.m. at night…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- ...locked up in the cell in Lautoka, driven to Suva in the wee hours of 
<br/></span><span>the  morning  and  questioned  there  at  8.30  a.m.  and  kept  in  custody.  That  is  what  brutality  is, 
<br/>honourable Usamate.  That is brutality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- This harassment continues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- It will not be forgotten, Madam Deputy Speaker, and the reason was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because he raised the voice of the weak and poor workers, and they are talking about brutality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- It is 15 months now, honourable Singh, we want to hear what you are doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- The review is progressing very well, Madam Deputy Speaker, with

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>inputs  from  the  tripartite  parties  through  consultative  engagement  via  the  Employment  Relations 
<br/>Advisory  Board,  the  sub-committees  are  working.  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  when  all  that  was 
<br/>happening,  those  who  were  there  at  that  time  were  on  this  side  and  they  were  all  gleefully  and 
<br/>shamelessly supporting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I also wish to thank the ILO Regional office here for its tremendous 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>support and guidance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- </span><span>Areh</span><span>, he was arrested from your office </span><span>yaar</span><span>, and what are you talking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>about, honourable Bala?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the ILO has provided us with assistance through a Legal Drafter and 
<br/>has also now extended another Legal Drafter’s assistance so that we can comprehensively revise this 
<br/>legislation and to be presented to the floor of this Parliament in the first half of this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a massive exercise, Madam Deputy Speaker because they have undone everything and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has to be redone and those… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You were sitting in one of the boards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Dictators! They were dictators, there was not consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- You had no say, anyway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, please, address the Chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in this Parliament, in its November sitting last 
<br/></span><span>year  enacted  the  Employment  Relations  (Amendment)  Bill  2023,  marking  a  significant  step  to 
<br/>improve the rights of workers.  Sectors that were decreed “essential” in violation of ILO Conventions 
<br/>were  removed  from  what  was  first  shoved  down  the  throats  of  workers  as  the  Essential  National 
<br/>Industries (Employment) Decree 2011.  They suffered for 13 years.  It was dismantled on the very 
<br/>floor of this Parliament here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is alarming to note that due to the draconian anti-worker laws that 
<br/>were either promulgated or enacted by the previous Government, union density went down from 30 
<br/></span><span>percent to 12 percent.  Now, that says everything, what else do you want?  Now, they are saying they 
<br/></span><span>are championing the rights of the people.  They decimated the unions.  But now, both the unions and 
<br/>workers are busy re-organising to regain their membership and strength. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, as part of the holistic review, the Ministry is  now reviewing the 
<br/>minimum wage in the 10 Sectorial Wages Councils which were also dismissed by them.  The process 
<br/>will involve Sectorial Wages Councils already appointed by the Ministry.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I am rising on Point of Order 60 
<br/>which is Relevance.  We are talking about His Excellency the President’s Speech and not the Ministry 
<br/>of Employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau, please, continue Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  very  much  responding  to  His 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Excellency’s Address.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  minimum  wage  exercise  is  going  to  be  completed  and  an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>announcement is going to be made in the 2024-2025 National Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Mediation Service of the Ministry of Employment is a peace-
<br/>making institution that provides social justice to both parties, the worker and the employer.  In line 
<br/>with its objective, we have managed to amicably resolve two potential industrial actions namely, the 
<br/>health and the energy sector, as well as several others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, issues of labour mobility, addressing skills shortage, the initiative 
<br/>on the formulation of a new sector strategic plan over the next 10 years which is aligned to the needs 
<br/>of the labour market is noteworthy.  This will also address the issue of labor mobility through the 
<br/>appointment of an Education Commission to undertake a holistic review of our education system so 
<br/>that it adequately aligns to our needs.  Thank you, Ministry of Education. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in addressing the current needs of the labour market, the Coalition 
<br/>Government has supported the revitalization of the technical vocational training institutions around 
<br/>Fiji, to provide short-term and medium-term technical training to meet the industry needs. These are 
<br/>provided by the various established institutions and, of course, the three Universities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  institutions,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  the  Poly  Tech  Pacific  which  was 
<br/>mentioned during the debate by honourable Hem Chand.   I am  surprised  that honourable Chand, 
<br/></span><span>having worked in the Ministry of Education for so long does not know that there is a thing called 
<br/></span><span>“non-profit company”.  All schools are privately owned and Government funds 98 percent of the 
<br/>costs.  Even the University of Fiji is registered as a private company and that University also receive 
<br/>grants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- They are just making money.  I know you better from labour days  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just because they hate the individuals who are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>running this education provider, they have that contempt for them.  That is the whole problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  institution  is  providing  much  better  service  than  the  failed  Technical  Colleges  from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which the taxpayers lost $30 million.  They have forgotten that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Oh!

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- This institution deserves more funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me just elaborate a little bit more on what they are doing.  They 
<br/>are providing award courses, as well as short courses for basic skills training and development for 
<br/>unskilled youth  which TSLS calls micro-qualifications.  The award programme allows students  to 
<br/>attain a certificate at level 2 or level 3.  Level 4 and diploma level is currently being reviewed by the 
<br/>Fiji  Higher  Education  Commission.    Now,  if  you  have  a  gripe,  go  and  question  the  Fiji  Higher 
<br/>Education Commission because this institution is accredited by Fiji Higher Education Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, by July 2024, a total of 1,254 students will complete their award 
<br/>programme  category,  of  which  488  will  complete  at  the  end  of  March,  and  776  will  finish  their 
<br/>programme  at  the  end  of  July.  The  students  are  spread  between  Nausori  (536),  Tavua  (310)  and 
<br/>Labasa (408). The programmes are national qualifications developed by the Fiji Higher Education 
<br/>Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, for short-term Rapid Skills Development Course, a total of 797 have 
<br/>completed  this  course  and  an  additional  323  are  in  class,  while  about  120  are  awaiting 
<br/>commencement.  This institution has 2,200 students. They also take in dropouts and provide them 
<br/>with the skills training that allow them to become meaningful citizens of this country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Nabua  Youth  have  actually  benefited  from  this  and  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General was there to launch the programme that they have gotten into.  So, that 
<br/>it is what it is doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has been working with stakeholders like TSLS, TSLS 
<br/>Board  to  address  the  needs  of  training  and  filling  in  the  gaps  that  we  see.  One  initiative  is  the 
<br/>Apprenticeship Scheme that has been initiated.  There are 400 positions for this year that are provided 
<br/>for in the budget.  The Government is topping up wages by $2, which will amount to a total of $4.90 
<br/>an hour.  So, 230 places have already been taken up by institutions like Energy Fiji Limited, Asco 
<br/>Motors, et cetera, and the balance are going to be recruited in the near future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  also  have  the  National  Employment  Centre  where  we  have 
<br/>increased the allowances for attaché’s that can be attached to workplaces for three to six months.  
<br/>From $120 a week, it has been increased to $180 for graduates and for those with certificates and 
<br/>diploma, we have increased the weekly allowance from $100 to $150.  This came into effect on 4</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>January, 2024, and it is shared 50/50 by the employer and the Government. So, these are initiatives 
<br/></span><span>we have undertaken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme, Madam Deputy Speaker, we 
<br/>have  been  liaising,  talking  and  collaborating  with  Australian  Government  agencies,  approved 
<br/>employers, key stakeholders and Fijian workers, to ensure that the PALM Scheme and Recognised 
<br/>Seasonal Employer (RSE) programmes will be strengthened and sustainable.  Equally important is 
<br/>the  Coalition  Government’s  duty  of  care  to  the  Fijian  workers’  welfare  which  we  term  as  “non-
<br/>negotiable”.  The economic benefit from PALM remittances up to December 2023 is F$274 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Kumar had actually questioned the value of our visit to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Australia. They were very happy when my predecessors visited but when I visit, it hurts them.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  little  knowledge  is    dangerous  but  zero 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>knowledge is very dangerous. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Times up! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  After  we  have  discovered  all  the  challenges,  we  have  been  able  to 
<br/>appoint three Country Liaison Officers (CLOs),  improved the terms and conditions of their work, 
<br/>had  the minimum standards observed, we have solved the problems and now, the CLOs are handling 
<br/>them directly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  Government  is  about  approaching  through  a  consultative 
<br/>approach. This Government is about listening to the people. This Government is putting into practice 
<br/>what they were always dictating and that is the difference between them and us, and we will continue 
<br/>to  do  that,  and  we  will  not  be  thwarted  by  anyone.  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  you  for  the 
<br/>opportunity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- I thank you too, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers,  honourable Leader of Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members  of  Parliament  and  fellow  Fijians,  I  rise  to  respond  to  His  Excellency  the  President’s 
<br/>Address at the opening of the 2024 Second Session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to put it simply, the Coalition Government is struggling to be in 
<br/>Government. They are just over more than one year in power and indecisive decisions are destroying 
<br/>Fiji faster than any cancerous disease.  This Government hasty and impartial decision in making our 
<br/>people to be caught struggling for their daily needs… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Facts, facts! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.-… so they can govern without being questioned, leaving them helpless 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without much support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, what else?  Potholes, dusty, pathetic road conditions and defective 
<br/>works  are  now  a  staple  feature  on  our  roads  in  Fiji.    This  brings  to  my  attention  the  state  of 
<br/>Kawakawa,  Caralevu,  Nabekavu,  Coquru  and  Delaikoro  Roads  which  of  Waiqele  Road  just  2 
<br/></span><span>kilometres away from Labasa Airport situated in Waiqele. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With a population of more than 2,000, this is the only long stretch of road approximately 18 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kilometres… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Why didn’t you do it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  …that  has  not  been  tarsealed  and  often  neglected,  and  regular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maintenance is neglected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FijiFirst  Government  had  plans  to  upgrade  this  section  of  the  road  but  COVID-19 
<br/>hindered its progress. I urge the Coalition Government to tarseal this road as during rainy season, 
<br/>this road becomes bogged and children, especially, have to walk as far as Waiqele Sector Office to 
<br/>catch  the  transport  to  go  to  Waiqele  Primary  and  Secondary  Schools,  as  well  as  other  schools  in 
<br/>Labasa Town.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>sugarcane farmers find it difficult to cart their cane to Labasa Mill 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and many have left cane farming and have settled elsewhere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Coupled with this are </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers from Delaikoro and Coquru who 
<br/>are unable to sell their famous Coquru Kava in the Labasa Market on a regular basis.  So, as a result, 
<br/>they are exploited by wholesalers who give them less than the market price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  His  Excellency  the  President  has  stated,  Government  is 
<br/>committed to fostering a competitive and sustainable agriculture sector.  However, this cannot be 
<br/>achieved as people and farmers of Sigatoka are sick and tired of stray animals that roam and ramp 
<br/>their crops, vegetables and sugarcane farms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, Sir, my neighbor, Mr. Uday’s wife, broke her arm while chasing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stray horses from her sugarcane farm as she fell on the rough sugarcane terrain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- It is not a joke. She required surgery and was in constant pain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker</span><span>,</span><span> because stray animals frequently rampage their cane plantation and 
<br/>destroying  everything  in  their  path,  many  people  have  lost  interest  in  sugarcane  farming  and 
<br/>production. Also, multiple reports have gone unanswered and little, or nothing has been done to seize 
<br/>the wandering horses and livestock, people have lost faith in the police and agriculture department 
<br/>in Sigatoka. In the farming community around Nadroga/Navosa, this has grown to be a nuisance and 
<br/>an eyesore. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  stray  animals  is  one  of  the  major  contributing  factors  of  road 
<br/>accidents in the Sigatoka area from Sovi Bay to Lomawai.  In the last three months, eight accidents 
<br/>have occurred and three lives have been lost. The Ministry of Agriculture is hopeless and helpless, 
<br/>and I urge both the Ministers to please take this very seriously and give more funding to the staff to 
<br/>monitor and impound these stray animals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>I  am  saying  all  these  because  I  go  out  to  the  community  for 
<br/>community service where I meet members of the public.  Just lately, I came to know from farmers in 
<br/></span><span>Valley Road that there is no subsidy on weedicide and insecticide which means extra financial burden 
<br/></span><span>to  farmers.  To  add  to  the  woe,  the  Agriculture  Research  Station  does  not  have  any  seeds  at  the 
<br/>moment to supply to the farmers when they should be the one selling seeds and have it ready all the 
<br/>time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not only this, Madam Deputy Speaker, the veterinary office never has enough medicine for 
<br/>cattle, pigs, goats and chickens and this hinders big time in bringing top quality meat production.  
<br/>Due to the lack of medicine, the livestock die rapidly and that is beyond the farmer’s control. There 
<br/>are many cases which can be proven by the farmers. In addition, the machine that is supposed to be 
<br/></span><span>hired by farmers for land tillage is always under constant repair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>last  year  water  disruptions  along  the  Suva-Nausori  corridor  has 
<br/>continued its usual trend and very less has been done to mitigate this.  Complaints from the ordinary 
<br/>citizens for timely water cartage in times of water disruptions has fallen on deaf ears.  Often water is 
<br/>delivered two days late or in some cases no cartage at all.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Minister overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- On the same note, Madam Deputy Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>I urge the Water Authority 
<br/>of Fiji to look into the plight of Nakama, Savusavuitaqa, Dogoru, and Delaikoro village settlements 
<br/>that do not have access to metered water contrary to the fact that huge reservoirs have been built in 
<br/>these areas that provides water to whole of Labasa Town.  In fact the water source that supplies water 
<br/>to the whole of Labasa is in Vuinakawakawa which is few kilometers from Nakama, Dogoru and 
<br/>Delaikoro. The honourable Minister for Sugar got more votes from these villages and areas and he 
<br/>has neglected them and the situation has remained the same. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  the  President  also  spoke  about  the  new  National 
<br/>Development Plan that will invest in robust and resilient infrastructure thus enhancing social safety 
<br/>nets for the disadvantaged and low-income household.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  there  is  one  such  community  is  in  Soasoa,  Ronikanace  Road  in 
<br/>Tabia, Labasa where there are seven families without electricity. Scoping was done by the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government and I urge the Coalition Government to take this forward, as it has been a year and no 
<br/>action has been taken despite the villagers frequenting the EFL Office in Labasa. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency the President reiterated that we 
<br/>must increase our collective effort in implementing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to 
<br/>minimize the risks associated with climate change and sea level rise, not only here at home, but also 
<br/>in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I also wish to reiterate that under the leadership of our former Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  former  Attorney-General,  Fiji  has  become  a  global  and  regional  leader  in  raising 
<br/>awareness  on  climate  change,  its  effects  and  what  the  nation  states  should  do  together  to  reduce 
<br/>emissions, to keep us within 1.5 degree Celsius of global warming and to avoid catastrophic climate 
<br/>change.  In  order  to  combat  climate  change,  reduce  emissions,  make  advanced  adaptations  to  the 
<br/>effects that are already occurring, and build strength, financial resources and wise investments are 
<br/>needed. The long-term advantages of these actions far outweigh any initial expenses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, investment by the FijiFirst Government towards climate change is 
<br/>unmatched  because  never  ever  before  have  we  had  investment  of  such  magnitude.  The  list  is 
<br/></span><span>impressive and incessant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government had delivered on climate change where we had developed a:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>robust National Climate Change Policy;  
<br/>National Adaptation Plan for Fiji to guide climate resilience;  
<br/>low emissions development strategy that will guide Fiji towards a law carbon future by 
<br/>2050; and  
<br/>National Ocean Policy that is designed to accelerate Fiji’s Blue Economy aspirations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  what  have  the  Coalition  Government  delivered  apart  from  false 
<br/>promises and attempt to resolve their own internal issues? It seems they are running out of innovative 
<br/>ideas and stamina to take this country forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, recently it was in the news that 30,000 tonnes of cane have not been 
<br/></span><span>harvested.  Part of the blame must go to the Fairtrade where many farmers opted to join Lautoka 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cane  Producers  Association,  Rarawai  Cane  Producers,  Penang  Cane  Producers  Association  and 
<br/>Labasa Cane Producers Association under the umbrella of Fairtrade. The Fairtrade has been riddled 
<br/>with mismanagement, poor work ethics and accountability. Farmer’s complaints are swept under the 
<br/>carpet as Fairtrade is not answerable to any Ministry and even until to-date we have not seen their 
<br/>annual report. Nepotism and favouritism is at its peak and many farmers are marginalised resulting 
<br/>in their crop not being harvested by the Fairtrade gangs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I urge the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry to fix these issues that 
<br/>farmers are facing with Fairtrade which he has failed to do so for the whole of last year as farmers had 
<br/>brought these issues during Ministers consultations with the farmers on numerous occasions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.-</span><span> </span><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the people of Fiji have lost faith, credibility and 
<br/>respect  in  the  Coalition  Government  due  to  its  inability  to  deliver  what  they  promised  during  their 
<br/>campaigns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.N.  NAND.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  answer  to  all  these  problems  they  have 
<br/>created including disunity, poor economic growth, high incidence of poverty, deteriorating law and 
<br/>order, abuse of human rights, lack of transparency and accountability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as alluded to earlier by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>this Government is on record of appointing former politicians to key Government positions instead 
<br/>of experts and technocrats that has resulted in poor service delivery, miscommunication and very 
<br/>poor decision making. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, currently the Government looks pretty anguished about the state of 
<br/>the public service, they just could not convert their words into action. So far we have not found a 
<br/>shred of vision in the Coalition Government’s agenda which is heavily leaned on plans to reverse, 
<br/>replace and repeal and disestablish the good work done by the FijiFirst  Government.  I think they 
<br/>have a plan to go backwards and not to take Fiji forward. Of course, many voted for change but this 
<br/>was not the change people had voted for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,</span><span> </span><span>the  Government’s  priorities  seem  to  be  visionless,  random  and 
<br/></span><span>harmful grab-bag of policies and decisions that do not focus on the real issues on the ground. As 
<br/></span><span>such, I urge and plead that the honourable Prime Minister takes responsibility for the issues facing 
<br/>the country and accept that he has failed as a leader. There needs to be a clear change in governance 
<br/>that would help re-organise the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, finally I wish to quote from Y B Yeats poem - “</span><span>The Second Coming</span><span>” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>echoed by Chinua Achebe in his classic novel, </span><span>Things Fall Apart</span><span>:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Turning and turning in the widening gyre;    
<br/></span><span>The falcon cannot hear the falconer; 
<br/></span><span>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; 
<br/>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world; 
<br/>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere;   
<br/>The ceremony of innocence is drowned; 
<br/>The best lack all conviction, while the worst;    
<br/>Are full of passionate intensity.”

<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, God forbid we do not go down that path.  Having said that, I have 
<br/>hope that both sides of Parliament commit to bring critical change for all Fijians.  I have hope that 
<br/>both side of Parliament have consultation and conversation to provide a roadmap for a change for 
<br/>our nation’s women and children’s needs. Madam Deputy Speaker, I have hope that both sides of 
<br/>Parliament have a conversation and this is grounded in the need for transformation in the way we 
<br/>create possibilities for all Fijians.  In the words of </span><span>Samuel Coleridge</span><span>’s poem “Work without hope 
<br/>draws nectar in a sieve, and hope without an object cannot live.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the objective of my hope is that no Fijians should be left behind.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, for giving me this opportunity.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 11.08 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament, distinguished 
<br/>guests, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, </span><span>namaste </span><span>and </span><span>sat shiri akaal</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to respond to His Excellency Ratu Wiliame Maivalili 
<br/>Katonivere’s  Opening  Address  in  Parliament  last  week.    Firstly,  I  thank  and  commend  His 
<br/>Excellency for his most gracious Speech.  His advice, wisdom and wealth of experience not only 
<br/>underscored the need for good policies and plans for the nation’s growth and development, but also 
<br/>reminded us all honourable Members of this august Parliament of their responsibility to include the 
<br/>voices  and  aspirations  of  all  people  in  our  policies.    His  Excellency  spoke  on  the  significance  to 
<br/>embrace, build tolerance and trust amongst the various ethnic communities and remain united with 
<br/>one of the common goals to ensure that we live in a progressive, prosperous and peaceful country 
<br/>that is socially cohesive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as the Minister responsible for Multi-Ethnic Affairs, I applaud His 
<br/>Excellency for clearly emphasising this and thank the Coalition Government for re-establishing the 
<br/>Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs which was disbanded more than a decade ago.  I agree with His 
<br/>Excellency  and  I  also  believe  in  promoting  Fiji  where  culturally  diverse  societies  are  socially-
<br/>cohesive and all citizens share and agree on a common direction of a nation.  We all will do better 
<br/>economically and socially and will be more successful at attending to challenges as it arises.  Having 
<br/>understood this and to support the objectives of the re-established Ministry, two consultants were 
<br/>engaged to draft a policy framework for the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs, which outlined the 
<br/>strategic  framework  to  guide  its  structure,  strategic  objectives  and  programmes  for  all  the  ethnic 
<br/>communities in Fiji.  The Government of New Zealand provided the grant assistance to support this 
<br/>process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  a  wide  range  of  consultations  has  been  conducted  with  the 
<br/>Government  Ministries,  Non-Government  Organisations,  Faith-Based  Organisations,  leaders, 
<br/>academics, community leaders, lawyers, regional advocates and a range of people from the various 
<br/>ethnic communities and others with an interest in multi-ethnic affairs to formulate a policy report.  I 
<br/>am proud and confident to inform Parliament that the policy report has been finalised and will be 
<br/>tabled in Cabinet in the next sitting to seek the consensus on the findings and recommendations.  In 
<br/>this  regard,  I  extend  my  heartful  appreciation  to  the  Government  of  New  Zealand,  the  two 
<br/>consultants, namely, Dr. Rajend Prasad, Mr. Radhe Nand, the Cabinet and all the stakeholders and 
<br/></span><span>individuals who have provided valuable contribution and inputs towards the drafting of this policy 
<br/></span><span>report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on this note, I would like to respond to a young honourable Member 
<br/>on the other side of Parliament who appears totally confused about the role of the Ministry of Multi-
<br/>Ethnic Affairs.  Perhaps, he was not listening attentively when I had outlined the plans of the Ministry 
<br/>in the April session of Parliament last year.  I want to inform him and to do so from now, so that he 
<br/>can  perhaps  save  the  valuable  time  of  this  august  Parliament  if  he  listens  properly.    We  are 
<br/>progressing well as per the plan of the Ministry.  We believe in consultations, inclusiveness, dialogue, 
<br/></span><span>listening and then making sound policies.  This is the foundation of the Coalition Government.  We 
<br/></span><span>do not pick things from the air and do not rush with ill-conceived ideas, policies and Bills like the 
<br/>previous government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of tangible projects on the ground, noting that the Ministry 
<br/>is currently at its initial stage of assessing the community integration projects, we have identified the 
<br/>need to focus on projects which maintains and modernises the traditional structure of the heritage 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>sites  to  allow  continuity  of  the  service.    One  of  the  lead  projects  is  the  construction  of  a  gas 
<br/>crematorium in Tuatua, Labasa, and handing over of the gas crematorium to the trustees will come 
<br/>within the year.  This project will complement the natural practice as the gas cremator is environment 
<br/>friendly.  We have also planned three similar projects in the West in the coming year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to commemorate and celebrate 145 years of the arrival of our </span><span>Girmit</span><span>
<br/>ancestors in Fiji, my Ministry this year, will take lead in organising an event at the Lautoka Girmit 
<br/>Centre  to  celebrate  the  arrival  of  the  </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>  in  Fiji,  and  to  acknowledge  and  appreciate  their 
<br/>valuable contribution to the progress and prosperity of Fiji.  Honourable Sashi Kiran is assisting me 
<br/>as the chairman of this organising committee, and we have plans to make this important day in our 
<br/>calendar a memorable one.   Again, it is the Government that has given significance to the </span><span>Girmitiyas</span><span>
<br/>and its children by making it a public holiday for a second time in our history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, His Excellency in his concluding remarks stated that the Coalition 
<br/>Government  is  committed  to  protecting  and  preserving  our  traditions,  culture,  language  and  to 
<br/>support  this  objective,  the  Ministry  has  partially  supported  a  10-member  youth  group  who  are 
<br/>participating  in  the  International  Ramayan  Festival  in  India.  Their  participation  at  this  event  is  a 
<br/>testimony that the Coalition Government is committed to support and show case various cultures and 
<br/>its practices in the international level.  More importantly, to maintain and preserve our culture and 
<br/>allow continuity of this practices for generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  my  Ministry  has  a  significant  task  ahead  and  as  His  Excellency 
<br/>elaborated in his speech to rebuild Fiji, we have to get everyone together, have a sense of belonging, 
<br/>trust and cooperation among people from diverse backgrounds.  It is all about building strong united 
<br/>communities where we feel supported, valued and responded to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, moving onto my  other portfolio of Ministry of Sugar Industry,  I 
<br/>wish  to  shed  some  light  on  the  sector.  I  was  very  inspired  by  His  Excellency’s  Speech  when  he 
<br/>reflected  on  his  passion  about  the  sugar  industry  as  I  do  and  both  of  us  are  also  farmers.    His 
<br/>Excellency has spent much of his time growing up with the Indo-Fijian families, especially during 
<br/>the  harvesting  season.    He  also  had  a  crucial  role  as  a  Director  on  the  Board  of  the  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation in providing strategic directions to the company. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  members  of  this  august  Parliament  are  aware  of  the  critical 
<br/>financial  situation  of  the  Fiji  Sugar  Corporation  and  the  overall  sugar  industry  must  go  through.  
<br/>Currently, we are barely achieving 1.5 million tonnes of cane compared to 3.5 million tonnes of cane 
<br/></span><span>we harvested in the good times.  Whilst the rest of the sugar producing companies have moved into 
<br/></span><span>diversification,  FSC  has  not  conducted  any  research  and  development  activities  to  explore 
<br/>diversification opportunities to generate additional income in its better days when it benefitted from 
<br/>the European Union under the preferential sugar price.  It has only produced raw sugar and this will 
<br/>not take us too far, therefore, diversification is a must for the future sustainability of the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the problems are many and as a new Minister for Sugar Industry 
<br/>and a farmer too, I have a challenging role in turning this industry around.  It is not impossible, sugar 
<br/>as a resource-based sector is important for the livelihood of around 20 percent of Fiji’s population 
<br/></span><span>and to bring revenue for the country that supports in the reduction of national debt as it still brings 
<br/></span><span>more  than  $200  million  in  terms  of  foreign  revenue,  let  alone  the  employment  it  provides  to  the 
<br/>people in the Western Division and in my howe town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to ensure that the industry is sustained, my target is to achieve 1.8 
<br/>million tonnes of cane in 2024 and over 2.5 million tonnes of cane within the next five years. These 
<br/>targets will become part of the National Development Plan that will craft the future vision of Fiji.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My plans are to immediately address issues on the farm, harvesting, transportation and efficiency of 
<br/>the three mills.  The Coalition Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, has fully supported the industry 
<br/>in the 2023-2024 Budget and it will also support towards the next budget as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, Madam Deputy Speaker, a Member on the other side of Parliament mentioned 
<br/>about Rakiraki.  Had this Government not butchered the Penang Mill and sold it as scrap, we would 
<br/>have certainly achieved more than 1.8 million tonnes of cane years back, let alone insurance payout 
<br/>of $8.5 million for the damage to Penang Mill from </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> which was used elsewhere by the 
<br/>former  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr.  Abdul  Khan.  Because  of  these  decisions  of  the  FijiFirst 
<br/>Government saw many farmers exit from the industry.  We have plans to bring them back and the 
<br/>good days are coming, and we will do it with full commitments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, all citizens in the sugar industry will be given equal opportunities. 
<br/>We will be supporting all existing farmers and potential farmers who are willing to join the industry 
<br/>and farm. We are already offering grants of one-third or a maximum of $7,500 for new farmers who 
<br/>want  to  purchase  farms  for  cane  farming  as  well  as  paying  for  lease  renewal  costs.  This  grant  is 
<br/>accessible for both men and women, young and older generation and for all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  a  member  on  the  other  side  of  Parliament  earlier  stated  that  the 
<br/>Coalition Government did nothing for land leases and farmers.  I found that strange.  Does he not 
<br/>know  that  a  taskforce  was  formed  by  the  Coalition  Government  under  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister to resolve matters concerning land leases, renewals and premium 
<br/>issues?  Apart from these, we have grants for the upgrade of cane access roads, infield drainage, cane 
<br/>planting, manual harvesting, cane cartage, cage bins, farm mechanization, guaranteed cane price and 
<br/>incentives to reward our hardworking farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our strategy is  to  fully mechanize the sugar industry as a response to  address  shortage of 
<br/>labour  for  cane  planting,  cultivation  as  well  as  harvesting.    So,  we  will  bring  cane  planters  and 
<br/>fertilizer applicators for farmers.  We have kept searching for harvesters for hilly land but so far we 
<br/>have not found a suitable one.  However, in the meantime, Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) is getting 
<br/>steel tracks to convert the current mechanical harvesters into semi-track machines that can ease some 
<br/>burden on the undulated land.  We will continue to look for hilly-land-harvesters and I am hoping to 
<br/>find something soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on the milling side, we have plans to venture into diversification to 
<br/>produce  value  added  products  such  as  refined  sugar  and  sugar  products,  increase  co-generation 
<br/></span><span>capacity of the mills and of course ultimately to look at ethanol plant in Fiji.  Such relations will help 
<br/></span><span>benefit our industry through exchange of technical expertise and technologies and these cannot be 
<br/>done overnight.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the current mills are operating below capacity and needs attention 
<br/>to improve their efficiency.  Soon, I will be getting experts from India to assess the three mills. These 
<br/>experts will provide a report at no cost as professional fees, and they are coming from Delhi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, upon the completion of the assessment, we will get an idea on our 
<br/></span><span>short-term solutions of the three existing mills.  The experts will also provide a report on Penang Mill 
<br/></span><span>on whether a new mill with full capacity to refine sugar or will only extract juice and transport to Ba 
<br/>Mill.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Other plans, Madam Deputy Speaker, are to explore setup of refinery to 
<br/>refine raw sugar and sell at premium price.  This will not only increase FSC’s income but the farmers 
<br/>as well.  In addition, FSC will need to expand co-generation capacity of the mills to supply green 
<br/>energy to the Electricity Fiji Limited grid. Other countries are moving into supply of renewal energy 
<br/>and  nothing  should  stop  us  from  establishing  ethanol  plants  in  Fiji  to  produce  ethanol  for  local 
<br/>consumption  and  of  course  to  export.    Fiji  is  importing  fuel  worth  millions  of  dollars  where  the 
<br/>aviation industry is the biggest consumer of fuels.  So, we have potential for ethanol green energy to 
<br/>reduce import bills and support the reduction of carbon emissions and mitigation of climate change 
<br/>impacts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in terms of capacity building, we are advocating quality research, 
<br/>development of technology and transfer to our field officers and farmers.  Last year, many trainings 
<br/>including separate trainings for women were organised by the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF) 
<br/>and Fiji Sugar Corporation in all Mills.  The training involved various aspects, including farmers’ 
<br/>field days, demonstrations of new technology and awareness of cross-cutting issues such as climate 
<br/>change, et cetera.  The SRIF will continue to conduct high quality research and transfer knowledge 
<br/>of technology to stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Climate change has become one of the major challenges of the industry.  In our efforts to 
<br/>reduce risks of climate change, the industry is developing climate resilient varieties.  Farmers are 
<br/>also encouraged to practice integrated nutrient management to ensure improvement and maintenance 
<br/>of soil health.  It is a compulsory requirement for all farmers to get the soil tested to ensure proper 
<br/>nutrients are applied to farms for their newly planted cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  are  building  financial  security  for  all  farmers.    For  this,  the 
<br/>Sugarcane Growers Council has continued to mitigate some level of risks for all growers under the 
<br/>bundled insurance scheme where farmers are encouraged to take voluntary parametric insurance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also progressing well, Madam Deputy Speaker, in reviewing the Sugar Industry Act 
<br/>to incorporate our plans for conducting the Sugarcane Growers Council election, which will give the 
<br/>voice back to the sugarcane farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  want  our  farmers  to  learn  international  best 
<br/>management practices in farming.  To advocate this, we have sent 18 persons, including 14 farmers, 
<br/></span><span>to  acquire  experience  and  knowledge  from  cane  farmers  in  India  with  the  support  of  the  Indian 
<br/></span><span>Government.    These  farmers  will  come  back  to  share  knowledge  with  fellow  farmers  in  their 
<br/>localities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Sugar  Cane  Growers  Fund  is  ever  ready  to  avail  finance  to  the  growers  and  recently 
<br/>launched a new product whereby it is offering new loan for purchase of new farms with an interest 
<br/>rate of 1.99 percent for the first year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we all know about the finances of FSC that is struggling to come 
<br/></span><span>out of the legacy of financial mess of over $400 million in debt accumulated over the last 16 years.  
<br/></span><span>But we need to find a workable solution to generate income for the company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To address  FSC’s financial constraints, we are looking at joint venture schemes.  We will 
<br/>soon get into discussions with the FNPF and Fijian Holdings for possible business models whereby 
<br/>the investors and FSC will partner to develop properties for various purposes such as for hospitality, 
<br/>medical, retirement and light commercial sector.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the sugar industry is here to stay and we will make it bigger, better, 
<br/>modern and mechanised.  We have demonstrated this by paying the farmers the highest ever payment 
<br/>in cane proceeds of $91.38 per tonne for the last season.  No other government has done that and we 
<br/>have not short-changed either.  I will ensure that all stakeholders both, from the Multi-Ethnic and 
<br/>Sugar Industry are working together to achieve the set targets in the short and long-term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  before  I  sit  down,  I  would  like  to  show  an  example  of  how 
<br/>mismanagement was happening in the yesteryears of the industry.  There is a report here which was 
<br/>compiled in 2016, and you know what happened.  When this report was being compiled about Mr. 
<br/>Abdul Khan, there was so many transactions where money was paid.

<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Yes,  we  are  going  to  fix  it.    All  I  am  saying  is  that  these  types  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commissions were made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Standing Order 60 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on relevance.  He is not replying to His Excellency’s Speech and he has also run out of time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koroilavesau.  Honourable Minister, are you 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>winding up? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker, because they do not want to listen to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>truth, so I will end here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.– Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  friends,  families,  and  fellow  citizens  who  are  present  in  the 
<br/>gallery and those who are watching us live  on the Walesi platform; a very good morning to you all.  
<br/>I  rise  to  respond  to  his  Excellency’s  of  gracious  Speech  during  the  opening  of  the  2024  Fijian 
<br/>Parliament Session.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  quite  a  lot  was  covered  by  His  Excellency  in  his  Address.  A 
<br/>paragraph each was devoted to each Ministry, however, I would have loved to see some in-depth 
<br/>policy issues that will gear Fiji in the right direction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  totally  agree  with  the  Honourable  Prime  Minister  when  he  reiterated  His  Excellency’s 
<br/></span><span>words,  and  I  quote,  “It  is,  however,  unfortunate  that  some  unscrupulous  politicians  continue  to 
<br/>instigate mistrust among our communities for their own political ends”. My advice to the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister is to look within your group.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.– The answer to your issues lies within. A classic example is the Viria Water 
<br/>Project.  Every box was ticked before the funding was given by ADB.  The project was completed 
<br/></span><span>and was due to be commissioned in August 2023. What happened to the commissioning? Why has it 
<br/></span><span>not started supplying water to the greater Suva-Nasinu corridor.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. Ro F.Q. Tuisawau interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- I am taking about its commissioning.

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>171 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  is  it  the  case  of  some  political  interference,  and  thus  demand  more 
<br/>compensation before the project is commissioned? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU. – A Point of Order, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.– Point of Order, honourable Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.– Standing Order 60 - misleading information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Basically, the information being presented is wrong.  They are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying that the water is not flowing, but it is flowing. That needs to be corrected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.–Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  my  question  was,  has  it  been  commissioned 
<br/>officially?    No,  it  has  not,  stick  to  the  point,  do  not  mislead  the  house.  Why  has  it  not  been 
<br/>commissioned?  Is it the case of some political influence, and thus demand more compensation before 
<br/>the project is commissioned? Do something about it, honourable Prime Minister. Otherwise, it will 
<br/>be a step forward and two steps backwards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, results are best achieved when everyone works as a team. It is rather 
<br/>unfortunate that in this Coalition Government, everyone is pulling to their own way. This Coalition 
<br/>Government does not think twice before throwing its own people under the bus to suit its own agenda. 
<br/>When will they get the confidence of the people? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  has  talked  about  empowering  our  people,  and  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respect that thought. However, is this Government’s action leaning towards that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation and Acting 
<br/>Minister for Education very proudly stated that they have forgiven 53,725 student loans. Is it totally 
<br/>forgiven? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government celebrated the Girmit Day last year, but little did they advise the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people of Fiji that they are introducing Girmit 2.0 for our youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the 53,725 graduates who’s TSLS loan has been forgiven, do not 
<br/></span><span>walk free.  They have been bonded by the Coalition Government for three years to seven-and-a-half 
<br/></span><span>years, depending on what they have studied. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their travels, vacation with families and attending urgent overseas engagements have all been 
<br/>affected. They have to find guarantors and get clearance for FRCS before they can engage in any 
<br/>overseas travel.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, as a Commissioner for Oath, have seen the struggle these students go through in getting 
<br/>those forms filled by the guarantors and the form being endorsed.  This policy is all geared towards 
<br/></span><span>stifling the growth of the individual.  If they want to migrate or work outside of Fiji to develop their 
<br/></span><span>career, they have to pay the remaining bond term before they are allowed to travel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- What’s wrong with that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  These students were better off with FijiFirst conditions where…

<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address

<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  Listen, listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.-  … if they wanted to work outside, they only had to pay half of the total 
<br/>debt and the other half was totally forgiven and this is the real forgiveness, not converting into Girmit.  
<br/>So,  to  the  53725  graduates,  I  would  like  to  say,  “Welcome  to  Girmit  2.0!    Courtesy  of  this 
<br/>Government”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it is heartening to note that His Excellency has acknowledged that 
<br/>agriculture  will  continue  to  be  the  backbone  of  our  economy  for  food  security  and  export.    The 
<br/>Agriculture Sector is a sector that keeps the nation ticking through thick and thin.  It is pleasing to 
<br/>note that the Ministry of Agriculture has come up with a 5-year strategic plan.  I hope this is not only 
<br/>on paper but will result in actions on the ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M. S. N. KAMIKAMICA.- We will do more than you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Listen!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the cash crop farmers are struggling with the high cost of production.  
<br/>The seed cost has gone up, the cost of fertilizer and other inputs has gone up, transportation cost has 
<br/>skyrocketed.   To add to  the misery, by the time these products  go past  the craters on the road,  a 
<br/>considerable percentage of these products are beyond sellable state.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Even in the international Trade Administration – Fiji Country Commercial Guide that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>published on 23rd January, 2024, it mentions, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  sector  also  faces  several  challenges  including  natural  disasters,  inadequate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure, and high transportation and input costs.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone is acknowledging this fact but the Coalition Government is in a denial mode, I wonder 
<br/>way?  How will the farmers survive? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Agriculture  Sector  aid  should  be  well  targeted  and  well  monitored.    I  have  just  been 
<br/>informed that the tractor that was given to the Deepwater community is kept by an elite few and the 
<br/>other farmers of Deepwater are unable to access that tractor for their farming needs.  This is not an 
<br/></span><span>effective aid.  So, someone in the Ministry is sleeping.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  livestock  sector  is  also  in  a  miserable  state.    The  strategic 
<br/>direction  is  missing  to  steer  Fiji  towards  robust  livestock  sector.    In  the  2023-2024  Budget,  the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  of  Finance  blindly  allocated  funds  to  import  dairy  animals  into  the  country 
<br/>without consulting the relevant stakeholder.  This fell facedown and now we are told that they no 
<br/>longer will be getting the live animals to support the dairy industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Money allocated for farmers to improve production in not reaching the farmers and part of it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is kept by intermediatory organisations as administration expenses or mark-up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Livestock Sector, the cost of inputs has gone up too.  In such 
<br/>cases, farmers are bound to take shortcuts to make ends meet.  When shortcuts are taken, there is a 
<br/>blatant disregard to husbandry practices and the livestock becomes susceptible to disease and bad 
<br/>management practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>173 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An example of Dairy Sector is the Calf Milk Replacer which is  essential ingredient in the 
<br/>dairy industry.  From $161 in late 2022, the price has gone up to $251.  That is absurd!  How will the 
<br/>farmers be able to support this and be able to get to this ingredient and use it in the dairy industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am in no way blaming the honourable Minister for Agriculture or 
<br/>his team of officers.  They are trying to do their best with limited resources they have been allocated 
<br/>with.  They have been asked to run with their legs tied down.  The root cause of this is poor fiscal 
<br/>policies.  If fiscal policies are set, taking into consideration these commodities, these segments will 
<br/>prosper.  The Government needs to ensure that funds allocated to the Ministry is released on time for 
<br/>it to be effective. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  His  Excellency  alluded  to  raising  the  standard  of  living  for  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities.  But is this Coalition Government working towards that?  No, I do not think so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know in which world this Coalition Government is living in. They continually avoid 
<br/>recognizing that poverty in this country has significantly gone up. People are struggling to make ends 
<br/>meet, the cost of housing has gone up, parents are finding it difficult to put food on the table, the cost 
<br/>of food has gone up by an alarming rate, parents are now tasked to fork out extra for school levies, 
<br/>things have gone beyond the reach of ordinary people and only the elite few can afford it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  all  these,  the  Coalition  Government,  especially  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics is in 
<br/>a denial mode.  On 27</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2023, a newspaper article read, and I quote: “Cost of living lower, 
<br/>said Prasad”.  Is this for real?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Has he talked to the market vendors?  Has he talked to the BBQ sellers?  Has he talked to the 
<br/>construction workers?  Has he talked to the housewives and domestic workers? Has he talked to the 
<br/>farmers? Has he visited the rural and peri-urban areas and talked to them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  my  suggestion  for  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  is  to  visit  these 
<br/>people and talk to them.  Then only he will know what they are going through.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I met some taxi drivers recently and they were really worried about the high cost of inputs.  
<br/>Some of them have resorted to driving for 10 hours to 14 hours a day to take home a decent income 
<br/>to look after their families.  That is dangerous - a person driving for 10 hours to 14 hours a day.  But 
<br/></span><span>they cannot do much, they have to work that hard to make ends meet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are burdened with high cost of vehicle parts and consumables.  These are the people 
<br/>who  should  be  heard  in  making  policies  and  decisions.    It  feels  as  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  is 
<br/>clearly  avoiding  contact  them.    But  these  are  the  people  whom  he  promised  during  his  Election 
<br/>campaign that with good policies, he will bring the cost of living down, and that was the promise. 
<br/>But then, did he do it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>No, on the contrary, he is quoted as saying, and I quote: “Cost of Living not determined by 
<br/></span><span>the Government, says Minister for Finance.”  This showed that he lied through his teeth to fool the 
<br/>voters just to get into Parliament.  I will let the voters decide if he is to be believed the next time he 
<br/>comes around.  Again, this high cost of living and increased poverty is because of poor fiscal policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, every now and then, when one raises the issue of high cost of living 
<br/>and the rising cost of goods, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>13</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strategic  Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  is  quick  to  respond  that  it  is  a  global 
<br/>phenomenon.  Of course, it is, and a good Government will make fiscal policies as such that it will 
<br/>stimulate growth and reduce the cost of living.  If there is a global phenomenon, a good Government 
<br/>will not go ahead and raise taxes and other duties. However, in Fiji this was not done, and our people 
<br/>were pushed with both hands towards poverty.  Again, poor fiscal policies is to be blamed here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- It is 14 months now, you cannot go back and say, “FijiFirst Government”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, it is for you to go and do it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, investment in this country is all time low.  People have shelved their 
<br/>investment  projects  until  such  time  there  is  confidence  in  the  economy.  Once  the  investors  see 
<br/>confidence in the economy, they will invest.  You will not have to beg them to invest, like someone 
<br/>did recently in Nadi. If the fiscal policies are right, confidence will surely show in the economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, crime over the last 14 months is alarming. Please, people do not feel 
<br/>safe walking on the streets after 7.00 p.m. One never knows when he or she will be burgled or robbed. 
<br/>The incidence of serious crimes such as manslaughter or murder is alarming. Theft has taken a new 
<br/>turn  now.    Apart  from  business  and  residential  properties,  thieves  are  now  targeting  farms,  farm 
<br/>produce and farm animals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farmers  in  Koronivia,  Viria,  Laken  in  Tailevu  have  all  complained  about  loss  of  farm 
<br/>equipment, farm produce and farm animals. As alluded earlier, farm inputs are not cheap, and losing 
<br/>them after devoting one’s time, money and effort is heartbreaking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I  come  with  facts.    A  classic  example  is  farms  in  Waidalice,  Tailevu.  Farmers  had  their 
<br/>rootcrops ready for harvesting in December. A couple of evenings before the planned harvest, the 
<br/>entire field was harvested by the thieves and taken. Nothing was left for the farmer or the market, not 
<br/>a single mosel was left. This is what people voted for. Is this the change that people voted for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND. – Absolutely everything!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then  to  add  salt  to  injury,  when  the  farmers  went  and  complained  to  the  police  that  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>produce was stolen, you know what the police said – “get a security guard to guard your farm.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.– Which police station? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.– Waidalice Police Post. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.– Where is the report? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.– You go and talk to them, that is your job, not mine. I have given you the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>information, go and verify it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is this the change people have voted for? Is this the security people have been provided with?

<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, unprecedented levels of hard drugs are landing on our shores. This 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was not happening under the FijiFirst Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.– Unprecedented levels of drugs! This is due to poor policing in guarding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and monitoring our waters. What is the Government doing about it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA. – Sixteen years, you did nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Why  can  the  Government  not  allocate  more  resources  in  guarding  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>waters? Why can they not? The answer is </span><span>paisa nahi hai</span><span>, no money! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Civil Service has ballooned.  Overseas travel has ballooned. Probably this is where all 
<br/>the money is going. And do not talk about loans, you have not paid a single cent.  On the contrary, 
<br/>you have increased it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Does the Government think that the people who were caught and produced in the court are 
<br/>the ones involved in the hard drugs? These drugs do not come cheap and there is more to what the 
<br/>eye can see. Go ahead and investigate, please. Do not sacrifice the pawns to save the king. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, most of the hardship for our citizens in the last 14 months is because 
<br/>of poor planning, poor management and poor fiscal policies. I am sure everyone in this Parliament 
<br/>knows who’s turn is to go under the bus now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Excellency  advised  everyone  to  enhance  transparency.  How  transparent  is  this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the question I propose to the Government is, “What was the reason 
<br/>for the six people trip to Macau?” Was it sightseeing? Did it have any national reasons? Who paid 
<br/>for  that  trip?  Was  it  the  Government  or  was  it  the  Chinese  delegation  who  is  selling  the  idea  of 
<br/>establishing a casino in Fiji? Looks like there is more to come before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in our Foreign Policy, our stance against the ceasefire in the Israel-
<br/>Palestinian war is incorrect.  Not only me, but majority of our people feel that the Government is 
<br/>wrong. Remember Palestinians are not Muslims alone, they are Muslims and Christians.  Our narrow 
<br/></span><span>focus has restricted us from seeing the whole picture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  was  really  taken  aback  by  a  criticism  from  Government  by  a 
<br/>prominent  woman  activist  who  was  defending  the  removal  of  honourable  Lynda  Tabuya  as  the 
<br/>Deputy Leader.  Those allegations are quite serious.  I hope the honourable Prime Minister takes 
<br/>heed of those allegations and investigate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Listen to the video, if you do not have the video, I will forward it to you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order, honourable Members!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- In conclusion,  the people of Fiji expect actions, not words from the 
<br/>Government.  Do not go around promising but start delivering.  Seeing is believing, if the people see 
<br/>it  on  the  ground,  they  will  believe  it.    Deliver  improved  security  and  policing,  deliver  pro-poor

<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  join  the  rest  of  the  honourable 
<br/>Members of this august Parliament in thanking His Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji, 
<br/>Ratu  Wiliame  Katonivere  for  his  most  gracious  Speech  when  he  opened  the  new  sitting  year  of 
<br/>Parliament on 4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024.  His Excellency reminded all of us not to lose sight of the fact that 
<br/>national interest is paramount at all times.  He urged us to ensure that we must promote unity and 
<br/>diversity.  His  Excellency also  expressed concern that a few unscrupulous politicians continue to 
<br/>instigate mistrust amongst our communities, and he emphasised the importance of respectful debate 
<br/>because of its impact on inter-ethnic relations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I have always believed Parliament to be a temple of democracy.  We 
<br/>all had bitter and sometimes acrimonious debates in the past, and will no doubt continue doing so in 
<br/>the future.  We can be as hard hitting as we like, however, debates of such nature should not be based 
<br/>on race, religion or ethnicity.  It should not be used as a fear mongering tool, it should not be without 
<br/>lies and it should not be about making wild and unsubstantiated claims.  Therefore, my rebuttal of 
<br/>what came out from the Opposition will actually form the basis of my reply, as well as that of the 
<br/>Ministry that I am entrusted with, will do this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to begin by thanking the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition for their very dignified, respectful and meaningful contributions.  For once, I was hopeful 
<br/>that the honourable Members on the Opposition side would take their cue from their Parliamentary 
<br/>Leader while delivering their responses.  But my hope turned into disappointment very quickly.  A 
<br/>few moments after, honourable Members started speaking from the other side, and all I have heard 
<br/>in the last two and a half days, Madam Deputy Speaker, lies, misinformation … 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No facts, zero facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ... motherhood generalisations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in the process of my delivery, I will 
<br/>give you several examples of what those lies were.  It was told this morning, for example, honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua  said  that  in  the  last  elections  campaign  the  parties  promised  to  sell  Fiji  Airways.  No 
<br/></span><span>manifestos for a political party in the Coalition ever said that we are going to sell the airline.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Absolute hogwash.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we had honourable Koroilavesau coming out and telling a massive lie when he said, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“there is massive unemployment in the country.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No facts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  No  figures.  The  claim  of  massive  unemployment  was  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>massive lie.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Koroleva, your Point of Order, please.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debate on His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>177 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Standing Order 90.  Madam Deputy Speaker, what I have 
<br/>indicated in Parliament is basically massive unemployment. If he is indicating that there is an increase 
<br/>of employment in  Fiji,  that does not  explain why people are unemployed around  Fiji.  If they are 
<br/>unemployed, that means they are not being trained to take over the vacancies that exist now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  I  am  sorry,  honourable  Koroilavesau,  please  repeat  your    Point  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Oder.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Point of Order 90.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Are you sure?  
<br/></span></div>
