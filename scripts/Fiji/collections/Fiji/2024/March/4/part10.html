<h3>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI</h3>
<div><span>ADDRESS BY HIS EXCELLENCY THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF FIJI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Acting  Chief  Justice  and  honourable  Members  of  the 
<br/>Judiciary,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers,  honourable  Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament,  Your  Excellencies,  High  Commissioners,  Ambassadors,  Members  of  the  Diplomatic 
<br/>Corp, Distinguished Guests, ladies and gentlemen - </span><span>mia’u sa bula re </span><span>and a very good morning to you 
<br/>all.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, please, 
<br/>allow me to acknowledge and greet our countrymen and friends joining us this morning via television, 
<br/>live streaming and </span><span>Walesi</span><span> platform or radio. I acknowledge your keen interest in the State Opening 
<br/>of our Parliament. It is an honour for me to be here today to open this Parliamentary Session.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I look upon honourable Members of this august Parliament, I am humbly reminded of the 
<br/>immense responsibility that comes with representing the diverse voices and aspirations of our people.  
<br/>As democratically elected representatives, I ask that you listen to the voices of our people, not only 
<br/>to those who elected you, but to all citizens, young and old, men and women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge you all to faithfully embrace with resolve the principles of democracy and humanity as 
<br/>enshrined in our Constitution.  In doing so, we will continue to respect the integrity and dignity of 
<br/>our Parliament.  We must acknowledge and recognise our differences; however, we must be united 
<br/>with one common goal to ensure that we live in a progressive and prosperous nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, it is my 
<br/>solemn duty to announce the Government’s proposed legislative agenda, policies and programmes as 
<br/>stipulated under Section 81(4) of the Constitution for this term of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the outset, I humble seek your indulgence to  allow me to make a few remarks which  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>believe are pertinent to the continued progress and prosperity of our people and the nation as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I spent several happy years of my youth in Macuata with Indo-Fijian farming families during 
<br/>sugarcane  harvesting  season.  Our  integrated  community  in  Macuata  taught  me  many  important 
<br/>lessons in life which included hard work, respect for our elders, family unity and respect for other 
<br/>ethnic communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  two  major  ethnic  communities  in  Fiji  have  always  lived  in  harmony  together.    It  is, 
<br/></span><span>however, unfortunate that some unscrupulous politicians continue to instigate mistrust among our 
<br/>communities for their own political ends. This has led to the perception of communal differences 
<br/>within our society.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  I  humbly  plead  to  you  all  to  continue  to  promote 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>harmony and embrace diversity in our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to remind honourable Members of Parliament the importance of respectful debate 
<br/></span><span>as it has an impact on inter-ethnic relations in our different communities. As leaders we are required 
<br/></span><span>to  leave aside our differences for the common good of our people. We must focus on our shared 
<br/>destiny and commonality rather than our small differences.  I sincerely believe that we can all adhere 
<br/>to these fundamentals, to me that is what true leadership is all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, I always 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>believe that financial literacy will empower our people with financial security and self-reliance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Encouraging a culture of financial responsibility can have a positive impact or national prosperity 
<br/>and a secure future.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  providing  access  to  comprehensive  financial  literacy  supported  with  the  enabling 
<br/>environment and necessary financial resources, we can all make informed decisions about saving, 
<br/>investing and managing our resources effectively.  For example, I would like to see Jone, who is a 
<br/>dalo farmer and Ram who sells sweets at his cart, learn how to manage and have access to finance.  
<br/>At the same time, encourage a culture of saving which will allow the development of a sustainable 
<br/>investment plan for their families long term security.  I would like to see members of our communities 
<br/>learning and sharing from each other’s expertise so we can all prosper together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and Distinguished Dignitaries, I would 
<br/>now like to take this opportunity to expand on the Coalition Government’s Progressive Agenda and 
<br/>Legislative Programme.  A major priority for the Coalition Government this year is the formulation 
<br/>of  a  new  National  Development  Plan  that  will  set  our  collective  vision  and  key  initiatives  and 
<br/>programmes that will allow the nation to grow sustainably in the short and medium term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The key fundamental  of Government’s Development  Agenda is  inclusive development,  to 
<br/>improve the wellbeing of our citizens. Nationwide consultations are currently underway, and I am 
<br/>encouraged by the participation from our communities.  It is anticipated that the Plan will be finalised 
<br/>in June this year before the Budget announcement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  Distinguished  Dignitaries,  our 
<br/>domestic economy will surely return to the pre-pandemic level based on the latest statistics available.  
<br/>As  such,  a  broad-based  growth  of  3.8  percent  and  3  percent  is  anticipated  for  the  2024-2025 
<br/>respectively.  Today, our debt is around $9.9 billion, equivalent to 75.6 percent of Gross Domestic 
<br/>Product, which is unsustainable for a small vulnerable country like ours.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite Government’s emphasis on fiscal and debt sustainability, the new global risks and 
<br/>existing challenges linked to climate change present significant potential risk to the medium-term 
<br/>and micro economic forecast.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  is  committed  to  strike  a  balance  between  rebuilding  fiscal  buffers  and 
<br/>promoting growth by allocating sufficient resources to key priority sectors particularly the resource-
<br/>based sectors. This means investing in robust, resilient infrastructure and enhancing social safety nets 
<br/>for the disadvantaged and low-income households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Accelerating  key  structural  reforms  enhancing  efficiency  in  public  service  delivery  by 
<br/>reducing wastage and executing public and private sector initiatives to foster growth in the short term 
<br/>will be a priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To strengthen public finance, the Financial Management Act and related laws, regulations, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>instructions are being reviewed to enhance transparency, accountability and fiscal discipline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries,  with 
<br/></span><span>regard to our Foreign Policy, the Government will continue to pursue Fiji’s interest under the three 
<br/></span><span>key pillars which include sovereignty, security and prosperity. With strong multilateral and bilateral 
<br/>ties,  we  have  restored  the  confidence  of  our  development  partners,  improved  cooperation  and 
<br/>strengthened our foreign policy motto of being friends to all and enemies to none.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, for the first time is formulating a White Paper on our Foreign Policy.  The Paper 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will project Fiji to the world; elaborate on our identity, our values and approach to diplomacy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current global geo-political tensions, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and more than 
<br/>30 other armed confrontations around the world have created more uncertainty and fear, particularly 
<br/>in  the  global  trading  environment  due  to  disruptions  in  the  supply  chain.    We  are  in  a  menacing 
<br/>moment of history.  Therefore, it is critical that we must continue to promote peaceful solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Peace  creates  communities  of  compassion,  care  and  charity  and  leads  to  prosperity  and 
<br/>development. This has given the opportunity to promote the concept of the Ocean of Peace for our 
<br/>Blue Pacific - custodians of a powerful symbol of co-existence and friendship. Our honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister  will  continue  to  champion  the  concept  of  the  Ocean  of  Peace  in  the  region  and  in  the 
<br/>international arena.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ocean of Peace concept is designed to help move Pacific Island Member Nations to the 
<br/>next level of cohesiveness, prosperity, security and influence while enhancing and not reducing each 
<br/>State’s full sovereign rights.  It is anticipated that the Ocean of Peace concept, once accepted and 
<br/>embraced by all Pacific Island Member States would effectively create a 32 million square kilometres 
<br/>of Member States’ territorial waters as a major geo-political bloc which will enhance the Pacific’s 
<br/>position in the global scene.  It will also enhance the protection of each State’s natural resources, 
<br/>maritime and other natural heritage and the unique and diverse culture, language and beliefs of each 
<br/>member state. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries,  the 
<br/>Coalition Government is committed to protect and preserve our traditions, cultures and languages to 
<br/>promote social cohesion among our people.  To accomplish this, the Ministry of Multi-Ethnic Affairs 
<br/>will launch a new policy framework that will enhance social cohesion among all ethnic communities 
<br/>through sound policies, consultations and inclusiveness.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  is  working  with  our  development  partners  in  exploring  options  for  the 
<br/>establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to heal the pain and scars left by the events 
<br/>of 1987, 2000 and 2006.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To revitalise the sugar industry, a number of initiatives have been developed to increase cane 
<br/>production to 1.8 million tonnes in the 2024 season compared to the 1.6 million tonnes in 2022.  To 
<br/>support diversification within the industry, alternative livelihood programmes will be developed to 
<br/>augment farmers’ incomes against world market price fluctuations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, we, like 
<br/></span><span>other  countries  in  the  Pacific,  directly  bear  the  brunt  of  climate  change  on  our  coastlines, 
<br/></span><span>communities,  livelihoods  and  security.    This  is  despite  the  fact  that  our  contribution  to  global 
<br/>emission is negligible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The unjust burden placed on Pacific Island countries requires urgent action to address this 
<br/>very threat to our very survival and identity.  Therefore, we must increase our collective effort in 
<br/>implementing  climate  mitigation  and  adaptation  strategies  to  minimise  the  risk  associated  with 
<br/>climate change and sea level rise not only here at home but also as a region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  spirit  of  international  agreement  and  conventions,  Government  will  continue  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>implement policies to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reduce emissions and dependence on fossil fuels; 
<br/>protect our people from climate and disaster impacts; and  
<br/>support the wellbeing, resilience and sustainable development of our communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His Excellency the President’s Address 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Effective  collaboration  among  all  stakeholders  viz-a-viz  Government,  Private  Sector, 
<br/>Development Partners and Civil Society is critical to our climate change response.  We cannot do it 
<br/>alone,  we  must  all  work  together.    Accelerating  this  response  will  require  strong  partnership  and 
<br/>access to climate financing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The relocation of the people of Nabavatu to their new village site at Nadoiviri will commence 
<br/>this year.  They were forced to leave their original site in 2021 after </span><span>Tropical Cyclone Ana</span><span> which 
<br/>caused  a  geohazard  event.    The  relocation  is  funded  with  $5.9  million  from  the  Climate  Change 
<br/>Relocation Trust Fund with support from development partners and Civil Society Organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition,  Government  is  mindful  of  the  need  to  relocate  an  additional  44  communities 
<br/>affected by climate change around the country. Processes are in place in the preparation of a robust 
<br/>policy framework to support the existing SOP for Planned Relocations.  Lessons learnt from previous 
<br/>experience will be the basis of the policy framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/>Government is committed to greater accountability, transparency and good governance practices in 
<br/>all Public Sector Entities, including Public Enterprise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The re-establishment of the Higher Salaries Commission has resulted in an independent and 
<br/>transparent approach in the determination of remuneration relating to top Executive positions in the 
<br/>public sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will continue to improve collaboration and efficiency in the Civil Service.  I am 
<br/>pleased  to  announce  that  Civil  Service  Day  will  return  this  year  on  28</span><span>th</span><span>  June  to  celebrate  the 
<br/>contribution of civil servants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries,  with 
<br/>regards  to  our  tourism  sector,  it  is  encouraging  to  note  that  visitor  arrivals  have  surpassed  pre-
<br/>COVID-19 figures.  By the end of 2024, we anticipate welcoming one million visitors for the first 
<br/>time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism is a key driver of our economy.  A high number of visitors means increased demand 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for the necessary support services that will be required to support the influx of arrivals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  will  implement  a  10-year  strategy  for  the  industry  through  the  National 
<br/></span><span>Sustainable  Trust  Tourism  Framework,  which  will  position  Fiji  in  the  global  travel  and  tourism 
<br/></span><span>market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, education 
<br/>will continue to be a priority. The implementation of the Education Summit outcomes outlined in the 
<br/></span><span>Denarau Declaration</span><span>, will be pursued.  This includes the review and modernisation of the Education 
<br/>Act and relevant laws, policies and programmes. The formulation of the new Sector Strategic Plan 
<br/>for the next 10 years is aligned to the needs of the labour market and will also address the issue of 
<br/>labour mobility.  An Education Commission will be appointed to undertake a holistic review of our 
<br/></span><span>education system, so that it is adequately aligned to our needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/>Government is committed to expanding Fiji’s trade by broadening export with our trading partners.   
<br/>The Government will continue to support Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and co-operatives 
<br/>by enhancing regulatory compliance, access to markets and sustainable finance. Most importantly, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Government will continue to promote value addition in our resource-based sectors to allow the 
<br/>effective participation of our resource owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government is also committed to digital transformation with initiatives such as the National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digital Strategy and the National Cybersecurity Strategy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/>Government  is  committed  to  implementing  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Women’s  Economic 
<br/>Empowerment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Gender responsive budgeting across all sectors will be implemented this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Child  Justice  Bill  and  Childcare  and  Protection  Bill  to  modernise  and  strengthen  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legislative framework for children will be a priority this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government  will  continue  to  enhance  social  protection  programmes,  complemented  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>coverage for climate and disaster shock through the adaptive Social Protection Framework.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As announced last year,  the National  Defence Review is  ongoing  to  address  the changing 
<br/>security landscape.  The recent seizure of approximately four tonnes of methamphetamine requires 
<br/>the review of the Illicit Drugs Control Act and related legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Police Force will collaborate with counterparts in source countries to curb the smuggling 
<br/>and transhipment of illicit drugs to and through Fiji.  Partnerships with religious bodies, traditional 
<br/>and  community  leaders  and  other  stakeholders  are  crucial  in  the  fight  against  crime  and  drug 
<br/>trafficking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  Defence,  Immigration  and  National  Security  legislation  will  be  given 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>priority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and  distinguished dignitaries, in  our 
<br/>health sector, Government is committed to addressing the significant challenges posed by the burden 
<br/>of  Communicable  and  Non-Communicable  Diseases,  which  impose  a  substantial  burden  on  our 
<br/>population and the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  health  strategies  and  programmes  will  be  directed  to  ensure  effective  delivery  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>revamping health programmes relating to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Immunisation and Early Childhood Development; 
<br/>Sexual and Reproductive Health including HIV and AIDS; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1)</span><span> </span><span>Child and Adolescent Health; 
<br/>2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4)</span><span> </span><span>Maternal Reproductive Health; and  
<br/>5)</span><span> </span><span>Cancer Prevention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  Distinguished  Dignitaries,  the 
<br/></span><span>Great Council of Chiefs (GCC) has been re-established under the iTaukei Affairs Act.  The successful 
<br/></span><span>meeting last week saw the appointment of members of the Council, the Chairman and two Deputies 
<br/>to lead the Council.  The Council will now examine the final report of the GCC Review Team, which 
<br/>made various recommendations to ensure the independence and the new structure of the Council.   
<br/>Most importantly, to ensure political neutrality.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  am  pleased  to  note  that  after  the  extensive  consultation  process,  the  Bill  on  Traditional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Knowledge and Expression of Culture will be tabled in Parliament later this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/>Government  will review the State Lands Act  and related legislation to  streamline procedures and 
<br/>further improve revenue collection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished Dignitaries, water is 
<br/>a basic need and crucial for our socio-economic development.  Our water and sanitation infrastructure 
<br/>requires long-term planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Water Sector 2050 Strategy outlines necessary investment and enhancement initiatives 
<br/>in the Water and Wastewater Sector.  The Government is committed to ensure that all our citizens 
<br/>have access to clean drinking water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/>Government is committed to revitalising the ship building industry with construction of a new facility 
<br/>in Lautoka that will be able to serve both, domestic and foreign-going vessels. This will be achieved 
<br/>through Public and Private Partnership and support from development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  Maritime  Transport  Act  2013  is  intended  to  align  with  international 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>standards and promote a safe and sustainable maritime transport sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The National Energy Policy 2023-2030 underpins Government’s commitment to a resilient, 
<br/>cost-effective and sustainable energy sector. The objective is to achieve universal access to electricity 
<br/>by 2026, reduce greenhouse gas emission by 30 percent by 2030, and transitional fully to renewable 
<br/>energy by 2036. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agriculture will continue to be the backbone of our economy and for food security and export.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is committed to provide every citizen access to adequate, safe and nutritious 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>food, whist fostering a competitive and sustainable agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  the  Parliament,  distinguished  Dignitaries, 
<br/>associated with the development of agriculture and other resource-based sectors, rural development 
<br/></span><span>is a key national priority. Government will implement a wide range of socio-economic activities to 
<br/></span><span>support  the  goal  of  growing  the  rural  economy  and  raising  the  standard  of  living  for  our  rural 
<br/>communities.

<div><span> His Excellency the President’s Address  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and  distinguished  dignitaries,  I  am 
<br/>pleased to note that a tripartite labour fora has been re-established with representation from workers, 
<br/>Trade Unions and Government, working together to address issues relating to our labour force. This 
<br/>fora will play a pivotal role on issues relating to employment, productivity, workplace relations and 
<br/>the National Minimum Wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Employment Relations Act and its subsidiary legislation is also being reviewed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Members of Parliament and distinguished dignitaries, there are 
<br/>numerous challenges in developing the fisheries sector which is highly vulnerable to the impacts of 
<br/>climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government will develop strategies and programmes to support responsible fishing practices 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to meet the growing demand for seafood while sustainably preserving our ocean.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fisheries Act 1941 and related legislation is also under review. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our forest sector, the emphasis will be addressing climate resilience and sustainable forest 
<br/>management. Government will continue with the campaign to plant ‘30 million Trees in 15 Years’ - 
<br/>an initiative started in 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review of the mahogany industry has been given priority by the Government, and the 
<br/>focus will be on sustainability and value addition to improve foreign exchange earnings and enhance
