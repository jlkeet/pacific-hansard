<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s Official Opening of the second session of this 
<br/>parliamentary term.  I also welcome our guests seated in the gallery, thank you for joining us today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today  is  another  special  occasion  the  in  parliamentary  calendar,  as  it  marks  the  Official 
<br/>Opening of the Second Session of the third term of the Fijian Parliament.  The State Opening will be 
<br/>officiated by His Excellency the President, Ratu Wiliame Katonivere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Refurbishment - Parliament Chamber 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, as you may have seen today the Parliament Chambers has undergone 
<br/></span><span>some  refurbishments  and  IT  conferencing  system  upgrade  to  ensure  that  Parliament  remains 
<br/>adaptable to the ever-changing world of technology.  There has been a change in the carpet colour to 
<br/>the two-tone navy blue and grey.  The colour is considered timeless in fashion and design, and it 
<br/>represents  wisdom,  stability,  trust,  convention  and  knowledge  that  stems  from  within  us.    It  also 
<br/>resonates and represents the vast “blue” Pacific Ocean that surrounds Fiji.  It is hoped that it would 
<br/>provide the platform that can be used for cooling and calming, both physically and mentally whilst 
<br/>there are heated contributions in  debates by both sides  of Parliament in  respect  of building  Fiji’s 
<br/>democracy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While Fiji continues to honour the Westminster traditions in terms of practices and aesthetics, 
<br/>we should also appreciate the need for our Parliament to make certain adjustments to branch of on 
<br/>its  own.  Many  Commonwealth  Parliament  Chambers  have  adopted  colours  different  from  the 
<br/>traditional Westminster green.  In this case, while the carpet colour has changed, for the most part, 
<br/>Parliament still uses green in other aspects of this Chamber.

<div><span> Communications from the Speaker  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the other is the inclusion of the crafted tapa or motif design backdrop 
<br/>at the back of my Chair and this is to represent our unique Fijian culture, and also to encourage our 
<br/>talented  women  entrepreneurs  to  display  their  leadership  and  skill,  and  for  the  empowerment  of 
<br/>women and partly to promote women handicraft as part of Parliament’s contribution to SDG5 on 
<br/>gender equality.  This one is a traditional </span><span>masi</span><span> drapery from Cakaudrove and has been made by the 
<br/>women of the province.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also envisaged that the Secretariat, in consultation with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, 
<br/>will also be in touch with the other Provinces, who will also be able to provide a similar motif design 
<br/>to be hung at the back of my chair at a later time so that we may showcase that our cultural identity 
<br/>is very much alive and well.  It does not stop other Speakers of Parliament who will occupy this Chair 
<br/>in the future to change the background to one that they identify with, be it from any province or even 
<br/>from other non-iTaukei communities.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  just  come  back  from  a  visit  to  the  great  Government  of  Australia  by  the 
<br/>Parliamentary seat in Canberra.  There, they have on display in their big parliamentary Chambers 
<br/>7,000 work of art from the interior to the coast and to the urban areas.  It belongs to the traditional 
<br/>people, the first nation’s people, and the Australian people are quite proud for what is showcased in 
<br/>their Parliament. Most of the Parliament elsewhere, even the New South Wales State Parliament has 
<br/>a similar display of art works, and also the Chair.  Most of our walls within this Chamber lay bare 
<br/>for all this time, but again, this is a proud place to display our handicrafts, especially coming from 
<br/>the women.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  the  other  adjustment  you  may  have  noticed  is  the  elevated  gallery 
<br/>which will provide both our visiting guests a better view by the Speaker.   Furthermore, as you can 
<br/>see, we have restored the Presiding Officer’s Chair, this is the one that I am sitting on, which is very 
<br/>historic given that it dates back to  1939  with  all its original  art with  the  Crown at  the top  which 
<br/>signifies that Fiji is still a member of the Commonwealth. I am told that the honourable Faiyaz Koya’s 
<br/>dad also used it during his tenure as Deputy Speaker.  It also has our coat of arms with the inscription, 
<br/></span><span>Rerevaka Na Kalou Ka Doka Na Tui</span><span> or translated (Fear God and honour the King), and we will keep 
<br/>all the original handcrafted carving designs on it including the red leather and the cushion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, honourable Members, you would have noticed the additional five big screens on the 
<br/>walls which will allow Parliament to boost its e-Parliament initiative.  We will continue to reduce 
<br/>the use of paper for the printing of Order Papers, Minutes of Proceedings and other documents.  All 
<br/>these documents will be emailed to all honourable Members and copies will be projected from these 
<br/></span><span>screens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  and  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  advise  that  as  is  customary,  the 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  the  Judiciary  will  be  joining  us  in  Chamber  to  hear  the  Address  by  His 
<br/>Excellency the President of the Republic of Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>[Honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament escorts the honourable Members of the 
<br/>Judiciary into Parliament while honourable Members of Parliament are upstanding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament and Secretary-General 
<br/></span><span>to Parliament retire from the Chamber to meet His Excellency the President and escort him 
<br/>into the Chamber]
