<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the year 2018-2019 which was tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the former and current honourable 
<br/>Members of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, I take this opportunity to speak on the 
<br/>motion in regards to the Committee’s Review Report of the 2018-2019 Ministry of Agriculture which 
<br/>was tabled in Parliament by the former Chairperson of the Committee, honourable Inia Seruiratu, on 
<br/>Wednesday 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Annual  Report  was  initially  referred  to  the  former  Members  of  the 
<br/>Standing  Committee  on  Natural  Resources  in  2022,  chaired  by  honourable  Sanjay  Kirpal.  
<br/>Nevertheless, the current Committee proceeded with its scrutiny as mandated to the Committee under 
<br/>Standing  Order  110(1)(c)  and  made  recommendations  as  a  way  forward  for  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the period under review, the Committee noted that the Ministry had six Departments 
<br/>and  had  set  out  plans  and  implemented  key  policies  and  key  activities  to  achieve  high  economic 
<br/>growth whilst ensuring sustainability of Fiji’s agriculture sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  continued  in  partnership  with  relevant  stakeholders  to  enable  more  land 
<br/>available for productive and social purposes, which encouraged farming, adequate production, and 
<br/>committed agriculture workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Agriculture in 2018-2019 provided enabling environment for direct efficient 
<br/>delivery of services to stakeholders throughout Fiji.  The adoption of the professional service delivery 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  promoted  maximum  production  through  increased  investment  in  the  agriculture 
<br/>sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 5 Year and 20 Year National Development Plan (NDP) 
<br/>highlighted the strategic goal of the Ministry of Agriculture, which aligned every Fijian to access 
<br/>adequate food for acceptable quality and nutritional value, and to achieve the overall goals of the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  the  other  notable  strategic  goals  was  the  competitive,  sustainable  and  value 
<br/>adding non-sugar agriculture, promoting food self-sufficiency and the production of those agriculture 
<br/>products where Fiji has a competitive advantage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bipartisan Committee report not only examines, compares and analyses 
<br/>the performance of the Ministry of Agriculture but also took note of the Ministry’s administration, 
<br/></span><span>legislation, organisational structure, financial management, functions and programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  was  grateful  to  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  Senior  Management  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response to the questions which provided more references towards its final report to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In summary, the Committee noted the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>497 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Agriculture’s  total  budgetary  allocation  for  the  fiscal  year  2018-2019 
<br/>amounted to $96.8 million, which was an increase from the previous budget.  However, the 
<br/>Committee  noted  that  despite  this  significant  increase,  the  Ministry  only  achieved  66 
<br/>percent utilisation rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  efforts  of  the  Crop  Extension  and  the  Animal  Health  and  Production  Division  in 
<br/>providing feeder food and nutrition security. Feeder food and nutrition security needs are 
<br/>well noted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>While  export  figures  are  valuable,  equally  important  is  the  domestic  production  and 
<br/>consumption figures in order to fairly represent the Ministry’s contribution to the overall 
<br/>food and nutrition security needs, apart from the agriculture sector’s economic share.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also needs to reflect the main challenges faced by the Ministry during the fiscal 
<br/>year. This will help in identifying critical issues that will need fixing in order to enhance 
<br/>performance  efficiency  and  production  levels  as  expected  by  the  Ministry  and  the 
<br/>Government as a whole. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Diversify and broaden Fiji’s economic base, the agriculture sector both, sugar and non-
<br/>sugar, needs special attention and relevant support in order to realise its untapped potential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee would like to see that improvements are made, and changes are undertaken 
<br/>by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  and  that  the  Committee  recommendations  are  considered  for 
<br/>implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>a list before me from the Whips and the batting order will be led by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S. Nand; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Leader of the Opposition; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Assistant Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion before Parliament on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Annual Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture’s 2018-2019 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural 
<br/>Resources for reviewing the Ministry’s Annual Report and coming up with recommendations.  These 
<br/>recommendations will enable the Ministry to better it service delivery.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  agriculture  is  a  crucial  industry  for  Fiji’s  development  and  country’s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nutrients in several ways.  Food security is one of the key responsibilities of the industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Agriculture is the primary source of food production.  A strong agriculture sector will ensure 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji can feed its population adequately and reduce dependence on imports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on economic contribution, agriculture is a significant contributor to Fiji’s 
<br/>economy.  It provides employment to a significant number of people, especially in the rural sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The agriculture sector generates income for farmers and those involved in the agribusiness.  
<br/></span><span>The agriculture sector is the backbone of rural economy and not only rural economy, but it is also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>498 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the backbone of Fiji’s economy.  It generates significant foreign exchange in terms of exports like 
<br/>fresh vegetables, root crops, ginger, et cetera.  These are some of the agriculture base exports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  research  and  development  done  by  the  Ministry  provides  our  farmers  with  new 
<br/>techniques, new seeds and better management practices, and how to best control pests and diseases.  
<br/>It also improves the social standing of our population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture reduces the inequalities in our population and also helps 
<br/>in alleviating poverty.  Fiji’s agriculture sector is not only essential in making the basic human needs, 
<br/>but it also promotes, as I have said earlier, the economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry, not only in 2018-2019 but all these years until 2022, had achieved quite a lot 
<br/>under the FijiFirst Government.  As the Report states, apart from the meat and dairy sector, pork and 
<br/>poultry industry had a very good performance and almost reaching self-sufficiency level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the thousands or so employees or staff of the Ministry of Agriculture, 
<br/>who have dedicated their lives and their service to the agriculture sector.  Their dedication to the 
<br/>sector cannot be stressed enough.  I thank them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Crop, Research and Extension has achieved a significant growth.  Some commodities have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reached self-sufficiency and also are being exported.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rice  production  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  may  not  agree,  was  almost  killed  by  the  other 
<br/>Governments but the FijiFirst Government revived it and under their leadership, it achieved a record 
<br/>production.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the other sector, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FijiFirst Government had a multi-pronged approach 
<br/>to developing the industry.  These were direct assistance to the farmers, programme management, 
<br/>improved extension services, access to quality inputs and tariff protection to grow the industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government needs to continue providing assistance to the agriculture sector. 
<br/>It is good to see that there is an increase in budgetary allocation to the Ministry.  Thank you very 
<br/>much, but we are yet to see all the money being transferred there.  You need to assist our farmers by 
<br/>reducing the cost of inputs…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Talk about dairy money.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- … - fertilizer, seeds, transportation cost of raw materials, skilled labour is 
<br/>also an issue in our agriculture sector,  the high cost of chemicals, and in the livestock sector - feed.  
<br/>I will talk about dairy on Friday.  You wait and listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I say duty protection, it is to control the cost of production because 
<br/>Fiji is a small State, and we are competing with other countries where the economy of scale really 
<br/>drops us down.  Removing duty protection in the agriculture sector could be counterproductive, like 
<br/>the way the Government removed fiscal duty on imported chicken portions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I talked about it, I was told the whole bird industry is protected, only the portions had 
<br/>no duty on imported chicken.  However, one must remember that we do not swallow the whole bird, 
<br/>we  cut  it  in  portions  and  eat  it.    So,  portions  coming  here,  people  will  go  for  that  and  that  will 
<br/>encourage dumping in our market because the other countries have a market for premium poultry 
<br/>meat, which is the best meat.  The rest, they do not care, they can even dump it here at a very cheap 
<br/>price.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="74">Page 74</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>499 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  to  protect  our  industry.    We  need  to  ensure  that  the  cost  of  production  in  those 
<br/>industries are controlled, and we need to subsidise the cost of production.  We cannot let our farmers 
<br/>out in the cold, we need to protect, encourage and assist them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope the Government will take heed and protect our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>agricultural commodities and not throw them under the bus, like they do to their Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Review 
<br/>Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for the years 2018 and 2019, that was tabled in this august 
<br/>Parliament on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023.  Even though the Report is an old one, most of the challenges 
<br/>identified  by  the  Committee  on  the  Ministry’s  administration  structure,  budgetary  allocation, 
<br/>programmes and activities undertaken throughout the functional Divisions are still relevant and the 
<br/>Ministry is working towards improving that.  One of the weaknesses, in particular, is the failure of 
<br/>the Ministry to fully utilise its allocated budget, and the Ministry is working very hard to make sure 
<br/>that it utilises fully the budget that it is allocated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry takes note of the findings indicated in the Report - failing to 
<br/>highlight linkages of the Ministry’s programmes to the United Nations’ SDGs 1, 2 5 and 15.  These 
<br/>UN  SDGs  are  relevant  to  the  Ministry  and  the  Ministry  has  recently  developed  a  Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan for 2024-2028, and places emphasis on achieving those. The 11 recommendations 
<br/>put forward by the Standing Committee are noted and will be used as a guide for the Ministry, to 
<br/>align the development of its policies for the implementation of its programmes and activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  ensures  this  august  Parliament  that  the  upskilling  and 
<br/>recruitment of its officers and realignment of the organisational structure will happen.  In addition, 
<br/>the Ministry is increasing the volume of production through mechanisation, assisting agro-processes, 
<br/>capacity building, improving research infrastructure and facilities and the use of new technologies to 
<br/>grow the sector.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  contribution  of  the  Standing  Committee  on 
<br/>Natural Resources on the Review of the 2018-2019 Annual Report of the Ministry of Agriculture and 
<br/>on that note, I thank you for the opportunity and I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  the  time  given  to  me  to  also 
<br/>contribute to the motion before Parliament as presented by the Chairman.  This Report was presented 
<br/>during my term as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee and I wish to first acknowledge 
<br/>the Committee and, of course, the Ministry of Agriculture and, most importantly, the stakeholders, 
<br/>particularly the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be brief as well, like the honourable Minister.  The recommendations are there and as 
<br/>acknowledged by the honourable Minister, although the Report is old for the years 2018 and 2019, 
<br/>the challenges are still relevant, and I thank him for the commitment that he is making to ensure that 
<br/>they make improvements towards the recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  for  the  sake  of  moving  the  sector  forward,  something  that  is  not  in  the 
<br/></span><span>recommendation,  but  you  will  find  in  the  Chairman’s  Foreword,  is  a  recommendation  for  the 
<br/></span><span>establishment of the special committee because I, as Chairman, was unsure of section 101.  So, that 
<br/>recommendation is for a special committee under section 129 of our Standing Orders, not only to 
<br/>look at non-sugar, but to look at the whole agriculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I did mention this during my contribution to His Excellency’s Address on the Opening of 
<br/>Parliament last year, that there needs to be commitment by Government to have a special committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>500 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to review the sugar sector.  Perhaps, it is time that we look at the whole agriculture sector rather than 
<br/>demarcating between sugar and non-sugar agriculture.  We have been communicating as well with 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and probably that is something to 
<br/>consider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The potentials are still great, thank you, again, to the Ministry, the honourable Minister and 
<br/>the honourable Assistant Minister.  I asked for their strategic plan just to have a look, and I note with 
<br/>interest and, again, this highlights that gradually, with the right focus and available data, when we 
<br/>link  up  to  the  market  and  look  at  the  whole  supply  and  value  chain,  the  agriculture  sector  can 
<br/>contribute a lot.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What caught me yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I read through this strategic plan, they 
<br/>mentioned  about  the  contribution  made  by  the  agriculture  sector  during  the  2021  period  where 
<br/>agriculture contributed $763.9 million to total GDP.  If you subtract the sugar contribution from that 
<br/>figure, the total amount came to $689.3 million and non-sugar agriculture, according to the strategic 
<br/>plan by the Ministry, grew a share of the national economy from 5.5 percent in 2010 to 8.2 percent 
<br/>in 2021.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It can be better and that is what the Government needs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We look forward 
<br/>to the next Budget and, hopefully, with the continued provision of financing, particularly, in the three 
<br/>areas  that  are  important  to  agriculture  investment  -  public  sector  investment,  private  sector 
<br/>investment  and  investment  at  the  farm  level  by  farmers,  and    if  they  can  probably  link  up  to  the 
<br/>MSMEs, they should be able to finance some of their expansion programmes and then graduate as 
<br/>well into semi-commercial and commercial level farming.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They still highlight the Report by IFC, honourable Minister, perhaps this is the low hanging 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fruit on what can be the focus, particularly, for the tourism sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I conclude, the honourable Minister has talked about administrative issues. One of the 
<br/>key problems, honourable Prime Minister, Sir, with the agriculture sector, and I promised the team 
<br/>that I will raise this when we discuss this Report, is the high turnover.  It is happening in almost all 
<br/>Government Ministries, but I think it is quite serious in the Ministry of Agriculture because in here, 
<br/>we have  the  Council of  Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP)  agencies  – Pacific  Islands 
<br/>Forum  (PIF),  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Programme  (SPREP)  have 
<br/>established an office here, the Pacific Community (SPC), our universities, et cetera. The Government 
<br/>invests a lot in its human resources but then, as soon as they come back, we lose them because they 
<br/>are attracted by the offers provided by the other organisations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, when we visited the Papua New Guinea (PNG) a few years back, 
<br/>I asked the same question to the honourable Minister at PNG and they stated that they also faced the 
<br/>same problem.  But they came up with something and probably we can consider this, they always 
<br/>have a counter offer available in order to retain the staff because those particularly with Masters and 
<br/>PhDs  have  better  chances  of  moving  across  very  quickly,  particularly,  in  the  area  of  research, 
<br/>nutritionist, plant and animal breeders, et cetera, and the honourable Minister knows this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is probably something that we can consider, not a counteroffer that exceeds what we 
<br/></span><span>have been given but to match or is equivalent, perhaps with some terms and conditions that will help 
<br/>staff to reconsider the offers that they have been given because otherwise, we will keep investing in 
<br/>our people and we will keep losing them.  However, we have so many potentials and this is very 
<br/>much dependent on the capacity within. We want to do a lot of value addition, et cetera, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, but it is the capacity within.  Unfortunately, we keep losing them and, perhaps, that is something 
<br/>that the Government can consider.

<div><span>Review Report–Ministry of Agriculture 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>501 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish the honourable Minister all the very best and, again, to the team in the Ministry of 
<br/>Agriculture - keep up the good work and we hope that we will get the necessary support as well, 
<br/>particularly on funding when it comes to the next Budget. I strongly am in favour of the Report before 
<br/>Parliament and support it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition.  I think we will take note 
<br/>of that bright suggestion of getting the two Committees to come together, as you have suggested.  
<br/>We will take note of that and probably when we finalise the issue of scrutiny and oversight, then we 
<br/>should be able to get the two Committees together.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to speak on the motion that is before Parliament 
<br/>which is the Annual  Review Report of the Ministry of Agriculture for the Year 2018 to 2019.  I 
<br/>would like to thank the Committee for the formulation of this excellent Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture faces quite a lot of challenges, as have been 
<br/>highlighted in the Report.  Of course, most of us are quite aware of these challenges which include 
<br/>climate change, market access constraints and the sluggish adoption of technology, access to finance, 
<br/>human  capital,  pests  and  diseases  and,  of  course,  inadequate  infrastructure  which  has  been 
<br/>highlighted by some of the honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I  would  like to, perhaps,  raise  a few issues with  regards to  some of the 
<br/>policies that the Ministry can, perhaps, adopt to improve the Ministry and, of course, the delivery of 
<br/>their services in the sector as a whole.  The first one which I have put down here is the critical need 
<br/>to look at new ways of implementing any project that is being implemented by the Ministry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From my experience in the Ministry, all the policies and everything is there, but I think the 
<br/>implementation is one of the problems.  Of course, we need to come up with a new modality of trying 
<br/>to implement the projects.  For example, we had this funding from the Indonesian Government to the 
<br/>Prime Minister’s Office which we thought that, perhaps, we give the funds to the private sector, and 
<br/>they will be able to implement the project.  We found that quite successful because the private sector 
<br/>is the one that needs funding and they will be reporting also to us about what they have achieved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we need to have a look also into the consistency of our policies.  One of the things 
<br/>that I have found out is the inconsistency in policies.  After three years, we have a new policy and a 
<br/>few years, we have new policies again.  The farmers are there, and they are always suffering because 
<br/>when they ask for funding for a new commodity, staff, of course, say that the funding has finished.  
<br/>I would suggest, maybe for projects to go more longer term, instead of four years, maybe for projects 
<br/>to be implemented on a 10-year phase.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should be looking at how we can change the mindset 
<br/>of our people.  I think the honourable Leader of the Opposition will know about this because he has 
<br/>been talking about that for the last five years. How do we change the mindset of our people in the 
<br/>communities?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is quite important that there needs to be a more integrated approach towards changing the 
<br/></span><span>mindset of our people if we are going to have any success in the agriculture sector.  The Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government is thinking about these new ideas of working directly with the communities in trying to 
<br/>change their mindset and linking up the communities to the market.  We have a few plans and I have 
<br/>discussed it with the Minister on how we can take this plan forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are so many opportunities for people in the rural areas but, of course, they are waiting, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and they need someone to come in and hold their hand and introduce them to new technologies,

<div><span>One  of  the  things  that  I  wish  to  highlight  is  the  need  to  train  more  local  people  in  the 
<br/>communities.  I used to work on a project in Tonga where we trained local facilitators as Extension 
<br/>Officers, and I have already shared this with the honourable Leader of the Opposition. It was quite 
<br/>successful. Those are things that I have also shared with the honourable Minister, perhaps the need 
<br/>to train some of our people in the local communities to be Extension Officers because the cost will 
<br/>be much more or less, and they will be quite effective because they are in that community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all from my side and I wish to thank the Committee for the well-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>produced Report, and I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Natural 
<br/>Resources  to  speak  in  reply.  Perhaps,  if  you  could  take  a  leaf  from  what  honourable  Tubuna  is 
<br/>suggesting on what he learnt from Tonga. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  T.N.  TUNABUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Members  for  their 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contributions and support the motion before Parliament. Sir, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER. - Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of the Sitting today. I thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you for all your contributions. Parliament is now adjourned until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m.

<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 8.32 p.m.
