<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT- FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT  
<br/>2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports which was tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled 
<br/>its Consolidated Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 2021 and 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/>in  November  2023.  While  deliberating  on  the  Report,  the  Committee  noted  the  Fiji  Financial 
<br/>Intelligence Unit (FFIU) contributions towards building a stronger, legal institutional, operational 
<br/>and regulatory environment on anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism in 
<br/>Fiji  that  addresses  domestic  risk  of  money  laundering  and  complies  with  minimum  international 
<br/>standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In its findings, the Committee noted that FFIU has Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs) in 
<br/>place with several local and international stakeholders which enables them to exchange information 
<br/>regarding suspicious transactions of possible money laundering activities, gain direct access to FFIU 
<br/>database, including seconding staff to FFIU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It further noted that in addition to scams, tax evasion was found to be the other top possible 
<br/>underlying criminal activity identified in the suspicious transactions report.  The FFIU investigated 
<br/>cases where businesses had not lodged their income tax returns since 2006 and cases where business 
<br/>owners had not registered their business with Fiji Revenue and Customs Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee expressed its concern on the increasing online scams, pyramid schemes by 
<br/>using mobile money wallets and international debit cards to facilitate various online scams in 2021 
<br/>and 2022.  We would like to urge the public to be vigilant and ensure that they do not fall prey to 
<br/>malicious scams of such nature which would lead to losing their hard-earned money and savings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members felt that at present, there is no coordinated approach to deal with scams 
<br/>and money laundering and the law enforcement agencies need to act swiftly.  A timely report to FFIU 
<br/>from  financial  institutions  can  assist  in  quick  action.    There  is  a  lack  of  a  single  agency  taking 
<br/>responsibility for ensuring that these scams are filtered out in their initial stages and exposed to the 
<br/>public.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have a list of speakers provided by the two Whips, as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 1.  Honourable P.D. Kumar; 
<br/>2.  Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 3.  Honourable V. Naupoto; and  
<br/> 4.  Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for the opportunity to speak on this motion 
<br/>that  is  before  Parliament.    Before  I  speak  on  the  seven  recommendations  that  was  made  by  the 
<br/>Committee to enhance the performance of Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit (FFIU), I would like to 
<br/>express my appreciation to the  Director and staff of FFIU for their commitment to maintaining a 
<br/>credible and stable financial system, despite the evolving challenges that come with the sophisticated 
<br/>financial crimes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  FFIU was established in 2006 to assist our law enforcement agencies to 
<br/>investigate and prosecute financial crimes by providing financial intelligence and evidence which is 
<br/>very crucial.  The FFIU collects and analyses suspicious transactions and activity reports related to 
<br/>money laundering, terrorist financing and other serious crimes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, FFIU can only do its job if it receives quality and timely information from 
<br/>344 domestic stakeholders and international organisations, as the Chairman of the Committee had 
<br/>mentioned earlier. In 2022, FFIU reported 16 breaches where financial institutions did not adhere to 
<br/>the  five-day  transaction  reporting  rule.  Also,  FFIU  reported  19  data  quality  issues  by  financial 
<br/>institutions such as incomplete or incorrect information. The number may look small, but we cannot 
<br/>ignore the fact that every transaction matters to uphold the integrity of Fiji’s financial system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  FFIU  has  been  verbally  warning  the  institutions  for  non-compliance, 
<br/>although  they  have  the  powers  to  fine  these  institutions.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  Committee 
<br/>recommended FFIU to impose fines for breaching the reporting requirement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again in 2022, the estimated value of suspicious transactions that lead to criminal offence 
<br/>and tax evasion was around $252 million and the top two possible criminal activities identified by 
<br/>FFIU  were  tax  evasion  and  scams.  It  is  important  to  highlight  that  57  percent  of  the  suspicious 
<br/>transaction  cases  were  referred  to  the  Fiji  Revenue  and  Customs  Service  (FRCS)  for  possible 
<br/>violation of the Income Tax Act, Value Added Tax Act and Customs Act. The question is, how is 
<br/>FRCS protecting Government’s revenue and creating a fair and transparent business environment? 
<br/>In this regard, the Committee recommended that FFIU collaborate with FRCS to develop strategies 
<br/>to improve compliance with tax and customs regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  needs  money,  he  needs  revenue  to 
<br/>provide essential services to all Fijians. He has already fired the warning shot that the 2024-2025 
<br/>Budget will be a tough one, so every effort must be made to plug any tax revenue leakages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  all  aware  of  the  study  carried  out  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  on  the  black 
<br/>economy  in  Fiji  and in  this  Parliament, we had discussed this report so many times. Though this 
<br/>report is old, it highlighted that Fiji lost $2.8 billion as a result of informal economic activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  considering  the  rise  in  drug  and  human  trafficking,  I  believe  this  figure 
<br/>could be much higher. I think Fiji’s financial crime is much bigger than what is being reported with 
<br/>the increase in the illicit drug trade.  Drug peddling is a big business, people engage in drug sales, 
<br/>and they make a lot of money. The money trail needs to be detected to ensure our financial system is 
<br/>not  used  for  cleaning  dirty  money,  and  I  believe  more  needs  to  be  done  by  the  FFIU  and  the 
<br/></span><span>enforcement agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2021, FFIU noted an increase in online and pyramid scams with the sudden surge in the use of 
<br/>digital platforms during COVID-19. We are aware of Fiji's biggest eBay pyramid scam. What we expect 
<br/>is  timely  intervention  from  FFIU  and  also  from  the  enforcement  agencies.    The  Committee  made 
<br/>recommendations 1, 2, and 3 to ensure that FFIU uses other social media platforms to increase its online 
<br/>presence rather than just relying on press statements.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Fiji Police M-PAiSA Taskforce for their prompt action against M-
<br/>PAiSA scammers.  Almost weekly, we hear someone being charged for scamming mobile phone users, 
<br/>so I thank the Fiji Police Force for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee has proposed that  FFIU establish a feedback mechanism 
<br/>either through legislation or a Memorandum of Agreement and I emphasise,  Sir, that this is very, 
<br/>very crucial.  In 2022, the FFIU forwarded 76 percent of suspicious transaction cases to FRCS for 
<br/>tax evasion and the Fiji Police Force for proceeds of crime and multinational crime. Unfortunately, 
<br/>FFIU receives no feedback - absolutely no feedback - from these enforcement agencies.  The lack of 
<br/>oversight  and  accountability  hampers  the  assessment  of  FFIU's  performance  on  successful 
<br/>convictions or whether enforcement agencies are doing their job diligently.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  recent  segment  on  the  </span><span>60  Minutes</span><span>  programme  revealed  that  a  former 
<br/>Chinese national, now a Fiji citizen, has been on the radar of FFIU for some time. I am not surprised 
<br/>with that information, given the absence of checks and balances that should be put in place. Sadly, 
<br/>the reputation of the Fiji Police Force has been tarnished because of a few corrupt officers, who have 
<br/>been involved in tampering with drug evidence or causing files to go missing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to curb sophisticated financial crime, it is important to change regulations 
<br/>to ensure our financial system is credible and stable.  In August 2022, the  Financial Transactions 
<br/>Reporting  Act  and  Regulations  were  amended  to  reduce  the  threshold  transaction  reporting  from 
<br/>$10,000 to $5,000. With the increase in financial crimes like tax evasion, money laundering, human 
<br/>trafficking and drug peddling, it was imperative to amend the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will recall when this Bill was debated, we had honourable Members, 
<br/>like honourable Qereqeretabua, who was very worried that people would not be able to send money 
<br/>freely because of the new reporting requirement. We had honourable Gavoka who went to the extent 
<br/>of  saying  that  it  would  affect  the  ease  of  doing  business  and,  of  course,  we  had  honourable  Ro 
<br/>Tuisawau,  who  was  worried  that  this  amendment  was  introduced  to  restrict  money  flow  for  the 
<br/>elections. We still have that law in place, remittance has increased, in fact, increased a lot, the election 
<br/>was held, and the legislation did not hinder PAP from receiving funds from overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, law must evolve with time, and I hope the new CEO of FRCS, Fiji Police 
<br/>Force and FFIU will consider these recommendations to protect Government revenue, create a level 
<br/>playing field for businesses and, above all, protect the integrity of our financial system. I support the 
<br/>motion that is before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide a brief contribution on 
<br/>the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Fiji  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  2021  and  2022  Annual 
<br/>Reports as tabled in Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Firstly,  may  I  congratulate  the  agency  for  submitting  their  reports  in  a  timely  manner.  
<br/>Currently, we are seeing this as a rarity to get reports here in a timely manner so that when we make 
<br/>contributions on these reports, they are actually relevant.  For that, I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>former  Manager  of  FFIU  and  his  team  for  submitting  the  Report  in  a  timely  manner,  which  has 
<br/></span><span>allowed us to actually have some constructive discussions today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the FFIU, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is without the question that it is one of the leading 
<br/>agencies  in  Fiji,  responsible  for  the  detection  of  money  laundering  and  terrorist  activities.  
<br/>Established  under  the  Financial  Transactions  Reporting  Act  2004,  as  alluded  to  by  honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar, notwithstanding the comments from the other side of Parliament then, it is a great 
<br/>initiative because it has allowed the country to create visibility in a very challenging area in terms of  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>493 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>money flows and business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the Report, the FFIU recorded $1.9 million in Electronic Fund 
<br/>Transfer reports in 2021, as a result of increases in money remittance services from across all sectors.  
<br/>The  FFIU  analysed  752  suspicious  transactions  and  provided  174  cases  for  dissemination  to  law 
<br/>enforcement and 27 cases to other agencies.  What we have seen, as alluded to as well by honourable 
<br/>Kumar, is the rise in online scams and pyramid schemes, and the use of mobile money wallets and 
<br/>international debit cards to facilitate online scams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  this  side  of  Parliament,  I  am  pleased  to  report  that  rather  than  just  looking  at  this 
<br/>information when it first came to hand last year while we just started in Government, we decided to 
<br/>form  an  Anti-Scam  Taskforce,  which  is  already  in  existence.    Through  it,  the  M-PAiSA  Police 
<br/>Taskforce came into creation and what that has done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that for the first time, we 
<br/>have visibility over what is happening in terms of money laundering and scams in our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  idea,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  it  is  not  going  to  be  a  long-term  Taskforce.    We  are 
<br/>combining together across agencies merely to create visibility on issues regarding to scams and then 
<br/>create teeth in legislations.  So, I hope, in the not too distant future, to return to Parliament to actually 
<br/>talk about, through the honourable Attorney-General and the honourable Minister of Finance, what 
<br/>we are going to do to ensure that there is teeth in the legislation to be able to prosecute on the scams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the interesting things I discovered, Mr. Speaker, and this is information for both sides 
<br/>of Parliament was that, in the current legislative framework, you cannot actually stop a scam until it 
<br/>is actually reported.  If the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) sees a scheme and feels that it does not look 
<br/>right, nothing can be done until someone reports a loss on that scam.  So, we are hoping that through 
<br/>this Taskforce, we can create a more proactive approach so that we clamp down on some of these 
<br/>schemes as they evolve rather than when the horse is bolted, we then are talking about a historical 
<br/>event.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That, I think, is a positive contribution from this side of Parliament, reacting to circumstances 
<br/>as they had happened over the last year, particularly, and we hope to come back to Parliament to 
<br/>actually make good on our intent to really tighten up the laws and ensure that the agencies involved 
<br/>have the powers to actually do what they should do when these types of schemes or scams emerge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another interesting fact from the Report alludes to cases where businesses had not lodged 
<br/>their tax returns since 2006, as well as business owners that had not registered their businesses with 
<br/>FRCS  and  perhaps,  just  as  a  comment  I  know  this  is  something  that  the  honourable  Minister  of 
<br/>Finance is looking into, is to see what can be done for the two agencies to collaborate a lot closer to 
<br/>ensure that this kind of leakages, if you like, in the tax system can be plugged so that the money 
<br/>owing to Government is rightfully collected Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two other points, we are facing one of the major challenges of our 
<br/>generations right now in terms of the drug crisis in our country.  So, it is important that Government 
<br/>and certainly we will make sure that the FFIU continues to be well resourced to address the scourge 
<br/>that is  occurring  in  our  country and ensure that  the drug  crisis  that  currently  exists is  thoroughly 
<br/></span><span>addressed  in  terms  of  the  money  flows  in  and  out,  and  to  ensure  that  we  can  crack  down  to  this 
<br/></span><span>criminal activity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in wrapping up, I would like to congratulate the FFIU for engaging 
<br/>with our Australian counterparts that do tracking.  It is called the Australian Transaction Reports and 
<br/>Analysis  Centre  (AUSTRAC).  I  understand  the  engagement  is  to  try  and  capacity  build  and 
<br/>strengthen the FFIU and from outside of Parliament, we will certainly ensure that we build on this

<div><span>Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regional  solidarity,  as  we  try  and  remain  united  in  our  battle  against  money  laundering,  the  drug 
<br/>problem and, of course, terrorist financing activities around the world. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I welcome the findings and recommendations made 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>by the Committee and I thank the FFIU for all the good work they are doing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament.  I would like to thank the Committee for the Review Report, thank you for the findings 
<br/>and the recommendations that are in there and I hope the relevant agencies will read the Report and 
<br/>look at the very good recommendations and findings that you have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to pick up on your finding number eight and if I read it, it says, “FFIU analysed 
<br/>752  suspicious  transaction  reports,  provided  174  case  dissemination  reports  to  law  enforcement 
<br/>agencies and 27 cases linked to other cases already disseminated but did not receive feedback on the 
<br/>outcome of these reports.”  I hope that something can be done so that they can provide the feedback 
<br/>for  those  who  work  in  the  intelligence  community.    They  know  that  information  requirement  or 
<br/>Request  for  Information  (RFI), the loop  needs to be closed before that  information  is  turned into 
<br/>intelligence, then it is the intelligence that is useful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is an Intelligence Unit and if agencies do not close that loop and report back, as they 
<br/>found out in the Committee Report, then they are not giving the FFIU the tool for them to do their 
<br/>job - intelligence and it just remains as information and is never turned into intelligence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I had raised this before, crime of this nature is transnational and what FIU 
<br/>is looking at, and I refer to the Budapest Convention.  I had raised this before on when will we sign 
<br/>up to the Convention. I know that our Committee had looked at it and brought it back to Parliament 
<br/>and  it  is  up  to  the  Government  to  bring  it  back  for  it  to  be  passed  by  Parliament  because  it  is 
<br/>transnational.  We need the cooperation; we need to link up with those that are at the front of this 
<br/>fight against cybercrime and that Convention provides a very good tool in that fight that we have.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are seven recommendations.  First of all, may 
<br/>I also highlight how appreciative I am in terms of the Report.  It is a very educational tool, neatly 
<br/>done, comprehensive and anyone can pick up this Report by the Standing Committee and follow 
<br/>what  the  FIU  does.    It  is  very  elaborate  and,  again,  I  echo  the  same  sentiments  as  expressed  by 
<br/>honourable Kamikamica, it is a lesson for Government Departments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Monday, we were dealing with an Annual Report for after eight years, here we are dealing 
<br/>with  2021  and  2022  -  more  relevant,  easier  for  planning  and  also,  it  is  detailed  and  it  is  very 
<br/>informative for anyone, even for Parliamentarians and outsiders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  few  issues,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  I  just  wish  to  highlight  and  one  of  which  is 
<br/>Recommendation No. 2 in terms of how they reach out to members of the public.  I hope that through 
<br/>the relevant Ministries that this information regarding the scam, reaches the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> level and also the 
<br/></span><span>Bose ni Yasana</span><span>.  Why?  Because most of them, in my view, are the people in the rural areas who are 
<br/></span><span>not familiar with the kind of scam that are going on.  They need to know how the game is played, 
<br/></span><span>otherwise, they will be easily cheated.  Some are represented at the provincial level, others, I believe, 
<br/>should  be  more  information  at  the  </span><span>Tikina</span><span>  level.    Also,  the  issue  that  has  been  highlighted  by 
<br/>honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Naupoto is the close interaction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I reached out to one of the members of the Council in 2022 and this is the concern, she has 
<br/>never attended any meeting.  I am told that there is no meeting of the council for the whole of last 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="70">Page 70</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FFIU 2021-2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>495 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>year.  There has been a meeting of the council this year.  They are important people, very busy people, 
<br/>and this could also be one of the reasons that affects how often they do meet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My  concern,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  if  an  important  entity  wants  information  but  that 
<br/>information has not been positively used.  I reached out to a staff of the Ministry of Home Affairs 
<br/>and was  advised way back in 2014.  Honourable Naupoto would be aware as well as honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua, as he was the Commissioner of Police, honourable Vasu would be aware as he was the 
<br/>Commissioner of Prisons. The combined law enforcement agency is a very important agency that   
<br/>digest some of the information that comes from FIU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that I found out last year was that it is non-existent.  So, 
<br/>we wonder why the detection and the number of agencies have actually been lower in the past years 
<br/>than initially in 2018.  I will take on board, as the Minister responsible, to ensure, first of all, that the 
<br/>Council meets.  I am told there was a Terms of Reference that was supposed to be circulated and 
<br/>probably was not finalised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The advertisement for the Director will soon be put in the papers so that a substantive post 
<br/>can be filled.  I also wish to acknowledge the role played by the former Director for many years as 
<br/>the Director of FIU.  It is a very small unit with two staff on secondment from Fiji Revenue and 
<br/>Customs Authority and one from the Fiji Police Force.  Maybe, it is high tide from 2004 to really 
<br/>look at the legislation, review the members, and also make sure that they are more accountable at 
<br/>their work so that the intelligence collated are put into practical action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am pleased of the fact that there has been some successful prosecution, I have noted 32 in 
<br/>all.  I also note in one of the press-release regarding the role played by FIU in terms of Musa.  I echo 
<br/>what honourable Naivalurua said.  Yes, there is a transnational crime being committed or practised 
<br/>here in Fiji and there are a lot of cases of unexplained wealth. It is so visible, but what we need is to 
<br/>use that information and with a close collaboration with the Police and FICAC so that it leads to a 
<br/>successful  prosecution.  Only  then,  then  we  can  say  that  FIU  is  playing  its  key  role  in  terms  of 
<br/>combating the financial crimes that are being practised in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I commend the Report to Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I noted the need to have more check and balances 
<br/>within  the  financial  system,  with  the  increase  in  drug  trafficking,  money  laundering  and  human 
<br/>trafficking - the role of FIU is very critical. Money remittance is a critical source of revenue to the 
<br/>country and the use of mobile wallets need to be closely monitored.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Dissemination of information has been highlighted by most of the contributors and it is very 
<br/>critical so that information reaches the relevant institution and particularly, our communities in the 
<br/>outer islands.  Inter-agency collaboration is very critical. It is quite important that the various agencies 
<br/>play the usual role and, of course, ensuring that they address the regulation that they are supposed to 
<br/>be policing.
