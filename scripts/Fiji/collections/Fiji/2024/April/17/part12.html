<br/>Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>COP 28 and Climate Change 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  good to  see  you  back.    You  were  very  capably 
<br/>replaced by your Deputy Speaker yesterday.  While we enjoyed her presidency of the meeting, we 
<br/>also prayed for your good recovery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I welcome all honourable Members  this morning - the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable  Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition and Members of the Opposition, as well as ladies and gentlemen in the gallery and 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen who may be watching us on the livestreaming of our procedures in Parliament.  
<br/>Sir,  we  also  wish  our  Hindu  brothers  and  sisters  a  very  meaningful  and  happy  </span><span>Rama  Navami</span><span>
<br/>celebration today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver this Ministerial Statement on the proceedings of the 28</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conference of Parties, otherwise known as COP 28, held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Statement will elaborate on the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the outcomes of the Conference of Parties (COP 28) Meeting; 
<br/>reflect on global progress in responding to climate change; and  
<br/>outline directions and priorities on climate change in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Overall State of Play – Towards a Region of Peace, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister for Environment and Climate Change, I remain very concerned at the scale of the effects 
<br/>of climate challenge that we face and the existential threat it poses to the wellbeing of our nation and 
<br/>the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we have seen and experienced, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the seasonal patterns our ancestors lived 
<br/>by  are  very  quickly  shifting.  From  more  frequent  and  extreme  rainfall  events  to  unseasonable 
<br/>droughts,  intensified  cyclones  and  higher  average  temperatures,  the  challenges  and  changes  are 
<br/>disorienting for the island population for the Blue Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the same time, we experience different localised permutations of climate threat, depending 
<br/>on where we are, how we live, and what we depend on.  What is constant in this complexity of crisis 
<br/>is  that  the  collective  effort  of  Pacific  Leaders  to  build  unity  and  mobilise  action  to  protect  our 
<br/></span><span>collective future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  we  can  rely  on  this  unity  in  the  Pacific,  unfortunately,  in  many  cases,  this  is  an 
<br/>exception to the rule. Looking further afield and reading beyond the political rhetoric, it is clear that 
<br/>global cooperation is faltering at a time when we need it most.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>434 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  Mr.  Speaker,  geopolitical  rivalry  remains  a  core  driver  of  many  interests.  
<br/>Rather  than  find  motivation  and  common  purpose  to  -combat  the  shared  suffering  of  the  climate 
<br/>crisis;  combat  the  staggering  loss  of  biodiversity  we  are  experiencing;  or  commit  a  realistic  and 
<br/>equitable share of international capacity and resources to reduce damage to livelihoods, many large 
<br/>economies remain focussed on short-term gain and inter and intra-regional competitions.  We are 
<br/>experiencing some of those right now, and this is why we continue to bring attention to the broad  
<br/>concept of peace and security, which must underpin our regional and global vision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rivalry  and  disunity  is  undermining  efforts  to  address  climate  change  at  the  scale  that  is 
<br/>required.  So, when it comes to concepts of peace and security, and the need for our region to share 
<br/>these aspirations, I speak to issues of geopolitics and climate change as one and the same. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Mitigation and Global Stocktake, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you have heard in Dubai, the 
<br/>world is not on track to keep global average temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.  Keeping 
<br/>global  temperature  rise  below  1.5  degrees  is  not  a  political  objective,  or  by  perspectives  or 
<br/>preferences, instead, it is a guardrail identified by thousands of leading scientists and is the threshold 
<br/>beyond which life on earth changes dramatically. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Pacific,  the  difference  between  1.5  degrees  and  2.0  degrees  or  3.0  degrees  is  the 
<br/>difference between habitability of our island homes and forced migration.  It is the difference between 
<br/>catching your own fish and growing your own family’s food or being wholly dependent on imported 
<br/>protein.  It is the difference between economic sovereignty and fully fledged dependence on external 
<br/>aid and disaster relief. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the difference between 1.5 degrees, and 2.0 degrees or 3.0 degrees Celsius 
<br/>is a distinction that involves great consequences for all people in all regions, not just for our people 
<br/>in the Pacific.  However, here in the Pacific, the difference is not subtle - the difference is a knife 
<br/>edge.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific must continue to  present  the voice  of pragmatism  and influence to  those who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appear increasingly committed to disunity and ultimately, self-harm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last  year’s  28</span><span>th</span><span>  Annual  Conference  of  the  Parties  to  the  United  Nations  Framework 
<br/>Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (COP 28) convened from 28</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023 to 13</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>December, 2023 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  COP  28  was  mandated  to  reflect  on  progress  made  since  the  Paris 
<br/>Agreement agreed in 2015 (COP 21) - seven years prior to that.  The final decision text agreed upon 
<br/>in Dubai, which is referred to as the </span><span>UAE Consensus</span><span>, documents the lack of progress made to-date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  the  first  decision,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  text  agreed  upon  in  the  28  years  of  these 
<br/>gatherings  that  makes  explicit  reference  to  fossil  fuels  and  introduces  a  global  commitment  to 
<br/>transition away from fossil fuels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While there are few large economies that continue to push against this transition, many are 
<br/></span><span>working  hard  to  embrace  it  and  there  is  increasing  potential  in  the  uptake  of  renewable  energy 
<br/></span><span>globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, to ramp up our own efforts to decarbonise our economy, we need to be clear on 
<br/>why we are pursuing decarbonization in Fiji.  With our minimal contribution to global emissions, our 
<br/>reasoning is more about economic benefits of this transition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>435 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, Fiji is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels and as such, 
<br/>we are exposed to the increasing oil price volatility that we see annually.  The price of oil impacts all 
<br/>aspects of our daily lives. It is felt across our value chains, at the shops and markets, in our daily 
<br/>purchases, in our transport systems and our whole economy.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it drives our 
<br/>inflation  and  the  high  cost  of  living.    While  we  must  be  practical  about  how  and  where  renewal 
<br/>alternatives will be viable, we know that there is huge benefit that is largely untapped. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must be pragmatic when it comes to decarbonization. We must focus on 
<br/>transitioning  energy  systems  in  ways  that  build  resilience  and  increase  economic  independence.  
<br/>Whether it is landowners (either </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> or freehold) releasing their land to host solar arrays to power 
<br/>communities, or electric buses that reduce emissions and increase public transport uptake, or strategic 
<br/>investments into locally produced biofuels, we must be open to these opportunities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At COP 28, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we signed the Global Renewable and Energy Efficiency Pledge, 
<br/>to triple the world’s installed renewable energy by 2030, which involves a further commitment to 
<br/>collectively double global average energy efficiency improvements every year until 2030.  We hope 
<br/>Fiji can benefit from this global pledge.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Loss  and  Damage,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  our  people,  struggling  with  flood  waters  and 
<br/>rising  fuel  costs,  we  must  continue  to  bring  attention  to  the  loss  and  damage  we  already  are 
<br/>experiencing.  At COP 28, a major headline was the agreement on the operationalization of the new 
<br/>Loss and Damage Fund agreed to at COP 27.  Fiji and the Pacific nations engaged in a 12 months 
<br/>negotiation process through the Transitional Committee to design the governing instrument of this 
<br/>new Fund in 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our collaborative work with our Pacific Small Islands Developing States (PSIDS) family led 
<br/>to Fiji’s inclusion as a member of the new Loss and Damage Board.  What Fiji brings to this process 
<br/>is our experience with the limits of adaptation which we are actively facing daily in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  national  level,  following  endorsement  of  the  Standard  Operating  Procedures  for 
<br/>Planned Relocation last year, we are moving forward with the relocation of Nabavatu community. 
<br/>We had a question raised yesterday on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Adaptation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we signed our additional pledges and declarations at COP 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28 and these are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health. 
<br/></span><span>The Climate Relief, Recovery and Peace Declaration. 
<br/>The Gender Response, Just Transition and Climate Action Declaration.  
<br/>The  UAE Declaration on Sustainable  Agriculture,  Resilient  Food Systems and  Climate 
<br/>Action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will follow up on opportunities for these pledges to translate into tangible benefits for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>vulnerable Small Island Developing States.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  COP  28,  it  is  clear  that  irrespective  of  support  and  opportunities  that  exist, 
<br/>Government must take the lead in ramping up domestic adaptation efforts.  This means developing 
<br/>more  robust  and  larger  scale  climate  financing  proposals  and  engaging  effectively  to  support  our 
<br/>access to finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Overarching Priorities into 2024, with those in mind, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will accelerate adaptation programme to build resilience and create a prosperous future for our 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, for the rest of 2024, we will focus on the following priorities on the domestic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>front: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Delivering against the Strategic Implementation Roadmap for Fiji’s Climate Change Act 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to increase collaboration across sectors and better coordinate efforts. 
<br/>Increasing access to financing through the new Loss and Damage Fund; the new Pacific 
<br/>Resilience Facility; and other international climate finance mechanisms. 
<br/>Engaging  effectively  in  global  negotiations  on  the  new  quantified  collective  goal  for 
<br/>climate finance in preparation for COP 29. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In concluding, on Bipartisanship and Collaboration, Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to 
<br/>thank the members of the Fiji delegation to COP 28.  In particular, I must thank you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, and your team, and respective Cabinet Ministers for engaging in the COP 28 process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  specifically  thank  honourable  Inia  Seruiratu,  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  for 
<br/>joining  the Fiji  delegation and in  so doing,  embodying  the bipartisan approach to  climate change 
<br/>which is so important for our nation, and he brings along with him the experiences from the previous 
<br/>Government where he was one of the Champions of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within this Government and this nation, addressing climate change and preventing further 
<br/>harm to the people of Fiji is a bipartisan priority, which is above politics.  In saying that, we must 
<br/>now  shift  gear  to  accelerate  the  implementation  of  our  objectives.  We  need  to  be  increasingly 
<br/>strategic, collaborative and open minded to manage the long-term nature of this existential threat.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji maybe recognised as a world leader for our efforts to lead on policy and international 
<br/>advocacy on climate change over the years, but we will be judged by our ability to deliver results.  It 
<br/>is the results, rather than the diplomatic fanfare upon which the People’s Coalition Government is 
<br/>focused. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcomes of COP 28 are a reminder for Fiji to deliver at the national 
<br/>level to underline our commitment to both, international leadership and domestic action.  No nation 
<br/>is exempt from the impact of climate change.  No nation can address it alone, but if we work together, 
<br/>we  can  achieve  much  more.    Keeping  momentum  on  this  priority  is  the  only  way  to  create  the 
<br/>enabling environment for the peace, security and prosperity we all expect from the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this stage, I would like to join with the people of Namosi, in welcoming 
<br/>back  </span><span>Na  Turaga  Bale  na  Vunivalu  na  Tui  Namosi</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>who  will  be  instrumental  in  one  of  his  new 
<br/>developments of the search for a new source of renewable energy from Namosi inland waterways.  I 
<br/>thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do join the honourable Prime Minister and also 
<br/>on this auspicious occasion of </span><span>Rama Navami </span><span>to convey to the Sanatan followers who are celebrating 
<br/></span><span>Rama Navami </span><span>today</span><span> </span><span>a very happy and meaningful </span><span>Rama Navami </span><span>celebration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for his Statement and he 
<br/>has  stated  a  lot,  particularly  on  what  is  happening  at  the  global  scene  and,  particularly,  what  is 
<br/>relevant for Fiji in terms of the way forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again,  I also  acknowledge the honourable Prime Minister for hearing the plea and advice 
<br/>from  the  honourable  Chairman,  to  do  participate  in  COP  28.    I  know  that  it  is  a  big  learning 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>437 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>experience for all of us. I do acknowledge as well the Government, especially the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, in considering including the Leader of the Opposition as a member of his delegation and, 
<br/>of course, as member of the IPU joining your delegation, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I have made some recommendations, honourable Prime Minister, to the Senior Officials. I 
<br/>think we need to have a debrief, and congratulations to the Permanent Secretary for Environment and 
<br/>Climate Change – Dr. Sivendra Michael.  I think he is in the process of organising this because there 
<br/>is a lot to learn from COP and COP is not easy because there are geopolitics, there are thematic areas 
<br/>and there are processes within and there is a lot that we could learn.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are Senior officials and Diplomats out there, who are already exposed in this arena, 
<br/>who can help us, help the Government and help all of us.  Even in the discussions in the Opposition 
<br/>Chamber on Friday last week, they were interested, and I talked about COP and SIDS4, et cetera. 
<br/>These are capacity development, but it is good that we have a debrief, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Prime Minister, Sir, and honourable Members of Parliament, I will just focus on 
<br/>three areas, probably just to look at Fiji particularly as a country, and the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>has alluded to most of what Fiji is considering.  Of course, in terms of our role in the wider Pacific 
<br/>Small Island Developing States (PSIDS) and Alliance Of Small Island States (AOSIS), that is very, 
<br/>very critical and I link that, Sir, with SIDS4 that is going to happen in Antigua and Barbuda in May 
<br/>this year.  This is a very critical year for SIDS, given the special circumstances of SIDS in the space 
<br/>of sustainable development and, of course, the role of Parliament, as you have alluded to earlier, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  Fiji,  again,  on  the  areas  of  improvement,  you  have  mentioned  it, 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, Sir, but the increase to climate financing is so important for us. It is one 
<br/>thing to have finance available, but it is about the accessing of those finances that is very important 
<br/>for us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening our pathways to Net Zero in terms of renewable, in terms of transportation and 
<br/>the so many good things, we need to focus on that.  But may I remind Government, let us not only 
<br/>concentrate on adaption.  Adaption is for our survival, but mitigation is important in every aspects 
<br/>where we can do mitigation, that is always recommended because more mitigation now means lesser 
<br/>adaptation in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Loss and damage, of course, we are in the Board, and we congratulate Fiji for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Waste and pollution, of course, the monitoring of our biodiversity. Perhaps, in terms of few 
<br/>of our priorities forward, Sir, the improving of data, the enabling environment and also finalising the 
<br/>National  Adaptation  Plan,  the  National  Biodiversity  Strategic  Action  Plan  because  these  will 
<br/>complement the work that has already been undertaken. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will just focus on the year 2022 to 2024.  As I have stated, we have come 
<br/>a long way from 1990 into 1994 where we had the Bridgetown Barbados Action Plan, and then we 
<br/>have the Mauritius International Agreement - that was the first cycle after 10 years, then we have the 
<br/></span><span>SAMOA Pathway, and this year is a critical year for Small Island Developing States.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister said we really need to strengthen the link between PSIDS and 
<br/>AOSIS.  If I am correct, Samoa is now the Chair of AOSIS, so let us support Samoa because although 
<br/>the priorities have not changed in terms of the SAMOA Pathway, the Barbados Action Plan and the 
<br/>Mauritius  Strategy,  but  what  worries  us  is  that  the  situation  has  gotten  worse.    There  are  special 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>circumstances for SIDS, and that is why Antigua and Barbuda this year in May is so important for 
<br/>the AOSIS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  leadership,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sir,  I  will  beg  the  Pacific  Leaders, 
<br/>including you, me and Mia Mottley is doing an excellent job as a leader from the Caribbean. We 
<br/>need that strong voice as well from the Pacific, given the situation that we are in now and the review 
<br/>of the SAMOA Pathway that is happening this year.  We can discuss too on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Sir, the role of Parliament. We have an Act, you are reviewing the National Adaption 
<br/>Plan, and then we have other plans, we need to continue with this.  You are well aware with this, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, because there need to be a convergence between what the IPU is doing and Mr. Speaker 
<br/>is  well  aware  of  this,  what  is  happening  in  the  General  Assembly  and  what  is  happening  in  the 
<br/>UNFCCC process, particularly, when it comes to this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in COP 28, the Pacific has launched its mobility framework. This is 
<br/>one issue that we have been raising as a country and Mr. Speaker is also leading on this, honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister, Sir, on the issue of migration and forced displacement. You have mentioned it, but 
<br/>the question that we have now is, we have the Pacific Mobility Framework but what will we, as a 
<br/>receiving country do, when it comes to our brothers and sisters from the Pacific Islands coming into 
<br/>Fiji?  We need to prepare for that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is so much to discuss, but thank you for the extra time allocated, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We 
<br/>will always work together on this and we, from this side of Parliament, will offer all that we can so 
<br/>that we can continue to move this forward.  Thank you, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Leader of the Opposition. Thank you so much for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your great contribution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea and we will resume 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>when the bell is sounded.

<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, before I begin my remarks, may I 
<br/>just first re-echo as did the honourable Prime Minister the well wishes to our brothers and sisters on 
<br/>a blessed </span><span>Ram Navmi</span><span> celebrations today.  Also, may I be allowed to just offer a word of tribute to a 
<br/>leader of Fiji who served as a Minister as well for a short time, and I speak of the late Ratu Esira 
<br/>Rabuno who passed away about a week ago.  After serving his country well, he spent a lot of time in 
<br/>university academia and served as a Minister in the 2006 Government.  He, of course, is my chief 
<br/>and  I  rise  on  behalf  of  the  people  of  Tailevu  and  </span><span>vanua</span><span>  of  Navitomi  to  acknowledge  his  great 
<br/>contributions to our country and also to our </span><span>vanua</span><span>.  We will miss him and may his soul rest in peace. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  rise  today  to  deliver  a  Ministerial 
<br/>Statement on Fiji’s engagement in the recent World Trade Organisation 13</span><span>th</span><span> Ministerial Conference 
<br/>held in Abu Dhabi from 26th February to 2</span><span>nd</span><span> March 2024.  Every two years, the Ministers for Trade 
<br/>for all WTO member States converge on what is called “the Ministerial Conference” which is the 
<br/>highest governing body of the WTO, which decides on the rules of trade for the globe.  The meeting 
<br/>this year was held in Abu Dhabi, and it was the 13</span><span>th</span><span> Ministerial Conference of the WTO, or as it is 
<br/>commonly called “MC13”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, two new members were admitted into the WTO - the Republic of 
<br/>Timor-Leste and the Comoros bringing the total membership of the WTO to 165 members with 24 
<br/>observer governments.  Fiji attended MC13 together with five other fellow Pacific countries who are 
<br/>member States namely, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  In fact, 
<br/>the  Pacific  had  a  very  high  level  delegation  attending  MC13  which  included  two  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers  from  Vanuatu  and  Fiji  and  full  Trade  Ministers  from  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa  and 
<br/>Tonga, the exception being Solomon Islands only because the honourable Minister could not attend 
<br/>due  to  election  commitments.    At  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  Pacific  Heads  of 
<br/>Delegation which formed a very formidable team for the Pacific at MC13. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For Vanuatu, the honourable Matai Seremaiah Nawalu, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
<br/>for Foreign Affairs, Internal Co-operation and External Trade.  From PNG, the honourable Richard 
<br/>Maru,  Minister  for  International  Trade  and  Investment.  Samoa  was  honourable  Leota  Laki 
<br/>Lamositele, from Tonga was honourable Dr. Viliami Uasike Latu and from Solomon Islands was 
<br/>honourable Natalia Patternot, Director for External Trade, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In some ways, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, the quality of the delegation reflected the importance of the topics that were 
<br/>to be covered at MC13.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the issues around e-Commerce, moratoriums and agricultural subsidies, MC13 
<br/>was viewed as the Conference to resolve the final issue relating to fisheries subsidies over capacity 
<br/>and overfishing as we know a very dear topic to the Pacific and its people.  Fiji was invited to head 
<br/>the delegation and, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure you we fought really hard for the Pacific.  
<br/>I hope when the history  of MC13 is  written, I am  confident  or relatively confident  that all WTO 
<br/></span><span>member states will be in no doubt, that when matters relating to oceans or climate change arise, the 
<br/></span><span>Pacific are big boys, not small boys and I will return to this later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the Conference our negotiating posture was to advocate for fair 
<br/>and  equitable  trade  practices  that  prioritise  the  needs  of  developing  nations,  stability  in  trading 
<br/>systems, a functioning multilateral system and reliant supply chains that includes smaller nations.  
<br/>The WTO Conference provided the Pacific and Fiji an opportunity to shape policies that resonate 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with our own unique circumstances, contributing to more equitable and prosperous global trading 
<br/>systems.  Fiji  particularly  emphasised  the  importance  of  addressing  challenges  such  as  Climate 
<br/>Change and Sustainable Development within the framework of the trade agreements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  will  now  just  focus  on  the  Fisheries  Subsidies  which  was  in 
<br/>essence the main purpose of the Pacific’s attendance at the MC13.  Why are Fisheries Subsidies so 
<br/>important? According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization - 2022 State of World Fisheries 
<br/>and Aquaculture Report also known as the SOFIA Report, 35 percent of fish stocks worldwide are 
<br/>exploited beyond sustainable levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We suspect, Madam Deputy Speaker, that that has increased.  Experts note that Governments 
<br/>around the world are paying more than US$22 billion a year in subsidies and this drives overfishing. 
<br/>The  subsidies  primarily  go  to  industrial  fishing  fleets  to  artificially  lower  their  fuel  and  vessel 
<br/>construction costs while enabling them to catch more fish farther and farther out to sea for longer 
<br/>periods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  result,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  should  be  no  surprise  that  there  is  virtually  un-
<br/>negligible presence of a local tuna industry in the Pacific in terms of vessels and operations.  Fiji and 
<br/>the Pacific, of course, has been an advocate for international disciplines on Fisheries Subsidies and 
<br/>the preservation of the last sustainable stock of tuna in the world.  In fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>the Pacific holds two-thirds of the world’s tuna stock. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Pacific leaders when mandating the Trade Ministers to attend MC13 had given very clear 
<br/>directives,  encouraging  that  we  conclude  a  comprehensive  set  of  disciplines  of  overfishing  and 
<br/>overcapacity  which  will  deliver  reasonable  outcomes  for  the  Pacific.    What  do  I  mean  by 
<br/>comprehensive disciplines?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  more  than  20  years  of  negotiations  at  the  WTO,  a  Partial  Agreement  of  Fisheries 
<br/>Subsidies was concluded at the last Ministerial Conference (MC12) in June of 2022 in Geneva.  The 
<br/>Partial Agreement prohibited certain forms of Fisheries Subsidies in the following three situations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Fishing of already over-exploited stocks; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Fishing on unregulated high seas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to acknowledge the contributions of honourable Koya who was quite instrumental in 
<br/></span><span>concluding  the  first  wave,  if  you  like,  of  the  Fisheries  Subsidies  Agreement.    However,  as  was 
<br/></span><span>acknowledged at the time, it was merely a partial agreement that was concluded which did not fully 
<br/>achieve the Ministerial mandates on Sustainable Development Goal 14.6. It did not address subsidies 
<br/>that contributed to overfishing and overcapacity. For this reason, the WTO viewed the MC13 as the 
<br/>Conference where this was going to be resolved.  How did we go, Madam Deputy Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Pacific  did  go  to  Abu  Dhabi  to  fight  for  the  Pacific.    We  worked  very  long  hours  to 
<br/>protect our key offensive and defensive interest on Fisheries Subsidies.  We demanded that our voices 
<br/>be heard as equals.  We asked the WTO to ensure that fisheries resources are sustainably managed 
<br/></span><span>and not overfished.  We pleaded that our oceans and resources are protected for future generations 
<br/></span><span>and the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  was  honoured  to  lead  the  Pacific  group  with  an  aim  to  negotiate  disciplines  on  the 
<br/>Fisheries  Subsidies  considered  harmful  that  contribute  to  overcapacity  and  overfishing.    We 
<br/></span><span>emphasised  that  it  was  vital  to  recognise  that  appropriate  and  effective  Special  and  Differential 
<br/></span><span>Treatment (S&amp;DT) be in place for developing country members such as Fiji and least developing 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countries and these were to be central parts of the negotiations.  In layman’s terms, we simply wanted 
<br/>to  correct  the  injustices  of  the  past  and  present,  that  is,  to  enable  nations  that  own  the  fisheries 
<br/>resources to develop their own fisheries sector and to do so sustainably.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Distant Water Fishing Nations (DWFNs) that fish over 90 percent of the fish stocks may 
<br/>not do so sustainably.  If current practices continue, Madam Deputy Speaker, the risk of overfishing 
<br/>and overcapacity is real.  This will be disastrous for the Pacific. We have not been able to have had 
<br/>any significant input in our own industries as I had mentioned, thus it is better that we be custodians 
<br/>of our own resources.  As such, Small Island States like Fiji, will need the flexibility to assist local 
<br/>fishing co-operatives and communities with support such as fishing equipment, provision of outboard 
<br/>motors and fishing nets, to name are few.  Additionally, we also needed an equitable platform where 
<br/>the Pacific and Fiji has not been able to compete with the bigger operators that are subsidised, as I 
<br/>had mentioned. Therefore, that is why the meeting in Abu Dhabi was very important.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we worked tirelessly to attain the support of the Members when we 
<br/>got there.  We went past that deadline of a conclusion of the negotiations on 29</span><span>th</span><span> February, which 
<br/>was extended into the early hours of 2</span><span>nd</span><span> March.  We regrouped countless times, re-drafted our textual 
<br/>proposals, we met the WTO Director-General, Secretariat, Chairman of the Rules Committee and in 
<br/>fisheries negotiations, the Permanent Representative of Iceland to the United Nations in Geneva, His 
<br/>Excellency  Einar  Gunnarsson  and  the  Fisheries  Facilitator,  the  Permanent  Secretary  for  State 
<br/>(Assistant Minister) for Iceland, Mr. Martin Eyjolfsson respectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The main reason for the numerous around the clock meetings was to ensure that we would 
<br/>have a successful outcome and deliver a comprehensive agreement on Fisheries Subsidies for our 
<br/>people and our leaders.  I had the pleasure and honour of working with the Chairman of MC13, His 
<br/>Excellency  Dr. Thani  bin  Ahmed Al Zeyoudi,  the UAE Minister of State for  Foreign  Trade who 
<br/>expressed his understanding in terms of our Fisheries Subsidies aspirations.  We did not stop there, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, we continued to have meetings with the WTO members such as Australia, 
<br/>New  Zealand,  Bangladesh,  Barbados,  Canada,  CARICOM  Group,  European  Union,  Guyana 
<br/>(Coordinator  for  CARICOM),  Japan,  India,  New  Zealand,  Singapore,  United  States  of  America 
<br/>(USA), United Kingdom and the Distant Water Fishing Nations such as China, Korea and Taiwan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just imagine this, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Pacific was talking as equals with some of the 
<br/>largest  economies in  the world  when it came to  our fishing  resource  and our oceans because our 
<br/>future generations’ lives and livelihoods were at stake.  What was the result?  Unfortunately, despite 
<br/>all our hard efforts of the Pacific, Fiji and other like-minded members in calling for prohibitions that 
<br/>contributed  to  over-capacity  and  over-fishing,  unfortunately  MC13  was  not  able  to  conclude  an 
<br/>outcome for a Comprehensive Agreement on Fisheries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since the World Trade Organization (WTO) is a consensus-based organisation, it is required 
<br/>that all the 165 members provide full endorsement and even one dissension means that an outcome 
<br/>cannot be reached.  While the WTO members were not able to conclude a second wave at MC13, 
<br/>trust me, Madam Deputy Speaker, when I say, our efforts have not been lost.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the concluding remarks in the General Council session, in the informal session, I made an 
<br/></span><span>impassioned  plea  to  all  WTO  members  to  not  let  this  opportunity  of  safeguarding  our  oceans 
<br/></span><span>particularly the Pacific slip.  Whilst we could not seal the deal in Abu Dhabi, we should continue to 
<br/>negotiate with the same passion and vigour.  I asked as a symbolic gesture for all Trade Ministers 
<br/>and Ambassadors that agreed with Fiji and the Pacific to stand up and be seen.  I am happy to report, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, that almost every delegate stood and gave a standing ovation to the Pacific 
<br/>and  Fiji  towards  the  continuation  of  negotiations.    It  was  a  strong  signal  of  the  commitment  to 
<br/>continue negotiations after MC13 and we are acutely aware that time is ticking.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also happy to report that we are not giving up.  There are two positive developments, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, that I would like to share with this august Parliament.  A coalition against 
<br/>over-capacity and over-fishing.  While we will continue to fight  and progress our efforts towards 
<br/>negotiating a comprehensive and balanced agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, Australia, Fiji and New 
<br/>Zealand will instigate a regional and multi-lateral initiative to form a coalition against over-capacity 
<br/>and over-fishing.  This idea is a start of what we hope is a group of like-minded countries that are 
<br/>ready to act in terms of disciplining high subsidies that lead to over-capacity and over-fishing and 
<br/>eventually building global momentum.  The idea is to also reach out for low hanging fruit that can 
<br/>lead  to  more  sustainable  practices  including  channelling  investments  in  the  Pacific  and  other 
<br/>countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second news that  I  would like to  share, Madam  Deputy  Speaker, is  that, out  of these 
<br/>discussions with MC13, there is a clear desire now for the Pacific to create their own industry.  I have 
<br/>the blessings of the honourable Prime Minister to explore these opportunities seriously and there are 
<br/>actually about, at least I can count, three opportunities on the table to move this forward.  I liken it, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, to the Arabs getting foreigners to come and mine their oil.  Why should we 
<br/>surrender the tuna  resource of the Pacific to  others to  come  and harvest  for themselves when we 
<br/>should do it in our own backyard? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, a word of appreciation, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I would like to take this opportunity 
<br/>to  thank  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  who  through  their  Secretariat  supported  us  in  the  meeting.  I 
<br/>acknowledge  Secretary  General  Henry  Puna  and  the  Ambassadors  of  the  Pacific  in  Geneva; 
<br/>Ambassador  Falemaka,  Ambassador  Daunivalu,  Ambassador  Levy  from  Samoa  and  Ambassador 
<br/>Antas  from  Vanuatu.  I  would  also  like  to  acknowledge  the  small  but  hardworking  team  in  my 
<br/>Ministry who assisted in the negotiations and who have left an indelible mark on WTO MC13 in 
<br/>ensuring the momentum continues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we move forward, Fiji remains dedicated to harnessing the benefits of international trade 
<br/>while ensuring our policies promote inclusive growth and protect the welfare of our citizens. Above 
<br/>all,  we  remain  committed  to  ensuring  a  meaningful  agreement  on  fisheries  subsidies  that  would 
<br/>ultimately contribute to sustainable fisheries management, a thriving fisheries sector and meaningful 
<br/>livelihoods for our peoples in the region. With those few words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank 
<br/>you for allowing me the floor to deliver my Ministerial Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  for  his  extensive  covering  on  the  Fisheries  Subsidies  Agreement.  I 
<br/>would restrict myself to the operationalization of the Agreement and what Fiji has contributed to in 
<br/>the past as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has exclusively covered the negotiations that has 
<br/>been recently held.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji was the first Pacific Island to sign this agreement on fisheries Subsidies which is a major 
<br/>step for Fiji’s position in the Pacific. The agreements basically restrict harmful subsidies that continue 
<br/>the depletion of fish stocks. It also includes provision for technical assistance and capacity building 
<br/>to help developing countries implement this agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is an agreement that basically take the rich and big successful 
<br/></span><span>nations against the small developing nations and these subsidies has been an ongoing subject for a 
<br/>very long period. As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has stated, they have exclusively come 
<br/>into our fisheries zone and take everything that is within. Fiji’s position has always been that Fiji, 
<br/>Samoa and Tonga do not have the stock that is available to our small island nations up the north, 
<br/>Tuvalu, Kiribati and all those rich tuna stocks. However, Fiji has taken the stand that we will take 
<br/>the lead role even though the benefits are for our small island friends. Fiji has taken this position 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>443 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because  it  has  allowed  our  voice  within  the  international  arena.  You  might  have  heard  that  Fiji 
<br/>negotiated for the US Tuna Trade Agreement which was increased from $19 million to $60 million 
<br/>a year. So, the Pacific nations looked to Fiji as the fighter at the front and they will get the benefit at 
<br/>the back. We have developed a great idea in fighting for our small island Pacific states.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the international arena, I have always called us “big ocean states” because even though our 
<br/>landmass is quite small, our oceans are quite big. So, to put the positives on discussions, I always 
<br/>say, “we are large ocean States”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The benefit to this agreement is to conserve fish stocks and the issue is that these fish stocks 
<br/>are migratory. Basically, when it comes to your EEZ, you have the opportunity to catch as most as 
<br/>you can.  But Small Island States do not have the capacity to be able to catch the fish themselves, 
<br/>and that is where subsidies come in. They are basically being funded by their home countries to come 
<br/>and fish in the Pacific and now the Caribbean Islands, take the fish and then have it for the benefit of 
<br/>their population or increase their trade capacity within the International Trade Organization.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The WTO and Food and Agriculture Organization FAO have been quite vocal in trying to 
<br/>protect the Small Island States so that they can get the maximum benefit out of their fish stocks, but 
<br/>it is a huge war. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has stated, we will have to keep fighting until there 
<br/>is some recognition from the big island States to say, “we know that you own the fish, we will develop 
<br/>and take away the subsidies so that more benefit is  realised by small  island States”.  Thank you, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji National E-Commerce Strategy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam  Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members 
<br/>of Cabinet and Assistant Ministers, honourable Members of Parliament and those of you who may 
<br/>be listening in today, </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise today to provide an update on Fiji’s National E-Commerce Strategy and also the next 
<br/>steps, once it is formalised.  You may recall in some of my utterances this week, I was talking about 
<br/>Nabukalou Creek, I was talking about the need to plan better in our country, and I was talking about, 
<br/>where we can, look at some of the work that has been done by previous Government and actually 
<br/>leverage on it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  strategy  falls  into  a  bit  of  the  planning  side,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  but  also  more 
<br/>importantly, it falls into the groundwork that was done by the previous Government to actually move 
<br/>this forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that  I thought  I would mention,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker, is  that from  the 
<br/>People’s Coalition’s perspective, we are looking at a very strategic process for Fiji in order to digitise 
<br/>the whole Fijian economy.  There is a national strategy for digitisation that is currently underway and 
<br/></span><span>it is underpinned by the e-commerce strategy as one of its central pillars.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In actual fact, Madam Deputy Speaker, you would recall that I was talking about the MSME 
<br/>sector and the MSMEs strategy will fit in well with the efforts that are being made currently in e-
<br/>commerce.  So, going forward, the people of Fiji will have a very clear direction in terms of where 
<br/>we want to take both, the MSMEs digital aspirations and also e-commerce in our country.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In today’s rapidly evolving world of digital economy, e-commerce, as we all agree, plays a 
<br/>pivotal  role  in  driving  economic  growth,  fostering  innovation  and  expanding  opportunities  for 
<br/>business, especially micro, medium, small and medium enterprises.  We have witnessed a global shift 
<br/>towards online transactions and digital marketplaces, and this is crucial for Fiji to capitalise on this 
<br/>trend  and  position  itself  strategically  in  the  digital  landscape.    Hence,  developing  a  national  e-
<br/>commerce strategy for Fiji is imperative to harness the potential of e-commerce and ensure that our 
<br/>businesses can access global markets, reach a broader customer base and compete effectively in the 
<br/>digital marketplace.  It will also encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, driving job creation and, 
<br/>of course, the diversification of the Fijian economy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  one  of  the  positives,  I  think,  is  that  Fiji’s  e-commerce  sector  is 
<br/>currently in an emergence state of maturity or is really maturing with various sectors showcasing 
<br/>growth trajectories.  The tourism industry has been at the forefront of e-commerce adoption in Fiji.  
<br/>The business process outsourcing industry is another success story for Fiji, contributing significantly 
<br/>to the economy and offering employment and thousands of employment opportunities for Fijians.  
<br/>As someone who was involved in the setup of the industry whilst I was outside Government, it is 
<br/>pleasing to see the progress that has been made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, in  the domestic market,  sectors such as food delivery, groceries, 
<br/>electronics,  tools  and  furniture,  are  experiencing  significant  e-commerce  activity,  driven  by  the 
<br/>consumer demand for convenience and variety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cross border e-commerce activity is also present, particularly in export agricultural markets, 
<br/>like kava.  Some of you might be aware that people can actually order Lami kava from Fiji.  It gets 
<br/>on a plane through DHL and arrives on the other side of the world.  Ginger and turmeric are other 
<br/>examples.  Fiji has made strides in exporting these products to markets such as the United States, 
<br/>Australia,  Canada,  New  Zealand,  and  United  Arab  Emirates,  with  opportunities  for  further  value 
<br/>addition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  furthermore,  e-commerce  platforms  are  also  facilitating  the 
<br/>promotion  of  wellness,  beauty  care  products  and  unique  Fijian  crafts  to  global  markets.    Rising 
<br/>Beyond  the  Reef  products  are  now  available  on  Amazon  -  the  world’s  fastest  growing  online 
<br/>shopping site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  navigate  through  the  vast  opportunities  presented  by  the  digital  age,  we  are  also 
<br/>confronted with significant challenges, such as access to viable internet payment gateways, access to 
<br/>finance, trust in e-commerce transactions, lack of consumer and data protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering  these  challenges,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  development  of  a  national  e-
<br/>commerce strategy became a strategic imperative for economic development and resilience in the 
<br/>digital age.  This strategy will provide a five-year roadmap, outlining tangible measures to support 
<br/>the enabling environment for e-commerce and setting a clear plan for its implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, our journey towards developing the National E-Commerce Strategy 
<br/>has been one of collaboration and foresight.  With the support of the United Nations Conference on 
<br/></span><span>Trade  and  Development  (UNCTD),  we  thoroughly  consulted  stakeholders  from  Government, 
<br/></span><span>statutory bodies, the private sector, particularly MSMEs, civil society and academia.  Hence, they 
<br/>have actively participated in the strategy design process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our journey towards this milestone began even before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, as 
<br/>I had alluded to, Madam Deputy Speaker, with the National E-Commerce Readiness Assessment, 
<br/>which  was  conducted  under  the  previous  Government  in  2019  and  early  2020.    One  of  the  key

<div><span>recommendations  stemming  from  the  Readiness  Assessment  was  the  imperative  need  for  Fiji  to 
<br/>develop  its  comprehensive  e-commerce  strategy,  involving  both  public  and  private  sector 
<br/>stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in early 2023, amidst our recovery from the pandemic impact, we 
<br/>embarked on formulating the e-commerce strategy with invaluable insights gathered from national 
<br/>stakeholder consultations held in September 2023.  Recent validation workshops were held in March 
<br/>2024, which have provided a platform for further discussions with diverse stakeholders to refine our 
<br/>strategy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  addition  to  this,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  a  roundtable  discussion  to  engage  our 
<br/>development partners in the National E-Commerce Strategy implementation was conducted with the 
<br/>aim to foster collaboration and identify areas where our partners can contribute their expertise and 
<br/>resources effectively.  Once finalised and endorsed by Cabinet, its implementation plans will pave 
<br/>the way for our competitive digital economy in our beloved country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to extend my appreciation to the United Nations Conference 
<br/>on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Team and all the development partners for their invaluable 
<br/>support in shaping this trajectory in our e-commerce landscape. I thank you for this opportunity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to thank the honourable Minister for 
<br/>his Ministerial Statement.  Yes, we need a strategic plan in developing our e-commerce, there is no 
<br/>two ways about it, we just have to get that done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The use of electronic medium to do business has really taken off after COVID-19.  There is 
<br/>more B2B and B2C transactions taking place in e-commerce, so it simply means that we have to 
<br/>protect both, the buyers and the sellers, in the marketplace.  The strategic plan can work towards 
<br/>developing those protective mechanisms required for consumers, as well as the businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>E-commerce landscape has significantly changed with time because of the new technologies 
<br/>that were introduced, like MPAiSA, MyCash, and other mobile wallets that is in the marketplace.  
<br/>This has given ways for Fijians to engage in online shopping, buying goods and services or paying 
<br/>their  bills,  transferring  money,  et  cetera,  and  it  is  the  most  convenient  way  of  carrying  out  a 
<br/>transaction.  From the comfort of your home, within the 24 hours at night, whenever you want, you 
<br/>can carry out this transaction.  Gone are the days where you have to go and line up physically outside 
<br/>a shop to make those payments. So, that is how convenient it has become. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is  not  just convenient  but  also  secure. However, this security that  I am talking  about  is 
<br/>actually not fully secure and that is where the strategy needs to take that into account as well because 
<br/>we do hear about the cybercrimes and many other forms of financial crimes that take place through 
<br/>online mechanism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do agree that with e-commerce, new businesses can be created for women and youth and, 
<br/>in fact, for all of us.  We can have a day job, we can have some kind of hustle business after hours, 
<br/>and that you can through online. So, it is going to contribute a lot to the economy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, consumer choice has widened now with access to technology and 
<br/>when we talk about access to technology, it comes with a lot of problems.  I have mentioned a few, 
<br/>but  the  problems  are  there  because  you  physically  do  not  see  the  product.    You  cannot  feel  the 
<br/>product,  but  you  are  buying  it  online,  so  that  gives  rise  to  substandard  products  to  be  sold  to 
<br/>consumers.

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you are not happy with the product, how do you return this product?  Is there a cooling 
<br/>off period where, if you are not happy, you will be able to get your money back?  So, there are a 
<br/>range of issues that need to be addressed, so protection is needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  (FCCC)  had  already  developed  a 
<br/>separate relating Guideline for e-commerce and a lot can be seen from that Guideline and more can 
<br/>be done from that particular document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  FijiFirst  Government  had  a  vision  to  develop  a  modern 
<br/>economy.    In  2018,  Government  announced  its  intension  make  Fiji’s  economy  cashless  and 
<br/>contactless.  MPAiSA and MyCash has greatly helped the nation moved towards a cashless society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I was disappointed when I saw the headline just recently which says, 
<br/>and I quote, “No consultation done on cashless payments, and it will be withdrawn”.  This statement 
<br/>was made by the honourable Prime Minister.  Now, this is shocking. It is shocking because we are 
<br/>talking about e-commerce on one hand, and we are trying to remove this cashless payment system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2023-2024 National Budget, every Ministry was given $50,000 to turn their systems 
<br/>into cashless mode.  The Ministry of Health and Medical Services had done but now that system has 
<br/>been withdrawn.  So, I am emphasising the words “consultation” and “withdrawn”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultation, in my view, is overromanticized by the Government side - over, at the expense 
<br/>of the taxpayers.  What is there to consult?  There are only two options there, Madam Deputy Speaker, 
<br/>and they are, you can provide the cash payment system, you can also provide the technology-driven 
<br/>system...  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- That is what we are doing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- …both systems can be there.  But to say that we are withdrawing, what 
<br/>are  you  withdrawing?    I  am  merely  speaking  from  the  statement  that  was  made,  Madam  Deputy 
<br/>Speaker, and that needs to be looked into because it seems that the Government side is in disarray, 
<br/>and they do not know what we are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The honourable Minister of Finance is saying, “Loo, we will go towards cashless society, we 
<br/>will do a cashless economy.” The honourable Prime Minister, despite sitting in Cabinet, is aware of 
<br/>the National Budget but still says, “Hey, but we are going to withdraw this.”  So, this is not sending 
<br/>a good signal to the people, the country and to the Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker, my  concern is, which generation do  we belong to?   We 
<br/>belong to either silent generation or baby-boomers.  We have got Gen Z and we have got Gen X, 
<br/>these are the modern people - the young ones, who only know about digital age.  They are born in 
<br/>digital age, and here we are sitting and saying, “Guess what? We are going to withdraw this.”  So, 
<br/>take your words back and, please, look into this matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM  DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you  for  your  contributions  so  far,  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  point,  we  will  suspend  proceedings  for  lunch.    I  know  that  several  Members  of

<div><span>Naleba Youth Training Centre Fire Incident 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  SAUKURU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  and 
<br/>viewers who are watching through live television broadcast from the comfort of their homes;  I rise 
<br/>today with a heavy heart to address a strategy that recently struck the Ministry of Youth and Sports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, four days ago, the boy’s dormitory at the Youth Training Centre in Naleba, 
<br/>Labasa, was engulfed in flames, leaving nothing but ashes in its wake.  While we are grateful that no 
<br/>lives were lost in this devastating incident, it pains me to report that the 25 trainees who called this 
<br/>Centre home have lost everything they had possessed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  background  of  Naleba  Youth  Training  Centre,  Mr.  Speaker,  it  is  one  of  the  two 
<br/>Training Centres situated in the Northern Division and it is one of the five Youth Training Centres 
<br/>under the Ministry of Youth and Sports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It became fully operational in 2005 with the construction of proper classroom for learning. 
<br/>Prior  to  that,  youth  were  only  called  in  for  short  courses  lasting  for  three  weeks  to  learn  about 
<br/>agriculture.  The land area of the centre is approximately 22 acres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, approximately 30 to 50 youth enroll at the Centre annually.  The Training Centre 
<br/>provides  Certificate  Level  IV  Training  on  Organic  Agriculture  to  encourage  self-help  project, 
<br/>entrepreneurial opportunities and farming amongst young people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, other short courses, such as screen printing, SRHR and Climate Resilience 
<br/>Training,  are  offered  at  the  Centre  to  create  an  institution  where  young  people  are  able  to  make 
<br/>informed choices and wise decision for their lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  Training  Centre  provides  a  second  chance  to  education  to  education, 
<br/>particularly for those who have fallen through the mainstream education system.  A major focus of 
<br/>the  Training  Centre  is  towards  creating  young  replacement  farmers,  who  then  return  to  their 
<br/>communities to practise intergraded farming for diversified income, as well as to contribute towards 
<br/>reducing  hunger  and  poverty  by  improving  food  security,  creating  employment  and  building 
<br/>resilience to disasters and shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the importance of the Youth Training Centre at Naleba, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Centre was 
<br/>more  than  just  a  building.  It  was  a  sanctuary  for  young  minds  seeking  guidance,  education  and 
<br/>opportunities for a better future.  It serves as a beacon of hope for our youth in the North, offering 
<br/>them a chance to learn variable skills, engage in meaningful activities and connect with their peers 
<br/>in a supportive environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Centre’s aim is to provide non-formal vocational training for unemployed young people 
<br/>and  to  provide  pathways  where  they  would  gain  practical  skills,  enabling  them  to  establish 
<br/></span><span>sustainable  living  through  employment,  income  generating  activities,  or  provide  a  platform  for 
<br/></span><span>progress to further education in either the formal or non-formal context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Naleba  Youth  Training  Centre  offers  free  education  to  young  people  on 
<br/>agriculture and is accessible to both, male and female.  Training is intended to substantially increase 
<br/>the number of youth with relevant skills learnt for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship 
<br/>opportunities within the agricultural sector, involved with semi-commercial farming.

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At our Naleba Youth Training Centre, we accommodate and have facilities for young women 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and provide them with equal opportunities for learning.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through our agriculture training, we educate our young people on organic farming methods 
<br/>in order to cope with the current impacts of climate change with respect to farming for sustainable 
<br/>living. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the impact of the fire on the trainees, Mr. Speaker, the destruction of the dormitory not 
<br/>only robs these young individuals of their material possessions but also shatters their dreams and 
<br/>aspirations.  It has left a profound impact, not only on the trainees themselves but also on the entire 
<br/>community, which has lost a vital resource for youth development and empowerment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As alluded to, all items in the dormitory were completely destroyed by fire.  However, there 
<br/>was  no  causalities  during  the  incident.  The  incident  had  left  the  trainees  in  a  state  of  shock  and 
<br/>questions of whether training will continue is a lingering thought in the minds of these young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our immediate relief efforts for the affected trainees – As the relevant Ministry, we pledge to 
<br/>work closely with the relevant authorities to provide immediate support to the 25 trainees who have 
<br/>been left affected as a result of this tragedy.  We have begun coordinating with local and international 
<br/>organisations, businesses and community leaders to mobilise resources for emergency relief efforts 
<br/>including temporary shelter, clothing and essential supplies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the investigation into the cause of the fire - Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise the urgency of 
<br/>conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire.  As a Ministry, we cannot allow such 
<br/>senseless acts of destruction to go unpunished. I assure you that the Ministry will collaborate with 
<br/>law enforcement agencies and relevant authorities to ascertain the causes and to ensure that justice is 
<br/>served with the measure put in place to prevent similar incidence in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  extent  of  the  damages  being  currently  assessed  by  the  relevant 
<br/>authorities,  National  Fire  Authority  (NFA)  and  Fiji  Police  Force  and  a  comprehensive  report  is 
<br/>expected  to  be  released  soon.    Just  recently,  the  Youth  Training  Centre  has  completed  the  OHS 
<br/>compliance requirements as a training centre for this year with completed inspections and clearance 
<br/>by NFA and the Ministry of Labour.  Effective from the date of fire, the police have been exchanging 
<br/>shifts to oversee the site of the accident.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On our commitment to rebuilding the Youth Training Centre – The Ministry is committed to 
<br/>overseeing  the  re-construction  of  the  Youth  Training  Centre  in  Naleba,  Labasa  with  the  utmost 
<br/>urgency. This Centre must be rebuilt sooner, stronger and more resilient than before, equipped with 
<br/>modern facilities and amenities to better serve the needs of our youth.  The main aim is to make a 
<br/>very fast turnover from current destructive form to normalcy.  This initiative will obviously incur 
<br/>costs, however, the return on investment on educating these children will be repaid in an estimated 
<br/>four  years’  time.    This  will  be  achieved  through  employment,  beefing  up  IGP’s  and  knowledge 
<br/>sharing among the peers and communities.  This will have direct impact of the GDP hence benefitting 
<br/>the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training centre started with scoping for minor repairs and maintenance 
<br/></span><span>to organise temporary accommodation for the trainees continue with the training.  The centre will 
<br/>propose for a capital project in the new financial year through the normal budget process.  Preliminary 
<br/>works will be completed this financial year to prepare the plan and the scope of work of the new 
<br/>construction. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our efforts to rebuild and strengthen our youth infrastructure cannot be

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>achieved in  isolation. We have plans to  work hand in  hand with local  authorities, line ministries, 
<br/>organisations and community leaders to ensure that the needs of our youths are met and that they 
<br/>have access to the supported resources that require to thrive.  The Commissioner Northern Division 
<br/>was informed, and the team are on standby for any support that could be rendered.  The list of items 
<br/>needed instantly has been prepared and shared with our divisional network through the Commissioner 
<br/>Northern Division for support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  sincere  appreciation  to  respective  line  ministries  that  have  assisted  in 
<br/>various ways to return their trainees back to their respective homes, accompanied by staff to advise 
<br/>parents on the incident.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Long term sustainability of Youth programmes - Mr. Speaker, Sir, our efforts cannot stop at 
<br/>rebuilding  the  Youth  Training  Centre.  We  must  also  invest  in  the  long  term  sustainability  of  our 
<br/>youth  programmes,  ensuring  that  they  are  adequately  funded,  staffed  and  equipped  to  empower 
<br/>young people across our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Training Centre is earmarked to be one of the major source of training providers for the 
<br/>youths  in  terms  of  formal  and  non-formal  in  the  Northern  Division  and  these  will  require  the 
<br/>expansion of the infrastructure and its staffing as well and the diversification of youth programmes 
<br/>in accordance with the need of the nation in terms of the skills. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Ministry’s aim of leaving no youth behind, the Youth Training 
<br/>Centre  is  a  stepping  stone  towards  achieving  this  long  term  goal  for  the  benefit  of  the  Northern 
<br/>Division as well as the nation at large. This incident will ensure security is strengthened and further 
<br/>enhanced to ensure that government assets are secured at all times.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in closing I plead with our stakeholders and individuals to 
<br/>let us not forget the resilience and spirit of our youth who have faced adversity with courage and 
<br/>determination time and time again.  Together, let us stand in solidarity with the trainees of the Youth 
<br/>Training  Centre,  Naleba  and  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  supporting  and  nurturing  the  next 
<br/>generation of leaders, innovators and change makers.  The fire incident at the boy’s accommodation 
<br/>building of the Youth Training Centre was swiftly responded to and brought under control by the 
<br/>timely intervention of National Fire Authority and Police for the fire not to spread further into other 
<br/>buildings in the Youth Training Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  response  to  this  incident,  the  Youth  Training  Centre  management  is  committed  to 
<br/>undertake appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.  This includes conducting 
<br/>thorough review of the facility’s fire safety protocols, implementing any necessary improvements 
<br/>and organising mandatory fire safety training for all staff and students.  I wish to take this opportunity 
<br/>to address the parents and guardians in the vernacular.

<br/>assisted in this through one way or another. I thank the management and staff of the Ministry and in 
<br/>particular the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations who had 
<br/>visited the Centre on behalf of the Government immediately after the incident to provide reassurance

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my seat, please, allow me to respond to honourable Premila 
<br/>Kumar’s comment on a cashless Fiji.  I wish to advise the honourable Member that the Coalition 
<br/>Government is not withdrawing the project, but we are doing everything right in consultation with 
<br/>all stakeholders. We will eventually get there. I will share with the honourable Member what Ronnie 
<br/>Chang of Martintar, Nadi wrote in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> in the Letters to the Editors column, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In doing so, please remember our fellow sisters and brothers who are not computer, 
<br/>tablet, fast phone and IT savvy.  The poor members in our community who do not have 
<br/>access  to  internet  services  will  suffer  the  greatest.    Our  old  school  senior  citizens 
<br/>unfortunately will be left out, they toiled to earn a decent dollar.  To them cash and their 
<br/>cheque  books  is  their  means  of  economic  survival.  Let  us  have  a  generous  and 
<br/>accommodative heart, let us have a more caring nature in this field of economic progress.  
<br/>Most back office employees still have work to do manually.  Do not deprive them of their 
<br/>bread and butter in progress’s name.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are a leadership that listens because we do care about our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.N.  TUICOLO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  thank  you  for  allowing  me  to  respond  to  the 
<br/>Ministerial Statement presented by the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports on the importance 
<br/>of the Training Centre and the impact of the recent fire on trainees and the community, the Ministry’s 
<br/>commitment  to  rebuilding  the  Youth  Training  Centre  and  the  long  term  sustainability  of  youth 
<br/>programmes.  We are all now aware of the importance of vocational training and their opportunities 
<br/>as it provides for personal and professional growth.  The training programme fits a much needed role 
<br/>in providing for training and education in sectors that are not found in formal education institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the FijiFirst’s term in government, we invested considerably to the 
<br/>Naleba Youth Training Centre by ensuring that there was sustainable recognised curriculum with 
<br/>modern  agricultural  machinery  as  well  as  standard  infrastructure  in  place.    The  Naleba  Youth 
<br/>Training Centre has accredited its training through the Fiji Higher Education Commission, where 
<br/>school dropouts can further their education in agriculture tertiary institutions after graduating from 
<br/>the Training Centre.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there were negotiations in place to also introduce the Seafarers Training 
<br/>Programme where youths from around Fiji, particularly, those in maritime areas are to access this 
<br/>firsthand training on deckhand, cook, engineers, to name a few.  The FijiFirst Government further 
<br/>invested in the Youth Training Centre by building a hostel and a gym worth $381,200 in the year 
<br/>2020.  This goes to show that the FijiFirst Government was always committed in ensuring increased 
<br/>educational, employment and leadership opportunities for young Fijians.  It was rather unfortunate 
<br/>to hear of the recent fire incident that destroyed Naleba Youth Training Centre’s boys’ hostel building 
<br/>and all its contents.  We understand that this incident will have some drawbacks and impacts on the 
<br/>trainees, and we sympathise with all the youths who have been affected by the fire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  cause  of  the  fire  is  yet  to  be  established,  we  urge  the  Youth 
<br/></span><span>Training Centre’s administrators and staff to supervise their trainees and practice fire safety.  It is 
<br/></span><span>important that the Training Centre administrators take the lead role in teaching its students on fire 
<br/>safety.  The Naleba Youth Training Centre serves the Northern Region, and we thank the Ministry 
<br/>of Youth and Sports for its commitment to rebuilding the boy’s hostel in order for our youths from 
<br/>the North  to  continue with  their training.  Having  heard of the importance of the Youth Training 
<br/>Centre from the honourable Minister, it would have been wise to provide ae grant to the Ministry of 
<br/>Youth and Sports Training Centre rather than to Pacific Polytech, an institution that is occupying a

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to deliver my Statement on the Wood Utilisation Project with the main 
<br/>objective  of  maximising  wood  resource  utilisation  through  the  use  of  harvesting  and  processing 
<br/>residues as an alternative sources of raw materials for wooden products manufacturers.  The project 
<br/>focuses on utilising mahogany wood left in the forest after a harvesting operation and, in this regard, 
<br/>works closely with the Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  completed  a  baseline  survey,  extraction,  processing  and 
<br/>classification of wood residues using specialised machines at our Ministry of Forestry workshop in 
<br/>Nasinu. Following the internal research and information gathering, the project started an initiative to 
<br/>engage  and  train  selected  mahogany  landowners  on  how  to  utilise  these  mahogany  harvesting 
<br/>residues to operate as small cottage industries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations were undertaken initially in the three villages within the Nukurua Mahogany 
<br/>Station, that is, Sote, Savu and Naimasimasi where mahogany  harvesting was being undertaken. The 
<br/>main objective was to engage and select suitable young men and women from these villages to be 
<br/>trained in wood processing and furniture making at the Ministry’s Timber Industry Training Center 
<br/>in Nasinu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, after taking up Office in December 2022 saw the potential 
<br/>of this initiative to significantly improve the livelihoods of our rural communities and jobless youth.  
<br/>Additionally, this programme was seen to have to have potential enhance the forestry’s contribution 
<br/>to  the  national  GDP  and  identified  that  the  level  of  funding  was  not  sufficient  to  invest  in  this 
<br/>initiative. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the Minister responsible for Forests, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is my aim to have the forestry 
<br/>sector  adequately  supported  so  that  it  is  able  to  continue  to  enhance  its  capacity  to  improve  the 
<br/>livelihoods  of  our  people,  especially  our  rural  landowning  communities.  This  can  be  achieved 
<br/>through  increasing  our  investments  in  the  training  of  our  people  to  have  the  right  skills  and 
<br/>knowledge, and also in having the appropriate value adding machines and the application of new 
<br/>technologies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with this objective, Government during the financial year of August 
<br/>2023 to July 2024 announced an increase in the budgetary allocation for Forest Subsidy Grant from 
<br/>$50,000 in the previous financial year to $200,000 which is an increase of $150,000.  This grant is 
<br/>supporting our people to purchase value adding machines, especially our mahogany landowners who 
<br/>were trained at the Ministry’s Timber Industry Training Centre to operate as small cottage industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are currently engaging four small cottage industries and one registered 
<br/>co-operative. The Gaunavou Co-operative, comprising the villages of Sote, Savu and Naimasimasi 
<br/>has also recently received the Ministry of Trade and Investment’s approval to use the Fiji brand on 
<br/>their products. Three cottages are currently working on manufacturing products, while members of 
<br/>one are currently undergoing training in wood processing and manufacturing.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to inform Parliament that my Ministry is not 
<br/>only providing training and technical advice to support the above initiative but has also taken the step 
<br/>to connect the cottage industries to the markets.  Market outlets for the wooden furniture items to be 
<br/>produced were arranged and each cottage industry was taught to focus on a specific product.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in April last year a contract agreement between Gaunavou Co-operative and 
<br/>Vision Group was signed by the two parties for the supply of mahogany wooden beds through Courts 
<br/>(Fiji) Limited. Gaunavou Co-operative managed to supply 80 beds and with the support of the Forest 
<br/>Subsidy Grant of $28,864 managed to generate a total revenue of $70,200. The other three cottage 
<br/>industries also supplied mahogany wooden products which generated a total revenue of $220,500.  
<br/>Currently, there is ongoing discussion between my Ministry and the Ministry of Rural Development 
<br/>for  the  funding  of  a workshop  for  Gaunavou  Co-operative.  This  is  crucial  as  it  provides  the 
<br/>opportunity for Gaunavou Co-operative to run on their own using their own facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  is  happy  to  inform  Parliament  that  one  of  the 
<br/>cottage industries from Kalabu Village has begun construction of their own workshop at Colo-i-Suva.  
<br/>With their own workshop and machines, the cottage industry will be in a better position to be hived 
<br/>off from the Ministry and to operate on their own.  The Ministry will continue to monitor the cottage 
<br/>industries once they are hived off focusing on the quality of  products being produced and also in 
<br/>terms of their administration and finance.  During their engagement period in Nasinu, each cottage 
<br/>industry is expected to build sufficient working capital to allow smooth operational transition once 
<br/>they are relocated to their own premises. The support and assistance of other arms of government are 
<br/>also being solicited to strengthen our monitoring of these cottage industries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry has plans to widen its scope of assistance of cottage 
<br/>industry  and  value  addition  to  the  14  mahogany  based  stations  and  other  interested  forest-based 
<br/>communities.  The Ministry of Forestry believes that this initiative will boost economic activities, 
<br/>for the rural sector will contribute to rural economy and improving livelihoods. The engagement of 
<br/>young men and women in  forest-based businesses will reduce urban  migration, alleviate poverty, 
<br/>reduce  crime  including  drug  related  activities,  and  also  create  a  generation  of  people  who  are 
<br/>contributing positively to the development of their communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for the Statement and 
<br/>thank him for the continuation of this project.  The project started way back in 2010. I know it very 
<br/>well when I was the Permanent Secretary for Fisheries and Forests. It was born out of this argument, 
<br/>if you like, with Fiji Hardwood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Forestry staff was saying that the utilisation rate for mahogany was too low, about 40 
<br/>percent at that time.  We asked for a budget and so we would go in and collect the waste.  As we 
<br/>know for mahogany, you cut it from as close to the ground and then when it begins to branch, that is 
<br/>why you chop it off and then that log is sold off.  So, we collected those branches. We employed a 
<br/>gentleman  who  had  a  very  good  qualification  in  interior  decoration,  and  he  started  to  turn  those 
<br/>branches into pieces of furniture, and we started to learn from there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We went back to Fiji Mahogany and said, “Hey, look, this is the waste that you are leaving 
<br/></span><span>in the forest.  The utilisation rate for that mahogany needs to be much higher than 40 percent.” We 
<br/></span><span>planted those trees in 1960 and then 40 years later, started harvesting them in 2003.  We thought that 
<br/>after waiting for 40 years and then just use 40 percent of the plantation is not a good return.  So that 
<br/>was where it was born, at the Utilisation Division. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  and  the  Ministry  for  its  continuation.    It  is  helpful  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>youth. We would bring in our young people and train them at that facility in Nine Miles.  At that
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>453 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>time, there were two main machines that we thought was useful to set up those cottage industries.  
<br/>One is  a lathe machine where it rotates and you can do bowls, lamp stands, et cetera.  The other 
<br/>machine is the bench saw that cuts it down into workable sizes for those communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the suggestions we had before I left and maybe you can take this up was, for those 
<br/>who are doing those pieces of ornamental mahogany, we can supply those ornamental pieces to all 
<br/>our embassies overseas, to put in those embassies as a marketing tool where people come in and visit.  
<br/>You can tell them, “Look, this is available in Fiji, it is Fiji mahogany.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji has the second largest mahogany plantation, apart from Brazil, it grows well in Central 
<br/>America.  The mahogany that we have in Fiji is </span><span>Swietenia macrophylla</span><span>, commonly known as big leaf 
<br/>mahogany from Honduras.  The Fijian mahogany, according to those that deal with it, say it is very 
<br/>unique because it has pin knots.  If you look at Fiji mahogany, you see a lot of those black dots which 
<br/>are very unique and some of the importers would not buy it because of those pin knots.  So, we are 
<br/>always in competition with those that sell mahogany from Central America because theirs is like free 
<br/>from pin knots.  Even those pieces of mahogany that has those pin knots can be turned into wonderful 
<br/>pieces of furniture and brand it as the brand for Fiji Mahogany which has got all those dots.  I wish 
<br/>the Ministry well and I hope those cottage industries thrive and extend it to all the landowners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  problems  we  face  then,  I  do  not  know  whether  you  face  it,  is  that  mahogany 
<br/>belongs Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited and if they can give those pieces for free or the standing 
<br/>low grade mahogany.  I think they mostly buy A to C and D to E grade - mostly left standing, if that 
<br/>could be given free, it will benefit those landowners very well.  But thank you for continuing with 
<br/>the project and I wish you well.
