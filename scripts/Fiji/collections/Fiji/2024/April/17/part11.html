<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee with its thorough inquiry and deliberation, was able to fulfil its mandate and 
<br/>report back on its findings to Parliament.  Although the years under review were hampered with the 
<br/>presence of COVID-19, this did not impact the work of the Commission in delivering its services to every 
<br/>citizen to actively participate in sports and physical activity. The Committee was grateful that during 
<br/>these years, sports development continued to be improved for our youth and communities and also for 
<br/>the welfare of our players.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  the  annual  reviews  were  from  2020  to  2022,  the  Committee 
<br/>acknowledged  the  current  data  and  information  provided  by  the  stakeholders.  This  assisted  the 
<br/>Committee in its review.  Therefore, I commend the work that is being carried out by the Fiji National 
<br/>Sports  Commission  (FNSC)  and  extend  my  deepest  gratitude  to  the  Executive  Chairman,  Mr.  Peter 
<br/>Mazey and his staff, for their timely assistance in this review process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social  Affairs;  honourable  Ratu  Rakuita  Vakalalabure,  honourable  Parveen  Bala,  honourable  Viam 
<br/>Pillay, honourable Aseri Radrodro and a former member of the Committee, honourable Sashi Kiran, for 
<br/>their valuable input and support.  May I also thank the Committee Clerks who have served and assisted 
<br/>the Committee for the past 14 months - Marica, Leba, Tevita, Lia and Susana.  Thank you very much for 
<br/>your  hard  work  and  commitment.    I  would  also  like  to  thank  honourable  Ketan  Lal  and  honourable 
<br/>Penioni Ravunawa for their assistance during several occasions, serving as Alternate Members for the 
<br/>Standing Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs, I commend this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament and request all honourable Members of this august Parliament to take note of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  121  (5),  I 
<br/>hereby move a motion without notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY. – Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report - Ministry of Sugar Industry 2016-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Economic  Affairs  is 
<br/>pleased to submit to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report of the Ministry of Sugar Industry 
<br/>2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020 Annual Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee conducted a site visit to the Western and Northern Divisions late last year 
<br/></span><span>and earlier this year, to gain a better understanding of the current practices of the Sugar Industry. The 
<br/></span><span>Committee also heard submissions from Officials of the Ministry of Sugar Industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware of the various challenges that the Ministry has been facing 
<br/>which  include  acute  shortage  of  labour,  aging  infrastructure  and  abandonment  of  farms,  amongst 
<br/>many  other  reasons.  The  Committee  noted  that  the  Annual  Reports  presented  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Sugar Industry lacked essential data during the period under review, which would have enabled the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>431 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee to make more informed recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee further noted the various programmes introduced by the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/>Industry  to  assist  sugarcane  farmers,  such  as  Sugarcane  Development  and  Farmers  Assistance, 
<br/>weedicide and fertilizer subsidy, cane access roads, mechanical harvesters, grants to new farmers and 
<br/>cane cartage grant. While discussing the Reports, the Committee noted that transporting cane through 
<br/>rails would be far more cost effective than through trucks which required more fuel. It would also 
<br/>relieve road congestion and damage caused by cane trucks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Committee was satisfied with the Annual Reports during the period under review, 
<br/>it  noted  that  there  were  areas  that  can  be  improved  through  more  enhanced  coordination, 
<br/>commitment,  and  accountability  of  all  stakeholders.  At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  extend  our 
<br/>appreciation to all the stakeholders for their valuable input.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  our  Committee  Members  who  were  part  of  the  team  that 
<br/>produced  this  Report  -  Deputy  Chairperson,  honourable  Sashi  Kiran,  honourable  Tomasi  N. 
<br/>Tunabuna, honourable Premila D. Kumar and honourable Semi T. Koroilavesau.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs, I commend the Ministry of Sugar 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Industry 2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019, 2019-2020 Review Reports to Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move a 
<br/>motion without notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the debate on the content of the Report is initiated at a future sitting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.

<div><span>Review Report - Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  present  to 
<br/>Parliament the Review Report of the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji Annual Report 2018-2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pursuant  to  Standing  Order  38(2)  of  the  Standing  Orders  of  Parliament,  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was referred the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 
<br/>Annual Report 2018-2019 on 14</span><span>th</span><span> July of last year.  This Report captures the review findings and 
<br/>recommendations of the Committee with respect to the Department’s Annual Report.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted six key findings from its review which are as follows, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>High staff turnover in comparison from 2018-2019 to-date. 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Low budget allocation for the reported year which, in turn, constraints parliamentary work. 
<br/>Lack of awareness of the powers and authority of Parliament and its Committees by civil 
<br/>servants. 
<br/>Lack of full digitisation of its Committees.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Significant number of Bills stated for the reported year that stands at 88.5 percent and as a 
<br/>comparative, 99 percent for the year 2023 that were enacted under Standing Order 51.  
<br/>Parliament has considered the inclusive participation of communities at all levels through 
<br/>the medium of broadcasting, and further notes the lack of information supplied with respect 
<br/>to gender composition within the two divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those were some of the key findings that the Committee noted in its review. 
<br/>I, therefore, would like to highlight some of the recommendations that the Committee had agreed to 
<br/>unanimously: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends the timely submission of Annual Reports. 
<br/>The Committee recommends that a Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) be conducted for the 
<br/>Department, given that the last JEE was conducted in the reported year. 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  the  upgrading  of  IT  systems  and  full  digitisation  of 
<br/>Committee sittings. 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  Standing  Orders  be  amended  to  review  the  use  of 
<br/>Standing Order 51 by referring it to a specific sub-committee. 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the Department ensures there is a formal SDG compliant 
<br/>component in all future reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as mandated by the provision of the Standing Orders of Parliament, those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>were some of the recommendations that the Committee had sought following its review.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  commend  the  Members  of  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and 
<br/>Human Rights.  In that regard, Sir, on behalf of the Standing Committee, I commend the Committee’s 
<br/>Report on the Parliament of the Republic of Fiji 2018-2019 Annual Report to Parliament and seek 
<br/>the support of all Members to take note of the recommendations by the Committee.
