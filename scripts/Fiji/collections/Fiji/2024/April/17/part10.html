<h3>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER</h3>
<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to today’s sitting and all those joining us in the public 
<br/>gallery  and  those  watching  the  proceedings  on  television  and  internet.  Thank  you  for  taking  an 
<br/>interest in the workings of your Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Words of Gratitude – Deputy Speaker and Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I would like to thank the honourable Deputy Speaker for holding the fort whilst I have 
<br/>been subjected to medical test yesterday. I heard when sitting in the office that the sitting in of the 
<br/>Deputy Speaker and your participation, honourable Members, all went well. I thank each and every 
<br/>one of you for that and also, Madam Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chamber Electronic System  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  you  are  kindly  requested  to  refrain  from  or  avoid  moving  your 
<br/>Chamber Bosch System Cards. These are the ones on your electronic system that you have there with 
<br/>you. Over the last two days, the ICT team experienced some disruptions to the control system and 
<br/>the Technicians had advised that it was caused by the card  movement.  That was quite similar to 
<br/></span><span>when  we  came  in  in  2014,  we  even  took  the  card  out.    We  were  then  advised,  again,  by  my 
<br/></span><span>predecessor, “No, you don’t take the card out, you leave it as it is, otherwise it will not work.”  So, 
<br/>honourable Members, please, could you leave the card where it is.  As soon as you touch it, it shuts 
<br/>down that particular unit with the control system at the top there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other complication that can arise is that microphones of Members of Parliament will be 
<br/>disconnected from the main central control unit where all microphones are connected and controlled. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Member will not be able to register a vote and he/she will be registered as absent, as the card will 
<br/>not be recognised in the system.  So, please, honourable Members, I trust that we will take heed of 
<br/>this advice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Written Question No. 29/2024  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, Written Question No. 29/2024 by honourable 
<br/>Sashi Kiran will be dropped from the Order Paper as the honourable Minister  for Agriculture and 
<br/>Waterways had provided a substantive response during his Ministerial Statement on Monday this 
<br/>week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Shipbuilding Industry – SVT Government  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to reflect a bit on the issue that was raised by the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications 
<br/>in  response  to  a  statement  that  was  made  by  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  yesterday 
<br/>regarding the shipbuilding industry and what transpired after that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  Parliament  and  honourable  Members  especially,  I  happened  to  be 
<br/>around as a Member of Parliament then.  The then Minister of Finance, James Ah Koy, had tried to 
<br/>balance  the  books  of  the  Government.    In  so  doing,  the  Government  with  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister under the SVT Government, had worked on a plan to try and balance the 
<br/>books and in so doing, they sold off existing assets of the Government and this included shipbuilding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we came back into power and the books were balanced, they were finally balanced, 
<br/>that was an  achievement.  But, again, sitting here,  I am  hearing you talking  about  $10 billion, et 
<br/>cetera, but when we tried to balance the books, it is a bit of a long story.  For this one here, it is totally 
<br/>different from when the honourable Prime Minister was leading the Government then.  That is the 
<br/>great story about that.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was not SVT Government that killed the shipping industry, even though I was tasked to 
<br/>revive the shipbuilding industry when I came back as Minister for Transport after serving time in 
<br/>prison.  We managed to begin that huge task of trying to find the people who were highly experienced 
<br/>in the shipbuilding industry and most of them had gone abroad, seeking better opportunities, working 
<br/>in shipbuilding industries in Australia and New Zealand. So that is the story of what was raised by 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises and Communications to something that was referred.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have checked the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> and, again, nothing sinister was said by the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition to indicate that the SVT Government caused that. No, it was an exercise 
<br/>done by the SVT Government to balance their books.
