<div><span>New and Innovative Approaches for MSME Businesses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 25/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the  new  and 
<br/>innovative approaches to raise funds for MSME businesses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I,  obviously,  launch  into  my 
<br/>response, I may be allowed just to comment on the word “wizardry” by honourable Ravunawa, who 
<br/>is a fellow clansman from Tailevu and from Tokatoka.  So, we know how they manipulate words, 
<br/>Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am somewhat surprised that the honourable Members on the other side are 
<br/>preoccupied with the imagery of Nabukalou Creek.  It is about the second or third time they have 
<br/>mentioned it this week.  I think sometimes in our lives, imagery hurts if it resonates and is telling the 
<br/>truth.  Imagery hurts when it is signifying the truth.  The truth hurts sometimes so I will use the words 
<br/>of honourable Tabuya, and I quote, “</span><span>ciqoma, jiloma.</span><span>” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter)   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I be allowed to answer the question and I thank honourable Vocea for 
<br/>the question.  Please, allow me to start with some obvious facts.  I will start off by saying that for any 
<br/>business to grow, expand or diversify, it needs a capital injection.  That can come in the form of an 
<br/>equity where you contribute your own funds or access to finance where you actually lend money 
<br/>from a bank or some sort of institution.  I guess it is no secret that access to finance remains a major 
<br/>challenge for MSMEs, not only in Fiji but globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  several  ways  that  small  or  large  businesses  can  raise  funds  from  the  formal  or 
<br/>informal sector and, obviously, it involves using retirement funds or borrowing funds or cashing up 
<br/>on stocks and those kinds of ways of funding.  To answer the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the 
<br/>People’s Coalition has endeavoured to do is try and look at some innovative ways to raise funding or 
<br/>finance to particularly assist the small to medium enterprises in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, some of the most aspiring startups in our country do not have personal savings, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, or a strong network of friends  or relatives that  can  actually allow them to  lend 
<br/>money and sometimes they do not qualify for grants. In Fiji, just as a matter of fact, , it is recorded 
<br/>that MSMEs make up 95 percent of all businesses and less than 20 percent of them have access to 
<br/></span><span>credit from formal lending institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The in-depth assessment of the MSME landscape, Mr. Speaker, Sir, reported that there is a 
<br/>funding gap of up to $2.2 billion in Fiji.  This demonstrates the excess demand there is for finance 
<br/>from the financial sector.  In the last financial year within our Ministry alone, we had received excess 
<br/>demand for grant applications up to four times more than our budgetary allocation.  So, even this 
<br/>year, there is already a funding gap we can see of about $2.5 million.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one may ask, what are we doing about it?  We must create the enabling 
<br/>environment that will unlock finance in a more seamless manner.  We need to be innovative, forward 
<br/>looking,  inclusive  and  entice  private  sector  to  increase  their  investments.    We  are  working  on 
<br/>developing the robust MSME ecosystem, as we have mentioned, that connects the dots better and 
<br/>fosters more innovation productivity and stimulates economic activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the assistance of the Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)</span><span> </span><span>and the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>(RBF) , we are developing a law that will enable alternative sources of financing to be introduced 
<br/>into Fiji, apart from the traditional way of raising funds for businesses.  The draft Bill was approved 
<br/>by Cabinet in November 2023 for public consultations. During the consultations, we have received 
<br/>positive responses and also important feedback from the business community.  This will be the first 
<br/>in the South Pacific, while Australia and New Zealand already have similar legislation, that enabled 
<br/>them to undertake these forms of capital raising for businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to explain the methods of financing, the first method of raising funds under the Bill is 
<br/>called Small Offers.  Small Offers is basically where an equity based financial modality whereby a 
<br/>business will have the ability to seek limited capital injection of up to $2 million into a business from 
<br/>a  limited  pool  of  investors  (up  to  about  48  investors)  that  include  family,  friends  and  business 
<br/>networks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  second  method  is  Crowdfunding,  and  this  will  be  undertaken  through  two  structures 
<br/>either through equity or  debt-based  Crowdfunding.  Essentially Crowdfunding  provides  a way of 
<br/>raising money on an approved online platform to fund businesses, including MSMEs.  The RBF will 
<br/>be issuing licences to the online platform provider that acts as an intermediary between the business 
<br/>and the investor/lender.  The Bill also details the disclosures or information that the businesses must 
<br/>provide before seeking request for funds.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in summary, these are alternative ways 
<br/>that the Government will try to introduce equity or financing for our small businesses.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following the conclusion of the current consultations, the Bill is being vetted 
<br/>and  will  be  presented  at  the  next  Cabinet  sitting.  Subsequently,  the  Bill  will  go  through  its  own 
<br/>consultations and then make its way into this august Parliament.  When the Bill is ready to be brought 
<br/>to Parliament, which I am eagerly looking forward to, we will definitely have more discussions and 
<br/>debates on the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that one has to look at the funding for 
<br/>the MSMEs. Currently, big businesses can get access to loans at a very cheap interest rate, sometimes 
<br/>2 percent or 3 percent, but when it comes to small businesses, they struggle, despite the Government 
<br/>trying to get assistance or setting up some mechanism to assist MSMEs through Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>(RBF) as well as Fiji Development Bank (FDB), but that is not sufficient.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do have some loan sharks through which MSMEs try and raise loans or get some money 
<br/>to get on with their business. Also, we have other micro-financing agencies and they charge very 
<br/>exorbitant rate of interest. Sometimes it is 20 percent, and it is not even viable to borrow from them.  
<br/>We look forward to what the Bill is all about, and my question to the honourable Minister is, on that 
<br/>initial  step  of  consultation  on  the  Bill,  which  stakeholders  were  involved  in  the  initial  stages  of 
<br/></span><span>discussion? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we consulted quite extensively and that 
<br/>involved Vanua Levu and Viti Levu both, in traditional settings as well as the normal business MSME 
<br/>consultation. I think it is the first round of consultations and I am sure if we take this Bill through the 
<br/>normal process, there will be another opportunity to do some more consultations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="46">Page 46</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>471 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For me, Mr. Speaker, this kind of new mechanisms are only successful if they are simple and 
<br/>workable.  Uptil now, I am heartened by the fact that I have not heard any negative suggestions about 
<br/>the funding mechanisms, but I am keen to hear more because it is very important.  Sometimes we 
<br/>think  we  know  the  answer,  yet,  we  are  totally  missing  the  need,  particularly  for  MSME.    I  look 
<br/>forward to the deliberations that will continue once the Bill gets through Cabinet and just to ensure 
<br/>that we put out something as practical and benefits what is potentially a very big sector for Fiji which 
<br/>is the MSME, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the honourable Minister, perhaps, clarify  
<br/>more on the difference between Small Offers and Crowd Funding because you did not mention any 
<br/>figures on both, Small Offers and Crowdfunding?  That $2 million that you were referring to, is that 
<br/>the  MSME  turnover  or  is  that  the  debt  ceiling  that  is  available  to  them?    What  is  available  for 
<br/>Crowdfunding as well in terms of that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the guidelines provided by the 
<br/>RBF, I think they are comfortable with the limit of $2 million on the total funding that can be provided 
<br/>under the Small Offers and Crowdfunding Scheme.  I think it is a work in progress as well, but as we 
<br/>progress and get comfortable with the workings, perhaps the threshold might be increased.  But it is 
<br/>really trying to target those who cannot really play in the wider spaces when it comes to financing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, it is a learn and see as we go, and that is consultations is important and we are keen to 
<br/>continue that discussion as we go through the formalisation of the process because it is very important 
<br/>that we can get more often than not.  We suggest things and then we get a shock when we realise it 
<br/>is not hitting the need of the audience or the people that we are trying to target.  The $2 million is 
<br/>actually a threshold, upper threshold you can ask for $15 million or $20 million or whatever, but the 
<br/>$2 million is like a cap on the funding, just to create some prudential guidelines. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while listening to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister Kamikamica, especially the proposal that he has placed forward, he was talking about equity 
<br/>and then funding that is going to be available to MSMEs to get from commercial banks and other 
<br/>institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is funny, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that when FijiFirst used to give grants, we were criticised 
<br/>and now </span><span>dinau </span><span>to MSMEs.  How can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister justify by increasing the 
<br/>burden whereby MSMEs have to give equity and 80 percent funding will be </span><span>dinau? </span><span> They are already 
<br/>struggling, the economy is not doing good and then they will have to pay the loan.  What kind of 
<br/>funding is this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this modality of funding, the investor 
<br/>decides what sort of level of return that they wish to impose.  Because it is targeted specifically at 
<br/>the start up market, it is only venture capitalists who have the money that actually go in and play in 
<br/>those spaces.  Again, we can all just rely on grants and leave it there, but we do have limited funds.  
<br/>Then if a ventured capitalist comes along and sells for zero cost, I will offer some businesses in Fiji 
<br/></span><span>up to a potential equity injection of $100,000 to $200,000.  That will go a long way for an MSME. It 
<br/></span><span>is not a loan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- You said about equity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Equity can be a  loan or it can be an actual injection from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you own pocket. You are being semantic, unfortunately, honourable Maharaj.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact of the matter is that we are trying to create solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- If you had listened to what we have been saying since this 
<br/>morning, this Government is committed to economic diversification.  Stimulating the MSME market 
<br/>is a key pillar of the People’s Coalition’s strategy for economic diversification.  Actually, you had 
<br/>zero economic diversification during your time.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  honourable  Maharaj  did  need  the  banks  to  support  his  business, 
<br/>even though  he tried very hard, but  the end result  was not  that good. But when his  business  was 
<br/>running well, the banks were writing to him, seeking how best they can offer.  He has been through 
<br/>the mill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question; this women’s bank that 
<br/>has been targeted by the honourable Minister for Women all along and may be an opportunity also, 
<br/>have you consulted with her and I did not hear you mentioning it in your answer. Is it one of those 
<br/>solutions also, or you have thrown it out, you did not consult it with her? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you for the question, there is a bit of conspiracy going 
<br/>in there, Mr. Speaker.  Again, it is a difference between that side of Parliament and this side.  I have 
<br/>been privately having a discussion with honourable Tabuya on what we can do in that space.  Really, 
<br/>once she forms the views of the Ministry, we will be there to help her, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is already a women’s bank out there, the SPBD that we know of, but it does not mean 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that it does not need to end there, there are other mechanisms that be used, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not sure why they are so critical. They should be happy that we are trying to find more 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ways to fund MSMEs, or are they suggesting that we should not have any SMEs funding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  I  think  that  imagery  of  Nabukalou  Creek  is  somewhat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>flooding their view of things.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Selection Criteria - Appointment of Special Administrators 
<br/>(Question No. 26/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government inform Parliament 
<br/>on the selection criteria and tools employed in the appointment of Special Administrators for 
<br/>towns and cities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was hoping for another honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to ask me the question before Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the question by honourable Chand, first, I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>join the previous speakers in wishing our Hindu brothers and sisters a Happy Rama Navami. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>473 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to understand why Special Administrators are 
<br/>appointed and the rationale behind the appointment of these Special Administrators.  The concept of 
<br/>Special Administrators was introduced in 2009 by the previous Administration under section 9A of 
<br/>the  Local  Government  Act  1972  going  to  suspend  election  of  Councillors  and  reduce  the 
<br/>independence of the Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  was  a  reorganisation  of  Municipalities  done  to  bring  two 
<br/>Councils together into clusters.  That was done purely for the purpose of administration, sharing of 
<br/>resources  and  ease  of  management.    However,  this  reorganisation  created  more  problems  than 
<br/>benefits. The Special Administrators working for two Councils had lost touch with the ratepayers 
<br/>and  residents  for  some  Municipalities.    Why?    Because  they  did  not  reside  within  those 
<br/>Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  above  has  created  issues  like,  lack  of  town  rates  collection  initiatives,  and  even  not 
<br/>attending to issues and complaints by ratepayers and residents in a timely manner.  The needs and 
<br/>interests of the Councils differ, Mr. Speaker, Sir, therefore, the Special Administrators were not able 
<br/>to focus time and resources to both Councils, which was detrimental to the Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the need for improvement and to ensure the Special 
<br/>Administrators in office supported the efforts of the Government and prepare the Councils for Local 
<br/>Government  Elections,  a  review  of  the  performance  was  approved  by  Cabinet  in  January  2023, 
<br/>leading to subsequent actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government’s appointment of Special Administrators marks 
<br/>the beginning of a transformative phase for local governance - the phase of elections.  This will pave 
<br/>way for a new era of accountable and transparent Local Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- I will come back to the question.  Please, listen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review indicated that despite several discussions and consultations with 
<br/>former  Special  Administrators  regarding  the  services  of  the  Councils,  mainly  the  Special 
<br/>Administrators were not active in attending to the matters of the Councils or the issues of interest of 
<br/>the residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  were  several  other  major  challenges  noted  in  our  review  which 
<br/>included,  supervision  and  monitoring  of  Municipal  Council  capital  projects.    Poor  monitoring  of 
<br/>basic  essential  services,  like  waste  collection  and  management  was  a  concern,  and  demands 
<br/>innovative and new approach.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another fundamental concern was the Councils’ internal governance and 
<br/>control measures, which were weak.  Most of the Councils had outdated SOPs that needed urgent 
<br/>attention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a change of mindset was required, especially with regards to 
<br/></span><span>the reliance of the Central Government for funding of projects and other basic services due to income 
<br/>limitations.  Now, we have empowered the new Special Administrators to think outside the box, to 
<br/>be  innovative  and  initiate  strategies  that  would  bring  about  financial  sustainability  in  their  own 
<br/>Municipalities, irrespective of their size.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reinstatement of market stall fees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is an example of a revenue stream 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>474 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that can assist Municipalities financially, especially in smaller Councils.  These small Councils need 
<br/>cash flow so by collecting stall fees on a monthly basis, it supports the way they do their business.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I move to the criteria, I want to emphasise some of the remarkable 
<br/>achievements of these new Special Administrators.  Within just three months of assuming office, 
<br/>these achievements are testament to our unwavering commitment to the people, the ratepayers and 
<br/>to the residents of our towns and cities.  For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Nasinu Town Council, 
<br/>you must have heard in the news today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- All political appointment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  After  undertaking  an  institutional  review  of  the  Council,  they 
<br/>have successfully resolved a long outstanding issue by signing off a long outstanding union claims 
<br/>on Monday, 15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024.  This is, indeed, a significant achievement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  Nadi  Town  Council,  the  Council’s  recent  agreement  with  the  unions  and  workers  in 
<br/>January 2024, ensuring staff receive their rightful dues.  This achievement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, directly 
<br/>benefits our hardworking workers of our Municipal Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other key achievements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the Nadi Market bird nesting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Selection criteria! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- When I first toured Nadi Town, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that was the 
<br/>first complaint I received from the Nadi Market vendor - all the birds’ wastes in most of the tables in 
<br/>the Nadi Market.  So, the Nadi Town Council and the new Special Administrators have fixed this.  I 
<br/>invite  the  honourable  Members  of  Parliament  to  go  and  see  the  work  that  the  new  Special 
<br/>Administrators have done for the Nadi Town Council, as well as the newly appointed Nadi Special 
<br/>Administrators and even the approval of the acquisition of an essential vehicle which is like a working 
<br/>tool, to assist the Council in the delivery of some of the services that are provided by the Nadi Town 
<br/>Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Come to the point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Even  the  Sigatoka  Town  Council  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  two 
<br/>Special  Administrators  have  installed  50  new  garbage  bins  and  it  is  working  on  50  smart  bins, 
<br/>enhancing waste management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another  important  issue,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  on  community  engagement.    When  we 
<br/>appointed the new Special Administrators, they are connected to the ratepayers, as well as connected 
<br/>to the residents of their own Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within three months, they have conducted ratepayer consultations within their Municipalities.  
<br/>They have done consultations for Lautoka City, Labasa Town, Savusavu Town and Nasinu Town.   
<br/>Tomorrow, the new Special Administrators are going to conduct consultations for Nadi Town.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  achievements,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  underscores  the  dedication  of  the  Special 
<br/>Administrators  and  Local  Government  to  serving  the  people  with  integrity,  transparency  and 
<br/>effective governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to outline the selection criteria for Special Administrators, which 
<br/>includes the following - competence with diverse experiences, people with business entrepreneurial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>475 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>skills, former decorated civil servants, lawyers, architects and doctors, in their respective towns and 
<br/>cities. Most importantly Sir, is that they have the passion to serve their Municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next is our commitment and availability, they are required to be committed to serving the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>residents of their respective towns and cities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another one on diversity and inclusivity. Most of the Special Administrators appointed, there 
<br/>is a good mix of gender in the appointment of the new Special Administrators. There is one female 
<br/>Special Administrator.  One is currently the Chairperson of the Nausori Town Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What about the NFP appointment there? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Special  Administrators  are  expectd  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prioritise the interests of the ratepayers first, then themselves  later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  one,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  leadership  and  communication.    They  must  have  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential and qualities to lead, while serving their Municipalities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They must have the skills and competence to engage with their communities, so community 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engagement is very important.

<div><span>They have to be strategic. They must have the skills to be strategically thinkers.  When you 
<br/>are a strategical thinker, you should be able to solve problems on more analytically.  Preference is 
<br/>given to candidates who are residents of towns and cities where they ought to serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Following  an  expression  of  interest  through  an  advertisement  in  the  local  newspapers, 
<br/>applicants meeting the criteria were shortlisted. The final Special Administrators were appointed in 
<br/>December 2023 by the Minister of Local Government with the endorsement of the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Very good. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- For the larger Councils, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are four Special 
<br/>Administrators appointed  -  one for the medium  and small  Councils, three Special Administrators 
<br/>were  appointed.  The  Ministry  undertook  due  diligence  to  ensure  compliance  and  some  legal 
<br/>requirements were adhered to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has also developed various documents, including Appointment 
<br/>Letters,  Code  of  Conduct,  the  duration  of  confidentiality  and  interest  and  resource  manuals,  all 
<br/>reviewed by legal authorities. The Special Administrators also signed the Conflict of Interest and 
<br/>Confidentiality Declarations and adhered to Code of Conduct to maintain integrity and public trust.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the Local Government elections is being prioritised by the Coalition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government, it is vital as Special Administrators are committed to the cause and will support the 
<br/>Government’s efforts to reinstate the Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they are also guided by policies promoting governance, transparency and 
<br/>accountability.  The  Ministry  also  developed  and  reviewed  policies  and  manuals  to  help  them  in 
<br/>undertaking their new roles as newly appointed Special Administrators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local Government is committed to establishing accountable, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsive and efficient Municipal Councils, ensuring good governance, practices and public

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confidence in the Local Government System.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank you once again, Mr. Speaker, for giving me time to respond to the question before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  According  to  a  media  report  and  I  have  the  report  with  me  dated  3</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>January, 2024, the General Secretaries from the three Political Parties - SODELPA, PAP and NFP 
<br/>had chosen and went through the list before it was sent to Cabinet for approval. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in breach of the OMRS Guidelines. According 
<br/>to  OMRS  Guidelines,  the  recruitment  process  should  be  fair  and  transparent  to  eliminate  any 
<br/>nepotism and discrimination. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  many  meritorious  applicants  were  not  considered  because  according  to 
<br/>concerned applicants, the due process was not followed.  My question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>can he inform the Parliament why the selection of Special Administrators was based on the three 
<br/>Political Parties’ recommendation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, through you, I wish to respond to the question 
<br/>by honourable Chand.  I will explain, Sir, the criteria on the selection of the Special Administrators, 
<br/>as well as the expression of interest that was advertised in the local dailies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, everyone was given the chance to apply.  We received a total of 166 applications, so  they 
<br/>were chosen.  That was the prerogative of the Minister with the endorsement of the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, that has led to the confirmation of the appointment of the new Special Administrators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time, I feel pity for the honourable 
<br/>Minister in trying to explain the mess that was created by the Coalition agreement to appoint the 
<br/>Special Administrators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  Expression  of  Interest, 
<br/>criteria of expression of interest number one on residency, the applicant must be a resident in the 
<br/>municipality in which they seek to serve, demonstrate a deep connection and understanding of our 
<br/>community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to know if Naitasiri is part of Nadi because someone 
<br/>from Naitasiri was appointed as a Special Administrator of Nadi Town, but he declined because he 
<br/>cannot travel from Naitasiri to Nadi.  Secondly, Sir, because honourable Minister has actually spoken 
<br/>for almost 25 minutes now, the simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer, can the honourable Minister confirm that 
<br/>the appointed Special Administrators had met the residential qualification of being a resident of that 
<br/>particular municipality, as outlined in the Expression of Interest? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- In 2013, there was someone living in Ba but was appointed as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Special Administrator for Lautoka, as well as Special Administrator for Nadi.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- That is the simple answer to your question.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>477 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is hard for him to answer because all of you are talking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just got a message from 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my General Secretary, who says that what honourable Chand was saying is false.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- He needs to clarify whether he is just using a </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> report 
<br/>or whether he has got evidence to say that the three General Secretaries met to decide the appointment 
<br/>of Special Administrators. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  It  is  quite  difficult  to  answer  that  Point  of  Order.    Are  you  seeking 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>clarification on that, based on the article that honourable Chand was reading?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I said was, it is according to a media report dated 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3</span><span>rd</span><span> January, 2024, and I have the article with me.  It is a media report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA. – Article?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Yes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Fiji Sun? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Fiji Sun.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Who’s the source? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- It is a media report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Another Point of Order, honourable Chand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Standing Order 44(15) and I quote: “A question must not be 
<br/>asked on whether statements in the press, or statements of private individuals or private concerns, 
<br/>are accurate.” He is asking a question from the press. You should not ask questions from the press, 
<br/>that is what it states here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  one,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  on  the  Nadi  Special  Administrator.    He  lives  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Votualevu, Nadi, so that is misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Do not come and lie here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Sharma, I now offer you the floor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, breaking news for the Coalition Government. The 
<br/>General  Secretary  of  Political  Parties  selecting  candidates  was  quoted  by  one  of  the  General 
<br/>Secretaries from the Coalition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Who?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- SODELPA, read the articles.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Honourable Minister for Local Government, it is a mess.  How do 
<br/>you justify that these appointments are based on merit and not political appointments? Secondly, do 
<br/>you admit this is the practice of democratic values and governance under this Coalition Government? 
<br/>Yes or No answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I have already explained the criteria and 
<br/>the process the Ministry took prior to the appointment. I also want to mention here that they were 
<br/>stating  that  they  were  political  appointees.  I  need  to  tell  them  that  two  of  the  newly  appointed 
<br/>Administrators were part of the previous Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And one of them was NFP anyway. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Workers’ Complaints and Labour Inspection Cases 
<br/>(Question No. 27/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/>update Parliament on the investigations conducted by the Labour Standards and Compliance 
<br/>Services on workers’ complaints and labour inspections cases lodged with the Ministry from 
<br/>1st August 2023 to 31st March 2024? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just before answering the question, I was listening to 
<br/>the honourable Hem Chand talking about the Open Merit and Recruitment System (OMRS). I was 
<br/>the General Secretary of the Fiji Teachers Union when he appointed Head Teachers (almost 600 of 
<br/>them), outside the OMRS and the Minister who questioned him was honourable Premila Kumar. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- A Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Standing Order?
