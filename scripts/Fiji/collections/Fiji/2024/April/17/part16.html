<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- 42.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Standing Order 60 on Relevance.   I am asking the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations to produce evidence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Did you say that because I have noticed this Standing Order moving across. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You stood up on a Point of Order without being fully prepared.  I think I will not allow that, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Hem Chand, please. Time is of the essence here and we are nearing the end of the day,

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>479 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>plus programmes that are still very much pending here, so I will ask that we continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, hypocrisy is well practised in some places.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Labour  inspections,  complaints  and  investigations  are  crucial  roles  in  upholding  labour 
<br/>standards and regulations set forth under the Employment Relations Act 2007.  Sir, by conducting 
<br/>regular inspections, Labour Inspectors can identify and address violation of labour laws, such as non-
<br/>payment of wages, overtime payment, holiday pay, leave entitlements and other dues in accordance 
<br/>with  the  Employment  Relations  Act  2007and  relevant  Wages  Regulations.  Through  these 
<br/>inspections, we can safeguard the rights of workers and hold non-compliant employers accountable 
<br/>for their actions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  compliance  with  labour  laws  is  not  just  a  legal  obligation  but  a  moral 
<br/>responsibility. When employers adhere to labour laws, they contribute to the wellbeing and dignity 
<br/>of employees.  By providing fair wages, ensuring safe working conditions, and respecting workers’ 
<br/>rights, employers create a positive work environment that fosters productivity, loyalty and mutual 
<br/>respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, compliance with labour laws is essential for promoting social 
<br/>justice  and  equality  in  our  society.    By  enforcing  labour  standards,  we  can  combat  exploitation, 
<br/>discrimination and unfair labour practices, that undermine the rights and dignity of workers. When 
<br/>we uphold labour laws, we uphold the values of justice, equality and human rights for all individuals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Labour Standards and Compliance Section of my Ministry is responsible 
<br/>for the enforcement and compliance of the Employment Relations Act 2007 and Wages Regulations 
<br/>2010, as well as the National Minimum Wage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has conducted 2,017 labour compliance inspections from 1</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>August, 2023 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 2024, achieving 86 percent of the targets set for the eight months which 
<br/>was 2,336.  Our annual target is 3,500, and we now intend to increase this to 4,500 or up to 5,000. 
<br/>We were not able to do this in the past year because there were 30-plus vacant positions that had not 
<br/>been filled for a number of years.  We are almost on the verge of completing that exercise, so we can 
<br/>increase the number of inspections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has resolved 746 labour complaints out of a total of 999 cases 
<br/>received from 2022 to March 2024, achieving a settlement rate of 75 percent.  These complaints were 
<br/>regarding  the  non-payment  of  wages  due,  annual  leave,  overtime,  meal  allowance  and  maternity 
<br/>leave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has over 600 cases before the Employment Relations Tribunal for adjudication, 
<br/>where employers have failed to pay dues to workers and comply with the minimum standards.  The 
<br/>total recovery from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2023 to March 2024, stands at $660,000 which has been paid out to 
<br/>the workers through the efforts of the Ministry’s Compliance Section.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir; does the Ministry 
<br/>conduct  training  and  awareness  for  employers  and  employees  on  compliance  with  the  minimum 
<br/>standard? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry’s proactive role is crucial in reducing the 
<br/>number of labour complaints received.  Both employers and workers need to be made aware of the

<div><span>During the eight months from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August to 31</span><span>st</span><span> March 2024, the Ministry has conducted a 
<br/>total of 2,044 awareness trainings to employers.  Out of those, 2,022 were conducted for awareness 
<br/>while 22 were structured training sessions which were conducted with employees.  The list of 22 are

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  training  in  employment  relations  helps  improve  working  relationships 
<br/>between workers and employers, leading to a more positive work environment, equips individuals 
<br/>with skills to effectively resolve conflicts and disputes that may arise in the workplace.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, by promoting a better understanding of employment rights and responsibilities, this 
<br/>would contribute to increase in productivity and efficiency at the workplace.  It also enhances the 
<br/>spirit of good faith, which is the cornerstone of our employment relations in Fiji.  We try to bring 
<br/>employers and workers together - bring about the awareness, so that they can work together and build 
<br/>their trust in each other which, of course, had been missing for quite some years now.  We are in the 
<br/>process of rebuilding all that, which had been dismantled because of the amendment of the labour 
<br/>laws that disallowed that kind of interaction.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister.  
<br/>Yesterday,  I  raised  my  concern  about  how  our  local  workers  are  treated  in  Australia  and  New 
<br/>Zealand.  I was not satisfied with the answer by the honourable Minister, talking about the role of 
<br/>Country Liaison Officers because there is a difference between liaison and arbitration, and that is my 
<br/></span><span>concern.    You  have  talked  about  labour  laws  and  workers’  rights.    My  simple  question  is  on 
<br/></span><span>employment relations, preparing our workers who are to leave for offshore employment.  Is that part 
<br/>of the training package pre-departure?     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  currently,  we  have  four  days  of  training  and  this 
<br/>training  is  provided  not  only  by  our  team  but  we  also  have  resource  persons  from  Australia’s 
<br/>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and they do it together.  They try to do their best

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to familiarise themselves with what they can expect in terms of terms and conditions or labour laws 
<br/>in Australia.  As I have stated earlier, four days is not enough, and we are now working with our 
<br/>counterparts in Australia to assist us, to extend the four-day training to, at least, two weeks where we 
<br/>will be able to do a better job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  investigation  conducted  by  Ministry  of 
<br/>Employment is really effective in terms of helping our employees.  What I wanted to ask was, for 
<br/>example, justice delayed is justice denied.  We do understand that there is an Employment Tribunal 
<br/>which sits to deal with all the cases referred to the Tribunal and sometimes we do not have a sitting 
<br/>Magistrate looking after this Tribunal. Has there been any work done to have a full time Magistrate 
<br/>who can fast-track all these cases? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have is what we had inherited.  With my 
<br/>experience,  Sir,  being  a  trade  unionist  under  that  Administration,  I  waited  for  four  years  for  the 
<br/>Employment Relations Tribunal to give a decision. There are cases that had been pending for four to 
<br/>seven years in the Employment Court and in the Employment Tribunal.    so, it is nothing new from 
<br/>what we are doing now. I have spoken to the honourable Attorney-General, we are also requesting 
<br/>the honourable Chief Justice to appoint more tribunals and we are also now revising the labour laws.  
<br/>We are now going to straighten things so that we can expedite the whole process.

<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the changes in our Immigration Law and policy as announced by the Minister, 
<br/>can the honourable Minister for Home  Affairs and  Immigration inform  Parliament inform 
<br/>Parliament on  the following –

<div><span>how many that have come to Fiji as Business visitors are now employed and the general 
<br/>sector where they are employed;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>how many of those non-citizens that are registered in the Vola ni Kawa Bula have entered 
<br/>Fiji through the permit exemption granted under the Immigration (Amendment) Act 2023; 
<br/>and  
<br/>how many foreigners who are descendants of a Fiji Citizen on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, 1970 have 
<br/>entered Fiji through the permit exemptions granted under the Immigration (Exemption by 
<br/>Descent) Order 2023? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I will table my response at a later sitting date as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>permitted under Standing Order 45(3).
