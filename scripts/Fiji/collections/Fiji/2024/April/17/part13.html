<div><span>Fiji Airways’ Charter Policies and Procedures  
<br/>(Question No. 20/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics inform  Parliament  of  Fiji  Airway’s  charter 
<br/>policies and procedures they follow when processing charter requests? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I answer this question, I think it is 
<br/>important  for  me  to  state  this.    If  the  Opposition  were  to  be  in  Government  and  we  were  in  the 
<br/>Opposition, and if we were going to ask this question, we would have been told that it is a private 
<br/>company.  It is a private company in which Government has more than 50 percent share and that is 
<br/>why, Sir, as a Government, we will present to Parliament the Annual Reports and Financial Reports 
<br/>of the Fiji Airways in May. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But let me answer this question on the policies and procedures followed by Fiji Airways when 
<br/></span><span>processing charter requests.  These are normal commercial policies that different organisations have 
<br/>and they devise this as part of their check and balances and how they offer charter services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways has a very detailed set of procedures when it comes to assessing 
<br/>charter flights.  To begin with, upon receipt of the request, the Fiji Airways Charter Team gathers all 
<br/>relevant information from the customer, including flight dates, number of passengers, special needs,
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ad hoc</span><span> items, potential flexibility on dates and times in case aircraft is not available on preferred 
<br/>dates  and  an  assessment  is  conducted  to  determine  available  resources  to  support  the  requested 
<br/>charter, aircraft, crew, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, if a request cannot be supported with the available resources, the request is 
<br/>declined  and  if  the  resources  can  support  the  charter,  then  Fiji  Airways  proceeds  to  assessing 
<br/>operational feasibility and cost quote. The goal with any request is to ensure that safety and security 
<br/>are achieved, operational feasibility is confirmed, and revenue covers the cost and justifies the efforts, 
<br/>complexity and a reasonable amount of risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Operational feasibility, Mr. Speaker, Sir, depending on the nature of the charter, a complex 
<br/>geography, short timelines, et cetera, internal teams such as the Operations Aircraft Crew, Safety and 
<br/>Security Ground Handling and Catering Crew, et cetera, are asked to assess the operational feasibility 
<br/>before the cost quote is finalised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a comprehensive analysis is conducted to determine the cost of operating 
<br/>the  charter  to  Fiji  Airways.  This  starts  with  an  assessment  of  the  Airline’s  related  costs,  further 
<br/>proposed routes such as fuel, route costs, accommodation costs, catering, insurance, engineering, et 
<br/>cetera, and the expenses that are associated with any flight. This may also include the cost of flight 
<br/>consolidation, opportunity cost or cost to cover additional risks, particularly when operating a charter 
<br/>to destinations Fiji Airways does not normally operate to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once an operational cost forecast has been assessed, a profit margin is added to the cost to 
<br/>finalise the quote. The quote is provided to the customer, who then has an option to accept, decline 
<br/>or negotiate. Fiji Airways may decide not to negotiate the rate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The charter agreement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, upon confirmation from the customer, and as I have 
<br/>said,  which  is  normal  in  any  charter  services,  that  the  cost  quote  is  acceptable  and  operational 
<br/>feasibility is attained. A charter agreement, usually a contract is drafted and provided for sign off by 
<br/>both parties.  Fiji Airways has a template - a charter contract drafted by its in-house legal team that 
<br/>is provided which can be subject to negotiation and adjustment on a case-by-case basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  payment,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  apart  from  providing  a  cost  quote,  a  payment  timeline  is 
<br/>negotiated with the customer and documented as a part of the agreement. And if the customer fails 
<br/>to meet payment, the standard charter contract gives Fiji Airways the right in its direction to cancel 
<br/>the charter and retain a pre-agreed cancellation fee. Alternatively, it would be open to the company 
<br/>to accept revised payment terms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Airways tendered charter contract requires full payments to be made by 
<br/>no later than 38 days prior to the first charter flight. More complex charters may also require initial 
<br/>deposits to be made before the 38 day deadline, to fund costs associated with obtaining approvals 
<br/>and otherwise preparing to operate a charter flight. Many charter requests are made at the last minute 
<br/>and within days or hours of the requested charter fights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  a nutshell, each case is  assessed individually,  and in some cases, Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Airways may be willing to accept other payment terms after the charter has occurred.  Factors that 
<br/></span><span>are considered, include - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>credibility, financial or reputational, of the customer; 
<br/>Previous business activity of the customer; and 
<br/>an assessment or review of the past payment history.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>455 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Passenger taxes are generally finalised and paid within one to two weeks after the charter operation 
<br/>and all details are fully accounted. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the policies and procedures adopted by Fiji Airways to assess 
<br/>charter flights, in my view, and anyone who looks at it would find that it is transparent, robust and 
<br/>all decisions, if you consider the whole policy, is based on operational feasibility and is in the best 
<br/>interest of the company, without bias or political intervention, as claimed by some in the recent case. 
<br/>So,  that,  in  a  nutshell,  is  the  process,  the  procedures  and  the  assessment  when  a  charter  flight  is 
<br/>requested or booked with Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his 
<br/>comprehensive explanation which we appreciate. During the FijiFirst time, we never had a ‘travel 
<br/>first pay later’ scheme but now, with the Coalition Government during their time, a so-called private 
<br/>company which was funded by the Government, the pensioners or which we can call FNPF account 
<br/>holders and we all have shares in it, so being commercial,  honourable Minister, why in this particular 
<br/>case  such  as  small  deposit  was  taken  by  Fiji  Airways  when  they  were  assessing  this  charter 
<br/>arrangement - a very small deposit?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two points.  I think the honourable 
<br/>Member is confusing herself.  It is a private company in which Government has more than 50 percent 
<br/>share and that is  the point we were making that if Government has survived eight years, it is like 
<br/>other organizations where Government has more than 50 percent share, which means that taxpayers 
<br/>are involved and, therefore, it requires any Government in the past, except in the case of the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government, where they refused to bring Annual Reports, Financial Statements to this Parliament.  
<br/>We will do that, Sir, we will be tabling Financial Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we could have done another thing in the Business Committee.  We 
<br/>could have said, “This question is a subject of investigation.”  I do not want to get into the details but 
<br/>let me say that any decision as per the policy, as per what I have described, the company assesses 
<br/>each case on its own merit.  Sometimes, it may be based on the previous record, the company was 
<br/>involved in charter flights, it could be potential, but any company that does business will assess the 
<br/>risk. There is always a risk in anything any business entity does, either you book a flight, you cancel 
<br/>it and Fiji Airways has processes and procedures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The CEO is on record to make it very clear that as far as they are concerned, they have a 
<br/>payment plan that they are confident that whatever is owed to Fiji Airways will be paid and that is a 
<br/>normal  business  transaction  and  decision.    This  is  within  their  policies,  within  their  procedures, 
<br/>within their operational feasibility, cost feasibility assessment that they make and these are people 
<br/>who have the experience and who have the legal basis to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  a  simple  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister.  We understand that it is a company policy but two parts to this question. What is the update 
<br/>on the repayment and is Government concerned?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Opposition,  as  I  have  said  the  CEO is  on  record  to  say that  they  have  a repayment  plan,  already 
<br/></span><span>agreed and they are confident that what is due to Fiji Airways will be paid.  Let me just remind the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, again, Government has a majority share, the other shareholder 
<br/>is FNPF, and there are other minority shares by other countries as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, the Government would be concerned about any commercial company in which 
<br/>Government has a share and that is why, Mr. Speaker, we, on the other side, for eight years, had been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="31">Page 31</a></div>
<div><span>456 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>asking  them  to  bring  reports  to  Parliament  because  it  is  here  in  this  Parliament  that  the  report  is 
<br/>presented, it goes to the Committees and it is debated, but they denied the taxpayers of this country 
<br/>for eight years.  Now, we are teaching them what is transparency and that is why we are answering 
<br/>these questions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a clarification from the honourable Minister 
<br/>of Finance.  I think in his first response, he suggested that within 38 days, payment should be made.  
<br/>Then during his second explanation, he went on and said that it was within the company policy to 
<br/>get an agreement done, whereby they will actually ensure the payment will be done to Fiji Airways.  
<br/>That is contradicting.  If someone has actually surpassed that 38 days, is there any interest charged 
<br/>to the company who owes money to Fiji Airways?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think they are trying very hard to score a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>point. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is actually getting them nowhere because I said very clearly and let me just read this again for their 
<br/>clarification  and  to  get  their  mind  to  ease.    “Fiji  Airways  standard  charter  contract  requires  full 
<br/>payment to be made by no later than 38 days prior to the first charter flight”.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, I also said, in the policy, that every case is decided on its merit on a case 
<br/>by case basis, then there is an agreement.   The agreement is there.  If the agreement is not adhered 
<br/>to, it can happen in any commercial agreement, those who run businesses know this on a daily basis, 
<br/>it is being renegotiated and this is what the CEO has said very clearly, that they have a repayment 
<br/>plan, as per the agreement, and it will be paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are confident from what the CEO has told the Board, and the Board has communicated 
<br/>that to me as line Minister.   I am confident that the company will do what is in the best interest of 
<br/>the company and the country to run the business in an efficient way.  We are very confident in the 
<br/>ability of the people and the Board to deal with this effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me remind them again.  They will have the opportunity to peruse, debate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and discover what was happening in the Fiji Airways in the last several years from the annual reports.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  is  the  standard  that  this  Government  is  setting.    That  is  the  standard  of  democracy, 
<br/>transparency and accountability that we practise on this side, and   I want the Opposition to learn 
<br/>from it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Revival of the Rural Housing Programme 
<br/>(Question No. 21/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span><span>Management inform Parliament on the progress of the revived Rural Housing Programme 
<br/></span><span>Initiative? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, I had addressed this subject in my last Ministerial Statement last year but I believe an 
<br/>update is due.  I thank the honourable member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>457 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can give an update on the re-establishment of the Rural Housing Unit, it was reinstated in 
<br/>the  Ministry.    This  involved  transfer  of  the  Unit  staff  who  were  previously  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Housing, who were mostly carpenters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Head of Rural Housing Unit and other key personnel were recruited at the beginning of 
<br/>this  year.  The  team  is  to  oversee  the  administration  of  the  programme  from  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>Headquarters and inhouse carpenters to assist in the implementation of the Programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  four  housing  schemes  offered  under  the  Rural  Housing  Assistance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme 1  
<br/>Government  assistance  to  applicants  to  purchase  building  materials  at  a  minimum  cost  of 
<br/>$30,000, to which Government will facilitate the cartage cost of building materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme 2 
<br/>Requires the applicant to pay one-third contribution in cash, while the Ministry pays two-thirds 
<br/>of  the  total  project  cost.    The  Scheme  is  targeted  at  individual  applicants  with  the  following 
<br/>options: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(i)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(ii)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Newly built house construction using the approved 24 x 16 feet house plan. 
<br/>The extension of an existing structure which includes the attachment of sanitation and 
<br/>kitchen facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iii)</span><span> </span><span>Retrofitting  of  the  existing  structure  to  withstand  Category  4  and  Category  5  tropical 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>cyclones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(iv)</span><span> </span><span>Completion of an existing structure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme 3  
<br/>Mainly targets timber resource owners with either pine schemes, native tree resource owners or 
<br/>lease  beneficiary  holders  who  can  use  these  resources  as  their  one-third  contribution.    The 
<br/>Ministry works with the Ministry of Forestry on this Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Scheme 4   
<br/>Meant to assist beneficiaries under the Family Assistance or Social Welfare Housing Scheme. 
<br/>This  Scheme  will  adopt  the  same  Rural  Housing  Unit  Standard  House  Plan  with  additional 
<br/>disability  friendly  facilities.    So,  those  who  request  this  assistance  needs  the  support  of  the 
<br/>Ministry of Women, Children and Social Protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Programme prioritizes assistance to those who are permanently residing 
<br/>in villages and rural settlements and in non-urban and peri-urban areas. The Ministry is developing 
<br/>this initiative to maximise the assistance to the most overlooked communities in our Fiji, thus the 
<br/>Ministry, through the Rural Housing Assistance Programme, will work to narrow this gap.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  progress  to-date,  the  Rural  Housing  Unit  has  produced  an  engineered  approved 
<br/>designed timber framed house plan with material list as part of the Rural Housing Assistance New 
<br/></span><span>House  Programme,  and  as  I  speak,  rural  and  maritime  communities  are  receiving  this  assistance 
<br/></span><span>through the four Divisional Commissioners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  allocated  $3  million  for  the  Rural  Housing  Assistance 
<br/>Programme in this financial year in which the Ministry has released funds for the implementation of 
<br/>the Programme.  The Ministry is targeting to complete 130 projects in the current financial year, and 
<br/>the breakdown of released funds and the number of projects per Division are as follows:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year is the first financial year that the Ministry is taking on the responsibility of Rural 
<br/>Housing  Programme  again  and  based  on  the  experiences  encountered  this  year,  the  Ministry  is 
<br/>working  on  reviewing  the  Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  Guidelines  for  the  Rural  Housing 
<br/>Assistance  Programme,  taking  into  consideration  the  different  earning  power  of  our  rural 
<br/>communities  and  the  fluctuation  of  the  market  prices  that  prompted  the  increase  and  the  cost  of 
<br/>building materials. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the review will also allow the inclusion of women and children privacy and 
<br/>promote the inclusion of safety and security of our vulnerable population in our new model design.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe, as honourable Members of this august Parliament, we are aware 
<br/>of the objectives of the SDGs and you have a responsibility to institute strategies to achieve those 
<br/>goals and targets.  Sir, SDG11 relates to making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient 
<br/>and sustainable.  Target 11.1 states and I quote, “By 2030, ensures access for all to adequate, safe 
<br/>and affordable housing and basic services and upgrade slums.”  The Ministry is doing its best to work 
<br/>towards  achieving  this  target  and  to  ensure  that  our  rural  and  maritime  communities  will  have 
<br/>conducive and durable houses that they can call home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  his  detailed 
<br/>response.  I had a look at the question and chuckled to myself, the question said, “revival of rural 
<br/>housing programme initiative”.  There was no revival as such, this programme was already revived 
<br/>by the Ministry of Housing with a couple of things that was done.  One was the review of the policy, 
<br/>plus the development of various plans, like CAT4 Engineer Certified Programme, so quite a lot of 
<br/>work went into it.  My question to you, honourable Minister is, how many projects have the Ministry 
<br/>completed in the 2023-2024 financial year?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the projects at the moment are ongoing, none have 
<br/>been  completed  yet.    There  are  quite  a  number  of  applications  that  were  received,  about  6,600 
<br/>applications and at the moment, we are working hard to complete whatever needs to be completed 
<br/>and we will come back to Parliament with a report when those projects are completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Honourable  Minister,  we  have  NGOs  like  the  Habitat  for 
<br/>Humanity  Fiji,  that  is  heavily  involved  in  rural  housing,    and  those  kinds  of  projects.    In  this 
<br/>framework or policy, do you have some kind of working partnership with them because I feel that 
<br/>they can be involved and assist with your projects in a bigger way?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have some working partnership with some of 
<br/></span><span>these  NGOs,  Habitat  for  Humanity  in  some  projects,  as  well  as  ADRA  Fiji,  as  I  had  mentioned 
<br/></span><span>yesterday.  But as far as the Rural Housing Project is concerned, it is a purely Government enterprise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  a  simple  question  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister.  When the Rural Housing Unit was with the Ministry of Housing, they had come up with a 
<br/>new design, but you have stated that you have gone back to the normal 24 x16.  So, the question 
<br/>honourable Minister is, has the plan been approved?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>459 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I inquired late last year, according to your staff, it is still going through the approval 
<br/>process and what is critical in the plan is whether that 24 x16 also includes the ablution unit, meaning 
<br/>the bathroom and the toilet, because this is something that was learnt from previous disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  houses  that  we  have  are  engineer-
<br/>certified and this has been approved by the Ministry of Works as well.  Sorry, what was your second 
<br/>question?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- The ablution block. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- The ablution block is part of the plan as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measures to Combat Increase in HIV Cases 
<br/>(Question No. 22/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is  an increase in  HIV cases  and a contributing factor, amongst  others, is  the 
<br/>practice  of  injecting  diluted  methamphetamine  into  bloodstreams,  then  sharing  the  drug-
<br/>infused blood with other users. Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services 
<br/>inform Parliament on the measures in place to combat this issue? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of what the Ministry is doing 
<br/>with  the current  surge in  HIV  cases  within  the nation, allow me to  first give a brief status  of the 
<br/>current HIV status within the nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, addressing the sharp rise in HIV cases in Fiji in recent years is, indeed, an uphill battle 
<br/>and will require our collective effort. Our latest Ministry statistics on HIV positive cases show a near 
<br/>doubling of new cases diagnosed each year from 2021 to 2023, and we anticipate that this trend will 
<br/>continue in 2024.  However, the numbers recorded at the Ministry may only be a fraction of the real 
<br/>number of HIV cases in the community and this should be a concern for all of us in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I had highlighted in Parliament in the last session that injecting drug users have been reported 
<br/>to the Ministry to be using a new method called “blue toothing”.  Blue toothing, as what honourable 
<br/>Lal mentioned, is a means to share injectable drugs amongst users, which involves injecting drug 
<br/>users, plunging a syringe of diluted methamphetamine into the bloodstream, drawing first blood and 
<br/>sharing the syringe with a second person who can then pass it on to a third.  This is a very high risk 
<br/>activity which poses a number of serious health issues for those involved, such as serious adverse 
<br/>effects  from  sharing  unmatched  blood  that  includes  severe  anaphylactic  reactions  and  death; 
<br/>transmission of serious infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C; bacterial infections at 
<br/>the injection site; as well as passing bacteria into the blood stream that can cause severe infections 
<br/>from unhygienic injecting practices.  I wish to advise all IV drug users to refrain from this activity as 
<br/>it can lead to more serious health outcomes immediately and in the long terms for users.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to touch on to what the Ministry is doing, the solution for the HIV situation 
<br/></span><span>in  Fiji  requires  several  actions  and  approaches  involving  critical  stakeholders  collaborating  or 
<br/></span><span>working  together  to  comprehensively  address  the  many  aspects  of  the  issue.    The  Ministry  is 
<br/>finalising the HIV Surge Strategy which will facilitate our collaboration with health partners across 
<br/>Government Ministries and our communities, to –

<br/>the risks associated with the practice is important in curbing the practice amongst new and potential 
<br/>users.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will facilitate the decentralisation of service delivery, testing, treatment and care 
<br/>with oversight provided by the specialist at Sexual Reproductive Health Clinics in Fiji’s three largest 
<br/>Divisions, mainly Western, Central/Eastern and Northern.  This will facilitate the collaboration that 
<br/>addresses universal access and inequity for service delivery to the public and private health sectors 
<br/>across the nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to conclude by reminding everyone in Fiji that unsafe sexual practice 
<br/>and  the  use  of  injectable  drugs  are  contributing  to  the  rise  of  HIV  in  Fiji.    Avoiding  these  risky 
<br/>behaviours can prevent you from getting HIV infection.  I also want to reiterate that having HIV is 
<br/>not the end of the world and not a death sentence.  With treatment, people living with HIV can lead 
<br/>a normal and productive life and have children who are HIV infections-free.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on policy formulation and legislation,  Public 
<br/>Health Officials need to advocate for a healthier law and policy targeting the stigmatisation of HIV 
<br/>and AIDS and also drug users.  Stigma can discourage affected individuals from seeking necessary 
<br/>help.    My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is,  would  he  consider  the  formulation  of  a  policy 
<br/>advocating  non-criminal  treatment  of  drug  abuse  or  drug  users,  emphasising  it  as  a  public  health 
<br/>concern  rather  than  purely  its  legal  issues  and  encourage  the  needle  users  or  drug  users  to  seek 
<br/>assistance in our public and private health facilities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  DR.  RATU  A.R.  LALABALAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Ravunawa for his supplementary question.  As I had mentioned, we have a HIV Surge Strategy that 
<br/>is currently in place and most likely will be implemented next month.  That will incorporate all what 
<br/>the  honourable  Member  has  suggested  and,  again,  it  is  cross-cutting  across  all  Ministries  and 
<br/>throughout the communities as well - from NGOs, CSOs, religious organisations, traditional leaders, 
<br/>et cetera.  This is a task for all of us in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, UNAIDS is a vital and essential institutional platform 
<br/></span><span>for the United Nations as the main advocate of accelerated and global action on stopping HIV/AIDS 
<br/>pandemic.  However, it is noted there is a reduction in UNAIDS’ presence in Fiji, which has resulted 
<br/>in less support of funds for technical support given to the Ministry of Health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the reduction in support, there is high rate of HIV incidence in this country.  In 2017, 
<br/>there were approximately four staff based in Fiji, but this has been reduced to only one in 2023.  For 
<br/>the same period, HIV cases has increased from 150 to 450.  Honourable Minister, the question I wish 
<br/>to ask you, do you think that there is a high degree of correlation between the increase in the number 
<br/></span><span>of HIV and the decrease in funding from UNAIDS? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is a very technical kind of question - correlation between the number 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we have and the decrease in the funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to UNAIDS here 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji, since taking office and when I first met with the Team from UNAIDS, they were also saying

<br/>is only one staff currently, she is acting as an Advisor to the UN Residency Office. I had written to 
<br/>UNAIDS earlier in October last year requesting that they re-consider in terms of moving their office 
<br/>away  from  Fiji.    I  will,  again,  follow  that  up  and  hopefully,  I  will  involve  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister. They are very much needed, and I look forward to that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I was a bit lost on the intention of the question because it came from your

<div><span>Government side.

<div><span>Mining and Land Use Policies 
<br/>(Question No. 23/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources update Parliament on 
<br/>the Ministry’s plan to balance economic development with environmental conservation in the 
<br/>context of Mining and Land Use policies?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question posed to Parliament this afternoon.  It is almost given that when people talk about mining 
<br/>or when mining is mentioned, people often associate that word with environmental destruction and 
<br/>exploitation. However, as we understand the world over, mining has been around for many centuries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mining is a crucial and perhaps, a critical component of any national development and more 
<br/>so particularly for those countries that have a large deposit of mineral resources because it provides 
<br/>for the necessary raw materials that are used in today’s developing world in construction, energy and 
<br/>in technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minerals  are  fundamental  and  are  also  important  to  the  ingredients  that  we  have  in  our 
<br/>everyday consumables, from the toothpaste that we use on a daily basis, jeans that we wear, the latest 
<br/>technology  that we enjoy  such as our mobile phones, laptops, smart  televisions, all  those contain 
<br/>products that are extracted from mining activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mining Industry contributes to Fiji’s economy through job creation and 
<br/>employment  opportunities.    This  sector  offer  both,  direct  and  indirect  employment,  positively 
<br/>impacting  our  local  communities  and,  of  course,  our  regional  economies.  Direct  employment  in 
<br/>mining involves jobs such as the miners, technicians, engineers, surveyors, administrative personnel 
<br/>and mine labourers, to name a few.  These positions offer competitive wages and benefits, attracting 
<br/>skilled workers and contributing to local economy and its stability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  by  way  of  background,  currently,  three  mining  operations  in  Fiji 
<br/>employs about 2,000 people, while the exploration sector employs another 100.  By the latest count, 
<br/>the recently opened Tuvatu Mine in Nadi has a total of 420 registered workers, plus eight expatriates, 
<br/></span><span>with an estimate of $120,000 being their figure of fortnightly pay.   The Vatukoula Gold Mine on the 
<br/></span><span>other hand, employs 1,058 workers, with 19 expatriates.  Their pay bill hovers around $800,000 every 
<br/>fortnight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to mention that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the mining sector continued 
<br/>operation, and continues to bring in the much needed employment income for our local people and 
<br/>boosting economic activities in their communities.  These companies’ employees were not laid off,  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>but further recruitment of new staff was made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry always strives to strike a balance between development, and 
<br/>when I say development, any development for that matter, not just mining, and emerging issues about 
<br/>environmental protection and economic growth.  There is always this hard task of managing what 
<br/>would  development  caused  to  our  environment  because  we  are  always  in  need  of  economic 
<br/>expansion.  For mining, it is enshrined in the Mining Act  1965 and is facilitated through mineral 
<br/>exploration and mining, using, of course, sustainable best practices that are practised worldwide.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Lands is mandated under the Mining Act 1965 to safeguard the environment 
<br/>and  also  the  people  who  live  around  it.    In  addition,  there  are  also  requirements  now  under  the 
<br/>Environment Management Act 2005 to which we are also aligned to.  The main reason for doing that 
<br/>is  to  ensure  environmental  stability  and  protection,  and  when  there  is  mining,  environmental 
<br/>rehabilitation through a very comprehensive rehabilitation plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mining  development  approval  can  only  be  permitted  if  the  various  authorities  have  given 
<br/>their  relevant  endorsements.    For  example,  the  Environment  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  by  the 
<br/>Department of Environment and the surface lease from the iTaukei Lands Trust Board (iTLTB) are 
<br/>a must before any mining lease is issued.  Director Mines cannot approve any application if such 
<br/>endorsements  from  these  authorities,  within  the  mining  approval  process,  is  questioned  or  not 
<br/>granted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  also  worth  noting  that  responsibilities  of  environment  conservation  is  not  solely  the 
<br/>responsibility of the Department of the Mineral Resources, but with the respective authorities of the 
<br/>law governing all these sectors that I have alluded to.  The Department of Mineral Resources works 
<br/>within the premise of the legislation that regulates that resource sector in Fiji.  They are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Mining Act 1965; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Quarries Act 1939; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Explosives Act 1937; 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Petroleum (Exploration and Exploitation) Act 1978; 
<br/>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Fair Share of Mineral Royalties Act 2018.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International Seabed Mineral Management Act 2013; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the practices adopted by the Ministry to address the balance needed 
<br/>between development and conserving environment includes collaboration with other line Ministries 
<br/>such as the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry,  Department  of Environment and Climate Change, 
<br/>Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  and  other  agencies  that  I  have  referred  to,  such  as,  iTLTB,  Water 
<br/>Authority of Fiji (WAF) and the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  applications  for  mineral  exploration  and  mining  are  being  processed,  these 
<br/>stakeholders  are consulted to  identify areas of  ecological  or cultural interests.   If they are  agreed 
<br/>upon, they would then be demarcated as exclusion or no-go zones in mining.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  the  ERA  and  Environment  Management  Plans  are  integral  components  of  the 
<br/></span><span>application process for mining and special prospecting licence. Also, monitoring of compliance is 
<br/></span><span>undertaken on a quarterly basis during the mineral exploration and during the mining phase. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a requirement for active mines to submit monthly reports to 
<br/>the Director of Mines which requires updates on their environmental management strategies whereas 
<br/>for exploration, companies need to submit quarterly reports to the Director of Mines, which include 
<br/>updates on the environmental management measures that they have undertaken.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, under section 16 of the Mining Act of 1965, a performance deposit 
<br/>is paid to the Department of Mineral Resources that is withheld as a guarantee of their company’s 
<br/>performance.    Part  of  the  deposit  calculation  also  includes  and  accounts  for  environmental 
<br/>rehabilitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a mandatory requirement for areas disturbed from exploration activities, such as drilling, 
<br/>trenching, et cetera, to undergo approved rehabilitation work.  For example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>planting  of  pines  for  the  Nawailevu  Bauxite  Mines,  160,000  pine  trees  at  Nawailevu  site  while 
<br/>another  5,000  trees  replanted  at  the  second  location  for  the  sole  benefit  of  the  landowners  of 
<br/>Nawailevu.  Mining rehabilitation is value adding, taking into account post-mining land use for the 
<br/>benefit of the landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  any  land  use  development,  including  mining,  protection  of  the 
<br/>environment  will  remain  to  be  a  challenge,  not  just  in  Fiji  as  a  developing  nation,  but  elsewhere 
<br/>around the world where there are development needs on land and sea, be it at a global, regional or 
<br/>local here in Fiji. That is why, Mr. Speaker, it is important to maintain the right balance between land 
<br/>development, the need for economic extension of a country and the absolute need for environment 
<br/>conservation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 21(1) of the State Lands Act 1945 states, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“No lease of any State foreshore land or of any soil under the waters of Fiji shall 
<br/>be made without the express approval of the Minister and such approval shall not be 
<br/>granted  unless  the  Minister  declares  that  such  lease  does  not  create  a  substantial 
<br/>infringement of public rights.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources has the legislative mandate 
<br/>or authority to allocate and approve foreshore developments in our country.  However, this is done 
<br/>and can only  be done within  the ambit  of  ensuring that decisions  are made with  consistency  and 
<br/>accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Together  with  obtaining  approvals  from  relevant  Government  agencies,  in  addition  to  the 
<br/>Ministry’s own checklist, requirements and lease conditions, all of these aim to identify the most 
<br/>sustainable  action  between  land  use  in  the  case  of  foreshore  land  and  social  and  economic 
<br/>development and, on the other hand, preservation of our environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry have received complaints on the delay of obtaining ministerial 
<br/>approvals. This is, indeed, essential to ensure that thorough and careful considerations are made to 
<br/>preserve our natural landscapes, traditional values, heritage, whilst also embracing the 
<br/>modern 
<br/>opportunities that are available to develop our country and make it attractive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry works in collaboration with the Department of Town and Country 
<br/>Planning in ensuring that its leases are in alignment with the Department’s land zoning system.  The 
<br/>Town Planning Act is a guide or a checking tool for sustainable development and further, the Ministry 
<br/>also consults with the Land Use Division of the Ministry of Agriculture regarding the highest and the 
<br/></span><span>best use of all of its agricultural leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, having to consult the Ministry of Agriculture, also allows the Ministry to issue 
<br/>the most suitable commodity for our agricultural leases, for example, identifying whether the land is 
<br/>good  for  grazing,  rice,  ginger  farming,  et  cetera.  However,  for  all  leases  issued,  there  are  lease 
<br/>conditions which must be adhered to. If a lessee does not follow these lease conditions, there are 
<br/>penalties and implications and quite possibly, the last resort would be re-entry and cancellation of  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Ministry had been working in collaboration with the Department of Town 
<br/>and Country Planning on its State Land Use Master Plan along the Western corridor which should 
<br/>be finalised in this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the Ministry is currently reviewing its Mining Act 1965 and the State Lands Act 1945, 
<br/>together with the recent Land Use Act 2010 where we anticipate integrating sustainable development 
<br/>on all State land, minerals and, of course, one of Fiji’s best buys - groundwater resources. The review 
<br/>seeks  to  strengthen  and  improve  on  aspects  of  how  best  we  could  attempt  environmental 
<br/>management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  finally,  there  are  discussions  on  the  need  to  formulate  a  National  Land  Use 
<br/>Policy  for  Fiji,  incorporating  the  three  major  land  tenure  -  State,  iTaukei  and  freehold  land.    We 
<br/>understand that this will be a very huge exercise where we will require the services and assistance of 
<br/>those other various relevant Government Ministries and institutions.  But nothing is impossible if we 
<br/>combine our resources for a united course. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the benefit of our future generation and to also leave this world better than how we found 
<br/>it, the Ministry is committed to have this policy in place. I borrowed that off from the motto of the 
<br/>Adi Cakobau School.  This will ensure, Mr. Speaker, that we are developing  holistically, and our 
<br/>strategy  encompasses  both,  environmental  protection  as  well  as  economic  advancement  of  our 
<br/>beloved home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I must  thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>reply.  It brought some glimmer of hope, particularly, in some of the projects that have been probably 
<br/>on the list for quite a while. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We fully understand the challenges, particularly, when you deal with extractive industries in 
<br/>trying to balance the environmental issues together with social and economic benefits.  The simple 
<br/>question to the honourable Minister is, what is the progress on Namosi?  It is in the interest of the 
<br/>country and, hopefully, if the issues are resolved, that this can proceed. What is the possibility of it 
<br/>being graduating from an exploration to a mining, should all the conditions are met?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, for Namosi, we are almost at the tail end of the 
<br/>decision-making process on the renewal. There is only one outstanding matter that we are going to 
<br/>be attending to the week after next and after that, a decision will be made by my office on the renewal  
<br/>of the Namosi Special Prospecting Licence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question, this is  on mangroves, 
<br/>honourable Minister.  There is a decreasing acreage in our mangroves, and I think there is a study to 
<br/>show that where there were mangroves, that has disappeared and the </span><span>i qoliqoli</span><span> adjacent to it becomes 
<br/>barren.  I am just wondering whether we are slowing it down somehow, given the the biodiversity 
<br/>protection? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as mangroves and mangrove plans are 
<br/></span><span>concerned,  in  every  foreshore  development  lease  that  is  issued  by  the  Ministry  and  if  it  affects 
<br/>mangroves on the foreshore, there is always a plan.  If those mangroves are required for development 
<br/>to be removed, then the plan is that they will plant more than the equal number of mangroves that 
<br/>they remove either in the nearby area or in the area that is approved and agreed to by those traditional 
<br/>landowners or freehold landowners that are within the vicinity.  So, there is always a concerted effort 
<br/>now, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that our acreage of mangroves are not lost.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the development of the Mangrove Policy, I think in the future, we are going to have a 
<br/>very  a  cohesive  and  detailed  plan  that  can  be  easily  executed  by  all  the  Government  Ministries.  
<br/>However, I can assure the Parliament that from the viewpoint of the Ministry as well as the Ministry 
<br/>of Fisheries and Forestry, we are working together to ensure that the standing mangroves of Fisheries 
<br/>and Forestry, we are working together to ensure that the standing mangroves of our country are not 
<br/>less than what it is now, and we will need to improve and increase that in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Honourable Minister, going back to the question on the balancing 
<br/>of land use, the economic growth and the environmental protection right in the initial question, we 
<br/>see this in every areas - in mining, agriculture, forestry and even commercial activities.  My question 
<br/>is, are you going to come up with this overarching policy that looks after all the areas?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know that you mentioned something about ginger farmers maybe cutting down the forest 
<br/>and all those kind of work.  Then we have on the other side, the environment was supposed to be 
<br/>coming in to give guide on how to protect our forest.  That is the question that I want to ask, if you 
<br/>have  or  are  planning  to  get  this  overarching  policy  that  covers  every  area  of  land  use  to  balance 
<br/>environmental protection and economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  talked  about  it  in  the  morning  with 
<br/>honourable Tuinaceva.  He spoke about his own experience of leasing a piece of land and that land 
<br/>is identified as agricultural.  It has standing trees, so because his need is to plant ginger, they had to 
<br/>uproot everything that is on that piece of land.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What happened is after that, they have lost the birds that usually sing to them in the early 
<br/>mornings, but that is the price that I think is usually paid when such developments are undertaken 
<br/>without  the  consideration  of  what  else  would  cost  the  local  environment  and  how  that  can  be 
<br/>sustained. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the important part that has been raised by the honourable Tuinaceva is for Government 
<br/>to find how we can provide for a coordinated inter-governmental environment preservation scheme 
<br/>that  would,  for  example,  permit  our  Ministry,  Ministry  for  Climate  Change  and  Environment, 
<br/>Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, to better coordinate land use so that whilst we have land made 
<br/>available for economic advancement, we do not totally lose the environmental aspects of our own 
<br/>local villages and towns.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Given the dismal performance of Team Fiji in the last three Pacific Games, can the 
<br/>honourable Minister for  Youth and Sports inform  Parliament on the plans to  improve and 
<br/>elevate Fiji’s performance in the next Pacific Games? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Naivalurua for his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, reference to the question raised by the honourable Member, the results at 
<br/>the  Pacific  Games  very  much  depends  on  the  performance  of  the  individual  sports  competed. 
<br/>Government can only assist with funding allocated to each sport who applies for the development 
<br/>and travel to international events.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly, Sir, the results at the last Pacific Games was considerably down, so as the previous  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>two Games as well.  From the latest we had in the Solomons Islands in 2023, we had 21 Gold, 30 
<br/>Silver and 40 Bronze.  In 2019, in Samoa, there were 35 Gold, 38 Silver and 43 Bronze.  In 2015 in 
<br/>Papua New Guinea, we had 33 Gold, 45 Silver and 37 Bronze.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In those same years, funding provided for the preparation and participation at the Games in 
<br/>2023, the latest one we had in the Solomons, it was $1.04 million. In 2019, we spent $364,483 and 
<br/>in 2015, it was $749,444. These funding figures do not include grants given for the development and 
<br/>preparation in the years leading up to the Pacific Games. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the funding provided for the last Games was substantially higher than that 
<br/>provided to the previous Games, so it indicates that funding is not the problem. We are working with 
<br/>Fiji National Sports Commission to identify how we can better develop and equip our athletes for 
<br/>international competition, but it still relies on the talents available to work with, and the National 
<br/>Sporting Organisation’s (NSO) Development and Strategic Plans for athlete development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  moving  forward,  in  terms  of  elite  athlete  development,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Youth and Sports, as part of its Strategic Plan, is to review the Fiji National Sports Commission to 
<br/>ensure  that  it  is  strengthened  in  terms  of  its  role  in  NSO  development  and  also  establish  the  Fiji 
<br/>Institute of Sports for the management and development of elite athletes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, currently we are going  through the budget  submission  process  and with 
<br/>request  from  NSOs  received,  we  are  asking  Government  this  year  for  an  overall  grant  of  $17.6 
<br/>million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question; given the importance of 
<br/>sports  in  a  nation  like  Fiji,  it  not  only  adds  value  to  the  economy  and  likewise  in  international 
<br/>relationship as a foreign policy tool to bring about good relationship and we benefit from dividends 
<br/>through this relationship.  Can we consider, as part of the strategies in improving our sports standards 
<br/>today, on a foreign policy relationship through sports diplomacy that we can have as co-operation to 
<br/>bring  about  more  funding,  explore  more  on  those  that  are  willing  to  help  that  can  improve  our 
<br/>standard and performance, not only at the national level, but over and beyond?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, before you reply to that question, I just want to add 
<br/>a bit more, especially on the interest here on how it affects the rural people.  We had one good athlete 
<br/>from Tavua lately, he has been doing really well.  Apart from that, we have two gold medallist here 
<br/>- the honourable Prime Minister and the honourable Leader of the Opposition, in athletics.  So really 
<br/>that kind of question needs to be taken at a much more deeper level so we can get the best out of it. 
<br/>How have we not been doing well? That was the first question that was raised.  Now, honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua is looking at the funding of this through international relations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we appreciate that supplementary question.  Yes, 
<br/>sports is an investment, there is no doubt about that.  We appreciate the input put in by the honourable 
<br/>Member and we would love to pursue that with other countries where we can establish partnership 
<br/>with them and how we can develop our local talents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you know, Mr. Speaker, sports has become a pathway for our youth, especially in the rural 
<br/></span><span>and outer islands, to be able to play in the international arena and earn a living for themselves.  Sports 
<br/>has become a very crucial part of our economy with what our players in overseas have been sending 
<br/>to  their  relatives  in  Fiji  through  remittances.    So,  sports,  in  totality,  is  something  that  we  cannot 
<br/>ignore.  As I had mentioned in my submission, for the latest Pacific Games at the Solomon Islands, 
<br/>the  Government  did  put  in  $1.04  million,  so  we will  continue  to  support sports  from  this  side  in 
<br/>whatever way possible to lift the standard of the games and to empower our athletes.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>467 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have mentioned that we are looking at reviewing the role of Fiji National Sports Commission  
<br/>and the possibility of introducing a Fiji Institute of Sports where our elite players or athletes can go 
<br/>through,  they  are  nurtured  and  developed  for  international  competition.    Our  players  become 
<br/>marketable overseas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  according  to  the  former  Prime  Minister,  I 
<br/>switched sports once I got married from athletics to sumo.  My simple question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister is participation in minor sports.  There is so much focus on the main sports like rugby and 
<br/>football, but these minor sports are something that used to bring Fiji a lot of gold and particularly, 
<br/>when it comes to individual sports as well because it helps in building the character and personality 
<br/>of individuals. A best place to start with this is probably in our schools.  In that plan, what is there 
<br/>between  the  Fiji  Sports  Council  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  promoting  these  minor  sports 
<br/>starting from school? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir , I had mentioned about the Fiji Institute of Sports.  
<br/>It is one area where we can identify athletes at a very young age, when they are still in schools.  The 
<br/>question we always ask every year is, where do our athletes go to when they finish from the Coca 
<br/>Cola Games?  We are about to witness another Coca Cola Games this year, there is no pathway for 
<br/>them, a place where we can nurture these athletes and prepare them for international duties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji  Institute of Sports will be a better way where  they  can work with Fiji Secondary 
<br/>Schools and identify talents, while the athletes are still in school.  We can develop those who have 
<br/>talents in sports and put them through the Fiji Institute of Sports.  Yes, for minor sports, it may be a 
<br/>minor sport in Fiji but it is a major sport in other countries, for example, surfing.  We are trying to 
<br/>introduce surfing in the Lau Group of Islands, and swimming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- Sumo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- We are also trying to revive boxing for those in the interior of Fiji, in 
<br/>Bukuya and Navosa.  Those were places that were well known for boxing before.  Yes, we are also 
<br/>looking at minor sports to be developed further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Nabukalou Creek was used by the Government 
<br/>for  some  hilarious  illustration  yesterday,  which  in  my  view,  is  a  disgrace  to  the  MSMEs  kiosk 
<br/>operators who are operating along that Creek and also Tui Suva and the </span><span>Vanua</span><span> </span><span>o Nadonumai</span><span>, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Works who is a distinguished chief of Rewa and also the honourable Minister 
<br/>for  Local  Government,  looking  after  the  Suva  City  Council  and  the  honourable  Prime  Minister 
<br/>himself as the Minister for Environment.  It has been 16 months now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My supplementary question is, the Government has spent $1.9 million for the new running 
<br/>track at the HFC Stadium, which was officially re-launched by the honourable Prime Minister last 
<br/>month.  We are now advised that the new track is  already lifting and showing damage.   Can the 
<br/>honourable Minister, please, advise Parliament what is happening here and when is the CEO going 
<br/></span><span>to be appointed to the Fiji Sports Council to ensure proper governance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that is a new question. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Minister is very good at this.  He is a former Ratu Kadavulevu student.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is good in playing rugby, like he used to do in his village in Vitogo. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  housekeeping  issue,  honourable  Members,  and  for  the  purpose  of  complying  with 
<br/>Standing  Orders  with  respect  to  sitting  times,  I  now  call  upon  the  Leader  of  the  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament to move his motion.
