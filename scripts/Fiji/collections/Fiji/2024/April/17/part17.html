<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - NATIONAL FIRE AUTHORITY 2016 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  review  of  the  National  Fire  Authority  2016  Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report for the seven months period ending 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>482 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  The  National  Fire  Authority  (NFA)  provides  firefighting, 
<br/>road accident rescue, urban search and rescue, HAZMAT, natural disaster management, flood and 
<br/>swift water rescue and emergency ambulance services to protect life, property and the environment. 
<br/>Its  core  strength  is  a  service  delivery  model  that  ensures  shared  responsibility  with  various 
<br/>communities to minimise the likelihood and consequences of emergencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the pace of change in NFA’s environment, both internal and external, is 
<br/>increasingly significant presenting both, challenges and opportunities.  These changes will impact on 
<br/>Fiji’s communities and will challenge the traditional way that NFA delivers programmes, products 
<br/>and services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the period under review, NFA continued to achieve targets, as followss: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted that as at 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016, the total income for NFA increased to a totalling 
<br/>amount of $8.1 million.  This was attributed from the increased fire insurance levies, the 
<br/>water levies, structural fire safety compliance earnings and receipt of Government grant 
<br/>and ambulance operating grant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  NFA’s  emergency  incident  response  for  the  period,  totalled  up  to  2,884.  These 
<br/>emergency incident responses are from property fires, bush fires, malicious fires, vehicle 
<br/>fires, ship and boat fires, road accident rescue, private fire alarms, swift water rescue and 
<br/>emergency ambulance services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee highlighted a few findings and recommendations: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee notes the increased number of structural property fires and high level of 
<br/>grass,  bush  and  cane  fires,  as  this  is  still  a  growing  concern  and  that  response  time  to 
<br/>incident sites is still lacking as notification to NFA are delayed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  NFA  continues  to  build  on  its  community  outreach 
<br/>programmes  with  rural  and  urban  communities,  agencies  responsible  for  housing 
<br/>development, and other relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  notes  that  NFA  needs  to  establish  a  training  academy  to  capitalise  on 
<br/>capacity building, not only for Fiji but for the region as a whole.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/>before I offer the floor, I have a list of speakers that have been confirmed by the relevant Whips, as 
<br/>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable N.T. Tuinaceva; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable K.K. Lal; and 
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister  and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to this debate on the Review 
<br/>Report of the National Fire Authority Annual Report for the seven months period ended 31st July, 
<br/>2016, that is before Parliament.  Firstly, I want to congratulate the Committee for putting the report 
<br/>together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="58">Page 58</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>483 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Committee’s recommendation Item 4.2 it states that NFA to continue its community 
<br/>outreach programmes in both rural and urban areas.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation was for 
<br/>a report submitted seven years ago but to my view, it is valid and pertinent, and I do support the 
<br/>recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reason,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  has  been  grappling  with  fire  incidents.  In  a  NFA 
<br/>Consolidated Report on Structural and Small Fires which damaged or destroyed buildings including 
<br/>homes, it proclaims that in 2016, there was a total of 330 fires.  It was the same number in 2017; in 
<br/>2018, there was a total of 337 fires; in 2019, there were 310 fires; in 2020, there were 278 fires; in 
<br/>2021, 125 fires; in 2022, 323 fires; and in 2023, a total of 358 fires. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there was a media report stating that in the month of January and February 
<br/>2024, there were 29 cases reported. At one point, a few months ago, 30 people were left homeless in 
<br/>nine fire incidents that occurred within 10 days.  We have even reached a stage of having four fires 
<br/>in less than 24 hours and 10 home fires in seven days.  In fact, according to the figures, 2023 was the 
<br/>worst in 10 years.  For this year (2024) between January to March, we have a total of 62 fires. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the pattern emerging is strongly suggesting that we will surpass the 2023 figure 
<br/>if NFA is not going to lift their campaign and awareness work.  This is why I am saying that I strongly 
<br/>support  the  Committee’s  recommendation.    Just  like  road  safety  when  we  say  it  is  everyone’s 
<br/>business, the same goes for fire safety, it is everyone’s responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to educate people on the better understanding of fire, its destructive impacts and the 
<br/>preventative  procedures  needed.  I  understand  that  NFA  has  developed  and  delivers  a  range  of 
<br/>community  initiatives  to  educate  people  on  the  prevention  of  potential  fire  hazards  and  how  to 
<br/>manage and control fires at the early stages. The whole purpose is to minimise damage and protect 
<br/>lives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, according to NFA, around 40 percent structural fires are attributed to electric 
<br/>faults. It becomes the major cause of fire in Fiji, and that is alarming.  This basically changes the 
<br/>whole fire incident dynamics and calls for a different level of awareness. Fiji is about 90 percent 
<br/>electricity access, therefore, increasing our vulnerability to fire on structures due to electric fault if 
<br/>standards are not met.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  NFA  has  to  closely  work  with  EFL  and  other  agencies  that  are  involved  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>structural wiring work on practices and procedures that strictly ensures fire safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, under the key findings, Item 3.2, the Committee commented on NFA’s response 
<br/>time, asserting that it is still lacking as notification to NFA is a delay. That is unacceptable and we 
<br/>cannot afford that kind of retard in the NFA system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, it can take 17 minutes for a fire to consume the entire structure of an average 
<br/>home built 10 years ago. That is remarkably a long time, compared to today’s estimate time which is 
<br/>roughly about six minutes.  That is basically how quick a fire can just destroy or kill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question is, how long does it take a fire to extinguish?  Some reports are saying that, for 
<br/></span><span>example, a fully involved one-storey average framed structure can have a fire knockdown within 10 
<br/>minutes. It  all depends  on how quickly the Fire Department  can access  the fire and has adequate 
<br/>water supply to put that out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the response time to incident sites is very important.  I can only imagine the 
<br/>number of properties and lives saved if the response time was at its best.  The good news is that, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>484 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>between the period of 2013 to 2022 during the FijiFirst Government, NFA has expanded its operation. 
<br/>They  built  and  commissioned  new  fire  stations  in  Taveuni,  Korovou,  Korolevu,  Lami,  Nakasi, 
<br/>Seaqaqa, Savusavu and Nabouwalu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  NFA  also  purchased  several  second-hand  good  quality  vehicles  from 
<br/>Country Fire Authority in Australia. In addition, they also purchased two ladder firefighting trucks 
<br/>and  one  powerful  Scania  firefighting  truck  to  cover  the  increase  in  high-rise  buildings  in  Suva-
<br/>Nausori and Nadi-Lautoka corridor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  also  aware  that  NFA  is  in  the  process  of  purchasing  land  for  new  fire 
<br/>stations in Navua, Pacific Harbour, Korovisilou, Wainibuka,  Natadola, Navosa, Navakai and Tavua.  
<br/>All these, Sir, will improve response time in a big way and uplift NFA firefighting capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  NFA  will  need  to  expedite  the  latest  fire  software  which  can  help  them  to 
<br/>prepare for emergencies much better. It is a critical tool that can assist in reducing response time by 
<br/>optimising response through managing resources smartly, communicating more effectively, checking 
<br/>response time and preparing for emergencies and can response quickly and efficiently to response 
<br/>time and preparing for emergencies and can response quickly and efficiently to emergencies.  The 
<br/>importance of response time cannot be overstated.  If fire can be kept small, lives and properties can 
<br/>be protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  before  I  take  my  seat,  I  want  to  say  NFA  needs  funds  to  carry  out  the 
<br/>recommendations and address findings mentioned in the Report.  Most of their services now is a bit 
<br/>slow down and low, and they are struggling to cope.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, NFA is a life and property saving organisation and to be at the top of their 
<br/>role, they must be well resourced.   They need manpower who are well trained, specialised and are 
<br/>properly  remunerated.    They  need  the  right  tools  which  are  at  the  best  level  of  their  service  and 
<br/>technology to boost their performance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the leadership and the staff of NFA for the great 
<br/>work they have carried out over the years, despite the challenges faced – a broad and diversified role 
<br/>on their shoulders, but their commitment has been unwavering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with that being said, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this august Parliament this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government  takes  note  of  the  key  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs and also takes this opportunity to 
<br/>thank the Committee for doing a wonderful job and doing a thorough investigation, even undertaking 
<br/>visits to some of the Fire Stations around the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key issues identified by the Committee is the timely submission of annual reports.  
<br/></span><span>The  Ministry  had  highlighted  the  importance  of  this,  and  the  National  Fire  Authority  (NFA)  is 
<br/></span><span>currently working on annual accounts for 2018-2019.  The Office of the Auditor-General has also 
<br/>completed auditing of 2017-2018 annual accounts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Authority is targeting to complete the pending accounts for the years 2019-2020, 2020-
<br/>2021 and 2022-2023 by December 2024.  There is also a need for the Authority to continue to build 
<br/>on its community outreach programmes with rural and urban communities, as well as the agency on  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>485 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>responsible for housing development and other relevant stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA is committed to enhancing and expanding its community outreach 
<br/>programmes, particularly with the rural and urban communities, housing development agencies and 
<br/>other relevant stakeholders.  These programmes are designed to educate and empower communities 
<br/>to  prevent  fire  hazards  and  minimise  the  devastating  impact  of  fires,  thereby,  safeguarding  their 
<br/>homes, basic necessities and human lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  core  initiatives  undertaken  by  the  NFA  is  the  development  and  delivery  of 
<br/>community safety programmes and preventative initiatives.  These efforts aim to educate individuals 
<br/>and  communities  on  fire  prevention  measures  and  strategies  to  mitigate  fire-related  risks.  
<br/>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NFA conducts awareness campaigns in schools, delivering crucial 
<br/>messages on safety initiatives and the causes of fires, while also providing practical demonstrations 
<br/>on fire safety measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  NFA’s  Community  Fire  Warden  Programme  is  a  pivotal  initiative  scheduled  for 
<br/>implementation  across  1,193  villages  and  communities  during  the  five-year  training  period  from 
<br/>2021  to  2026.    The  Programme  entails  the  meticulous  selection  comprehensive  training  and 
<br/>certification of community Fire Wardens, ensuring that each community has capable individuals as 
<br/>Fire Wardens, trained to respond effectively to fire emergencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, progress has been made to-date with the completion of 11 community Fire 
<br/>Warden  Trainings  in  the  Western  Division,  nine  in  the  Central  Division  and  six  in  the  Northern 
<br/>Division.  I was so fortunate that one of the trainings was conducted in my own village about two 
<br/>weeks ago. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  also  imperative  to  emphasise  that  fire  safety  is  a  collective 
<br/>responsibility.  The NFA remains steadfast in its readiness to respond to fire incidents properly and 
<br/>offers invaluable service to homeowners and tenants on effective fire prevention measures and to 
<br/>safeguard their belongings and properties. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a need for the Authority to engage in public-private partnership.  The initiative 
<br/>to address housing needs for its officers in the three Divisions, I think, is one of the major challenges 
<br/>now for the Authority, which is the provision of accommodation for its officers and the Authority 
<br/>has been working in collaboration and consultation with the Ministry of Local Government to address 
<br/>housing needs for its officers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are projects  that are currently underway, the Taveuni  barracks for staff.  Therefore, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>housing needs are prioritised based on the place where the Fire Station is situated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  also  a  need  for  the  Authority  to  organise  training  for  its  officers  locally  and 
<br/>internationally for capacity building and specialised training and this area of NFA has programmes 
<br/>to train staff locally and internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  training  for  Fire  Fighters  applied  annually  for  the  year  2023-2024  and  in-house 
<br/></span><span>instructors undertake specialised training in Japan, Singapore, Jakarta and other agencies.  The local 
<br/></span><span>training on core operational activities are conducted daily for the duty crew in all Fire Stations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having  said  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  also  wish  to  take  this  time  to  thank  the  staff  and 
<br/>Management of the NFA for doing a wonderful job, fully dedicated to the call of the duty in ensuring 
<br/>that our properties are protected and also attending to some of the very important rescue operations 
<br/>around our country.

<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you  once  again,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  giving  me  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>motion and I fully support the motion before Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is good to have you back and I hope you are feeling 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today to support the commendable efforts of the National 
<br/>Fire Authority (NFA) as highlighted in the recent review conducted by the Standing Committee on 
<br/>Social Affairs in its Annual Report for the seven month period ended 31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2016. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  comprehensive  review,  not  only  celebrates  the  achievements  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>NFA, but also presents constructive insights for further enhancement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, NFA serves as a beacon of safety and security in our communities, tirelessly 
<br/>working to protect life, property and the environment.  Throughout the period under review, the NFA 
<br/>demonstrated unwavering commitment and dedication, despite facing challenges such as increased 
<br/>structural property fires and delays in response times.  The NFA remained steadfast in its mission, 
<br/>responding to emergencies with professionalism and efficiency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  testament  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  NFA’s  service  delivery  model 
<br/>which  ensures  shared  responsibility  with  various  communities  to  minimise  livelihood  and 
<br/>consequences of emergencies.  The NFA’s ability to adapt to changing environment and evolving 
<br/>challenges is commendable, reflecting its commitment to continuous improvement and innovation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  report  highlights  the  NFA’s  proactive  responses  to 
<br/>emergencies, particularly during the devastating effect of </span><span>TC Winston</span><span>.  Despite facing unprecedented 
<br/>challenges,  the  NFA  continued  to  provide  essential  services,  working  alongside  other  service 
<br/>providers to increase its duties between agencies and taking the lead role during major disasters.  Sir, 
<br/>this is the testament again to the NFA’s resilience and dedication to serving our nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, to its emergency response effort, the NFA also pursued capital projects aimed at 
<br/>enhancing its capabilities. The completion of the new Fire Stations in Korovou, Korolevu, Seaqaqa, 
<br/>Taveuni and Savusavu stands as a remarkable testament to the foresight and dedication of the former 
<br/>FijiFirst Government in ensuring equitable access to essential services across our nation’s diverse 
<br/>landscapes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  visionary  initiative,  not  only  underscores  the  former  Government’s 
<br/>unwavering  commitment  to  the  safety  and  wellbeing  of  every  Fijian,  but  also  exemplifies  its 
<br/>proactive approach to infrastructure development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through prudent investment, the former FijiFirst Government purchased and 
<br/>upgraded  new  equipment  and  facilities  at  these  five  Stations,  allocating  millions  of  dollars  to 
<br/>modernise our firefighting capabilities.  This strategic investment reflects the former Government’s 
<br/>responsiveness to the needs of its citizens and its ability to deliver tangible results that directly impact 
<br/>the lives of Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By prioritising the establishment of new Fire Stations, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and the acquisition 
<br/>of  the  state-of-the-art  equipment.  The  former  FijiFirst  Government  demonstrated  effective 
<br/>governance and leadership, fostering trust and confidence amongst Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this commitment to enhancing emergency response infrastructure, not only 
<br/>fulfils the Government’s mandate, but also provides essential services and strengthens its reputation 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="62">Page 62</a></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>487 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as a proactive and forward-thinking administration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, the establishment of new Fire Stations and the procurement of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>upgraded equipment and facilities carry significant economic implications for our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  bolstering  firefighting  capabilities,  the  former  FijiFirst  Government  has  created  job 
<br/>opportunities, stimulated local economies and attracted investments to communities in both, urban 
<br/>and rural areas.  Additionally, by mitigating the risk of fire related losses and property damages, these 
<br/>initiatives help safeguard investment, promotes stability and foster resilience, thus contributing to 
<br/>sustainable economic growth and prosperity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  investing  in  Fire  Stations  and  equipment  upgrades  across  various  region,  the  former 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government  has  demonstrated  its  commitment  to  leaving  no  one  behind,  regardless  of 
<br/>geographic location.  This inclusive approach strengthens the social fabric of our nation, fosters a 
<br/>sense of unity and security among all Fijians, and reinforces the Government’s mandate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  capital  grants  and  collaborative  initiatives,  the  Government  has 
<br/>demonstrated its commitment to ensuring that NFA remains at the forefront of emergency response 
<br/>and  disaster  management  efforts.    This  support  is  essential,  enabling  the  NFA  to  fulfil  its  vital 
<br/>mission.  Furthermore, I also urge for increased emphasis on fire safety education in our schools and 
<br/>universities, recognising the paramount importance of safeguarding the lives of our young children 
<br/>and adults.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  alarming  number  of  fires  occurring  last  year,  as  highlighted  by  honourable 
<br/>Tuinaceva, especially in our schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative that we prioritise fire drills 
<br/>and safety trainings to ensure preparedness and awareness among our young youth and students.  By 
<br/>instilling  fire  safety  practices  earlier  on,  we  can  empower  our  future  generations  to  respond 
<br/>effectively in the event of an emergency, potentially saving lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  encourage  the  NFA  to  explore  modern  techniques  and 
<br/>technologies  to  enhance  its  firefighting  capabilities.    From  advanced  firefighting  equipment  to 
<br/>innovative  fire  suppression  systems  and  adopting  modern  techniques  significantly,  improves  the 
<br/>efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, by embracing technological advancement, the NFA can stay at the forefront of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>firefighting innovation and better serve our communities in times of need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I urge all honourable Members of this august Chamber to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>acknowledge the commendable work of the NFA and support the Report that is before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to rise to provide my contributions 
<br/>on the debate of the Review of the National Fire Authority Annual Report for the seven months to 
<br/>July  2016.    Admittedly,  as  mentioned  by  previous  speakers,  the  Report  is  somewhat  outdated.  
<br/>However, Sir, my remarks would be more in terms of looking forward rather than opining on what 
<br/>is in the distant past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just to note some of the key findings and because I have had the 
<br/>pleasure and honour of interacting with the NFA of late, I, perhaps have an insight running in terms 
<br/>of some of the good things that are already happening at the NFA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key findings of the Committee, Mr. Speaker, was the concerns around the response 
<br/>time to an incident, which was found to be lacking, given notification delays.  I report with some

<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>17</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pleasure to Parliament today that I had the honour of being in their National Operations Centre less 
<br/>than a month ago, and they do have now very modern equipment, which actually allows them to start 
<br/>notifying and deploying services to the needy as soon as the calls come in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  actually  quite  at  an  international  standard,  I  do  note,  however,  that  there  were  some 
<br/>concerns raised just recently about the fire in Navuso but other than to say, Mr. Speaker, the systems 
<br/>that current NFA had that I saw in Suva, allows for oversight. When calls come in, they can actually 
<br/>issue instructions to the fire trucks on the ground, on situ to the fire, and they can call other parties 
<br/>on the way, like the Police, the medical ambulances, if need be, to actually provide comprehensive 
<br/>report. So, I thought that, that was a positive, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I thought just for the purposes of 
<br/>our discussions here today, that I highlight that as a positive for the NFA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is more an economic point of view and, that is, generally, 
<br/>when we create support services such as the NFA, I think those of us who lived in the 1970s can 
<br/>recall  that  in  the  1970s,  there  was  no  such  thing  as  the  Fire  Authority  and  it  was  a  very  small 
<br/>operation.  Since then, it has grown into a very large operation with quite a few stations across the 
<br/>country and I think, as a Government going forward, we will probably need to look at how…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  This  is  the  thing  with  the  other  side  of  Parliament,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker.  They set up big operations systems but do not think of the implications. Where will the 
<br/>funding come from?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of the Parliament, we are trying to think 
<br/>about how we can deploy user-pay. For example, at the moment, the NFA goes around and now does 
<br/>search and rescue for accidents all over Fiji. In doing that, they get no direct funds from anywhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are funds that are going towards Land Transport Authority.  Perhaps, some of that can 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be deployed to assist with the NFA’s good work in that area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is looking at the national fire levy.  We have a lot of 
<br/>buildings around the country and the question we need to ask is, is the fire levy adequate enough and 
<br/>can we not increase it to allow us to service better the fire services that our people need. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, those are some of the innovative things that this side of Parliament are thinking about, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  rather  than  creating,  sort  of,  kingdoms  if  you  like,  without  thinking  through  the 
<br/>implications and what it means to the national coffers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It is something like Nabukalou Creek again.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just looking at some of the futuristic things that the NFA, they now do have 
<br/>a strategic plan that incorporates Sustainable Development Goals and it is not worthy in terms of 
<br/></span><span>what they are trying to do in terms of integrated community approach which was alluded to by one 
<br/></span><span>of our fellow speakers, introducing community fire wardens in the communities to assist in the care 
<br/>of our people during fires.  I congratulate the NFA for that as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I think the discussions around a training centre is an interesting one, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  I think we all agree that should we find the right funding, maybe from some donor partners and 
<br/>institutes  that  serves  our  fire  authority  in  terms  of  providing  capacity  building  for  what  we  will

<div><span>Review Report – NFA 2016 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>489 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>become as the economy continues to grow on ever increasing  demand and imposition on the country 
<br/>in terms of servicing fires, the need to have very skilled fire wardens and fire officers is a necessity 
<br/>and we hope that in time, something can be done on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I do commend the Report by the Committee and I support the motion before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  honourable 
<br/>Members  who  have  contributed  to  the  debate  on  the  motion  before  Parliament.  Sir,  whilst  we 
<br/>acknowledge the previous Administration for extending the services of NFA, it is the duty of any 
<br/>Government of the day to continuously improve such services for the benefit of its citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I have no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I now intend to adjourn Parliament so we can have 
<br/>dinner and then when we return, we will try and look at the two pending motions before we complete 
<br/>the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.17 p.m.
