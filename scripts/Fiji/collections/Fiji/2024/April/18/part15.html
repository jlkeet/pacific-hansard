<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – ENERGY FIJI LIMITED 2021 AND 2022 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the followings: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 Annual Report which was tabled on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23</span><span>rd</span><span> November, 2023; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2022 Annual Report which was tabled on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>23rd November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs tabled 
<br/>its  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Energy  Fiji  Limited  2021  and  2022  Annual  Reports  in 
<br/>November 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  its  findings,  the  Committee  noted  that  Energy  Fiji  Limited  (EFL)  faced  unprecedented 
<br/>challenges  in  2021  due  to  COVID-19,  particularly  the  second  wave  of  the  pandemic  which 
<br/>significantly impacted EFL’s electricity demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted  and increase in  the number of domestic customers, benefiting from 
<br/>subsidies provided by EFL, especially after 2020, and acknowledges EFL for this initiative, given 
<br/>that several customers were affected by the pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While deliberating on the 2022 Annual Report, the Committee noted that EFL managed to 
<br/>make a healthy profit despite the various challenges and unforeseen expenses that it had to endure 
<br/>during the financial year, and commends the team at EFL for maintaining its financial soundness. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  considering  the  Government’s  commitment  to  climate  change,  the 
<br/>Committee noted that the 2021 Annual Report on the importance of EFL embarking on renewable 
<br/>energy  site  projects,  and  strongly  recommended  for  the  inclusion  of  key  stakeholders,  such  as 
<br/>landowners in their land acquisition process.  It also recommended that all efforts must be made to 
<br/>ensure that the pending Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is expedited to achieve the current targets 
<br/>for 100 percent renewable energy by 2036.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted in the 2022 Annual Report that EFL’s existing risk mitigation strategies 
<br/></span><span>provided substantial support to the company during the adverse impact of COVID-19.  This included 
<br/>strategies to address the disruption in EFL supply chain, and the minimising of the effects of rising 
<br/>fuel costs through its hedging programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It was noted with concern the damages to EFL’s infrastructure which occurred due to various 
<br/>reasons, such as motor vehicle accidents that damage power poles, overgrown vegetation clashing 
<br/>with powerlines, third party and damage to EFL underground cables and vandalism of EFL assets. 
<br/>The Committee urges members of the public to be mindful of EFL’s infrastructure to ensure that they 
<br/></span><span>continue receiving undisrupted electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee observed the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical 
<br/>aspects of EFL’s regulatory functions, such as the registration of licensed electricians and ensuring 
<br/>standard compliance is met.  In this regard the Committee recommended FCCC to recruit necessary 
<br/>expertise required to regulate the services of EFL.

<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While  deliberating  the  Committee  noted  a  slow  increase  in  the  use  of  solar  rooftop 
<br/>installations  and,  of  course,  encourages  the  use  of  solar-powered  products  by  domestic  and 
<br/>commercial customers as an alternative to reduce their dependence on fossil fuel in the 2021 Annual 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was made aware of EFL’s loss of 54 technical employees for greener pastures 
<br/>overseas.  Given that EFL is an essential service provider, it is imperative to further develop strategies 
<br/>to entice the technical employees from moving overseas.  Multiple renewal energy projects are in the 
<br/>pipeline at present, however, the Committee is concerned that our national targets to meet 100 precent 
<br/>renewable  energy  electricity  by  2036  might  not  be  achievable.    While  hearing  submissions  from 
<br/>various applicants who intended to invest in the renewable energy programmes, their applications 
<br/>were rejected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before I do offer the floor,  I have a list before me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of those who will be participating in the debate: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Jone Usamate; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, Environment, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises and Veteran Affairs; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable S.T. Koroilavesau;  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Strategic Planning, National 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Development and Statistics 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  first  of  all,  I  would  like  to  congratulate  the 
<br/>honourable Members of the Committee for the Report.  In short, I am quite pleased to see that despite 
<br/>all the kinds of difficulties that it faced, EFL has come through quite well, despite the damage to its 
<br/>property, the huge loss of technical staff and the kinds of damage that happens to it.  I have also 
<br/>noted, in particular, how they have been able to mitigate against the risks that they face, such things 
<br/>as the hedging programme, which I think that a lot of companies in Fiji can learn from, all of us can 
<br/>learn on how we can mitigate the risk that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in going through the reports, I have noticed the strong financial record of 
<br/>the EFL, the Action Management and the Grid Risk Management that they had, and I think in terms 
<br/>of their governance system, a great use of Committees in the Board.  I think this was a great example 
<br/>of seeing how this is taking place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the HR aspects of EFL, despite the fact that they lost quite a lot of staff, they seem 
<br/></span><span>to have a very good strong pipeline of making sure that they have people in place to be able to take 
<br/>care  of  the  kind  of  work  that  is  being  done  by  the  people  who  have  left.    They  have  ongoing 
<br/>recruitments, they also still have a strong apprenticeship scheme, I believe it is still operational, and 
<br/>they hire graduate engineers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  read  in  the  Report  that  they  had  implemented  a  succession  plan  for  all  positions  from 
<br/>Tradesman Team Leader to the CEO.  I think that is very admirable.  It shows that, we know that 
<br/>things are going to happen, but we do not just sit and cry about it, they identify high potential people 
<br/></span><span>and they have a programme to put them through, so if that person goes, there is someone who can 
<br/></span><span>take up the kind of role that the person who has left used to take.  So I think that is something that 
<br/>they need to be congratulated for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have also noted during COVID-19, we asked a lot of organisations in Fiji to pitch in and 
<br/>help residents of our country to get through COVID-19.  Looking through the Reports, I noticed that 
<br/>EFL’s contribution to the low income earner from April 2020 to March 2021 during COVID-19 was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>554 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>around $6.77 million.  This was the kind of assistance they gave to the people that they used their 
<br/>services.  So a very big </span><span>vinaka va levu</span><span> to EFL for what they have done in that area.  I noticed also 
<br/>with  appreciation  the  Rural  Electrification  Programme  that  has  been  funded  by  the  Government, 
<br/>where they extend the grid up to rural areas to care for rural dwellers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  our  time  in  government,  we  removed  the  requirements  to  pay  the  deposit  that 
<br/>communities had to pay before, but this has brought electricity to people out in the rural areas.  I 
<br/>think if there is one area for concern, and we get these complaints every now and then, is the delays 
<br/>in getting their electricity completed, whether it is putting up the poles or hooking up the electricity 
<br/>from the poles to each of the individual houses, that is the kind of complaint we get every now and 
<br/>then.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to speak to a few recommendations for both of the Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Report of 2021: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing the technical 
<br/>aspects  of  EFL’s  regulatory  functions  such  as  the  registration  of  licenced  electricians  and 
<br/>ensuring  compliance  with  standards.    The  Committee  recommends  for  FCCC  to  recruit 
<br/>necessary expertise to undertake the full range of regulatory functions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I totally endorse this particular recommendation, Sir.  At the moment EFL plays the role of a 
<br/>player and a referee at the same time.  It has been like that because in the past we did not have the 
<br/>technical expertise around the country to be able to separate out these roles, but in order to have any 
<br/>good governance in any sector, we need to be able to separate these roles; the role of the player and 
<br/>the role of the referee.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend this but I know it is not going to be easy to do because there is not a lot of these 
<br/>technical people around.  They will have to come up with some innovative ways of separating out 
<br/>the functions and still have access to technical expertise, whether it is from the private sector, whether 
<br/>it is from the institutes of higher learning, somehow that they can do that, but we need to move to 
<br/>that level where we separate out these two roles of player and referee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee noted that stakeholders such as the Department of Energy under the Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Public Works, EFL and FCCC need to have strong collaborations and recommends that 
<br/>there  be  clarity  in  their  functions  and  their  roles.    I  also  totally  endorse  this  particular 
<br/>recommendation.  The energy sector or the electricity sector which is part of the energy sector 
<br/>has  three  major  players.    EFL  is  the  provider,  FCCC  is  the  regulator,  the  Department  of 
<br/>Energy it seems to have a mix kind of roles.  One part of it is very operational, where it does 
<br/>the solar home systems, where it does the energy efficiencies, it identifies potential sites for 
<br/>hydro and wind power and the other part of it is more policy formulation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just  come up with  things like the National  Energy Policy. To my  mind, the establishing 
<br/></span><span>policy  should  be  something  that  always  should  sit  in  government,  policy  looking  forward  should 
<br/>always sit in government.  I think that role of policy setting for the sector as a whole needs to sit with 
<br/>the Department of Energy.  It is something that I talked to the department at that time that we need 
<br/>to build it up and I think moving forward, we need to strengthen this role where the Department of 
<br/>Energy  is  given  the  right  kind  of  people  so  that  they  can  sit  at  that  policy  role  looking  for  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>555 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>benchmarking around the world and deciding what the direction should be for the sector so that it is 
<br/>not led by the players.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is why, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse that particular recommendation.  I have not seen the 
<br/>final version of the National Energy Policy that has been approved by Cabinet unfortunately, but I 
<br/>am familiar with the 2021 version that has been together while I was there, which calls for a higher 
<br/>level  of  involvement  and  coordination  by  DOE  across  the  whole  energy  sector.    As  I  said,  the 
<br/>Government must keep the policy controlled to itself, can give up regulatory but the policy must be 
<br/>with the government, so it has oversight, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Report for Year 2022, I found one finding in particular which was 
<br/>of interest to me, Finding No. 5.  The Committee is aware that multiple renewable energy permits 
<br/>are in the pipeline at present, however the Committee is concerned that our national targets to ensure 
<br/>100 percent renewable electricity by 2036 might not be achievable.  That, I think should be a concern 
<br/>for all of us.  I will come back to talk about that particular finding because it appears again in one of 
<br/>the recommendations at the bottom. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 6: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends for EFL to raise awareness on the benefits of installing roof-top 
<br/>solar  plants  as  well  as  incentivise  such  initiatives.    I  would  propose  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance might look at ways in which we can incentivise our citizens to put solar 
<br/>panels onto their roofs so that we can reduce the amount of electricity we get out of fossil 
<br/>fuels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 7: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee is of the view that a detailed enquiry is needed in the energy sector to ensure 
<br/>EFL embark on attaining a 100 percent renewable energy by the Year 2030. You will notice 
<br/>that one part of the Report talks about 2036, the other part talks about 2030.  That is because 
<br/>one is quoting from the NDCs, the other was quoting from what National Climate Change 
<br/>Policy. But the thing is this, we as a country are one that fights for climate change.  It is very 
<br/>important  for  us  as  a  country  when  we  go  out  in  the  world  that  there  is  coherence  with 
<br/>everything that we say everywhere, there is also coherence between what we say on the global 
<br/>stage and what we do at home.  So, I think this is something that we really need get together 
<br/>with, if we are not going to hit 2030, I do not think it might be possible for us to hit 2030 
<br/></span><span>unless we get those Namosi hydros in very quickly; the three big ones that are still stalled for 
<br/></span><span>the time being. But if not, we need to shoot for 2036. How can we hit that target?  So, when 
<br/>we hit that target, we stand on a global stage and we talk about reducing emissions, we have 
<br/>done it here, by getting at least  our electricity 100 percent renewable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We already have a lot of things that we have put in place, the Low Emissions Development 
<br/>Strategy, the Maritime and Land Transport Strategy that talked about efficio vehicles, reducing fossil 
<br/>fuel consumption, National Adaptation Plan that looked at creating a long term resilient strategy for 
<br/>the  energy  sector  underpinned  by  Climate  Risk  Model  and  the  National  Climate  Change  Policy. 
<br/></span><span>Those are my recommendations from the Reports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last things that I will say, Mr, Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the extra minutes. I 
<br/>also  think  the  energy  sector  is  one  when  we  look  at  them  and  commit  this,  we  look  at  them  in 
<br/>isolation; we look at EFL, we look at Ministry of Works and other parties but we need a way in the 
<br/>Committees, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to look at the whole energy sector.  I think the honourable Leader of 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>556 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Opposition  was  talking  about  this  yesterday.  So,  that  will  also  be  one  thing  that  we  need  to 
<br/>consider.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,    honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  and  Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of 
<br/>Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>ni sa bula vinaka</span><span> and good afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for allowing me time-off this morning to be with my friends at 
<br/>the RSL Club remembering the events of 18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 1996 and we were joined later by the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Home Affairs who was also there at the time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Economic 
<br/>Affairs for the preparation of this Review Report of the Energy Fiji Limited 2021 and 2022 Annual 
<br/>Report.  As we are aware, Sir, the EFL is a vertically integrated company and honourable Usamate 
<br/>is concerned about players, referees all playing on the same side is because of that.  Power generation, 
<br/>transmission, distribution and retail of electricity in the large islands of Fiji, et cetera, they all one.  
<br/>That was not the original intention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  SVT/GVP  Government  had  lived  through  the  corporatisation,  privatisation  era  in  the 
<br/>world and one of those identified entities was FEA (now EFL).  It was supposed to be cut up into 
<br/>those  three  entities;  a  generation  enterprise,  distribution  enterprise  and  a  regulatory  body.    The 
<br/>successive government did not go that way, so we now have EFL and the way it is structured. The 
<br/>EFL is responsible for developing renewable energy projects to support Government’s goal to attain 
<br/>100 percent renewable energy.  The honourable Usamate mentioned two years - 2026 and 2030. Yes, 
<br/>we have those feature in our plans as well as the universal goal of sustainable development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hydroelectric sources are the major renewable energy generators for EFL. Given sufficient 
<br/>rainfall,  hydroelectric  generation  contributes  approximately  50  percent  to  60  percent  toward 
<br/>electricity generation by EFL.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, EFL has been consistent in providing return to the Government even during the COVID 
<br/>pandemic.  EFL developed a 10-year power development plan which highlights the project within 
<br/>the Green Energy Sector that aligns to the national objectives or providing electricity to every citizens 
<br/>in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  take  this  opportunity  to  thank  the  EFL  Board,  the 
<br/></span><span>management and staff for their continued hard work in progressing EFL.  I must apologise in advance, 
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, few of the recommendations made to these two reports are outdated and have been 
<br/>overtaken  by  events  and  progress  made  by  the  entity  in  question,  so  I  will  only  focus  on  the 
<br/>recommendations which are pending actions: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 1: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As honourable Usamate also noted, the need for FCCC to strengthen its role in overseeing 
<br/>the technical aspects of EFL regulatory functions such as registration of licenced electricians 
<br/></span><span>and  ensuring  compliance  with  the  standards.    The  Committee  recommends  for  FCCC  to 
<br/></span><span>recruit the necessary expertise to undertake the full range of regulatory functions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our response back, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that I am pleased to report that the FCCC now issues 
<br/>generation transmission and distribution and retail licences to operators in the energy sector and has 
<br/>absorbed  the  regulatory  functions  of  EFL  while  few  technical  functions  have  been  outsourced  to 
<br/>EFL. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, FCCC conducted public consultations on EFL proposal on 10</span><span>th</span><span> August, 2023 to 
<br/>raise  electricity  tariffs.    The  submission  was  declined  and  FCCC  deemed  that  direct  increase 
<br/>unsuitable at that point in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation 2: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  noted  with  concern  that  the  power  purchase  agreement  for  the  Agro 
<br/>photovoltaic project in Ovalau is yet to be signed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The response, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this agreement was signed on 27</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>outside the period of the report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may elaborate on various ongoing solar farm projects, a power purchase agreement has 
<br/>been signed with Sunergise Dratabu Pte. Limited for a 5MW solar power plant in Dratabu, Nadi.  
<br/>The power plant is expected to be commissioned in the fourth quarter of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>EFL  entered  into  a  financial  advisory  services  agreement  with  International  Finance 
<br/>Corporation (IFC) in September, 2020.  Three solar power plants in Nadi, Ba and Tavua with  an 
<br/>expected  collective  capacity  of  19MW  are  undergoing  due  diligence  by  the  IFC  and  we  will  be 
<br/>operated either by an independent power producer or via a joint venture with a development model. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>EFL is working with Chugoku Electric Power Company Limited through the Sevens  Pacific 
<br/>Pte. Limited a 44 percent shareholder in EFL to develop a 5MW solar power plant in Lautoka by 
<br/>2025.  IFC due diligence is also underway for a 10MW solar power plant in Seaqaqa, Vanua Levu 
<br/>which will have battery storage and after due diligence, tenders for the Independent Power Producer 
<br/>(IPP) or JV are expected to be called in 2024.  Feasibility studies are also underway for a solar power 
<br/>plant project in Labasa which was identified by a prospective IPP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>EFL, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is working with Envelops Company Limited, a South Korean IPP on 
<br/>4MW solar power plant in Ovalau.  The development of one megawatt solar power plant with battery 
<br/>storage  is  also  underway  in  Taveuni.  The  project  is  funded  by  Korea  International  Cooperation 
<br/>Agency (KOICA) and is expected to be completed in 2024. The EFL is working to ensure that 100 
<br/>percent renewable electricity target is achieved by 2036. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  strongly  recommends  the  inclusion  of  key  stakeholders  such  as  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landowners in the land acquisition process. The Committee’s recommendation is noted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my position, the Coalition’s position and as Minister for Public Enterprises, 
<br/>we must abide by our commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
<br/>Peoples (UNDRIP) and sadly after this sitting this afternoon, I will be joining my golfing colleagues 
<br/>to pay our last respect or </span><span>reguregu</span><span> to Ratu Napolioni Delasau of Nabubuco,  one of the champion 
<br/>landowners who had been trying to finalise the deal on their land in Monasavu. Unfortunately, the 
<br/>agreement we made before the Elections of 1999 have never been completed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure the other speaker from the Government side will complete the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response on the other recommendations before the end of this debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to make a short 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribution on the Review Report of Energy Fiji Limited 2021 – 2022 Annual Reports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members that have spoken before me have basically covered 
<br/>the recommendations that has been put in by the Committee. As a Member of the Committee, I would

<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>558 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to make my contributions on the findings and what we had look through during our examinations 
<br/>of the original report itself. Most of the recommendations have been stated by honourable Usamate 
<br/>and the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  provided  to  Parliament  by  the  Committee  as  findings  and 
<br/>recommendations to reflect the effort, the Committee dug deeper into EFL operations and see if the 
<br/>Committee can recommend some changes. The Economic Affairs Committee through the Chairman 
<br/>had  decided  to  play  a  more  active  scrutiny  and  oversight  role  in  the  agencies,  especially  on  the 
<br/>agencies that provide economic activities in Fiji and that affects Fijians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  EFL  provided  that  opportunity  and  we  are  looking  at  the  Sugar  Industry  and  its 
<br/>contribution to agriculture as a whole.  I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you are well aware of these efforts 
<br/>to  make  improvements  on  our  ability  to  contribute  to  the  improvement  of  this  industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee noted that the FCCC’s functions as has been alluded to by 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister and honourable Usamate has been deprived in its checkoff. I think to 
<br/>enlighten Parliament on that, I think I would go back to the background on the appointment of FCCC 
<br/>as the regulator in September 2019 when the Electricity Act was gazetted. However, EFL had signed 
<br/>an MOA with FCCC to continue to carry out certain regulatory functions until further notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the dilemma that had been forced on EFL as part of FCCC. While 
<br/>FCCC is the regulator, EFL still does not see because it has the technical expertise to oversee this 
<br/>regulatory function.  I urge the honourable Minister for Public Works to have a look at this because 
<br/>the Department of Energy within the Ministry of Public Works has the Director that oversees this 
<br/>function.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we found that EFL is on a different footing in comparison to our national 
<br/>commitment on energy sector.  We called EFL to tell us, what is their commitment towards renewable 
<br/>energy?  We found out the difference between our national target and the target set by EFL itself.  
<br/>We have highlighted to them that they must align themselves to our national target - a total of 100 
<br/>percent by 2036, and we hope that they will come online on that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  believes  that  a  comprehensive  inquiry  is  required  on  energy  as  a  whole, 
<br/>especially the renewable energy sector.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the reason I am saying this is that, there 
<br/>have been efforts by international companies to establish solar farms in Fiji but it seems that EFL 
<br/></span><span>needs position to protect itself so as a sole provider of electricity in Fiji, it has always denied this 
<br/></span><span>opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  has  suggested  that  with  the  partnership  with  the 
<br/>landowners, they will be able to develop this and then provide the energy into the main grid for it to 
<br/>be distributed to consumers. I think in the Western side, they have been a lot of effort by landowners 
<br/>to give their land for solar farms.  My view is this, EFL owns the assets - they own the post, they 
<br/>own the lines, they can rent into new investors that come in at an affordable rate that will allow the 
<br/>investor to generate electricity and sell it off to EFL so that the whole population of Fiji derives the 
<br/></span><span>benefit of cheaper electricity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  will  leave  it  there,  that  is  basically  what  Mr.  Chairman  had 
<br/>delegated and thought that we should side track and have dig deeper in why this monopolised industry 
<br/>should be allowed to carry on to the detriment of the people of Fiji.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister and

<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>other honourable Members who have spoken before me.  The honourable Prime Minister gave a good 
<br/>account of some of the recommendations - the way in which EFL has placed itself in dealing with 
<br/>the whole energy issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I heard from honourable Koroilavesau and honourable Usamate was quite interesting.  
<br/>I think a lot of what they have said we agree.  On this side of Parliament, as a Government, we are 
<br/>deeply committed to addressing some of those concerns and moving ahead, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 
<br/>plans to ensure that we achieve those targets, not only in terms of affordable energy, but also moving 
<br/>away from over reliance on fossil fuel to more renewable sources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The economics of decarbonisation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where earlier on we talked about carbon 
<br/>emissions trading and you raised some very intelligent questions about what it involves, because a 
<br/>lot of people do not seem to understand that.  But before I talk about the two other recommendations, 
<br/>let me just remind the honourable Members of this Parliament, particularly, the honourable Members 
<br/>on the other side who were in the Government in 2021, the Government at that time entered into a 
<br/>share  sale  agreement  with  Sevens  Pacific  Pte  limited,  which  is  a  consortium  owned  by  Chugoku 
<br/>Electric  Power  Company  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Corporation  to  acquire  44  percent  of 
<br/>shareholding in the EFL.  So, the consortium acquired 44 percent of the shares in the EFL, acquiring 
<br/>24 percent from Government and 20 percent from FNPF.  In fact, we are now wondering, why would 
<br/>even FNPF at that point in time want to sell its 20 percent shares to this company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> From foreign investor point of view, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it makes sense.  We could say that, 
<br/>that is a signal that we provide to foreign investors, but the fact is that, EFL is no longer governed 
<br/>under the Public Enterprises Act.  It is no longer a Public Enterprise.  It is a private company governed 
<br/>by the Companies Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we talk about what honourable Usamate and honourable Koroilavesau talked about, 
<br/>the synergy - the difference between what is our national priority, what the Government wants to do 
<br/>in terms of energy policy, what the company and EFL wants to do.  In fact, the Government still has 
<br/>majority Board members, but Chugoku Electric has three Board members as well.  For any private 
<br/>shareholder, the motive, the overwhelming objective, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is to make profit.  
<br/>So, having said that, I think it is important for honourable Members to understand where we are in 
<br/>terms of what was done in the past with respect to the sale of shares.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we as a Government, the Department of Energy and a number 
<br/>of priorities that the Government has articulated to the EFL Board, we have a new chairman, we have 
<br/></span><span>a very competent Board and we are confident that the Board is bringing together the expertise of the 
<br/></span><span>private company that owns 44 percent of the shares, that we would be able to move ahead as part of 
<br/>our national strategy and national objective in not only moving away from over reliance on fossil 
<br/>fuel  to  more  renewable  sources  of  energy,  but  also  make  sure  that  the  energy  that  is  available  is 
<br/>affordable, not only to our ordinary citizens, but also to our investors and those in the business sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Recommendation 4, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee recommends for EFL to explore 
<br/>avenues  through  which  solar  roof  installation  can  increase  at  a  rapid  pace.    I  know,  honourable 
<br/>Usamate talked about incentives, so let me give you some figures.  In fact, I think people themselves 
<br/></span><span>are moving away from the idea of just relying on the electricity supply from the EFL to rooftop solar.  
<br/></span><span>In fact, the EFL Grid rose from 174 in 2020 to 225 in 2023, a growth rate of about 29 percent.  The 
<br/>issue of existing  Government support and funding initiatives, the Government provides financial 
<br/>support, Mr. Speaker, Sir, towards household having a combined income of less than $30,000 by 
<br/>contributing  about  16.34  cents  per  unit  VEP  for  first  100  units  consumed  in  a  month  by  such 
<br/>households.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – EFL 2021 &amp; 2022 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>560 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also for primary and secondary schools, what we call a ‘step up subsidy’ is in place where 
<br/>first 200 units consumed in a month are subsidy at a rate of 12.85 cents per unit VEP with the school 
<br/>contributing the remaining 21.16 cents per unit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the roles of the Department of Energy, FCCC and EFL and their ability to 
<br/>align their policies and strategies to  ensure that it meets both the regulatory as well as the policy 
<br/>imperatives of Government is something that we, as a Government, would ensure that the Board and 
<br/>Government representatives of the Board are able to move this forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to thank the former Chairman 
<br/>of the EFL  -  Mr.  Daksesh Patel, and all the Board members who were there  and as stated by all 
<br/>honourable Members before, despite the decrease in  the sales during COVID-19 in  2021  and the 
<br/>contribution that EFL made to consumers or households during COVID-19, it shows that EFL was 
<br/>in good hands at that point in time,  it is in good hands now and the Government is going to work 
<br/>with the new Board Chairman and the Management of EFL to make sure that our national objectives 
<br/>of Energy Policy would be achieved by targets set by the Government.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think most of honourable Members have extensively 
<br/>covered most of the recommendations. I just want to highlight one area which has been highlighted 
<br/>by honourable Koroilavesau, the need to have a thorough inquiry at the energy sector.  Of course, the 
<br/>Committee had written to the Secretariat so that we do not to go ahead with  the recommendation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also has been highlighted by honourable Usamate and honourable Professor Prasad on the 
<br/>non-alignment of EFL to national targets.  From our view and, of course, the Committee this has to 
<br/>be intensified and accelerated to ensure that they achieve at the national targets that the Government 
<br/>has established for them not to achieve.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the honourable Members for their comments, and I support the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  thank  you  for  those  comments  and  I  think  if  only  we  bear  with  the 
<br/>workload that we have here with  the Secretariat   and once we get  the role of the Committees on 
<br/>oversight and scrutiny to be better addressed, especially by the proposal to set up sub-committees 
<br/>under existing Standing Orders, then that should be able address what you have stated, Mr. Chairman. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I intend to adjourn Parliament now for afternoon tea. When we return, we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just try and complete the remaining motion that is still before us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 4.40pm
