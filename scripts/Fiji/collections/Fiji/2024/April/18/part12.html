<div><span>Housing Rehabilitation Assistance – </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>
<br/>(Question No. 30/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>Housing Rehabilitation Assistance provided to landowners through the Fiji Pine Trust after 
<br/>the devastation caused by </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his  question 
<br/>regarding the Housing Rehabilitation Assistance provided to the landowners through the Fiji Pine 
<br/>Trust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  close  collaboration  between  the  Government  and  non-governmental 
<br/></span><span>organisations and the communities is crucially important in the effort of rebuilding homes and lives 
<br/></span><span>during trying times after a severe natural disaster, like we faced after </span><span>TC Yasa.</span><span> The outcome of what 
<br/>was  achieved  during  the  rehabilitation  programme  was  a  result  of  united  effort  by  Government 
<br/>through  the  Ministry  of Forestry,  the  Ministry  of  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  National 
<br/>Disaster  Management  and  NGOs  where  each  party  had  respective  critical  roles  to  play  in  their 
<br/>rebuilding of lives and livelihoods of the affected communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and  key  stakeholders  in  the  Forestry  Sector 
<br/>undertook the lead role in housing rehabilitation in the Northern Division, collaborating with the Fiji 
<br/></span><span>Pine Group of Companies in assisting pine landowners in Cakaudrove, Bua and Macuata Provinces 
<br/></span><span>to  rebuild their homes. With the support of the Fiji  Pine Limited and Fiji  Hardwood Corporation 
<br/>Limited (FHCL), the forestry stakeholders were able to repurpose timber from trees felled during the 
<br/>recent series of cyclones and have them ready to rehabilitate the homes that were damaged by the 
<br/>cyclone.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The collective effort from the forestry stakeholders have now seen about 17 houses rebuilt, 
<br/>ripped and sawn for the village of Cogea from trees given by FHCL through the Ministry of Rural 
<br/>Development, who was the leading agency in that work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government had targeted to rebuild 70 houses in Cogea and Nabavatu but the progress 
<br/>in achieving these numbers was stalled due to the proposal of the previous Government to rebuild 
<br/>both homes in concrete material suitable to withstand Category 5 cyclones. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Forestry  have  since  had  a  home  built  at  our  Training  Centre  in  Nasinu 
<br/>certified by MOIT last week to withstand Category 5 cyclones. This is the model that we use in the 
<br/>Northern and Maritime communities’ rehabilitation work given that we have the resources readily 
<br/>available to carry out this work at limited cost to affected communities and doing so empower and 
<br/>upskill these communities to become self-reliable and sustainable during this time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Specifically, Fiji Pine Limited and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited supply both pines and 
<br/>mahogany, timber, and associated housing materials while the Ministry of Forestry provides portable 
<br/>sawmills and carpenters. In addition to providing its staff to operate the sawmill, the Ministry also 
<br/>trains the communities to assist and on occasion to actually mill timber themselves. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  further  supported  the  initiative  by  training  and 
<br/>certifying 28 carpenters and 20 portable sawmill operators. Through this training, the Ministry also 
<br/>supplied  framing  materials  processed  through  the  portable  sawmill  for  at  least  250  houses.  This 
<br/>assistance  provided  much  needed  relief  to  the  villages  in  these  three  provinces  of  Vanua  Levu 
<br/>following </span><span>TC Yasa.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  mentioned  before,  lesson  learnt  during  the  past,  the 
<br/>Ministry has received requests and constructed a Category 5 model house which has been inspected 
<br/>by the Ministry of Infrastructure and has now been certified. The Ministry will be conducting training 
<br/>on this model house and requests are already coming in: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Kumi - 20 houses; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Nameka - 15 houses; and   
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Gau  - 1 house.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  through  the  Ministry  of  Forestry,  and  its 
<br/>consultation  with  other  agencies  will  continue  to  provide  practical  and  capable  solutions  for  our 
<br/></span><span>maritime communities. There are much bigger plans in our next budget to support provisions of jetty 
<br/></span><span>for Muani in Kadavu, Lovu in Gau, Narocake Pine Scheme and Wainiyabia in Lakeba.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will ensure ease of transportation of pine logs and timbers from these 
<br/>pine schemes to others close by. These jetties will allow the barge to access more resource owners 
<br/>and support growing in other parts of these maritime islands apart from the areas where the current 
<br/>jetty exists.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing rehabilitation assistance is currently undertaken directly and indirectly through three 
<br/></span><span>different  agencies.  The  Ministry  of  Forestry  across  Fiji  and  Fiji  Pine  Trust  for  49  plant  schemes 
<br/></span><span>including those on maritime islands and Fiji Pine Limited for Fiji Pine lease landowning units with 
<br/>over 126 villages.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Pine Group has assisted in re-building 85by purchasing building materials funded 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through the 70 percent project entitlement and dividend from the Forest Trust levies.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  housing  rehabilitation  in  the  North  is  in  addition  to  the  housing 
<br/>rehabilitation in the Central, Western and the maritime islands where the Ministry of Forestry has so 
<br/>far have re-purposed timber building over 500 homes.  We are continuing to look strategically in 
<br/>strengthening  the  Ministry’s  initiative  in  focusing  and  driving  our  economy’s  economic  and 
<br/>development activities in the North and the maritime islands.  This work will continue to be driven 
<br/>and  focussed  in  empowering  our  maritime  and  Northern  communities  to  be  self-  sustainable  and 
<br/>commercially  minded  and  economically  driven  in  the  respective  programmes  that  the  Ministry 
<br/>continues to undertake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to Members of Parliament who would like to raise 
<br/>supplementary questions, you  mentioned something that caught my ears and that is the Wainiyabia 
<br/>Jetty.  I  remember  vividly  in  this  Parliament  during  budget  session,  we  raised  that  issue  to  the 
<br/>Government of the day then and they could not figure out where Wainiyabia was even though it was 
<br/>in their proposal. So, when we raised questions, the former Prime Minister shot out and said, “do not 
<br/>worry, we will do it”. I said, “okay, do not worry” to honourable Semesa Karavaki who raised the 
<br/>question. This Wainiyabia is in Lakeba, it is next to the late </span><span>Turaga na Tui Nayau’s</span><span> cattle farm.  It is 
<br/>quite some distance to the deep waters and they are still waiting.  It is over how many years now.  
<br/>You have mentioned that in your reply to the question raised and I hope you understand that issue 
<br/>concerning that particular proposal to build a wharf in Wainiyabia.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Minister  for  Fisheries  in  his 
<br/>statement  highlighted  about  the  upcoming  trainings.  My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Fisheries is, what was the selection criteria for the households to be selected for the trainings and 
<br/>when it will commence? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.V.  RAVU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is  a  community  training,  it  depends  on  the 
<br/>devastation of the place which was  affected by hurricanes.  If we have it in Natokalau Village, we 
<br/>will teach them on how to operate and assist the Ministry in doing their own logging, et cetera.  But 
<br/>for forestry training, we have our training centre in Nasinu, they can apply for training, and we can 
<br/>assist them with training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I was in Vanua Levu during </span><span>Tropical Cyclone Yasa 
<br/></span><span>because of rehabilitation work and the pressure to get it done for these houses.  A lot of those timbers 
<br/>were  not  treated.    I  think  some  years  later,  people  started  to  complain  about  the  condition  of  the 
<br/>houses because of untreated timber. They have been using their own pine because that was the advice 
<br/>given by the Ministry.  Will that be part of this work again to go back and fix these houses, they are 
<br/></span><span>really going down now.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we were not aware of that from past years but we are 
<br/>now working on that and trying to get all timbers treated.  We cannot get it to Viti Levu, we will take 
<br/>our services down to the rural and maritime areas and do our servicing in those villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I remember quite vividly as well, the former government, for fallen trees, 
<br/>they passed a very quick authority to be given to the Ministry of Forestry to cut and start providing 
<br/>fallen trees to enable the people affected by the cyclones to build their houses up in the Dawasamu 
<br/></span><span>area.  So now, it is the fallen trees during the hurricane and cyclones.  We do not have any fallen 
<br/></span><span>trees right now because we are still waiting for what may come. I leave that to you, Sir, the logistics 
<br/>of moving your trough to enable to treat the timbers because by then if there is a cyclone the roads 
<br/>will be blocked, et cetera.  How quick a response time can that be undertaken?  I do not know want 
<br/>you to reply to that, I just want you to consider that.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Rugby League Premiership Competition 
<br/>(Question No. 31/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports update Parliament on Fiji’s bid to 
<br/>secure a licence to enter the National Rugby League (NRL) Premiership Competition for men 
<br/>and women rugby league teams in the 18th Extension Franchise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I give my response, allow me to acknowledge 
<br/>the presence of the Bid Director, Bev Broughton and Mr. Rajesh Singh of Broughton’s &amp; Associates 
<br/>are partners of official Bid company in the public gallery today.  For the interest of Parliament, His 
<br/>Excellency the President of Fiji is the current patron of the Fiji National Rugby League while the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister is a former patron and now a life member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In reference to the question raised by the honourable Member, the following updates have 
<br/>been received - a letter of support from the honourable Minister for Youth and Sports on behalf of 
<br/>the Government of Fiji was vetted by the Office of the Solicitor-General and sent to the Chairman of 
<br/>the Australian Rugby League Commission, Mr. Peter V’Landys on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> February, 2024, expressing 
<br/>our support for the bid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, confirmation from the Australian Rugby League Commission for a licence 
<br/>is yet to be received and the timeline to have this approved may vary and could even take a while.  
<br/>However, in the meantime, as we wait for a confirmation, Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited, our 
<br/>bid company is currently strengthening media coverage of the Fiji bid on the extensive wide world 
<br/>of sports programme that reaches out to over four million sporting fans every month on Channel 9 
<br/>News in Australia.  They have ensured media coverage with key online commentators, one of which 
<br/>has been reported by a media commentator with the following of 168,000 sports fans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited is also developing bid programmes and 
<br/>constructive  liaison  with  the  Fiji  National  Rugby  League  regarding  complementary  pathway 
<br/>programmes to ensure no duplication.  Rugby League Bid  Fiji Pte limited is also working on the 
<br/>development of the media collateral in readiness for ongoing media releases to keep the profile of 
<br/>Fiji and the Rugby League Bid Fiji Pte Limited consistently promoted both in Fiji and internationally.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, they are working with sponsors including a forthcoming formal Rugby League 
<br/></span><span>Bid Fiji Pte Limited, the launch date to be decided, agreed and preparation for the launch of official 
<br/></span><span>website and social media.  The above are activities that will help support Fiji’s bid for a licence in 
<br/>the National Rugby League Franchise.  The bid has a defined outcome, but whatever the timeline to 
<br/>when NRL licence may  be, the Fiji  NRL bid  has great  ongoing  value with  a range of innovative 
<br/>programmes that continue to strengthen Rugby League and community outcomes for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  First  of  all,  we  are  competing  with  the  PNG  Kumuls  from  what  I 
<br/>understand  as  the  18th  Extension  and  I  also  understand  that  they  have  received  some  Australian 
<br/>Government backing with respect to this, they have a war chest of about $600 million with respect 
<br/></span><span>to their bid.  Are we able to even match them, because we all want to see our Fijian team part of 
<br/></span><span>NRL.  Will we be able to compete with them because I know PNG has a lot of money to do that and 
<br/>they have some Australian Government backing with respect to that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer to the question is, yes, we are competing 
<br/>with PNG in our bid for a place in the NRL franchise.  On the financial side, at the moment we have 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rugby  League  Fiji,  the  company  that  has  been  formed  which  is  currently  looking  at  that  bid.  
<br/>Financial outcomes for that we do not have any details of it, so at the moment our priority is to secure 
<br/>the bid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Have you approached the Australian Government for assistance on this?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- As I have mentioned Mr. Speaker, Sir, the company is also looking at  
<br/>sponsorship.  There are a lot of interested partners that are willing to come on board to be part of the 
<br/>move for Fiji to be in the NRL franchise. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What is the situation with the Silktails? Are they part of that company?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, no.  Kaiviti Silktails is competing in the Under 20s 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>category, so it is not part of the company here or the bid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my apologies honourable Minister, you already 
<br/>have the Silktails there and they are already playing in that competition.  Why cannot we just move 
<br/>them to another level?  While they are already there with the NRL, just play our Silktails?  That is 
<br/>my question in trying to understand the process that you are going to take, instead of going through 
<br/>another bid as we are already in that arena. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Mr. Speaker Sir, as I have mentioned before, Silktails is competing in 
<br/>the Under 20s category and it is at a lower level while the Fiji National Rugby League and the plan 
<br/>for joining the franchise, who are looking at the premium level of rugby league in Australia. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It will be a conduit to supply the rugby league. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Silktails to the rugby league; tthat is the question being raised? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. SAUKURU.- Yes, Silktails can be used as a pathway for our youths to go through 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the same structure.  They are provided the same pathway.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There being no supplementary questions, I intend to adjourn  Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>now for lunch and we will resume at 2.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 12:34 p.m.

<div><span>FSC – Pay Increase for Staff 
<br/>(Question No. 32/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament  as  to  where  the  funding  for  the  5  percent  pay  increase  for  the  Fiji  Sugar 
<br/>Corporation (FSC) staff that was recently announced will be sourced from? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to first of all ask the honourable Member 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether he is opposing this increment or his for the increment.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will ask all the honourable Members on the other side of the Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes I would like to actually say something more about the sugar industry, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have been given a good opportunity today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Yes, I will answer.  Please bear with me.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  got  19.23  minutes  left.  So,  first  of  all  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister who is here to listen to my answers because I will be delivering are few important messages 
<br/>and I am here to do a job. Now, honourable Keta Lal please…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I will, it is coming.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, FSC (this is the whole contention 
<br/>of this question) was and is in a state of debacle and as and is in a state of a debacle, in a shape of 
<br/>disarray whereby…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- What are you doing now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Look, in three years there were no balance sheets given by the last boards 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because we …  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- … and through my effort that I got the last board to present the last three 
<br/>years’  of  returns.    In  any  business  for  that  matter,  and  of  course  our  honourable  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister, Kamikamica will agree, you will need to have a balance sheet every year so that you can 
<br/></span><span>better measure yourself; where your company is going and what it is doing?  Now, I had to instruct 
<br/></span><span>the last board  to present three years of accounts and when we saw the balance sheet, it was upside 
<br/>down and why I am saying this is, I have given an instruction now to the new board that within three 
<br/>months of the closing of accounts, they have to present a balance sheet so that we can see how FSC 
<br/>is performing and where it is going.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 537 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Just a small thing to say. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Look!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- You have got 17 minutes, don’t worry.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- One more issue that honourable Naupoto had raised earlier that I was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>illegally doing things in the Immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- I have not transferred the workers, they are under my permit.  You know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>what happened, in my years in cane farming, as well as when cane crushing starts…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- And where is the sugar?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Come on honourable Ketan, shut up! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Do  not say shut up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Sir, I am sorry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As soon as the cane crushing starts the farmers see the cane farms burning.  They cannot get 
<br/>cane cutters to harvest because there was a seven-day window programme for the farmers to harvest 
<br/>and bring the cane to the mill.  I will seek the honourable Pio Tikoduadua’s indulgence to see how 
<br/>we can assist the farmers.  They will still be under my contract but if I can assist them, that is my 
<br/>whole idea.  I am not here to be illegally getting them transferred. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, that is right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Under this programme, I must thank honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>Gavoka and honourable Faiyaz Koya for raising the issue about ethanol and aviation fuel.  We want 
<br/></span><span>to bring aviation fuel to this country, but we need production. With 1.6 million tonnes of cane, we 
<br/></span><span>cannot produce ethanol.  We need volume. Later on, I would like to ask the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, how did our industry fail from a 3.2 million tonnes of cane to 1.6 million tonnes?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- No, I am not blaming you directly, honourable Leader of the Opposition, 
<br/>but I would like to know what went wrong and to bring it back is a task.  So, that is something that I 
<br/>will talk about with the honourable Leader of the Opposition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Leader of Opposition has alluded to me earlier that we need to bring the cane 
<br/>price up and I will tell you, $95 is minimum in this season. If everything goes well, it could be $100 
<br/>per tonne before the election.

<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You not a farmer!

<div><span>production of cane. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Answer the question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Come on, honourable  Member. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 3.2 million tonnes of cane that we used to harvest, we used to produce 
<br/>370,000 tonnes of sugar.  That relates to $700 million in foreign exchange.  That was the figure we 
<br/>have.  Now, what are we getting today? Sir, 1.6 million tonnes of cane, 140,000 tonnes of sugar and 
<br/>it gives us $200 million in foreign exchange.  We have to reverse it, and this why I want a bipartisan 
<br/>friendship.  Do not go to the farmers and give the wrong signals. You just tell them that they have to 
<br/>work together.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, I  tell you that  the honourable Leader of Opposition is very 
<br/>in co-operation with me. I would love to see other honourable Members on the other side to be part 
<br/>of us.  My answer to him is a four-piece answer.  I have got another nine minutes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, as we speak, Mr. Speaker, today we have got seven Engineers from India who are here 
<br/>in the country. I have negotiated to bring them here. They are working with no fees, and we only 
<br/>have to pay airfares and accommodation and they are currently… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Labour Law! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- …they are in FSC Ba Mill, then to Lautoka Mill and then to Labasa Mill 
<br/>to assess the conditions of our aging plants. They will give us a report in the next couple of days to 
<br/>say how the current Mills have to be given a revamp. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They will also give us an advice on how the Rakiraki Mill and what sort of mill that we have 
<br/>to put there.  It is coming and I am giving a promise in Parliament that like this time next year, the 
<br/>Mill will start with the foundation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will tell you why the production of sugar has gone down in this country.  It is because you 
<br/></span><span>on the other side have ruined the sugar Mill in Rakiraki.  You can put the market there, but your mill 
<br/>is not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, I will tell you one thing - the good part about me handling the Sugar Industry is this, 
<br/>the former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhary used to criticise the sugar industry, but he has not 
<br/>even said one thing against me ever since I have been the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Why? I am an efficient Minister.  I am a person who is working on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>job.  I am not sleeping on the job! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was in China recently.  I will tell you that under your Government, you

<div><span>imported pesticides and weedicides that could not kill the grass.  So now, I am bringing in a set of 
<br/>weedicides and pesticides that will kill not only him but you too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ever since he has asked me this question, he kept on saying, “Please, please do not attack 
<br/>me”.  I said, “I will not attack you because you did not ask the question.  Thethe question was asked 
<br/>by someone else, but you only have your name there.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question posed by honourable Matasawalevu.  The 
<br/>decision to provide this pay rise was made considering the several factors that have affected the Fiji 
<br/>Sugar  Corporation  employees.    The  last  salary  adjustment  occurred  in  January  2019,  marking  a 
<br/>period of five years without a subsequent financial recognition of the Cost of Living Adjustments 
<br/>(COLA).  This  termination  had  led  to  a  noticeable  decline  in  boosting  moral,  motivation  and 
<br/>productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also crucial to acknowledge that the high inflation rates over the past five years have 
<br/>severely impacted the ability of FSC employees to make ends meet.  The impact of these challenges, 
<br/>coupled with persistent demands for wages  reviews has put a significant pressure on FSC and its 
<br/>management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, in the aftermath of COVID-19, we observed a troubling pattern of skill loss as 
<br/>employees migrated to other countries or moved to organisations offering higher wages.  In the recent 
<br/>years, FSC has lost a total of 110 employees to either migration or to organisation offering a higher 
<br/>remuneration package.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In response to these pressing issues, the Board of Directors of FSC has approved a 5 percent 
<br/>increment, totalling to $1.1 million annually effective from 3</span><span>rd</span><span> January, 2024.  This has benefitted 
<br/>nearly 2,000 FSC employees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that the Executive Management is not part of this salary increase, while 
<br/>the majority of FSC employees have already received their increment and are benefitting from this.  
<br/>There are still 238 employees whose union are currently negotiating with FSC before accepting the 
<br/>increment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the unions negotiate as their rights under the Coalition Government, funds have been 
<br/></span><span>allocated from  the budgeted $1.1 million for these employees to  also  benefit from  the increment.  
<br/></span><span>Now, this is the punch line.  “Let me not compare against the salaries of two previous CEOs, Abdul 
<br/>Khan and Graham Clark, who, in today’s dollars, were earning in excess of $1.1 million per year.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  effectively  taking  the  funds  from  the  Executive  Management’s  remuneration  and 
<br/>invest them in our hardworking employees who run the show and keep these esteemed organisation 
<br/>afloat.    This  is  investing  in  our  own  people,  without  lining  up the  pockets  of  the  privileged  few. 
<br/>Implementing the pay increases was not just a choice, but a necessity, resulting from past negligence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The funding for this pay increase will be sourced from the operational budget of FSC.  The 
<br/></span><span>decision to provide this pay rise was made after careful consideration of various factors, including 
<br/>the Corporation’s financial standing, operational efficiency and the dedication of its workforce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Member, I thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say everything 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>from my heart.  </span><span>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I thank the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Minister for his elaborate answer.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We just recently visited all the Mills in Fiji - Western and returned from Labasa two weeks 
<br/>ago.  The honourable Minister has highlighted the production of ethanol as fuel.  Unfortunately, in 
<br/>our visit, it did not indicate the capacity to even produce sugar for local consumption, let alone for 
<br/>export.  My belief is that the Ministry of Sugar should come under the Ministry of Agriculture. Does 
<br/>he have any comment on that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think that is the prerogative of the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister where the Ministry should lie. You have said a good thing and if I can get half of the Ministry 
<br/>of Agriculture on my side,  I will be happy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Minister; he 
<br/>talked about  the good old  days of sugar, FSC particularly  when we had more  than three million 
<br/>tonnes and now it is down to 1.2 million tonnes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there is a correlation between that and the availability of land for leases and, of 
<br/>course, the number of famers that we have lost through that process. Please, can you tell Parliament 
<br/>and  every  Fijians  who  are  listening  today,  how  many  farmers  were  victims  of  non-renewable  of 
<br/>leases?  How does that relate to the production? How much land?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The expiry of land started in 1997, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Please, can you tell Parliament how 
<br/>many farmers did not have their land renewed and what is the impact of that on sugar production? 
<br/>Be honest! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a new question.  It was under your 16 years of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>governance, what did you do? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. We love listening to you and the way you 
<br/>hold up when you are under pressure.  Even by reading your reply, your voice goes up and down, yet 
<br/>no one is questioning you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his 
<br/>answer.  I have another question to the honourable Minister.  The FSC workers are happy now. My 
<br/>question is, what have you got for the farmers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a new question but, again, I love to answer it 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because the farmers are listening.  It will be better than last year’s price. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question is based on the first 
<br/></span><span>12 minutes of uttering by the honourable Minister about the sugarcane industry.  What I would like 
<br/></span><span>to know is, what is the current global market price for sugar at this point in time? As simple as that, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr Speaker, Sir, I think this honourable Member is deaf or what.  I said 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>$2,000 per tonne.  Go back and listen to my speech.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Disaster Management Office  
<br/>(Question No. 33/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  through  the  National  Disaster 
<br/>Management Office (NDMO) is working with stakeholders to address the issues of flooding 
<br/>due to drainage issues? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, first of all, I would like to digress for a little moment and try to clarify some of the 
<br/>issues  that  honourable  Premila  Kumar  had  pointed  out  yesterday,  regarding  the  revived  Rural 
<br/>Housing Programme.  She was saying that it was not revived, but just an old programme that was 
<br/>part of what they had done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow me to clarify, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the Rural Housing Programme is a testimony and 
<br/>legacy  to  the  previous  Government’s  failure  of  trying  to  mainstream  development  programmes, 
<br/>particularly for our rural population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two schemes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and compared to that, we have five at the moment.  
<br/>It is important to note that the above two schemes also include Social Welfare Scheme, which was 
<br/>causing them issues in the end.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The programme was transferred to the Ministry of Housing in the 2018-2019 Financial Year 
<br/>with  approximately  $0.76  million  outstanding  deposit  as  a  one-third  contribution  for  the  113 
<br/>applicants.  In the last five years, when the programme was with the Ministry of Housing, only 86 
<br/>applicants were processed, which is equivalent to around 17 applicants per year, compared to about 
<br/>6,000 applicants that we received.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  same  period,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  previous  Government  never  received  new 
<br/>applications  but  ended  up  withdrawing  the  applicant’s  one-third  contribution  as  part  of  the  Rural 
<br/>Housing  Reform  Programme.    A  balance  of  27  applicants  with  approximately  $296,056  were 
<br/>recorded at the end of the financial year.  As a result, when it was transferred to our Ministry, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we had to go through the very arduous task of returning the one-third contribution that 
<br/></span><span>they had already received.  That is only the clarification of yesterday’s answer that I gave. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in answer to the question today from the honourable Member, I thank him 
<br/>for  his  question.    It  is  an  update  on  the  Ministry’s  work  facilitated  by  the  National  Disaster 
<br/>Management Office in collaboration with stakeholders to address the issue of flooding  caused by 
<br/>drainage problems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In accordance with the provisions outlined in the Natural Disaster Management Act 1998, the 
<br/>Prevention  and  Mitigation  Committee  holds  the  responsibility  of  formulating  policies  directed 
<br/></span><span>towards disaster mitigation and prevention.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently,  the  NDMO  convened  a  meeting  to  comprehensively  address  the  drainage  issue 
<br/>through  a  holistic  Government  approach.    During  this  session,  the  Prevention  and  Mitigation 
<br/>Committee  identified  feasible  short-term  measures,  emphasising  the  necessity  of  an  integrated 
<br/>strategy,  involving  stakeholders  such  as  the  Fiji  Roads  Authority,  Municipal  Councils  and  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the focus was on maintaining clear roadsides and urban and field drainage 
<br/>systems to facilitate the uninterrupted flow of rainfall runoff to designated outlets.  Following the 
<br/>recent flooding in the Central Division, a Multidisciplinary Team, led by the Commissioner Central, 
<br/>swiftly mobilised to assess the areas of concern and identified potential gaps in our disaster mitigation 
<br/>efforts.  This approach underscores our commitment to ensuring the resilience of our communities in 
<br/>the face of natural disasters.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a list of priority roads and choke points that have led to floods 
<br/>in the last two years, was given to the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways for their contractors to 
<br/>attend to and desilt and clear where required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government was also requested to advice all Municipal Councils to be 
<br/>on alert and attend to all critical drainage and choke points during heavy rains to prevent build-up of 
<br/>runoff that contributes to flooding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  the  same  vein,  there  is  a  concerted  effort  by  Municipal  Councils  to 
<br/>promote continuous public and community awareness on cleanliness and rubbish collection to avoid 
<br/>blocked drains from households.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of urban flooding is also a matter of civic pride and responsibility, 
<br/>as rubbish and debris from households are often a major contributory factor to drainage systems being 
<br/>clot and the onus lies with individual households to collaborate with authorities in maintaining clear 
<br/>drains and outlets.  I would dare say it is a challenge also to the Ministry of Education in maybe 
<br/>adding that as part of the curriculum and also just the general public, to ensure that we take this lesson 
<br/>to our homes when we go back.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the NDMO, together with the Divisional Commissioners, form sub-national 
<br/>level taskforces as part of our coordinated responses to address recurring instances of flooding.  These 
<br/>taskforces  are  led  by  the  Divisional  Commissioners  and  comprise  of  representatives  from  the 
<br/>Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways, Ministry of Local Government, Water Authority of Fiji and 
<br/>Fiji Roads Authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The taskforces, Mr. Speaker, Sir, met for formulate quick fix measures to address flooding in 
<br/>urban and rural localities particularly, and this is related to drainage and debris management.  This 
<br/>approach  is  in  alignment  with  SDG11  of  making  cities  and  human  settlements  inclusive,  safe, 
<br/>resilient and sustainable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In particular, one of the targets is to substantially increase the number of cities and human 
<br/>settlements,  adopting  and  implementing  integrated  policies  and  plans  towards  inclusion,  resource 
<br/>efficiency,  mitigation  and  adaptation  to  climate  change,  resilience  to  disasters  and  develop  and 
<br/>implement  in  line  with  the  Sendai  Framework  for  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  2015-2030,  holistic 
<br/>disaster risk management at all levels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the long-term plan that the NDMO is currently developing is a National 
<br/>Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Plan  with  the  assistance  of  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency 
<br/></span><span>(JICA).    The  Plan  is  now  piloted  for  the  Western  Division,  is  almost  completed,  and  it  includes 
<br/></span><span>mapping of vulnerable areas prone to flooding, and this will guide development planning in urban 
<br/>and rural areas to ensure that development does not exacerbate flood risk. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we continue to implement ongoing interventions to address the issue at 
<br/>hand, I acknowledge the re-establishment of the Drainage Board, as announced by the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Agriculture  and  Waterways  earlier  this  week.    This  will  ensure  a  proactive  and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>systematic approach in the clearing of blocked drains and natural waterways that are causing flooding 
<br/>due to accumulation of debris and desilting. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to emphasise to our citizens the importance of proper waste 
<br/>management. I do concur and support the previous statement made by the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Agriculture  and  Waterways  in  this  august  Parliament  on  Monday,  that  it  is  crucial  for  each 
<br/>community,  household  and  individual  to  take  responsibility  in  the  appropriate  disposal  of  their 
<br/>rubbish.  Failure to do so will not only lead to blocked drains, which is now visible in almost all 
<br/>drains  around  us,  but  also  will  be  exacerbating  the  risk  of  flooding,  as  well  as  creating  breeding 
<br/>grounds for mosquitos in stagnant water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this all-hands-on- deck approach requires the support and cooperation of all 
<br/>stakeholders, including those in the Opposition, particularly in changing the mindset and behavioural 
<br/>change  towards  proper  waste  management,  given  its  important  contribution  for  sustainable 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is concerning to note that more lives are lost to vector-borne diseases, 
<br/>such as LTDD, leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue and diarrhoea due to the direct impacts of flooding and 
<br/>heavy rainfall. This underscores the urgent need for collective action and collaboration on improving 
<br/>waste management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I cannot overstate the significance of citizens’ adherence to proper waste disposal practices.  
<br/>I urge honourable Members of this august Parliament and fellow citizens, let us unite in our efforts 
<br/>to  promote  responsible  waste  management  and  mitigate  the  associated  risks  to  public  health  and 
<br/>safety.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would urge the honourable Minister perhaps 
<br/>just to pick up and continue with the work on rural development because regardless of whether it is 
<br/>in the Ministry of Housing or whether it is in the Ministry of Rural Development this is about the 
<br/>basic needs for our rural people. A lot has been done particularly by the Ministry when it was with 
<br/>Rural Development in terms of clearing the backlog from yester years.  So, he just needs to pick it 
<br/>up and carry forward, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have talked about you DRR Policy. You are answering a question related to flooding 
<br/>due to drainage issues but most of the flooding in Fiji is because of the major rivers and streams.  
<br/>Under the Sendai Framework that you have mentioned, early warning systems is so important. What 
<br/></span><span>are your plans about the early warning systems in the major rivers and streams in order to mitigate 
<br/></span><span>and raise the level of resilience for our communities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- The early warning systems that we had, some are already installed in 
<br/>some of the major rivers in Ba and Lautoka. There were some issues that we had met this time around. 
<br/>Some of the gauges were not picking up. So, we have got the Korean team coming over to have a 
<br/>look.  The plan is to ensure that all the major inlets coming down from the hills, the ones that are 
<br/>causing flooding, those are the ones that we want the river gauges to be deployed up to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, it depends on the donor members who come forward to deliver those systems. 
<br/></span><span>At the moment, the Koreans are the ones who had delivered those systems and those were the ones 
<br/>that were installed in Ba and Lautoka and in the areas surrounding and we intend to keep moving it 
<br/>around to other areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In some areas, the issues we were finding that some of the members of the public were causing 
<br/>damage to it. In some place the solar system was tampered with, some were stolen. In some other

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>areas, some technical equipment were also tampered with.  So, those are the kind of issues that we 
<br/>are facing as we are trying to deploy these systems all over the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  TUBUNA.-  My  question  to  the  honourable  Minister,  with  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways and Local Government Authorities also involved with flooding, can the 
<br/>honourable Minister inform Parliament of how he will ensure that there is no duplication of efforts 
<br/>between NDMO and other related agencies? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the taskforce has  been established to  address  the 
<br/>sudden onset of flooding and tree hazards. The team operates in real time to respond promptly to 
<br/>flooding incidents collaborating with Department of Waterways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Drainage  Board  which  just  been  established  is  an  institutionalise  cognition  forum 
<br/>responsible  for  overseeing  drainage  and  irrigation  infrastructure  management.    While  the  Board 
<br/>focuses  on  mitigation  such  as  drainage,  maintenance  and  dredging,  the  primary  mandate  of  the 
<br/>taskforce is to coordinate resources which is response from both Government and private sectors to 
<br/>respond effectively to flooding events and minimise the impact.  So, you will see that there will be 
<br/>no duplication of effort in that way, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Fiji’s National Standardisation Strategy 
<br/>(Question No. 35/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on the importance of 
<br/>Fiji’s National Standardisation Strategy, its requirement and benefits? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Standardisation Strategy will 
<br/>provide  a  policy  roadmap  making  sure  that  our  National  Strategic  Priorities  and  Development 
<br/>objectives  are  supported  by  relevant  national  and  international  standards.    In  this  case,  the 
<br/>development  and  adoption  of  standards  should  be  guided  by  a  comprehensive  understanding  of 
<br/>national  priorities  across  various  sectors  such  as  trade,  building,  construction,  tourism  and 
<br/>environment to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The all-encompassing strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will also consider emerging sectors that are 
<br/></span><span>expected to play significant roles in the future ensuring that standards evolve to support innovation 
<br/></span><span>and growth for an economy. Mapping national priorities to standards also helps prioritising Fiji’s 
<br/>resources towards achieving specific development targets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) for which Fiji is a member provides 
<br/>significant  investment  in  capacity  building  for  countries  that  want  to  develop  their  national 
<br/>standardisation strategies.  The Ministry has recently completed virtual training workshops on the 
<br/>ISO  methodology  on  developing  National  Standardisation  Strategies  with  ISO  and  more  virtual 
<br/>meetings will be expected as that strategy work commences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Being the only full member of the ISO amongst its Pacific neighbours gives Fiji a unique 
<br/>position to influence regional standardisation initiatives.  The strategy is an excellent policy advocacy 
<br/>too, it is also important because the exercise will involve conducting assessments or priority sectors 
<br/>and stakeholder interest which are essential in the standardisation process.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Ministry will be engaging with stakeholders who are users, contributors and 
<br/>potential users of standards ensuring that the resulting  standards are  comprehensive,  relevant  and 
<br/>widely accepted within the respective industries.  The Ministry plans to develop the strategy of the 
<br/>next 18 months and we are positive with the technical support by development partners that we will 
<br/>be able to use this collaboration to enhance the quality and effectiveness of our standards as a national 
<br/>strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry will prioritise stakeholder engagement in developing the strategy as it plans to 
<br/>work closely with the members of the Trade Standards Advisory Council, technical committees, sub-
<br/>committees of the National Standard Board or the Department of National Trade Measurement and 
<br/>Standards (DNTMS), industry, professional associations, core-government agencies, and of course, 
<br/>NGOs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Key  stakeholders  are  significantly  affected  by  standardisation  processes  and  their 
<br/>participation  in  such  consultations  remain  vital.    The  National  Standardisation  Strategies  work 
<br/>taskforce comprising of senior members of the Ministry of Trade including professionals with the 
<br/>knowledge and experience in standards will be involved in this work.  The taskforce may include 
<br/>specialists from other sectors outside the National Standards body on a case-by-case basis. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the ISO methodology, the taskforce will see that the following 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>processes are undertaken: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Conducting an analysis of priority sectors of the national economy; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Conducting an analysis of a social and non-economic priority areas; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Reviewing  National  Development  Plans  to  identify  new  and  emerging  centres  that  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expected to have significant importance in the future; and of the top of my head 
<br/>ICT  sector  and  the  BPO  sector  is  probably  one  of  the  most  obvious  ones  combining 
<br/>economic, non-economic and priorities from these newly emerging sectors into a single work 
<br/>obtaining  inputs  and  feedback  from  stakeholders  and  developing  a  list  of  topics  for  the 
<br/>required new national standards that correspond to priority sector areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In a nutshell, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the standard is primarily a combination of the socio-economic 
<br/>assessment  which  identifies  areas  that  needs  standardization  together  with  stakeholder  priorities 
<br/>based on critical areas I have mentioned. The proposal ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be to turn 
<br/>these  areas  into  standards  identifying  national  needs  which  could  undergo  identical  adoption  or 
<br/>modified  adoption  depending  on  the  final  recommendations  of  the  taskforce  put  together  after 
<br/>substantial  or  extensive  consultation.  A  National  Standardization  Strategy  for  Fiji  could  indeed 
<br/>provide a framework for alignment on a regional level  collaborating with other Pacific countries. 
<br/>You would have noted the honourable Prime Minister’s mention of Fiji being the hub of the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By  identifying  common  elements  and  priorities  among  these  national  strategies,  Fiji  can 
<br/>contribute once again significantly to the development of joint standards for the benefit of the region. 
<br/>Also,  as  co-Chair  to  the  Pacific  Islands  Standards  Committee,  Fiji’s  leadership  can  advance  this 
<br/>project and foster greater cooperation and harmonisation across the Pacific.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me conclude by saying that having a National Standardization Strategy 
<br/></span><span>will  map  out  the  future  standardization  in  Fiji.  We  do  not  only  assess  our  current  needs  and 
<br/>challenges.  However, we also have the ability to use information available to develop future looking 
<br/>policy tools, in this case the National Standardisation Strategy. A national strategy that will forecast 
<br/>standardisation solutions though the adoption of international or national standards that can change 
<br/></span><span>the  dynamics  of  trade,  product  performance,  safety  and  linking  climate  change  mitigation  and 
<br/></span><span>economic efficiency.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, standards play a very important role in everyone’s 
<br/>lives, whether you are buying medicine, construction materials or anything for that matter. It can take 
<br/>your life away if the standards are not in order or it can enhance your living condition if the standards 
<br/>are of an applicable level, in terms of insurance, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The question that I have for the honourable Minister is, the DNTMS that we have plays a 
<br/>very important role, is there any plan for the Minister to give the importance it deserves and try and 
<br/>create a statutory body so that it can also get donor funding and do its job better? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you honourable Kumar for that excellent question. 
<br/>That  is  exactly  where  we  are  headed.  Basically,  we  see  great  potential  in  the  enhancement  of  a 
<br/>centralised standards body. We have some capacity issues, we also have some infrastructure needs, 
<br/>and we feel that through a strategy that is well articulated and then bring in the development partners, 
<br/>we  can  develop  something  that  has  not  only  national  significance  but  more  importantly  regional 
<br/>significance, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I hope that answers the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.- Supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister, just listening to your presentation on this, there are organisations or institutions that 
<br/>use devices, measuring or weighing devices, even for those that use meter to charge fees or fare. This 
<br/>problem  of going  off this standard, I know there are a lot of complaints coming about  the e-card 
<br/>system  because of these devices  failing  to  redeem  bus fare cards  and the recalibration process  to 
<br/>bring them back.  You mentioned something about getting back the system.  How do you, under this 
<br/>strategy, ensure that the compliance level is there all the time so people will not be overcharged or 
<br/>undercharged or the wrong weighing and those kind of things are happening to the customers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Tuinaceva for his very 
<br/>good  question.    There  are  programmes  in  place  for  monitoring,  let  us  say  for  example,  all  the 
<br/>weighing machines we see around Fiji, they are regularly  checked sort of on  a progressive basis.  
<br/>Also, just as an information to Parliament, the speed guns for the Police, that has to be checked as 
<br/>well.  There are standards and programmes in place to monitor and are checked regularly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think it is fair to say, I am sure honourable Premila Kumar and honourable Koya can agree 
<br/>to  this, there is  probably  more capability if resource this year better to  do a much better job.  For 
<br/>example, we have standard weights to check machines and some of the weights have been around 
<br/>for quite some time and are beyond their use by  date, but we still use them because of budgetary 
<br/>constraints.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are some of the challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have but we are progressively 
<br/>trying to work on them.  There are two pieces of legislation under DNTMS that needs to be reviewed.  
<br/>Those are in the legislative programme now to be reviewed as well. I am comfortable that we do have 
<br/>regular checking, but I think we can do more. Perhaps a bit of less resourcing or maybe working 
<br/>smarter with some technology.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I may be allowed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just because I have some time just to divulge a bit. I 
<br/>know  honourable  Tuinaceva  mentioned  something  about  e-Ticketing.    That  is  also  under  active 
<br/></span><span>consideration  by  the  Government  at  the  moment.    Hopefully  we  can  come  and  make  some 
<br/></span><span>announcements soon on that particular aspect, hopefully in the next session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  We  will    now  move  on,  before  I  offer  the  floor  to  honourable  Peni 
<br/>Ravunawa in his question, I would like to acknowledge members of the public in the gallery.  Thank 
<br/>you for making yourselves available to come and attend and observe the sitting today.

<div><span>Medical Imaging Science Technologists 
<br/>(Question No. 36/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services inform Parliament of 
<br/>the  strategies  in  place  to  address  the  critical  shortage  of  almost  30  vacancies  for  Medical 
<br/>Imaging Science Technologists in public hospitals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Medical Imaging Science 
<br/>Technologist,  the  cadre  at  the  moment  is  facing  shortage  as  it  is.    In  replying  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Member’s Oral Question, I would like to first brief the honourable Members of this august Chamber 
<br/>and the public who are watching what the Medical Imaging Science Technologists do in the hospitals, 
<br/>before I touch on the strategies that the Ministry is currently doing, in terms of retention and holding 
<br/>back some of our graduates and staff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medical  Imaging  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  various  medical 
<br/>conditions  from  detecting  cancerous  tumours,  to  assessing  bone  fractures.    Medical  Imaging 
<br/>Technologists (MIT) have revolutionised modern healthcare.  Fiji has also seen its self-radiological 
<br/>imaging  development  in  the  last  two  decades  with  the  introduction  of  high-quality  ultrasound, 
<br/>technology,  computerised  axial,  tomography  or  commonly  known  as  CT  Scan  and  Magnetic 
<br/>Resonance Imaging known as MRI capabilities both in the public and private sector, the availability 
<br/></span><span>and  accessibility  of  these  highly  advanced  testing  technologist  for  our  people  have  dramatically 
<br/></span><span>increased.  These advances in healthcare are very positive for the people of Fiji and contribute greatly 
<br/>for  the  overall  achievement  of  the  health  targets  under  the  SDGs.    With  these  new  technological 
<br/>developments, there is also the important need to ensure that our medical imaging workforce are well 
<br/>trained and equipped to handle these new technologies and deliver the services that our people expect 
<br/>to receive at our health facilities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue with critical shortages and what the Ministry is doing about it, 
<br/>the Ministry is taking the MITs submission into consideration, the reason for its resignation and high 
<br/></span><span>turnover.  The Department of Radiology has submitted a proposal for a salary restructure for MITs.  
<br/></span><span>Additionally, incentives  for those who will be posted in  the subdivisional hospitals  and maritime 
<br/>zones  which  include  housing  allowance  and  on  call  allowance  are  being  considered.    This  will 
<br/>motivate MITs to take up posting as all MITs have resigned from their respective stations and moved 
<br/>on to the private sector.  All maritime posts are currently vacant and CWM Hospital is providing 
<br/>staff to relieve on a rotational basis throughout Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  private  sector  and  overseas  countries  offering  better  working 
<br/>conditions  for MITs, this  is  the only  way to  retain  our current  human resource.  The competitive 
<br/>markets are targeting our experienced MITs as they do not progress in their salary scale even after 
<br/>five years to 10 years on the job.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The public sector is losing our skilled MITs as it takes years to train them on special modality 
<br/>such as ultrasound, CT and MRI.  With the proposal submitted, this has been factored in to allow 
<br/>experienced MITs to progress up the ladder in their salary band.  The FNU produces 25 graduates 
<br/>every year with 20 locals and five regional students.  There were only 11 graduates who had applied 
<br/>this year, with the rest going straight to the private sector for employment.  As such, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the Ministry hopes to work with FNU to roll out an intensive programme similar to what we have 
<br/>with doctors and the dentists.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, not really a supplementary questions but would 
<br/>like to commend the  honourable Minister  for forward looking because when the graduates leave the 
<br/>public sector to go to the private sector, the salary that they are looking for is only $2,000 margin.  It 
<br/>is critical right now, it is good that we are looking into incentivising these officers for the speciality 
<br/>that they do for the healthcare service.  Thank you, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Physical Education - Music, Arts and Crafts (PEMAC) 
<br/>(Question No. 37/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  update  Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  is  aiming  to  improve  Physical 
<br/>Education, Music, Arts and Craft (PEMAC) in schools throughout Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to respond to the question raised by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Tuiwailevu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education, not only aims to improve Science, Technology, 
<br/>Engineering and Maths (STEM) and TVET subject areas, but we acknowledge the crucial role that 
<br/>Physical  Education,  Music,  Arts  and  Craft  (PEMAC)  plays  in  the  holistic  development  of  our 
<br/>children and our education system and provides equal opportunities for children in Fiji to unearth 
<br/>and showcase their God-given talents.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  and  foremost,  through  all  the  communication  platforms,  our  Heads  of  Schools  are 
<br/>constantly  reminded  about  the  importance  of  strengthening  and  maximising  the  existing  learning 
<br/>time  allocated  to  all  PEMAC  classes  in  both,  primary  and  secondary  school  level.    That  means 
<br/>PEMAC classes should be used to teach the skills in these subjects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening  of  PEMAC  also  includes  allocation  of  adequate  resources  for  facilities, 
<br/>equipment and having qualified teachers.  Moreover, equally important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is restoring 
<br/>our multi-pronged community partnership approach. One is our local partnership at community level 
<br/></span><span>with local artists, musicians and sports organisations to provide additional opportunities for students 
<br/></span><span>which include, teaching traditional art like mat weaving, tapa designing, traditional pottery making 
<br/>and wood carving.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Partnering  with  communities  in  teaching  traditional  songs  with  musical  instruments, 
<br/>accompaniment  alike,  like  the  use  of  </span><span>lali</span><span>,  </span><span>ukulele</span><span>,  </span><span>dholak</span><span>  and  guitar  to  reverse  the  trend  of 
<br/>programme music. This aims to preserve our traditional heritage and knowledge, and an opportunity 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for income earning, especially in our thriving tourism industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji Teachers Registration Authority (FTRA) facilitates this partnership, 
<br/>along  with  the  need  for  the  development  of  an  accelerated  short  course  on  teaching  our  own 
<br/>community partners, techniques on how to teach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second, Mr. Speaker Sir, is a partnership with Government and corporate entities.  They have 
<br/>already started reviving partnership with the corporate and Government entities so the Ministry of 
<br/>Education can reinstate music and drama festival such as Tadra Kahani, Fiji War Dance Competition, 
<br/>film making and Fiji Times or design school newspapers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly believe that with these strategies reinforced again in our school system, they will 
<br/>reduce unwanted behaviour and criminal  activities like that are  escalating in  society amongst  our 
<br/>students, both at primary and secondary school level. The adage – an idle mind is a devil’s workshop 
<br/>would  be  encountered  by  organised  educational  activities  that  my  Ministry  partners  with  the 
<br/>community at large.  These strategies will ensure that our children are empowered and equipped with 
<br/>life skills that will potentially lead to professional careers and income opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me the opportunity 
<br/>to ask my supplementary question to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  Most of us have seen 
<br/>the beautiful photo of Dr. Hussein, the first local student to receive PhD, Philosophy in FNU and 
<br/>most of our students too in school wore the traditional garland during the graduation.  My question 
<br/>is will the art of making </span><span>salusalu</span><span> or traditional garland be included in the craft curriculum in schools?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think before the honourable Deputy Prime Minister answers that question, 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister, it is  for your Ministry to look into that.  That involves a lot of very 
<br/>important aspects of our culture and tradition and that needs to be safeguarded, even to the extent of 
<br/>it being patient.  So, I think you are answering your own question, but I leave it to the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister to answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I officiated the graduation at USP and FNU and 
<br/>just  seeing  the  faces  all  with  this  traditional  garland  -  the  </span><span>sisi</span><span>,  I  was  quite  impressive,  just  about 
<br/>everyone graduating had a </span><span>sisi</span><span>, and I asked the Chancellor of FNU, “How do you make this?”  It is 
<br/>so much in demand, it can be an industry on its own and I am just hoping that it can also be part of 
<br/>the crafts that we can teach our students.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I understand it comes from the </span><span>vau</span><span> tree where you cut it and soak it in water for a couple of 
<br/></span><span>days and then you take off the bark.  So, it is a craft that we need to teach across the country because 
<br/>the demand for </span><span>sisi</span><span> is quite huge, not only for Fiji, even our people overseas want the </span><span>sisi</span><span>.  So, I like 
<br/>that question because I will ask our team to include this in the curriculum in terms of crafts for our 
<br/>students.  The economic value must be huge because one </span><span>sisi</span><span> now cost about $60 to $80, so there is 
<br/>quite an economic value in this one.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was just worried that maybe the raw materials may not be there, so we need to plant a lot of 
<br/></span><span>vau</span><span>.  The danger here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that someone was using the bark of the mangrove (</span><span>dogo)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>and that is danger.  We we do not want to encourage that,  we rather just stick with the </span><span>vau</span><span> - the 
<br/></span><span>traditional material for </span><span>sisi</span><span>.  But it is something that I will ask the Ministry to try and encourage as a 
<br/>craft for our young people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- I have a very simple question.  Recently many teachers have resigned 
<br/>and that may have created gaps in schools, especially secondary schools.  For effective delivery of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  If  I  listen  correctly,  Mr.  Speaker,  there  is  a  general  question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regarding the whole teaching profession or is that PEMAC?
