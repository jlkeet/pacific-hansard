<h3>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- PEMAC.</h3>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- PEMAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  PEMAC  as  we  speak,  there  is  no  one  in  the 
<br/>Curriculum Unit under PEMAC, so we were putting out Expression of Interest for four.  We need 
<br/>four at headquarters to start reviving PEMAC in the schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our particular concern is the music side.  Our music and dance today is from pre-recorded 
<br/>music. What we want to teach our people is to actually play the instruments and for that, it is quite 
<br/>challenging, getting the right kind of teachers into music.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For crafts, we are alright, I think we can do that in co-operation with the community. Physical 
<br/>education, we are alright in that area, but music is a challenging one. Our expression of interest has 
<br/>gone. We need four to be part of PEMAC in the system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Just another supplementary question to the honourable Minister.  
<br/>Will  these  Art  and  Craft,  Music  and  PEMAC  teachers  be  registered  under  the  Teacher  Training 
<br/>Board? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker. As I had mentioned in my speech, the registration 
<br/>people will be part of this, and once you join as teachers, you will be registered under the Fiji Teachers 
<br/>Registration Association. You will be registered under them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can address that, Mr. Speaker, one of the best schools in the Western Division, Xavier 
<br/>College, that had a very good pass rate and they attributed that to the extra-curricular activities they 
<br/>have in the school - PEMAC.  So, it really is a huge part of education both, at primary and secondary 
<br/>school, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Do you remember the days when QVS used to have a play – drama, almost every year?  They 
<br/>used to tour around the country.  We need to revive that. That is a kind of extra-curricular that we 
<br/>want to encourage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Just to add a bit more to what we have been hearing,  Honourable Members, 
<br/>we have heard from the making of the </span><span>Sisi ni Lakeba</span><span>.  Instead of using the traditional </span><span>vau</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>it has now 
<br/>gone to mangrove barks- similar to Egypt as well. They do drawings on the jute straws that they get, 
<br/>they do drawings there and they sell very high. They have run out of jute, they have gone on to the 
<br/>stems of banana trees. They take out the pieces there and they all look alike.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just recently back in my home island, when there is graduation from these three universities 
<br/>at the second part of the year, that is when new tracks are seen up in the lake in Taveuni where the 
<br/></span><span>people of the island found it as a very lucrative business to get the flower of the ‘</span><span>tagimoucia</span><span>’ and 
<br/></span><span>they send it across to Lautoka or Suva where they hold this graduation - the </span><span>tagimoucia</span><span> leaves.  So, 
<br/>that again is how good the strength of the people to make more from whatever they could in terms of 
<br/>the very high demands there is.  If that is to be taught, I certainly would appreciate that because it 
<br/>will protect our flower on the island as well.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 551 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past you hardly find farmers down in the urban areas of Somosomo with gumboots and 
<br/>you will see them right at the top of the hill. How they go up there with gumboots, I really do not 
<br/>understand. It is quite a hike up the steep hill, yet they are there. They are picking the flowers, and it 
<br/>is bringing a lot of happiness to their families.  They do that but at the same time, the landowners just 
<br/>have to face the brunt because they get direct benefit as well from all those side dealings and all that 
<br/>because of the demand from the three universities.   
<br/></span></div>
