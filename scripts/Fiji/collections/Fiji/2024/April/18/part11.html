<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State of the Fijian Economy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  The honourable Prime Minister, honourable Ministers, the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; I am happy to provide 
<br/>an update on the Fijian economy.  The headlines, if I can call them that, are that after a successful 
<br/>post-COVID recovery, we are confronting new challenges, particularly those posed by the loss of 
<br/>our skilled people abroad.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is ready to deal with these challenges at the same time as setting a longer-
<br/>term pathway for Fiji’s future growth and prosperity.  However, as always, we want our people to be 
<br/>informed and aware of the critical factors, and we want a united approach to economic management, 
<br/>including from our friends on the Opposition benches.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will delve briefly only on the history, but it is important because as the 
<br/></span><span>saying goes, “those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.”  We know of the huge 
<br/></span><span>burden our people suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 when the economy 
<br/>shrank  by  more  than  22  percent.  In  2020,  this  was  the  fourth-largest  contraction  in  all  of  the 
<br/>economies in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But  the  economy  was  not  in  great  shape  even  before  COVID.  In  2019,  it  was  already 
<br/>contracting, and we had negative growth. Our debt to GDP ratio was already rising so that when 
<br/>COVID came along and the Government was forced to borrow to keep the economy afloat, it rose 
<br/>sharply to 90 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While we expect this ratio to fall to just under 80 percent by July, the Government remains
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>505 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>burdened by it.  When Government debt is this high, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot invest freely in the 
<br/>things our people need – roads, water, power, health, education, and housing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  may  say,  I  believe  that  the  Coalition  Government’s  main  point  of 
<br/>difference in its economic management against that of the previous Government, has been to open 
<br/>the books, share information and invite people’s participation in economic management. We urgently 
<br/>convened the Fiscal Review Committee to report to us on tax and other economic measures.  We 
<br/>convened the National Economic Summit and now, we are completing a new National Development 
<br/>Plan.  I will talk more about this shortly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiscal Review Committee Report identified a number of urgent steps that needed to be 
<br/>taken, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The first of these was that the Government was not simply raising enough 
<br/>money, it was critically under-funded for the basic services that our people need, and we entitled to 
<br/>expect.    So,  what  happened,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir?    Because  we  were  not  collecting  enough  taxes, 
<br/>Government debt was allowed to grow.  We sold assets to raise money, such as 44 percent stake in 
<br/>our national electricity company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But most critically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we failed to invest in infrastructure -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everyone in Suva knows what happened to their water supply last month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>We have critical bridges in our road network that may have to be closed down at any time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and must be urgently rebuilt. 
<br/> Large parts of our main hospital are in an unfit state.  
<br/>Our post system urgently requires tens of millions of dollars in investment.   
<br/>Our sanitation infrastructure requires billions.   
<br/>Indeed,  it  was  only  earlier  this  week  that  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works, 
<br/>Meteorological Services and Transport told Parliament that the capital investment bill for 
<br/>his Ministry alone is about $8.5 billion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why am I raising these points, Mr. Speaker, Sir?  Is it to blame the previous Government?  
<br/>No.    It  is  to  ensure  that  the  lessons  of  the  past  are  learned,  and  the  challenges  of  the  future  are 
<br/>understood.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first lesson to take from the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that we must be honest and open 
<br/>with  the  people  about  the  challenges  we  face.    We  believe  that  if  we  share  information  with  the 
<br/>people, and ask them to help and support the Government, they will understand why we have had to 
<br/>know that this has been a concern to many.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Reduce your travel! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Well, when she sees the figures, Mr. Speaker, Sir, she will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stand up from her chair. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We believe that if we share information with the people and ask them to help and support the 
<br/>Government, they will understand why we had to take hard measures, particularly, with the return of 
<br/>VAT reform.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know that this has been a concern to many.  We have tried to manage this by increasing 
<br/></span><span>welfare and other payments for our most vulnerable.  We have also increased the tax burden on the 
<br/></span><span>businesses.  We believe that the people who are willing to inform themselves and understand our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenges, also understand the hard measures we have to take.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our economic management, our first rule will always be to inform, consult 
<br/>and request participation from those outside of the Government.  We may not have yet made good 
<br/>use of our learnings at the first  National Economic Summit and brought people together again to 
<br/>advance the resolutions we arrived at there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Ministry, like many employers, has had to deal with 
<br/>severe personnel challenges this year with an impact on what we can deliver.  We intend to convene 
<br/>another National Economic Summit later in the year, in August or September after the Budget.  The 
<br/>reason for this, Sir, is that we want the Summit to be focused on long-term challenges, not the Budget.  
<br/>By that time .... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- ...we will also have completed.  So, I want to assure everyone 
<br/>that we will continue to consult, to listen and to interact.  And we will also listen carefully to criticism, 
<br/>and I want to hear where we may have gone wrong and the alternative solutions that may be available. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in keeping with this focus on transparency and certainty, I intend to set out 
<br/>publicly in the next few weeks, the key Budget measures that are under consideration before the next 
<br/>National Budget is presented on 28</span><span>th</span><span> June this year. This is so that people can give us their input on 
<br/>these issues ahead of time and to tell us what might be wrong ahead of time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to emphasise the importance we place on consistency, predictability and stability of 
<br/>policy, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are not going to announce sudden changes on Budget night.  We want 
<br/>everyone with a stake in economic management to understand that our approach is to be open and 
<br/>transparent, to set economic and fiscal policy and not to constantly change it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last 18 months, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we managed to  come out of the pandemic with a 
<br/>strong economic rebound of 20 percent in 2022 and 8.2 percent in 2023.  So, we are back at pre-
<br/>pandemic levels now.  But that does not change the fact that our economy is now where it was in 
<br/></span><span>2019.  So, we have lost five years of economic growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tourism industry rebounded strongly with a record of 929,740 visitors, 4 percent higher 
<br/>than 2019 levels.  Our national airline, our hoteliers and all other tourism associated businesses had 
<br/>a year of record profits. Tourism earnings reached a record level of $2.4 billion, which allowed people 
<br/>to go back to jobs and other businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Honourable  Kumar,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  the  most  irritating 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Member of Parliament I have encountered in the last nine years.  She cannot help herself.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Personal remittances rose to a record of $1.25 billion last year, thanks to our people living 
<br/>and  working  overseas.    This  helped  propel  spending  in  the  economy,  and  supported  growth  and 
<br/>income levels of our people.  We have also attracted some major new foreign investment, although 
<br/>much of it remains in the ‘so-called pipeline.  Our job as Government is to get out of the pipeline and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 507 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and onto the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign  reserves,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  remain  at  comfortable  levels  now  and  is  projected  to 
<br/>remain stable in the medium term.  As of yesterday, our reserves position stood at about $3.2 billion, 
<br/>sufficient  to  cover  5.1  months  of  imports  of  goods  and  services.    While  these  reserves  are 
<br/>comfortable, the Reserve Bank of Fiji is managing them prudently, as we expect pressure on reserves 
<br/>in the coming months from higher oil prices and a slowdown in inwards tourism receipts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The healthy reserves position has ensured that the liquidity in the financial system supports 
<br/>low interest rates, which is a key ingredient in driving private sector borrowing and investment.  As 
<br/>of yesterday, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial system liquidity stood at about $1.9 billion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  fiscal  side,  as  I  have  said  earlier,  the  Government  has  decisively  tackled  the  debt 
<br/>problem and introduced a number of revenue reforms, although they are painful, to ensure long term 
<br/>debt sustainability. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- You have increased the debt.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.-  Debt increased.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- You have no idea what you are talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have managed to bring down our debt to GDP ratio from almost 90 percent in 2022 to 
<br/>below 80 percent at the end of this fiscal year - July 2024.  This is, Mr. Speaker, good progress, but 
<br/>we still have a long way to go.  This path of fiscal discipline and debt reduction must continue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, the VAT increase in particular, has had some impact on prices of goods and 
<br/>services to our people.  But if we do not take this bitter medicine now, the consequences would be 
<br/>far more severe and painful, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They have forgotten that the government of which they were 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>part of, had a VAT rate of 15 percent without any exemption for a long time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No running commentaries at the back, please.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Looking  ahead,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  economy  is  now 
<br/>returning to its usual growth trend of about 3 percent, as we had projected in the mid-term fiscal 
<br/>strategy.  We know this is not good enough, and we must do better than this.  Sir, 5 percent per annum 
<br/>is the minimum growth rate that is acceptable.  Once again, Mr. Speaker, we need to stop and look 
<br/>at what our situation is, and what measures we need to take to address them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  and  foremost  is  the  loss  of  skilled  people.    With  Australia  and  New  Zealand  after 
<br/></span><span>COVID-19 and the global labour market restructuring and unprecedented demand in those countries, 
<br/>they opened up their immigration doors to a very, very significant and unprecedented levels.  We 
<br/>have lost about 70,000 to 80,000 people in the last 18 months, many of them with significant technical 
<br/>training  and  experience.  We  cannot  blame  people  for  seeking  the  opportunities  given  to  them  by 
<br/>Australia and New Zealand.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is one of the more reason why Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is so important that we begin to tackle 
<br/>our big social challenges as well.  Some of them, like NCDs, domestic violence, the growing issue 
<br/>of drug use, are generational and require all of us to get involved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The skills lost, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is a major concern for employers and investors.  It is also a 
<br/>threat  to  economic  growth.  We  should  not  forget  that  Government  too  is  an  employer  of  skilled 
<br/>personnel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  own  Ministry,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  lost  a  quarter  of  its  professional  staff  in  the  last  18 
<br/>months, either to immigration or to the private sector. This has been our biggest challenge in some 
<br/>ways in implementing policies, and I know the honourable Minister for Immigration is going to talk 
<br/>about this in his Ministerial Address as to how we are reforming the Immigration Department and 
<br/>how we can improve the processing of work permits so that we can begin to get critical skills into 
<br/>the country and to get businesses, investment and construction to move faster.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  continuing  work  on  streamlining  the  processes  in  our  regulatory 
<br/>agencies. This work is challenging and time consuming. Government is burdened with regulatory 
<br/>processes that are decades old, and a culture which assumes that everyone seeking its help is guilty 
<br/>until proven otherwise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Decision-makers, in some sense, have grown up in a culture where they were afraid to make 
<br/>decisions and one that would displease a particular powerful person that they will be fired.  So, they 
<br/>were cautious and risk averse and reluctant to even make decisions and, of course, Mr. Speaker, we 
<br/>are changing that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  also  made  sure,  Mr.  Speaker,  that  we  have  in  our  approach  of  economic 
<br/>management, open up the discussion and the engagement with our business sector.  And we are told 
<br/>everyday by businesses and investors that they feel much freer, much more confident about investing 
<br/>in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I want to look at some key economic indicators which help us to analyse and 
<br/>assess our economic direction for the year. At this point, the data is pointing to weaker consumer 
<br/>spending against the earlier projections. The loss of so many people in the last 18 months, about 8 
<br/>percent of our population, will clearly impact this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lower consumer spending feeds into lower levels of economic activity and, of course, for 
<br/></span><span>Government, lower tax receipts from income tax and VAT as well, Mr. Speaker.  The recent period 
<br/></span><span>of heavy rain and flooding has also not helped, and it is going to cause some impact on the level of 
<br/>spending and delay some of the investment activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The investment activity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been very positive in the last 12 months to 18 
<br/>months.  Recent indicators point towards a pickup in activity, as major tourism-related projects gain 
<br/>traction. However, we need to build on this momentum and ensure that things are moving on the 
<br/>ground.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all know that we are critically short of skilled construction labour. We are tackling other 
<br/></span><span>factors, such as quickening environmental and planning regulation and where possible, high business 
<br/>cost.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to talk about price inflation. There has been a lot of confusing talk 
<br/>about  this  recently,  and  we  must  all  get  it  right  because  these  are  issues  that  go  to  consumer 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> 509 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confidence and the search for solutions to the cost of living. Only when we have the right data, we 
<br/>can look for the solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The year-on-year headline inflation rate stood at 4.6 percent, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in March 2024, 
<br/>compared to 2.0 percent in March 2023. Why has it increased? The two main causes are the increase 
<br/>in global commodity prices, and the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent in August last 
<br/>year. The VAT increase has been largely absorbed now so we expect inflation to slow to an average 
<br/>of around 3 percent by the end of this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To cushion the impact of inflation and VAT increase on our people, in the last Budget, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we had increased the welfare payments by 25 percent for those above the age of 70, and 
<br/>15 percent for the others. We paid almost $90 million in two rounds of back-to-school payment to 
<br/>almost  220,000  children.  We  had  forgiven  around  $650  million  in  TELS  debt  for  over  53,000 
<br/>families. We reduced import duties on certain food items and more importantly we are focused on 
<br/>rebuilding the economy to ensure that there is more high paying job creation.  In fact, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, the figures from the FCCC shows that a large number of products particularly food items saw a 
<br/>decrease in the prices as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  financial  sector  remains  sound  and  continues  to  support  domestic 
<br/>economic activity.  The private sector credit is showing encouraging signs but remains below pre-
<br/>pandemic trend as  over  $1.1 billion is  approved loans yet  to  be draw down. We are seeing  some 
<br/>major interest in foreign investment but, as I have said earlier, we all need to work harder towards 
<br/>getting this realized on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The global trends, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are watching  the global trends closely, the global 
<br/>economy seems to have slowed down in major trading partners including our source markets. New 
<br/>Zealand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just went into technical recession. The IMF is projecting global growth at 
<br/>3.2 percent in 2024, much lower than the historical average of 3.8 percent between 2000 and 2019.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The disruptions to shipping routes and trade fragmentation policies are expected to impact 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trade and add upward pressure on freight costs, although these effects are yet to be seen. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Production supply deficits…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please round off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It is the first bell, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- One minute left. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Yes, thank you.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issues we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with respect to global trends is the production 
<br/>supply deficits shaped by OPEC policies and the expectation and escalation of the war in Gaza and 
<br/>this is likely to push the price of crude oil to higher levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, we are reminding our people that we have a new economic 
<br/>management approach.  We are involving our people, our businesses and we feel that the approach 
<br/>that we have taken is building confidence, creating as I have said, it is going to result in a level of 
<br/>confidence that we never saw in this country over the last 10 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you are not confused because of the

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confusion  that,  that  statement  brought  to  the  floor  of  Parliament  today,  but  let  me  thank  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial Statement this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have already stated in my earlier address in reply to His Excellency’s Opening of Parliament 
<br/>that  with  all  the  intentions  that  the  Government  has,  the  main  thing  is  for  the  economy,  for  the 
<br/>financial footing of this nation and that is something that we will work towards as well.  In the limited 
<br/>time that I was given this morning to prepare, I just looked into two references. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Reserve Bank of Fiji Economic Review Volume 42 for the period end of March 2024; and  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Mid-Year Fiscal Statement that has been issued by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>through the Ministry of Finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister started his statement this morning on a very positive note stating 
<br/>that the Fijian economy has returned to pre-pandemic GDP level after two years of strong economic 
<br/>recovery.  The recovery, and of course, the growth in 2023 was because of the initiative that was put 
<br/>in place by the FijiFirst Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, post-pandemic Fiji is the fifth fastest growing 
<br/>economy in the world.  May I repeat that, Fiji post-pandemic was the fifth fastest growing economy 
<br/>in the world. That is the solid footing that we handed over to the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  challenge  that  I  keep  raising  to  Government,  and  of  course,  to  the 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance, the forecast for this year is already on a downward trend and the 
<br/>same for 2025.    What is Government going to do?  Are we going to see a positive growth in 2024 
<br/>plus vast the 3.0 percent that has been forecasted because 5 percent to 7 percent in my assessment 
<br/>will be the acceptable footing that we would like to be in.  That is the challenge for the honourable 
<br/>Minister of Finance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I will not go into the economic review because the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Biman 
<br/>Prasad has  stated most of the issues in  there. Of  course, we understand there  are  external  factors 
<br/>particularly the geopolitics, war that is happening, that affects us locally but what are we going to do 
<br/>with  the  influence  that  we  can  have  on  things  that  we  can  control?    That  is  the  challenge  for 
<br/></span><span>Government,  but  the  reality,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  in  the  expenditure.    If  you  look  at  the  six  months 
<br/></span><span>expenditure, there are a few concerns.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  The  forecasted  expenditure  is  $4  billion-plus.  They  have  only 
<br/>expanded $1.9 billion, well over 50 percent in their expenditure.  So, when we are spending below 
<br/>the expenditure forecasted, we are denying the people the services that they deserve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I say that again, we are denying the people the services that they 
<br/>deserve. Too much travel, too much consultations. Where are the tangible benefits that the people 
<br/>will experience out of the budget that we passed in this Parliament last year, Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If I can just quickly go through a few, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Cost of living, you will hear it from

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the honourable Member tomorrow. Cost of living is still increasing. Investments, although positive 
<br/>but it is going at a very slow rate. It is here in this economic report and we hope that we can create 
<br/>the environment so that there can be more in terms of investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Debt, I will have to talk the debt.  He is focussing now on reducing the debt to GDP ratio.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now almost $1 billion has been added to our debt. That is when you include 
<br/>the TELS component loan that you have taken away. You had $600 million already last year and take 
<br/>away  the  TELS  component  is  $1  billion  already.    He  is  very  cunningly  telling  the  people, 
<br/>hoodwinking the  people that debt to GDP ratio has decreased but fiscal debt has increased.  Do not 
<br/>hoodwink the people.  The bottom line is the services to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education,  we  talked  about  the  redeeming  of  bus  cards.  The  carriers  in  Tailevu  are  not 
<br/>operating. They wanted to stop because 11 weeks, honourable Prime Minister, the carrier operators 
<br/>in  Wainibuka  have  not  been  paid.  The  money  is  not  coming.  We  heard  it  from  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Agriculture yesterday, we heard it from the honourable Minister for Rural Development. 
<br/>The money needs to come to the Ministry so that they can perform.  It is one thing to have a budget, 
<br/>it is one thing to tell us all the good things about the economy, but people want to enjoy the benefit. 
<br/>We set that on a solid footing, the challenge is on you now to take it to greater heights. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Leader of 
<br/>the Opposition, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and honourable Members of Parliament, I rise to 
<br/>present a Ministerial Statement that sets light on the transformative potential of Sustainable Aviation 
<br/>Fuel (SAF) in standing at the forefront of aviation’s green revolution.  The potential to strengthen 
<br/>those elements of the agricultural sector involved in the growth of biomass, the green technologies 
<br/>that process the biomass and those who build infrastructure that is needed in selected areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  commercial  aviation’s  climate  change  impact  is  complex,  reflecting  the 
<br/>variety of missions from operations at the surface up to cruise altitudes as high as 43,000 feet across 
<br/>continents and oceans and over varied time spans. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, carbon dioxide is the primary contributor to aircraft emissions, accounting 
<br/>for around 70 percent of the exhaust.  The gas mixes in the atmosphere with the same direct warming 
<br/>effect that occurs when it is emitted from other fossil fuel combustion sources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  these  global  concerns  in  mind,  the  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/></span><span>Organization  (ICAO  convened  a  series  of  conferences  on  Aviation  and  Alternative  Fuels  to 
<br/>coordinate the deployment of alternative fuels in aviation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in November 2009, ICAO convened the CAAF/1 in Rio de Janeiro.  The 
<br/>conference endorsed the use of sustainable alternative fuels for aviation as an important means of 
<br/>reducing aviation emissions and established the ICAO Global Framework for Aviation Alternative 
<br/>Fuels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 2009, significant progress has occurred, including more than 180,000 
<br/></span><span>flights  using  a  blend  of  SAF,  six  airports  regularly  distributing  SAF,  and  evolution  on  the 
<br/>sustainability aspects of these fuels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide some context, sustainable aviation fuels are biofuels that have 
<br/>identical attributes to conventional jet fuel but have an 80 percent lower carbon footprint.  Sir, SAF 
<br/>feedstock  includes  grain,  oilseeds,  sugarcane,  agricultural  leftovers,  used  cooking  oil,  biological 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>waste and animal fat.  Ethanol which is a biofuel produced from plant-derived raw materials like 
<br/>sugarcane and cassava is a crucial component in the production of SAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  follow  up  on  the  developments  on  sustainable  aviation  fuels,  ICAO 
<br/>organised  a  second  conference  in  Mexico  City  in  2017  which  endorsed  2050  ICAO  vision  for 
<br/>sustainable aviation fuels, calling on States, industry stakeholders and other entities to significantly 
<br/>substitute  conventional  aviation  fuels  with  sustainable  aviation  fuels  by  2050  or  net  zero  carbon 
<br/>emissions (CO2) by 2050. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in order to find common ground and identify remaining discrepancies for 
<br/>outcome-oriented discussions at CAAF/3, ICAO in September 2023 held a pre-CAAF/3 outcomes 
<br/>consultation to solicit feedback from states on potential CAAF/3 results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  November  2023,  ICAO  hosted  the  third  conference  on  Aviation 
<br/>Alternative Fuels on CAAF/3 in Dubai.  The goal was to build an ICAO global framework in line 
<br/>with the no country left behind initiative, taking into account national situations and capabilities.  I 
<br/>attended the CAAF/3 at the invitation of the President and the Secretary-General of ICAO.  It was 
<br/>indeed an honour and privilege to be nominated and elected as Chairperson of CAAF/3, which was 
<br/>quite  welcomed  for  Fiji.    The  conference  was  attended  by  1,000  attendees  from  the  four  regions 
<br/>including more than 40 government ministers, government delegations from over 100 countries and 
<br/>representatives from more than 30 international and regional organisations, CEOs of major airlines, 
<br/>fuel production companies and aircraft manufacturers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  aligning  the  perspectives  from  the  four  regions  of  the  world,  each  with 
<br/>different  economic  capabilities  was  indeed  a  challenging  endeavour.    The  aim  was  to  reach  a 
<br/>resolution intended to be presented at the COP28 in Dubai a week after CAAF/3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  chairperson  of  CAAF/3,  I  led  the  adoption  of  new  ICAO  Global 
<br/>Framework for SAF, lower carbon aviation fuels and other aviation cleaner energies.  A collective 
<br/>vision for the clean energy transition, harmonised regulatory foundations, supporting implementation 
<br/>initiatives, and improved access to financing for related initiatives so that no country is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  this  juncture,  I  wish  to  acknowledge  the  substantial  contribution  of 
<br/>honourable Koya who was part of Fiji’s delegation to the ICAO CAAF/3. His support and insights 
<br/>was  indeed  invaluable  to  our  efforts,  exemplifying  bipartisan  cooperation  in  our  shared  quest  for 
<br/>sustainability in the aviation field. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the adoption of a new ICAO Global Framework for SAF, lower carbon 
<br/>aviation  fuels  and  other  aviation  cleaner  energies,  Governments  from  over  100  States,  in 
<br/>collaboration with the industry and civil society have established a target for aviation fuel in 2030 to 
<br/>be 5 percent carbon-intensive than the current fossil fuel. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scale-up of the development and the deployment of SAF, low carbon 
<br/>aviation  fuels  and  other  cleaner  energies  on  a  global  basis,  greater  clarity,  consistency  and 
<br/>predictability to all stakeholders will be possible through the ICAO global framework.  This presents 
<br/></span><span>a significant opportunity for Fiji, particularly concerning ethanol feedstock, given Fiji’s conducive 
<br/></span><span>environment for sugarcane and cassava production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that ADB is funding a feasibility study for Fiji Airways 
<br/>and Fiji  Sugar Corporation for the production of ethanol from  sugarcane and cassava.   Sir, ADB 
<br/>being a Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) will be a key institution in developing SAF.

<br/>Private Investors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when talking with aviation professionals on SAF, I quipped that I never 
<br/>imagined Fiji Airways would be in dialogue with FSC about its future and likewise FSC with Fiji 
<br/>Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is currently a shortage of sustainable aviation fuels. It is necessary to 
<br/>greatly increase the amount of biological and non-biological resources which are the raw materials 
<br/>that are crucial to the SAF production chain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  transition  will  need  to  be  rapid,  scaling  up  supply  of  SAF  from  7.9 
<br/>billion litres in 2025 to potentially 449 billion litres by 2050.  This is against the backdrop of the 
<br/>forecasted demand for jet-fuel at 1.9 trillion litres by 2050.  This rapid deployment calls for huge 
<br/>capital,  amounting  into  trillions  and  after  CAAF/3,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  indications  are  there  that 
<br/>financial institutions are prepared to unlock the required capital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the journey towards sustainability is laden with challenges, yet within these 
<br/>challenges,  the  opportunities  for  innovation  and  progress.  Achieving  economies  of  scale  to  bring 
<br/>down production costs and the high cost of specialised processing required for biofuels remains a 
<br/>primary challenge. Access to the fuel itself poses a significant obstacle in the advancement of SAF. 
<br/>Despite this, the aviation sector expects SAF to become more financially viable as demand for SAF 
<br/>grows and technology advances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  Fiji  it  will  mean  the  cultivation  of  cane  and  cassava  that  is 
<br/>unprecedented.  Factor in the processing and we are looking at an industry that will transform our 
<br/>economy in significant ways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the corridors of this august Parliament where decisions shape destinies, 
<br/></span><span>we  the  policymakers  wield  a  profound  influence  in  steering  the  course  of  SAF  adoption.    It  is 
<br/></span><span>imperative that we foster policies that nurture SAF deployment, policies that transcend borders and 
<br/>industries,  policies  that  embrace  technological  neutrality  and  feedstock  scepticism.  Let  us  be  the 
<br/>architects of change, crafting a path to progress guided by the principles of sustainability and equity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we navigate the complexities of SAF production and distribution, it is 
<br/>imperative to leverage the insights garnered from the outcomes of CAAF/3. The Conference adopted 
<br/>a global framework for cleaner energy in aviation, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goals  and  efforts  to  combat  climate  change.  It  underscores  the  aviation  sector’s  commitment  to 
<br/>improving  fuel  efficiency  and  reducing  carbon  emissions,  with  aspirations  for  net-zero  carbon 
<br/>emissions by 2050.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, 
<br/>the  journey  towards  sustainability  has  its  challenges,  yet  it  is  also  one  filled  with  promise  and 
<br/>possibility.  The SAF is no longer just an idea from clever people in laboratory coats, it is a must for

<div><span>low carbon travel.  The industry players, passengers, farmers and the planet will all benefit from the 
<br/>technology.  Let us make the aviation industry cleaner and greener, and let us start now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me just say first of, I want to thank the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister for the invitation that took across both of us to Dubai for this particular ICAO 
<br/>Conference.  I think it is quite important to realise that this is not about politics, this was about Fiji.  
<br/>It was about the betterment of Fiji, and I think it is important that we do realise that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest fuel emission problems actually comes from commercial 
<br/>aviation, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel is something that should form a large component of the way 
<br/>forward with respect to how aviation fuels are dealt with.  As pointed out by the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  it  is  extremely  important  that  we  do  something  about  it  because  it  is  a  massive 
<br/>opportunity for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  the  Conference  itself,  we  saw  that  the  whole  of  Africa  was  being  given  assistance  by 
<br/>Europe, yet the Pacific was left behind, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji were the only representatives 
<br/>from the Pacific. So, this requires a conversation with Australia and New Zealand when we actually 
<br/>do this, this requires a conversation with our development partners as to how we can do it, because 
<br/>this falls in line with what we all speak about in terms of diversification.  It could revolutionise our 
<br/>sugar industry.  It is very important that we realise that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  particular  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuel’s  issue  touches  on  three 
<br/>Ministries;  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  the  Ministry  of  Sugar.    It  is  very 
<br/>important that something is done now.  I hope honourable Minister of Finance will also start looking 
<br/>at some provisions that can be made, maybe incentivise things from now about the development of 
<br/>these fuels, because it can mean a whole lot of income for Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Airways is partially using these fuels, I understand also, they have flights that have gone 
<br/>across on totally Sustainable Aviation Fuels  right  across from  the US  into the Middle East.   It  is 
<br/>something that is moving forward at a very fast rate.  We all are very hot- headed about the sugar 
<br/>industry from both sides of Parliament, but this is something that can actually turn the sugar industry 
<br/>around.  It is something that needs to be desperately quickly looked at with respect to how we can 
<br/>actually develop this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we also found at the Conference that there is a pushback from the larger 
<br/>fuel producing nations.  If you look at Saudi Arabia and other fuel producing nations, there is still a 
<br/></span><span>pushback from them.  They are not saying, “no”, but they are still looking at it in terms of how much 
<br/></span><span>can we do, how much should we do, and of course, it is only natural because they produce fuels.  
<br/>However, it is an opportunity that we may be able to capitalise on.  As I said earlier on, the Pacific 
<br/>was only represented by Australia and New Zealand, and my conversations with them were that they 
<br/>would be happy to chat with us to see what can be done and get an infrastructure drawn up to see 
<br/>how we can benefit in terms of Fiji, and we are talking about Qantas and everyone else that might be 
<br/>involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, it would not only be just for us, it is also for export, and if I could 
<br/></span><span>just quickly let you know, the price of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is quite high still.  So you get a 
<br/></span><span>good return if you are actually producing these things, because it is quite high, it is still looked at or 
<br/>frowned upon.  I am happy to hear that ADB is actually involved in getting this done and I really 
<br/>hope  that  the  honourable  Minister  of  Finance  will  start  looking  at  maybe  how  we  can  actually 
<br/>incentivise this particular area.  I am not sure if he can do it in this budget or the next budget, but at 
<br/>least start thinking about how we can actually do it.  It is a very important aspect of our diversification 
<br/>that  we  actually  talk  about,  and  it  helps  three  different  Ministries.    It  is  not  just  about  sugarcane

<div><span>producing ethanol, it is about cassava and many other different foods that it actually produces.  We 
<br/>can do it.  It is not something that cannot be done, we can do it.  Once again, Sir, that is all I really 
<br/>have to say.  I want to thank the honourable Viliame Gavoka for allowing us the opportunity to join 
<br/>him on the ICAO Conference.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, if I am to allow the learned Attorney-General to take

<br/>now take a break for tea and before we rise on this occasion, I invite the students and members of the

<div><span>Ministry of Justice 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  and  fellow 
<br/>Members  of  this  august  Parliament,  members  of  the  public  in  Parliament  and  those  joining  us 
<br/>virtually through livestream media; good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  today  to  emphasise  the  unwavering  commitment  of  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government to improve the lives of our citizens and lead our nation towards effective governance.  
<br/>Our administration is founded on the principles of good governance, accountability and transparency, 
<br/>which serves as the cornerstone of democracy.  This commitment is reflected in our efforts to uphold 
<br/>the rule of law and ensure justice for our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Justice is actively engaged in refining its business strategy and enhancing 
<br/>customer  experiences  through  systematic  feedback  collection  and  deployment  of  quality 
<br/>management tools.  We aim to ensure that our services are not only efficient but also customer centric.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is also developing a Strategic Development Plan for the next five years which 
<br/>will  be  aligned  to  the  National  Development  Plan,  focusing  on  leadership  excellence,  digital 
<br/>transformation, customer empowerment and fostering an enabling environment for engagement.  We 
<br/>aim to bolster our capacity to address complex challenges and enhance stakeholders’ collaboration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry acknowledges the importance of preserving and accessing vital records and is 
<br/>in the initial stages of exploring ways to digitise its processes.  The digitisation of our systems and 
<br/>processes will improve the accessibility and efficiency in processing requests to better service our 
<br/>customers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have obtained a Cabinet approval to carry out digitisation works in consultation with the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Communications, as well as other relevant stakeholders on the 
<br/>digitisation of our legal Registries, prioritising the Registrar of Titles Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also shortening our processing times which, in the past, have taken up to three months.  
<br/>We have managed to significantly reduce our processing time to one month and reduce our response 
<br/>time to inquiries from one day to half-a-day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our Birth, Deaths and Marriages Registry, we are looking at offering free birth certificates 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for registration made within a month of a child’s birth to incentivise early registration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  also  increasing  accessibility  to  Justice  of  Peace  (JP)  services  in  our  community. 
<br/>Currently, we have 596 JPs in total with 278 in the Central and Eastern Division, 215 in the Western 
<br/>Division and 68 in the Northern division.  We expect to increase these numbers, given the number of 
<br/>applications we have received. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have gone through our awareness and talanoa session and reached out 
<br/></span><span>to members of the communities as the need for those former civil servants or those in the community 
<br/></span><span>to apply for JP so that they speed up the services.  One good example is that in the island of Koro, 
<br/>there is only one JP, in the island of Gau, there is only one and in Levuka there are few.  There is a 
<br/>misconception that there is a limited number of JPs in one locality.  Through our talanaoa sessions 
<br/>and awareness, we hope to probably double the number of JPs this year, so that we can reach out to 
<br/>our citizens.

<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  allow  me  to  briefly  highlights  some  of  the  significant  work  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government agencies under my responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In October last year, the Fiji Corrections Service concluded its Job Evaluation Exercise (JEE) 
<br/>for all positions. This is a significant  achievement,  as the last evaluation was done in  2006.  The 
<br/>implementation of the JEE Report is in line with Government  Staff Retention Policy that aims to 
<br/>align staff renumeration to the market rate.  We hope to implement this during the financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, the Fiji Corrections Service successfully held this year’s Yellow Ribbon Walk 
<br/>for the first time in Northern Division (Labasa) since its inception back in 2008.  This is a milestone 
<br/>achievement,  recording  more  than  3,500  participants,  reflecting  the  community  support  for  the 
<br/>rehabilitation initiative.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The event raised awareness of the importance of rehabilitation through various activities and 
<br/>provided  practical  pathways  for  the  reintegrating  of  our  inmates  into  society  with  dignity  and 
<br/>purpose. This event was held alongside Macuata Yellow Ribbon Symposium which established the 
<br/>Care Network Committee made up of the 12 heads of the </span><span>Tikina</span><span> representatives.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover, the Fiji Corrections Service recently signed a Memorandum of 
<br/>Understanding  (MOU)  with  the Fiji  National  University to  train  and develop  the Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service staff to ensure their competency and enhance their productivity, as well as upskilling inmates 
<br/>with tools and opportunities to become more productive members of society when they are released.  
<br/>This is a significant milestone, as the two parties formalise their partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  Director  of  Public  Prosecutions  is  currently  developing  its  five-year 
<br/>Strategic Plan which they plan to launch in early July.  Unfortunately, this Office has not had any 
<br/>strategic plan for the past decade.  This new initiative to formulate a strategic and intentional plan 
<br/>indicates the Office of the DPP will become more efficient each year as it focusses on delivering its 
<br/>constitutionally mandated role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Office  of  the  DPP  is  also  focussed  on  cybercrime  training  due  to  the  increase  in 
<br/>cybercrime.  The Office of the DPP will host a conference which will be held on 13</span><span>th</span><span> June to 14</span><span>th</span><span> of 
<br/>June,  which  is  co-funded  by  the  Council  of  Europe  and  the  United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs  and 
<br/>Crime (UNODC), to familiarise prosecutors with cybercrime and digital evidence in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office of the DPP also  saw a significant  increase in  hard drug cases. Early this year, 
<br/></span><span>relevant authorities seized 4.1 tonnes of methamphetamine in Nadi that resulted in the arrest of 10 
<br/></span><span>individuals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In March alone, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 33 people were charged with serious offences, including 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>murder, aggravated robbery and attempted drug exportation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An interim board has been appointed to oversee the Accident Compensation Commission of 
<br/>Fiji (ACCF).  The Coalition Government had agreed to review the function of ACCF.  A new Board 
<br/>has been  appointed to  ensure that the ACCF statutory functions continue,  while the review of its 
<br/></span><span>future takes place.  The Board is currently chaired by the Permanent Secretary for Employment and 
<br/></span><span>the Acting Chairman is the Acting CEO of LTA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Office of the Attorney-General  provides critical  advisory role to  the 
<br/>Government  in  ensuring  policies  and  processes  are  legally  compliant.    To  enable  this,  we  have 
<br/>managed to secure funding for 24 positions which have subsequently been filled. Currently, for the 
<br/>next budget, we have made a submission to the Ministry of Finance for the recruitment of four more

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lawyers in the Attorney-General’s Chambers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Law  Reform  Commission  which  was  previously  located  within  the  Office  of  the 
<br/>Attorney-General,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  has  now  moved  to  its  new  designated  Office  beside  Civic 
<br/>Towers.  Based  on  its  budgetary  allocation,  the  Commission  has  also  recruited  legal  officers  and 
<br/>administrative staff to support its functions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Justice  is  also  responsible  for  overseeing  the  Financial  Intelligence  Unit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(FIU), as articulated yesterday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this moment to congratulate the new National Flying Fijians Head 
<br/>Coach of Fiji, Mr. Mick.  Let me just, in my role as the Minister responsible for the Fiji Rugby Union 
<br/>(FRU), briefly highlight some of the work that has been done in terms of governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  speak,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  completed  the  work  in  terms  of  how  financial 
<br/>management should be administered in the FRU.  Currently, there is a draft constitution in circulation 
<br/>between some of the lawyers to be issued to all the unions.  This was lacking all these years and we 
<br/>hope that in the next two months, the Interim Committee has until July to complete its work and then 
<br/>we will hand over to the new administrators of FRU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  speaking  on  FRU,  may  I  echo  my  observations  in  terms  of  the  issue 
<br/>confronting FRU.  Fiji and the Fiji Rugby Committee have worked hard in its efforts to advance the 
<br/>professional establishment of the Drua with its current distinguished standing, and I offer my best 
<br/>wishes for the Fijian Drua and Fijiana Drua on their game on Friday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I strongly emphasise the importance on facilitating the progression of local talents within the 
<br/>professional  framework.    In  line  with  recent  discussions  held  with  World  Rugby,  it  has  become 
<br/>evident that there is a critical need to equip our local coaches with enhanced professional capabilities, 
<br/>especially in lead coaching environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hence, I kindly endorse the incorporation of our local coaches into the professional structure 
<br/>of Drua.  This decision will not only elevate and boost the interest levels amongst our local coaches, 
<br/>but also foster the belief that they possess and the potential to coach high level professional teams in 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now briefly summarise a few key legislative initiatives that the Office of 
<br/></span><span>the Attorney-General is working on with relevant Government Ministries and Departments in order 
<br/></span><span>to bring this august Parliament proposed amendments and Bills: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Anti-Doping Bill, Cabinet has approved the Anti-Doping Bill policy which requests 
<br/>the establishment of the anti-doping organisation to promote clean sports and ensure compliance with 
<br/>international anti-doping standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To put this policy into action, the National Anti-Doping Bill has been drafted to provide a 
<br/>regulatory framework and programmes on Fiji’s compliance with international standards for doping 
<br/></span><span>in sports.  We anticipate that this Bill will be tabled in Parliament by the third quarter of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Traditional  Knowledge  and  Cultural  Expression  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  traditional 
<br/>knowledge and cultural expressions are the foundation of intellectual property.  Developing countries 
<br/>like  Fiji  must  develop  policies  to  protect  intellectual  property  rights  and  preserve  their  cultural 
<br/>heritage.  They can turn into commercially viable products and services for tangible and intangible 
<br/>wealth.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 519 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the current system of accessing genetic resources and using traditional knowledge 
<br/>and cultural expressions has been repeatedly abused, exploiting the limited resources of indigenous 
<br/>societies.  A legislative framework is needed to protect them.  The Ministry of iTaukei and the Office 
<br/>of  the  Attorney-General  will  collaborate  on  consultations  regarding  the  protection  of  traditional 
<br/>knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consultations on the draft Bill with relevant stakeholders is ongoing.  It is part of the 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legislative programme and will be given priority for full realisation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Meteorological  and  Hydrological  Services  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji 
<br/>Meteorological and Hydrological Services currently lack a guiding law that oversees their functions.  
<br/>As Fiji has experienced tropical weather due to climate change, a proper legal framework is necessity 
<br/>to protect lives and property.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Meteorological Services has been working on a draft Bill with our Office, which we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anticipate will be tabled in Parliament by the third quarter of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  Personal  Insolvency  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  new  Bill  aims  to  replace  the 
<br/>Bankruptcy  Act  1944.    The  Bill  offers  an  alternative  bankruptcy,  establishes  a  clear  creditor  and 
<br/>debtor rights and aligns with international best practices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is collaborating all these projects by providing 
<br/>drafters who are familiar with insolvency systems worldwide.  Cabinet approval is expected before 
<br/>holding public consultations in June with tabling in Parliament planned before the end of this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  conclude,  I  would  like  to  give  my  congratulations  to  both  the 
<br/>Ovalau Team and Ra Team that will be playing for the Vanua Quarterfinal at Nasau Park on Saturday, 
<br/>as well as the Under 20 of Ovalau and Taveuni.  May the best team wins.  </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the Leader of Opposition or his designate, I would  
<br/>like  to  mention  a  few  issues  that  you  raised  since  you  have  also  reported  in  Parliament  on  FRU 
<br/>decisions, policies, et cetera. Before I do so, I would like to acknowledge members of the public 
<br/>sitting in the gallery, especially Mr. Rasova and Mr. Rajesh Singh, the two stalwarts of rugby. They 
<br/>are very crazy rugby enthusiasts. The Kadavu President is sitting behind them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why I am saying this, honourable Attorney General, it is so nice to hear you relay the current 
<br/></span><span>position of the FRU because what we had encountered on our way to Dubai to attend the COP 28 
<br/></span><span>meeting was the Fiji Team. They slept on the corridors of the airport. There was no money. They did 
<br/>not have the warm up and warm down clothing that was required and then I was asked to deliver the 
<br/>jerseys to them before they played and that is what they wore during their warm up, right through the 
<br/>game and they lost. As soon as they lost, I stood up and walked out because I am a bad loser. I always 
<br/>want to win. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Attorney General, it will be grateful  if you take note of that because that was 
<br/>what the Coach Ben Gollings, Vili Satala and the rest of the team encountered whilst in Dubai. It is 
<br/></span><span>a sad occasion, being highly placed in the Sevens ranking, yet they had to sleep on the veranda of the 
<br/></span><span>airport in Sydney because when the last aircraft comes in, soon after that, they close down.  Everyone 
<br/>has to go outside, including the Fiji Team that was inside.  Yet when we arrived in Dubai, they were 
<br/>glorified again. “Oh no! These people have just woken up from the veranda of the airport outside.” 
<br/>So, again, it places the team in a very awkward situation and whilst the Team is written all over the 
<br/>place as the best, yet this is what they are encountering and that affects their morale.  We know as 
<br/>rugby players, once your morale is affected, 100 percent performance is not there.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will offer the floor now to the honourable Leader of Opposition or his designate, to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the Ministerial Statement by 
<br/>the honourable Attorney General. From the outset, this side of Parliament in hearing the honourable 
<br/>Attorney General’s response this morning, it is too broad - covering many various Ministries that 
<br/>come under him. It shows that the honourable Attorney General has been sleeping on the job for too 
<br/>long. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that Ministerial Statements would have been divided into two parts, probably in the last 
<br/>sitting and this week’s sitting, it would have come in various simple topics. But he has covered a lot, 
<br/>it shows that he has not been doing his work and also his core responsibility is to Parliament and that 
<br/>is the Bills.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Attorney General’s response this morning is full of hollow promises. He has 
<br/>talked about good governance, transparency and efficiency but what the public has seen so far is the 
<br/>exact opposite. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.M.D. BULITAVU.- …especially in terms of the Attorney-General’s performance, Mr. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  talk  about  transparency,  people  are  saying  in  the  social  media  that  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General  is  under  investigation.    People  are  saying  whether  the  honourable  Attorney-
<br/>General  should  step  aside  if  he  needs  to  preach  about  transparency.    He  needs  to  start  with  the 
<br/>Principal Legal Advisor of Government, if we are to talk about good governance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there is also a view from the public that given the honourable Attorney-General holds a 
<br/>very important office, that there is an element of interference.  I am not saying that the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General is interfering with their own cases but, again, due to transparency, there needs to 
<br/>be checks and balances and this is what the people are saying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- The honourable Attorney-General also needs to think nationally.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He is too focussed on Lomaiviti all its islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Bulitavu, remember Lomaiviti has nightclubs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- In terms of consultation in the past, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with other 
<br/>Bills, I hope that the honourable Attorney-General moves around Fiji in the14 Provinces and Rotuma 
<br/>to do his consultation before he brings the Bills into Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  has  also  been  a  complaint  from  the  public  in  terms  of  the  Accident  Compensation 
<br/>Commission Fiji (ACCF).  I think there was no Board for the last few months and there is a slow in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 521 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>payout.  So,  I  hope  the  honourable  Attorney-General  puts  a  Board  in  place  so  that  people  are 
<br/>effectively and efficiently served from what he has alluded to this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome the Job Evaluation Exercise for the Ministry of Justice and also the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service which is quite outstanding.  They have been bringing up their issues to the Opposition as 
<br/>well and even the Committee when they moved around to the Correctional Centres in the last few 
<br/>months.  I hope that it comes in the next financial year, honourable Attorney-General.  You have to 
<br/>convince the honourable Minister of Finance, given its very important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Not  only  that  we  support  the  Yellow  Ribbon  project  and  the  road  to  acceptance,  but  the 
<br/>important thing too is to see that we retain our Correction Officers that we are losing to new Zealand 
<br/>and Australia given the staff turnover that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker, Sir, in regards to FRU, we had plenty issues when the interim committee came 
<br/>in, you were very vocal at that time honourable Attorney-General. But now, people are complaining 
<br/>about this selection of the new Flying Fijians Coach.  The very people who had supported you when 
<br/>you brought in this interim committee are not happy with the selection.  I do not know what is really 
<br/>wrong, whether we are not complying to IRB standards, these are some of the things that you look 
<br/>into.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the Fijian Drua initiative, that was started by the FijiFirst Government and thank you for 
<br/>continuing it.  But for your core functions, I hope the Bills that you have outlined this morning will 
<br/>come under Standing Orders 83 and 84. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- You have first reading, second reading and third reading, and then 
<br/>go into Committee of the whole.  That is something that needs to be seen and you have not done that.  
<br/>Even in the last sitting, you have been bringing in Bills that are under Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, will be very much aware that he had presented a Bill back in 2005 and 2006 
<br/>then in the previous Parliament where it came through Standing Orders 83 and 84 -  First Reading, 
<br/>Second Reading, committed into Standing Committee and come back into Clause by Clause before 
<br/>we go into Third Reading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I hope that you bring those Bills under those right procedures, and we look forward for Bills 
<br/></span><span>to come in a timely manner and also they do not come in the shortcut manner.  I hope that Government 
<br/></span><span>has taken what the Opposition have said this morning and to be more transparent, more efficient and 
<br/>practice good governance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>State of Immigration Services  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.-  Mr. Speaker, honourable Prime Ministers, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Ministers,  my  colleague  honourable  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers  and  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament and my fellow Fijians; first of all,  before I speak on the topic for which my Ministerial 
<br/></span><span>Statement is based today, I would like to take a short moment to share with Parliament an event that 
<br/></span><span>is happening right now at the RSL Club, where the honourable Prime Minister is joining the members 
<br/>of the RFMF’s current and ex-serving members, particularly those who served with the first Battalion 
<br/>Fiji Infantry Regiment as part of Bat19 on 18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 1996.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today, they are remembering an event which is widely referred to as Operation Grapes of 
<br/>Wrath of the wrath of God.  During this incident, the headquarters of the Fiji Battalion in United 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nations  Interim  Force  in  Lebanon  (UNIFIL)  was  bombarded.    I  was  the  Site  Commander  or  the 
<br/>Tactical Commander of that camp, and commanding us was Colonel Waqanivavalagi, who I believe 
<br/>is there today.  Our Contingent Commander was Colonel Raivoce.  I was the Battalion Adjutant and 
<br/>the OC of the battalion headquarters company and Tactical Commander of the camp in Qana.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> During that incident or shelling by the IDF, it killed approximately 200 men, women and 
<br/>children that were under our care.  In it, six Fijian soldiers were seriously injured.  This is very much 
<br/>an unknown  event,  and today these soldiers are  here to remember this  event.    It  reminds us, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the cost of war in the world today and the price of peace.  It is something that we should 
<br/>always strive for.  Every morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you recite a prayer for all on our behalf, that is, 
<br/>you pray for peace in Fiji and the world.  Today is the day we remember the sacrifice of those who 
<br/>gave their lives to be able to give us all a favourable condition to live in the world today.  I wish them 
<br/>well and a blessed day of remembrance to all our ex-servicemen who are there today, particularly, 
<br/>the members of the Bat19 of 1FIR UNIFIL. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to inform Parliament of measures recently taken by our Ministry to 
<br/>address  the  current  challenges  faced  by  us,  first  on  the  issues  of  passport  to  Fijian  citizens,  and 
<br/>second, on the delays in processing work permits.  We have taken note of the significant public and 
<br/>media criticism for our performance in these two areas.  It is appropriate that I inform Parliament of 
<br/>the current situation and the actions that we are taking. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> On the matter of passport issues, for a good part of 2023 and for all of 2024, Fiji has faced 
<br/>an unprecedented movement of its people to jobs abroad, some of its permanent migration and some 
<br/>of it for temporary work. Australia and New Zealand, in particular have opened their borders in a 
<br/>way we have never previously seen in order to obtain the workforce that they need.  Our people have 
<br/>responded in their thousands to the work opportunities created.  There is also increased demand for 
<br/>leisure and other travels by Fiji citizens, all of which requires them to obtain or renew passports. We 
<br/>have tried to anticipate increased demand for Department of Immigration services since last year. 
<br/>The Department had outgrown its previous offices and undertook a planned move to new offices in 
<br/>Suva  last  month.  This,  of  course,  disrupted  our  services</span><span> </span><span>to  passport  applications  which  has 
<br/>compounded the already challenging situation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  for  the  information  of  Parliament,  the  volume  of  passport  applications  has 
<br/>increased  sharply  since  2021  and  are  now  between  4,000  and  6,000  passports  per  month.    The 
<br/>Department  is  responding  to  the  demand  despite  the  challenges.    We  face  a  number  of  systems 
<br/>problems with printing, computer networks and other exceptional circumstances in the face of this 
<br/></span><span>unprecedented demand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, there was some publicity recently when it was reported that passport applicants 
<br/>were queueing up for service as early as 4 a.m. daily. We have responded by opening up our offices 
<br/>as early as 6 a.m. to accommodate them and on some days beginning the registration process as early 
<br/>as 7 a.m. We are planning to open also on Saturday mornings.  We have suffered challenges with a 
<br/>smaller  number  of  passports  which  are  applied  for  through  our  overseas  missions,  some  systems 
<br/>issues are causing delays for about 250 of these applications and we are moving now to address these.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note that despite the difficulties we face, we are delivering passports to most 
<br/></span><span>applicants within five to seven working days, urgent passport applications are processed within two 
<br/>to  three  working  days.    By  any  standard  around  the  world,  this  is  quick  processing.    We  have 
<br/>identified the problems we are facing and the resources we need.  We have had the support of both, 
<br/>the Ministry of Finance which has given us more money for staff and overseas donors helping us 
<br/>with  process  improvements.  So  overall,  Mr.  Speaker,  we  should  see  a  general  improvement  in 
<br/>services in the next few months.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  I  now  turn  to  work  permit  applications.    The  outflow  of  our  people  has 
<br/>created  an  unprecedented  demand  for  expatriate  labour  at  all  levels.    This  ranges  from  tertiary 
<br/>educated professionals, and managerial employees to trades people, to construction workers and all 
<br/>categories in between. We are receiving work permit applications at the rate of 500 to 800 per month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will shortly be issuing a policy direction pursuant to 44(4) of the Immigration Act 2003 to 
<br/>take immediate steps to address the current backlog on the issues of work permits. This message, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, I intended to take effect on 1</span><span>st</span><span>May, 2024 although some are already in place. I recognise 
<br/>the current backlog of two to four months in the processing of work permit applications, sometimes 
<br/>longer, is threatening economic growth and investor confidence.  This has been highlighted by both 
<br/>the business community and a number of authoritative official sources as Fiji’s most critical short 
<br/>term economic.  Our policy actions takes time to work through the system. If decisions are not taken 
<br/>now, it will be too late to change Fiji’s 2024 economic growth trajectory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The loss of skills in all areas slows economic activity, it also delays the capital expenditure.  
<br/>Construction  is  critical  to  economic  growth  and  to  generating  economic  activity  from  completed 
<br/>projects  such  as  hotels,  retail  centres  and  private  facilities.    At  a  higher  functional  level  without 
<br/>accountants, engineers, IT and other professionals, essential analytical work is stalled and adds to the 
<br/>lead time to establishing the feasibility and design of major public and private sector projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  even  at  lower  level  of  skills,  the  construction  industry  being  the  best  example, 
<br/>employment  of  expatriates  is  critical.  This  is  one  of  the  challenges  the  Government  is  facing  in 
<br/>ensuring efficient capital investment in its own capital expenditure  programme under the national 
<br/>budget  with  the  resulting  losses  to  public  welfare.  Fiji  employers  are  competing  with  other 
<br/>destinations  for  expatriate  employees.    They  complain  that  after  incurring  the  time  and  cost  of 
<br/>recruitment and documenting employment contracts, they lose their nominated employees to other 
<br/>countries because of the wait for their Fiji permits.  They cannot see things improving so they prefer 
<br/>to sell their future investment projects or even scale down their current activities until things improve.  
<br/>So, we have taken note of these issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to recognise that the business and investment 
<br/>community must see that action is being taken now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medium term actions we are taking, the urgent need for skills will continue for some years 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, so long term measures are needed to ensure things do not get worse than they are.  
<br/>Work is being done with the Growth Reset Sub-Committee of Immigration Investment to simplify 
<br/>permit forms and requirements of future applications.  This will mean simpler form filling and shorter 
<br/>processing likely to be implemented by the end of June.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2024-2025 Budget will fund more processing staff at the Department of Immigration and 
<br/>the Government of Australia is supporting the Department with training and document management 
<br/>system.  However,  these  measures  will  not  necessarily  address  the  current  backlog,  there  are 
<br/>approximately 1,000 applications for work permits in the system requiring processing and this must 
<br/>be moved out now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our immediate measures to clear the current backlog: Delegated powers, the first step we 
<br/>have taken as a Department is to ensure that the Director of Immigration holds delegated powers 
<br/></span><span>from the Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs to deal with work and investor permits.  This should 
<br/></span><span>speed up processing as it eliminates one additional level of authority in the Immigration system and 
<br/>avoid duplication of effort.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eliminating  delays in  key processing, we have also  taken steps to  better manage payment 
<br/>processes  in  the  Department.    Previously,  it  took  some  time  for  application  sheet  payment  to  be 
<br/>processed which demanded Immigration Department officers from beginning work on the relevant 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>application.  A  new  process  is  being  followed  now  where  processing  of  the  application  begins 
<br/>immediately  and  does  not  await  the  issue  of  revenue  receipt.    Of  course,  all  payments  must  be 
<br/>processed and verified before any work permit is issued but the payment process is now running in 
<br/>parallel with the application process, not one after the other.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The expedition for work permit applications promoted by qualified employers.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, as part of medium-term measures referred to in the paragraph above, the Director of Immigration 
<br/>will compile and issue a qualified employer list. The qualified employer list will comprise employers 
<br/>who in the reasonable opinion of the Director have a good track record as employers are capable of 
<br/>supporting compliance with work permit conditions and whose employees have not breached permit 
<br/>conditions or laws relating to immigration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  one  or  two  other  criteria,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  these  are  the  main  ones.    Any 
<br/>employer  may  apply  by  letter  to  the  Director  to  be  listed  as  qualified  employer.    The  qualified 
<br/>employer list will be regularly reviewed and updated by the Director. This will take a little time for 
<br/>some employers, and we ask for their patience while we bet down the new system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want us to briefly talk about how qualified employer applications are to 
<br/>be made and processed.  The precise criteria for an application promoted by a qualified employer 
<br/>must be left flexible in the discretion of the Director to ensure that the Director is free to act in the 
<br/>most facilitative way.  However, we intend in the case of qualified employer application to have a 
<br/>streamlined process that does not require proof of local advertising or evaluation of local candidates.  
<br/>Provided there is a properly completed application form, an employment contract and satisfactorily 
<br/>police and health clearances, these applications will receive priority processing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other  streamlining  measures  to  be  announced,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  measures  I  had 
<br/>mentioned are the first  in a series of further streamlining measures we intend to  rollout.  We  are 
<br/>currently reviewing a quicker process for applicants of offshore employers who are required to visit 
<br/>Fiji  as  part  of  their  overseas  employees’  requirements.    We  also  intend  to  look  at  a  streamlined 
<br/>process for employees of the so-called crop agencies, that is, the agencies who are members of the 
<br/>Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, once these measures are taken, we will be looking at easing the work permit 
<br/>processes for spouses or permit holders and accredited diplomats and then moving on a faster process 
<br/>for volunteer permits.  There is  a concentrated plan of action to speed up the processing of work 
<br/>permits, and I wish to assure Parliament, affected employers and of course permit holders themselves, 
<br/></span><span>that we are working on this as fast as we can.  Immigration is always a sensitive area. We must respect 
<br/></span><span>our obligations to Fiji citizens, and we must also take into account national security and other boarder 
<br/>control matters in making immigration decisions.  However, we recognise a clear economic reward 
<br/>that is available if we can make our processes more efficient.  We are seriously focussed on those 
<br/>outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I sit down, I would like to acknowledge some of the sentiments that were 
<br/>echoed in  Parliament earlier this morning coming particularly  from the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition about the benefits of economic growth. It is the only thing really that as we as a nation, 
<br/></span><span>if we do not have are unable to look after our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I, as a person responsible for our national security will do all within my best to ensure that 
<br/>our people are safe particularly under the initiatives that we offer as a Government, but we recognise 
<br/>as well that security is also enabled by making sure that our people have got money in their pockets 
<br/>and have got jobs where they can earn and look after their families. So, it is my job to make sure that 
<br/>my Ministry allows, that Government allows these two very important aspects of our society to work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 525 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>together and be mindful that we need to continue to look after our country and its security whilst at 
<br/>the same time create opportunities for our people in creating work and generating particularly money 
<br/>and wealth to look after their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Sir, thank you very much for allowing me the opportunity to share 
<br/>with you in Parliament the initiatives that we are taking and I ask for the support of Parliament on 
<br/>this initiative and as rightfully acknowledged, particularly all the time by the other side of Parliament, 
<br/>we need to work together to make things work because the benefits of this can only be for our people. 
<br/>It is not cast in concrete, we will continue to review it to make sure our systems are safe and that our 
<br/>people have the opportunity to look after their own families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Minister for his statement on the 
<br/>improvements to the immigration service and I wish the Department well in the changes that he has 
<br/>outlined  and  hopefully  it  will  improve  the  services  with  immigration  from  where  it  is  now  and 
<br/>drastically improving for the better.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we look at immigration service, a big part of it is counter service when we are looking 
<br/>after the visa, permits, I think there are 19 permits that they issue and the passport services - ordinary, 
<br/>official and diplomatic services.  One thing with the Department of Immigration is, you need hands, 
<br/>you need people because at the end of the day most of the work that they do, they need to see the 
<br/>persons standing in front of them when they are making decisions or when they are issuing either 
<br/>passports or permits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But the other big part of immigration work is also enforcement. In addition to them being a 
<br/>conduit to economic growth, I agree with what the honourable Minister said, they have a big role to 
<br/>filter out the unwanted, those that we would not want to come into our country and cause us trouble. 
<br/>In my last travel when I came out from Immigration, I was talking to the Immigration Officer at Nadi 
<br/>Airport and he was only one. There was only one moving back and forth from arrival, if there was a 
<br/>case in arrival or at departure and he was complaining to me, “I am the only one available.”  He has 
<br/>to go between arrivals and departure to deal with the cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 500 to 800 work permits per month shows the number of foreigners who 
<br/>are wanting to come into our country to work because work permits are only for non-citizens, those 
<br/>that want to come in.  Therein lies this problem of human trafficking.  I raise my concern on this 
<br/>business visa where they come on business visa and just go to work and they are allowed to work, 
<br/>and given the enforcement agency also, how do you track it?  Who is coming on a business visa and 
<br/></span><span>working? Who is responsible for them?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was surprised when the honourable Minister for Sugar said that he had brought in a few 
<br/>people to come and work for him from Bangladesh in his sugar plantation, but then he said that if 
<br/>they do not find work with him, they can go and work in another farm and I know that is not allowed 
<br/>in Immigration policies.  The person that brings them in, you cannot just send them away again and 
<br/>go and work somewhere else because there is a responsibility of those that brought them in.   I am 
<br/>not too sure which permit they are coming in, but I think that needs to be checked as well. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Standing Order 62(1). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. I find nothing wrong with what the honourable Naupoto was 
<br/>saying.  He is saying something that is about the Bangladeshi, you made these comments yesterday? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Yes.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  he  said  was  that  he  is  trying  to  impute 
<br/>improper motives.  I have not broken the law.  What I simply said that they are still under my work 
<br/>permit, if they want to be worked by someone else, I can allow them to go, but they are still under 
<br/>my work permit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- No, you cannot do that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We can. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- No you cant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- We have not done it yet but we are here with the Immigration Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is shortage of labour.   So you expect me that the sugar industry should go down?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You may continue, honourable Naupoto. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Thank you, Sir.  I was just using it as  an example, but  what  he is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>saying, you cannot do it as far as immigration is concerned. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- All you asked was I do not know what law is he working under, that is all.  
<br/>He  has  not  broken  the  law.    You  also  ask  him,  what  law  is  he  working  under  by  getting  the 
<br/>Bangladeshis to go and work in someone’s elses’ farm when they were brought in under a different 
<br/>thing.  Just continue now from where you were, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Thank you, Sir.  I lost my train of thought.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- See, that is the art of being…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Yes, Sir, I got it back now.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Okay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- I talked about the enforcement role that Immigration has, I hope that 
<br/>you do not compromise it in this push to just get things done, that you lose out on this big role that 
<br/>they have as the filter at our borders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to warn, for passports, if you hold it for a while, passports are not 
<br/>being issued but applications are still coming in, and one thing I have found is, once you start again, 
<br/></span><span>the supply just goes out very quickly.  I hope that you are going to restock as to cater for that.  Thank 
<br/></span><span>you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Come again? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you.    Sometimes  I  do  not  get  what  you  are  saying.  It  is  like  a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>fishhook in the fish mouth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- I would like to present my Ministerial Statement on Carbon Trade and 
<br/>Fiji’s Emission Reduction Payment Agreement  (ERPA), which Government signed in January 2021 
<br/>with the Carbon Fund of the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) that is managed by the World 
<br/>Bank.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important that I first explain the arrangements with the FCPF, as there 
<br/>has  been  a  lot  of  unqualified  and  baseless  assessments  and  claims  that,  if  left  unanswered,  could 
<br/>tarnish the enormous work that my Ministry has toiled to get Fiji to where it is today with regards to 
<br/>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Programme (REDD+) Programme, 
<br/>and its long standing work arrangement with the FCPF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCPF is a global partnership of governments, businesses, civil society 
<br/>and indigenous people focussed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through sustainable means 
<br/>and predetermined intervening programmes from within the agriculture, forestry and other land-use 
<br/>sectors, widely known as REDD+. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCPF, operating under the guidance of the United Nations Framework 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Conventions on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has a funding portfolio of US$1.3 billion of which: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>US$400  million  was  devoted  to  supporting  47  countries,  including  Fiji,  to  complete  its 
<br/>REDD+ readiness work.  Fiji received US$5.8 million for its readiness work, which was 
<br/>completed in 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>US$900 million is to fund Emission Reduction Payment Agreement of 15 countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  proudly,  Fiji  is  one  of  the  15  countries  that  have  taken  the  bold  step  to 
<br/></span><span>actually  reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Collectively,  the 15 countries have pledged to  reduce 
<br/>emission by 145 million tonnes by 2025, which is equivalent to removing 32 million cars of the road 
<br/>for a year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s contribution to this global pledge is a net emission reduction of 2.5 
<br/>million tonnes.  As a Small Island Developing State, this is something that is worthy of mention, and 
<br/>the gist of Fiji’s REDD+ work to date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Carbon Trade Agreement with the FCPF-Carbon Fund is basically to 
<br/></span><span>pilot the result-based payment arrangement, and the rate of US$5 per tonne under this Agreement 
<br/>was established well before other  carbon markets that are offering  a  much higher price, which is 
<br/>beginning to stir discussions and unsettle our landowners and forest dwellers.  At this juncture, I must 
<br/>acknowledge the World Bank and the FCPF for progressing Fiji’s REDD+ work through funding 
<br/></span><span>and technical support.

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the arrival of foreign interest to our shores can also be taken as an indication 
<br/>of Fiji’ state of readiness to trade.  However, it is important that, first, Fiji must complete and fulfil 
<br/>the terms and conditions of existing Emission Reduction Payment Agreement with the FCPF Carbon 
<br/>Fund, and learn from the valuable lessons to better prepare for future markets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s Emission Reduction Programme under Fiji’s REDD+ was primarily 
<br/>designed to, firstly, reduce greenhouse gas emission and reduce global warming and, secondly, to 
<br/>provide an innovative and alternative source of sustainable financing to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Protect the environment and promote the importance of trees and forests through the natural 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>landscape; 
<br/>support the development and meet the welfare needs of the landowners, forest owners and 
<br/>forest dwelling communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  assessments  of  the  net  emission  cover  Viti  Levu,  Vanua  Levu  and 
<br/>Taveuni.    This  means  that  all  interests  within  the  three  islands  can  participate  in  the  national 
<br/>programme.  The Ministry has received reports of communities being unhappy of the Government’s 
<br/>boldness to commit their land under the Carbon Trade Agreement without their prior consent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the case.  The rights of the landowner remain intact and without 
<br/>question.  A forest or land will only be considered under this arrangement through a  formal lease 
<br/>issued by the relevant leasing authority.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is always the responsibility of Government to safeguard the people when 
<br/>a new and novel approach that can potentially impact their lives, like carbon trade, appears, and the 
<br/>Ministry will do so by: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developing the framework; 
<br/>Acquiring a clearer and greater understanding of the dynamics of the carbon market; and  
<br/>Establish right platforms for engagement, as it is currently pursuing under the Carbon Trade 
<br/>Agreement with the FCPF-Carbon Fund.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the benefits from the carbon payment must be meaningful and have a longer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and lasting impact on the lives and welfare needs of the landowner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forestry  is  working  with  the  honourable 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs to reach out to the landowning and forest dwelling communities with the 
<br/>intention of: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Providing the right information and advice through raising awareness;  
<br/>assist in the planning and required preparatory work and provide the necessary training; 
<br/>and most importantly 
<br/>support the Village Improvement Scheme which is meaningful and has a longer lasting 
<br/>impact on the welfare needs of the present and future generations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has programmes that supports, synergises and complements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Emission Reduction Programme, for example, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>National Tree Planting Programme under the RDF 30 million trees; 
<br/>establishment of eco-park and eco-tourism; and  
<br/>cottage industry venture.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to advise the general public, especially the landowning 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>communities, that the Ministry’s goal through its national programmes are focused on:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>bettering the lives of all, particularly, the marginalised communities with very little options 
<br/>and opportunities; and 
<br/>protecting  the  environment  from  in-discriminant  exploitation  of  the  forest  and  land 
<br/>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May God Bless Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the honourable Leader of the Opposition, I thank 
<br/>you for that statement.  Just in terms of clarity, we raised this when we were in the Opposition.  You 
<br/>are talking about something that is based on something per dollar and then the cost of carbon. We 
<br/>are talking about air here, free air coming from the forest when it breathes out. Something new has 
<br/>come up again, it is the first time that I have heard it, that it is going to be leased.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most of these areas are regarded as forestry areas that are not supposed to be leased, they are 
<br/>protected forest.  Honourable Bulitavu knows fully well how they say it in our side of the world, </span><span>"ivei 
<br/>na i sau ni cagi?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, that is the issue here because when you were speaking, it is like you were speaking in a 
<br/>different atmosphere and we are in a separate world and it is hard for me to understand.  How can I 
<br/>interpret what you are saying to the people who own the resources?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You mentioned Taveuni is involved and a few islands in Vanua Levu but, Sir, we are simply 
<br/>at a loss here.  Would the Government be able to clarify this a bit more so that we better understand 
<br/>what you are telling us.  Now, we understand after so many things have been undertaken that the land 
<br/>are going to be leased.  Once you lease it, it is gone, you forgo all that.  What do we get in return? 
<br/>The free air?  Free air is given by God.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, you come from our side of the world, I do not know 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>whether you understand the meaning of this?  You come from Vanua Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  just because I come from Vanua Levu, I would 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>like to explain what the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry was trying to explain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  question  that  you  have  asked,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  all  about  carbon  sequestration.    It  is  a 
<br/>process  whereby  it  is  not  about  how  much  carbon  is  emitted  but  it  is  about  how  much  carbon  is 
<br/>absorbed by a particular acre of forest.  So, the amount of carbon sink per acre or hectare will be 
<br/>calculated in tonnes and that tonne will be sold to someone or some company, for example, sitting in 
<br/>Australia or somewhere abroad who are emitting carbon.  So, that is what carbon trading is all about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reason  why  I  am  well-versed  with  this  is,  again,  the  honourable  Minister  missed  this 
<br/></span><span>particular point, that this carbon trading is part of the Climate Bill that is now the Climate Change 
<br/></span><span>Act that was endorsed by this Parliament back in 2021 after which that Agreement was signed for 
<br/>five years.  So, it is all about how much carbon sink is there for a particular land or forest that is 
<br/>going to be leased out under this Agreement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also remember there was some confusion when this Bill was introduced and some Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Parliament thought that we will have to go and fill carbon in a can or something and then trade it.

<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not actually work like that, it is all about how much carbon sink is there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Who are the MPs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- You were part of that particular group, so you would know those 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MPs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as you might be aware that carbon trading is part of the Climate Change Act, 
<br/>there is a huge stock of forest that is available for carbon trading in Fiji.  So, having a lot of stock 
<br/>available, that can be deposited for the carbon trading. We were the first country to domesticate the 
<br/>Paris  Agreement  in  the  form  of  Climate  Change  Act  which  allowed  the  landowning  units  to  get 
<br/>involved in carbon trading, but the condition was they need to upgrade the current stock before it can 
<br/>be compensated or used for carbon trading. So, if you have a particular forest, it is not that you just 
<br/>go to iTLTB and lease it out for carbon trading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are terms and conditions, such as, you need to encourage reforestation. So, if there is a 
<br/>space  available  within  the  forest,  you  need  to  actually  encourage  reforestation.  You  need  to 
<br/>discourage deforestation on the land that you lease out. You cannot have logging going on one side 
<br/>and then allow the land on the other side to be leased out for carbon trading.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Mr. Speaker, which is very important and is part of the terms and conditions 
<br/>is undisturbed ecosystem.  So, it is not that the resource owners will not be able to utilise any resource 
<br/>that  is  available,  but  you  can  only  utilise  resources  that  does  not  have  a  drastic  effect  on  the 
<br/>ecosystem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  the  conservation  of  endangered  species,  Mr.  Speaker.    If  there  is  any  endangered 
<br/>species that is part of that forest, you need to protect that. Any lease agreement that is given to the 
<br/>landowning unit, you have to follow or go through these terms and conditions before you can lease 
<br/>out your piece of land for carbon trading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  there  needs  to  be  a  five-year  carbon  budget  for  the  purpose  of  planning  the 
<br/>whole  of  economies  emission  reduction  as  part  of  accumulative  effort  to  achieve  net  zero  gas 
<br/>emission by 2015.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the Act, Mr. Speaker, carbon budget was supposed to be determined before 31</span><span>st</span><span> March, 
<br/></span><span>2023 for the period 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2026 to 31</span><span>st</span><span> December, 2030 which, I believe, at this point in time, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Fisheries and Forestry is not aware of because we have not receive any 
<br/>carbon budget in this Parliament for one whole year now. And for this to come into effect and that 
<br/>particular agreement to be renewed, this is one of the terms and conditions that has to be passed. The 
<br/>carbon budget has to be passed by Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we also need to assist the landowners to upgrade the stock of forest that they 
<br/>have so that it meets the criteria to be utilised for carbon trading.  Carbon trading is a huge industry 
<br/></span><span>whereby landowning units in Fiji can really benefit from, but the Ministry needs to do much more to 
<br/></span><span>allow our resource owners to benefit from this programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, lastly, we need to assist landowning units financially because they do not have 
<br/>such capital which is needed to cater for the development of the forest in order to engage in carbon 
<br/>trading. So, we expect the Government to bring a separate budget to allow and help landowning Units 
<br/>to upgrade their forest so that they can lease out their forest for carbon trading, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Member.    It  is  very  interesting,  and  I  hope  the 
<br/>Government will do more in trying to explain that because we had you live when you were delivering 
<br/>your Statement. That is why I have raised that point, honourable Minister, and to the Government, 
<br/>the Deputy Prime Ministers and the honourable Attorney-General.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  sad  precedent  case  where  millions  of  dollars  were  paid  to  the  landowners  in 
<br/>Monasavu after a long time. They fought their case in foregoing the area that was taken under the 
<br/>water catchment. It was never leased, nothing was paid, but the landowners cannot touch it.  They 
<br/>cannot harvest their forests and all, so millions of dollars have been paid to some trust account.  The 
<br/>landowners are still fighting over that money that was paid.  That was the court’s decision. Here, I 
<br/>only hope that the Government wakes up to that.  From what has been said by honourable Maharaj, 
<br/>no budget has been prepared and all that.  I do not know about the legislation, is there any legislation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- It is yet to commence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is interesting.  </span><span>Au qai kerea ga Minisita, na lawa e sega tiko.  </span><span>Maybe, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we need to address that as well.  We need to give more time to this topic.
