<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT –  
<br/>FIJI CORRECTIONS SERVICE 2018-2020 ANNUAL REPORTS</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  of  the  Fiji  Corrections 
<br/>Service  Annual  Report  for  the  year  2018-2019  and  2019-2020,  which  was  tabled  on  23</span><span>rd</span><span>
<br/>November, 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  R.S.S.  VAKALALABURE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  Member  moving  the 
<br/>motion, I rise to make a short contribution on the Consolidated Report for the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>Annual Report 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Committee Report was tabled in November last year and the wish to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proceed directly in articulating some of the main areas of discussion that are captured in this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To begin with, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are few pertinent issues identified which the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had noted and these were as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Fiji Corrections Service, or commonly known as the FCS, is committed to reducing 
<br/>the high number of contraband entering correctional facilities around Fiji. 
<br/>The  FCS  continues  to  work  towards  its  responsible  targets  by  safely  detaining  and 
<br/>rehabilitating  persons  sentenced  to  imprisonment  or,  in  other  words,  persons  placed  on 
<br/>remand at each correctional centre pending trial by the courts. 
<br/>The  FCS  has  no  control  over  the  number  of  persons  incarcerated  by  the  courts  and, 
<br/>therefore, does not have the means to minimise overcrowding issues within the Correction 
<br/>facility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji National Budget 2022-2023 provided funding for a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Job Evaluation Exercise to be conducted for FCS staff, with the intention to review their salaries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FCS engaged a consultant company, namely Maxumise Pte Limited to 
<br/></span><span>conduct the JEE, which was to conclude in early October this year.  With that, Sir, the Ministry of 
<br/></span><span>Justice and Ministry of Finance now have the responsibility to evaluate and determine its outcome.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is essential to note that the final two key findings noted by the Committee 
<br/>was derived  from  the site visitation  that the Committee had conducted in which  we  were  able to 
<br/>identify key issues for redressing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee,  therefore,  noted  that  during  its  tour  of  the  correctional 
<br/>facilities, the Fiji Corrections Service has taken humanitarian steps to monitor and provide daycare 
<br/></span><span>towards inmates of old age.  This has subsequently exposed the lack of facilitation for inmates that 
<br/></span><span>are at risk with respect to mental health problems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last key findings was that, the Committee was informed of the land tenure issues at its 
<br/>Levuka facility, Mr. Speaker.  The Committee notes that the FCS has take a step to protect tenure on 
<br/>the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> land by signing a 99 year lease agreement with the landowning unit beginning in 2017.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>562 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these issues were addressed and clarified by the Fiji Corrections Service and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>any information on this can be retrieved from the Committee’s Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the key findings that was noted, the Committee has come up with 
<br/>recommendations that he believes will possibly improve certain operations within the Corrections 
<br/>Service.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, I will go straig 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>`ht  into  the  recommendation  put  forth  by  the  Committee  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consideration of this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation No. 1  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  upgraded  equipment  be  installed  to  curb  the  high 
<br/>number of contrabands smuggled into correctional facilities and this, Mr. Speaker, is a major 
<br/>issue whilst we were visiting the correctional facilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation No.2  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  is  of  the  view  that  the  human  dignity  of  all  inmates  be  respected  and 
<br/>recommends  that  there  be  separate  Centres  allocated  for  remand  and  convicted  inmates, 
<br/>respectively for Natabua, Vaturekuka and Korovou Correction Centres. This would reduce 
<br/>the issue of overcrowding and reduce the negative influence on persons on remand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation No.3  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends that there be a specialized area to confine offenders identified 
<br/>as having mental health and drug issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation No. 4  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  Corrections  Infirmary  facilities  be 
<br/>improved and better resourced and also serve those facilities without infirmary be furnished 
<br/>with one as soon as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Recommendation No. 5  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The  Committee  recommends  that  all  Corrections  full  preparation  as  storage  facilities, 
<br/></span><span>including kitchen and dining hall, be revamped to OHS compliance status.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity, and I urge the honourable 
<br/>Members of this august Parliament to take note of the contents of the Committee’s Report and show 
<br/>support for the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I have a list of speakers given by the Whips and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>batting is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. M.D. Bulitavu; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable I. Naivalurua; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.D.  BULITAVU.-  I  rise  to  give  my  contribution  to  the  motion  that  is  before 
<br/>Parliament and, that is, to note the Committee’s Report. Most of the things that I wanted to talk about 
<br/>has  been  clearly  outlined  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Standing  Committee  in  his  opening  speech  in 
<br/>moving the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  just  few  other  things  from  my  observation  after  reading  the  Report,  we  had 
<br/>moved around the FCS facilities.  In our visit, we have identified few areas that are in the findings 
<br/>for those of you who have the Report. We have got assurances this morning from the honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General and also Minister for Justice and Minister responsible for Corrections on the Job 
<br/>Evaluation Exercise that has been conducted and I have stated this morning that it is long overdue 
<br/>and outstanding.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  was  one  of  the  main  issues  that  was  raised  to  us  in  our  visit  in  various  Corrections 
<br/>Centres around the country, given they have been bringing up these issues over the past few years 
<br/>and they are still waiting.  So, we hope that the honourable Attorney-General will bring this to the 
<br/>attention of the honourable Minister of Finance and we looking forward for the upcoming budget.  
<br/>There could probably be a $5 million allocation for this JEE and if it is done, probably it should be 
<br/>given in a lump sum where lessons should be learned from the JEE that was done to the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force years back that had few teething problems and had to come back to the Committee for inquiries. 
<br/>It was given on a pro-rata basis and most that had passed on or left the Service were still being paid.  
<br/>There were issues of some who were paid monies that they were not supposed to receive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  other  issue,  I  would  like  to  raise  with  the  honourable  Minister  responsible  and 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General is the establishment of the Parole Board.  I think that is one area that 
<br/>inmates have always raised in terms of having that Parole Board.  I think they are in the process of 
<br/>getting the board members given there are certain specialists that are needed to be part of that board, 
<br/>psychiatrists, et cetera, and other things.  Probably he will enlighten us when he takes the floor.  These 
<br/>are some of the avenues that inmates are awaiting so that they can come through and also re-join the 
<br/>community outside.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the other issue that we have found out was the caregiving training that needs to be done.  
<br/>If you go to Nasinu Correction Centre, I think there is one whole dorm there which is dedicated for 
<br/>old inmates who are disabled and I think they are being cared by some Corrections Officers and some 
<br/>inmates.  I think proper training and proper equipment is needed there especially things like vehicles 
<br/>and ambulances where they can assist also them if an emergency arises in the facilities given, those 
<br/>old sick inmates are being cared for. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that they had raised in our visit around was a x-ray scanner.  Probably that could 
<br/>be part of the budget too as a capital expenditure for Fiji Corrections Service given the high rise of 
<br/>contrabands coming into our prison facilities, telephones even drugs and other things that are used 
<br/>by inmates illegally.  But they have body scanners but given the developments that have happened, 
<br/>how inmates have managed to hide that even in their cavity.  These are one of the things that came 
<br/>up  in  our  visits  –  the  need  for  x-ray  scanners  to  be  available  in  most  of our  facilities  around  the 
<br/>country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another thing that we came across was the remand centres.  Most remand centres here in the 
<br/></span><span>North, we do not have a specific remand centre in Labasa given that all are in Vaturekuka.  If there 
<br/>is probably a project in the future, honourable Minister, if there could be a capital project where a 
<br/>remand centre for the Northern Division can be constructed, so that it will reduce overcrowding in 
<br/>our centres.  Usually, Labasa is the only holding prison especially in the courthouse in Labasa before 
<br/>they are distributed to Taveuni and other places in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>564 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are my initial contribution to the Report that is before Parliament and I hope that the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General and Minister for Justice who is responsible for Corrections will take 
<br/>those  recommendations  and  findings  that  are  in  the  Report  that  is  readable  and  also  those 
<br/>recommendations will be taken in so that the service of the Fiji Corrections Service can be improved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to base my comments on the Report 
<br/>particularly the recommendations made by the Committee and I thank the Committee for their report 
<br/>to Parliament today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to speak on the lack of burial space.  I live in Davuilevu Housing 
<br/>which is right next to the crematorium and the cemetery.  That cemetery is filling up very quickly, I 
<br/>know also that the informal settlement located behind the crematorium and the cemetery is actually 
<br/>the reserve for the cemetery.  I noted in the Report that the Committee recommended that may be 
<br/>some of us can take our loved ones who have passed away to our villages, so that we can bury them.  
<br/>I think some of us have not been to our villages for a long time, so I am not sure how that will work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I really like to laugh at that comment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I would like to raise a sensitive issue that could really help the 
<br/>situation on burial space and that is  cremation particularly the  </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and Christians. We do not 
<br/>quite advocate for cremation.  There are many benefits of cremation, I have been to the crematorium 
<br/>many times, actually if I die maybe I want to be cremated, I am not sure if my wife will agree if she 
<br/>is still alive. This is definitely one area that has been developed in Fiji. I know there is one in Nasinu 
<br/>and there is more in Raralevu.  I think our Hindu brethens actually use it very well. This is a good 
<br/>way and clean way to go. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- You already gone. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I think we should consider this as a community.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I do not know if many of our people know, I been to some burials in Nasinu. I personally do not 
<br/></span><span>want to be buried there and for one of the main reasons is right now, during the burials they do not 
<br/></span><span>allow the casket to be covered with the mat. I do not know whether this is a rule.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Or maybe because it is small.  Just looks a little bit bare.  It is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussion about death but I think it is essential that we do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is if because of the mats or the body will not go down?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- I will leave that idea.  I know we Catholics are working around 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this idea of getting cremated, not being buried.  I would encourage discussion that much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reinforce the proposal  raised by honourable Bulitavu on the 
<br/>proper remuneration of Corrections Officers and all the other conditions for their work that needs to 
<br/>be looked at.  I was in Naboro the other day for reasons that shall not be made known to Parliament, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>565 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I noticed that some of the workers are really working hard.  I think there has been something in 
<br/>motion but I think we should recognise that our Corrections Officers need to be paid well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overcrowding in our prisons and the negative effects of that. Space is always a problem and 
<br/>I know it was raised earlier by the Chairman that the Corrections Service do not control the number 
<br/>that are coming to them. We must consider smart ways of looking after people who are convicted.  
<br/>The honourable Naivalurua and I were talking about restorative justice as a lead on to Yellow Ribbon 
<br/>as some way of looking after humanely and to try and rehabilitate people without leaving them in 
<br/>jail.  That is something we need to look at also.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  correctional  facilities  are  not  cut  for  those  that  need  special 
<br/>attention.  One, the physically handicapped (disabled).  I know an uncle of mine who is in there who 
<br/>is in a wheelchair.  Neither is it responding enough to the mentally challenged.  The third category 
<br/>of people that perhaps it should also look after are those that are aged.  So they all clamped, and this 
<br/>is part of the recommendation of the Committee, in the same space as everyone else.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Definitely a challenge, something for us to all look at particularly the Government I believe.  
<br/>I am sure there are two places they are kind of co-located which people do not necessarily want to 
<br/>look at for the stigma, they are located in the same area.  One is Suva Prison and the other one is St. 
<br/>Giles Hospital because it deals with the kind of people that we push to the limit of our community.  
<br/>But the important thing is that they are the very people who need our help the most.  I would hope 
<br/>that  we  consider  some  humane  policies  around  this,  and  I  definitely  would  support  this  in 
<br/>Government, in the event that these are brought as laws to be able to help, not only the Corrections 
<br/>Officers, but also those who are there, spending time for the crimes that they have committed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to start off by thanking the honourable 
<br/>Minister for the good news this morning.  I stand together with my two colleagues, the honourable 
<br/>Minister  for  Home  Affairs  in  thanking  him  for  his  commitment  and  assurance  that  Corrections 
<br/>Service JEE will be paid out in this fiscal year – thank you, Sir. Much has been presented by the two 
<br/>previous speakers, Sir, on the Report, but for the benefit of Parliament, I just wanted to go back to 
<br/>how it all started, just to enable us to understand why some of the current issues that keep on propping 
<br/>up in some of the reports will continue to do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 18 years ago, the Corrections Act 2006 was enacted.  That basically changed 
<br/>a  big  paradigm  shift  of  the  organisation  from  one  of  containment  to  one  of  correction  and 
<br/>rehabilitation.  That demanded a lot of changes.  I am thinking the past, changing the attitude, and 
<br/></span><span>above all, re-training the staff, a 360 degrees turnaround, even to the uniforms, to the branding, to 
<br/></span><span>how they should posture themselves in public, even to the selection of the uniform that they wear 
<br/>today, that particular uniform was decided by the community inside the New Town Hall.  A lot of 
<br/>things took place.  The plans were very clear and we were required to align ourselves to the new 
<br/>order of the day; the Corrections Act 2006.  All the plannings including infrastructure and capacity 
<br/>building had to be aligned. We had to put into place a long term development plan, together with 
<br/>what we thought will help us to comply with the new order of the day.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  those  days,  the  Corrections  Officers  were  known  as  Prison  Officers.  
<br/></span><span>Today, they are Corrections Officers, but I would also want to call them, they are Captains of Lives.  
<br/></span><span>Primarily the role of the Corrections Service is really inside the laws where they receive those who 
<br/>have gone offtrack and they are like doctors who treat them through a rehabilitation programme, then 
<br/>after they have served a time, then they are handed back again to the community.  There are two parts 
<br/>to this – one is their role inside the wall, and secondly is their role outside the wall.  You have heard 
<br/>about the Yellow Ribbon Programme, their positive initiative to deal with those who have served the 
<br/>time and were rejoining society, community or their families to be given a second chance.  From my 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>566 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>experience,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  inside  of  the  wall  part  of  the  work  was  manageable,  we  could 
<br/>control, we could deal with but it was the outside of the wall aspect of it that was most difficult.  I, 
<br/>at this point wish to thank the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, the community at large, families for their contribution and their 
<br/>effort in supporting the Yellow Ribbon Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very quickly on perhaps one of those five recommendations, all the five recommendations 
<br/>are really the inside the wall aspects, apart from a few of the need for funding on projects.  This will 
<br/>be ongoing, some of it are yet to be completed in line with the long-term development plan that we 
<br/>had set and some are just results that we are slow in catching up of the change in times. The offenders 
<br/>are those who are incarcerated in there, they have all the time in the world to beat the whole system.  
<br/>So, it is very important that we have a well-trained organisation, a well-skilled dedicated captain of 
<br/>lives who cares for them, treat them, change them and send them out again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Committee  for  the  engagement  with  the  Fiji  Ex-Prisoners  Training  and 
<br/>Rehabilitation Associate Service, this is something new for me.  These are those who have done time 
<br/>inside and they are really giving back their time to help those find their way back out and I would 
<br/>like  to  acknowledge  them  at  this  juncture  for  their  commitment  and  work  in  the  rehabilitation 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me end, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to say that whilst we cannot control numbers that go in, 
<br/>I believe we can create intervention points to reduce the numbers that go in.  By this I mean, in my 
<br/>thinking,  whilst  we have the Yellow Ribbon Programme, it could  be extended further that would 
<br/>encourage and perhaps inform the public and society on the roles they could play under the Yellow 
<br/>Ribbon Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have heard about  the  </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Community Policing, we had a brief 
<br/>discussion with the honourable Minister for Home Affairs just before we came back in and whether 
<br/>it is all possible whilst the Corrections Service’s role is to bring them back  on track, Fiji Police under 
<br/>the </span><span>Duavata</span><span> Community Policing could keep them on track, back a track and keeping them on track.  
<br/>There has been a few wonderful initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our effort to come up with innovative 
<br/>ways in dealing with ways or making sure that they change and they change for the better and they 
<br/>do not go back in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Arts Gallery was one, innovative one, if I may mention, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was one that 
<br/>we introduced in Taveuni.  Those who stole </span><span>dalo</span><span> or </span><span>yaqona</span><span> when they come in for the rehabilitation 
<br/>programme, they are sent out to the places where they stole and planted five times more what they 
<br/></span><span>stole.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 10 </span><span>yaqona</span><span> plants, you plant 50 to the owner, 2,000 dalo times five.  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, it worked there.  I am simply trying to say that there are innovative ways, it really does 
<br/>not cost much in how we can perhaps reduce the numbers and also prevent our sons and daughters 
<br/>from going in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I support the motion here, Sir, and I once again thank the public and society for their support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Yellow Ribbon Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I will just share some experience here being an old 
<br/></span><span>boy. So, I have two old boys, one the school that I attended, the other one is the Rehabilitation Centre 
<br/></span><span>and they quickly label you with the Yellow Ribbon thing.  The only concern that I have is the uniform 
<br/>of  the  Prison  Wardens.    When  I  was  sent  to  jail,  they  had  only  about  two  and  when  honourable 
<br/>Naivalurua took over, lots of changes happened. I do not know how many uniforms they have now, 
<br/>compared to the military and the military still has more.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why I am saying this, honourable Members, is because the Prison Officers are more exposed, 
<br/>very high risk job for them especially when they go with prisoners to clean some bush, et cetera, they 
<br/>are with prisoners who hold knives and things like that.  It is quite risky and dangerous for them and 
<br/>on  top  of  that,  I  do  not  how  about  their  present  uniform.  Do  they  have  overalls  as  well  like  the 
<br/>military?    On  top  of  that,  I  am  happy  that  this  Report  has  come  up  and  we  have  two  former 
<br/>Commissioner of Prisons here; honourable Naivalurua and honourable Vasu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The crux of what I am trying to say is, the prisoners, when you go amongst them, when you 
<br/>are also thrown into jail, they do not look at you as one of their colleagues who has broken the law 
<br/>but rather your standing in the community. Strangely I was asked, could you give us some training 
<br/>and lecture about what to do and what not to do, et cetera, things of that nature and then I said, “look, 
<br/>I am already in uniform, it will be so stupid of me to be in this uniform and then trying to lecture to 
<br/>you on something that you alone can understand, because you are wearing the uniform to look after 
<br/>us even though we are more smarter than you”; most of the convicts there are very bright.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When you cage them in, they become more smarter in how they exercise their minds. They 
<br/>never put to waste anything, even the leather boots,  they make nice cases for gas lighters.  How they 
<br/>transform the lace of the shoes into strings and whereby they throw things across their cell.  That is 
<br/>how they pass on whatever they get from this end right down to that end.  Even how they throw the 
<br/>newspapers through the cage like grills that we have and it flies through. The distance is about from 
<br/>here to there, but when they fold the newspaper, it is so strange because by the time you come to 
<br/>understand  where  is  the  newspaper,  someone  is  reading  it  on  the  other  side.  That  is  a  different 
<br/>dormitory altogether.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All I am trying to share is the riskiness of the work of the officers in prison.  I hope honourable 
<br/>Vasu will understand this better, their uniforms.  They have got number one, two now, and so forth 
<br/>but compared to the military, is still very much behind.  There are more interesting stories which we 
<br/>can share on the rehabilitation centre.  But again, I only hope that whatever is coming out of this 
<br/>Report, now that the Attorney-General is going to be closing up the debate on this motion, I only 
<br/>hope that proper financial help is provided to the Ministry, so that they conduct themselves better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Deputy Prime Ministers and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, first of all,  Sir, thank you for sharing the journey first-hand experience which other 
<br/>honourable Members too, through their visitations or probably by knowledge, are fully aware of the 
<br/>issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It brings me to light regarding this facility.  When I started in Government, one of the first 
<br/></span><span>work I did was to look after the Government Departments’ business and that Department used to 
<br/>come under my portfolio.  When I look at the government assistance rendered to RFMF, the Police 
<br/>and Prisons, the Prisons are always the last.  I can see the change during Naivalurua’s appointment 
<br/>and thereafter, and the infrastructural changes are significant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I happened to spend some of my time in the compounds of Natabua, Naboro and Nasinu.  My 
<br/>eldest brother was a prison officer, you may have known him, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I just came back 
<br/>from Sydney to celebrate his 70</span><span>th</span><span> birthday, so I am fully aware of the experiences.  I was a lawyer, a 
<br/></span><span>Magistrate and now I am the Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I can assure you one thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there will be changes, but it is going to take 
<br/>time.  The last few years has been different, during honourable Naivalurua and  honourable Vasu’s 
<br/>times.  When we talk about human dignity, I can say that in the last few years, it was non-existent.  
<br/>It did not only affect the prisoners, it also affected the lives of the Corrections Officers and it is a 
<br/>huge shift from that mode to the current.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>568 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have been constantly reminded, Sir, thank you for the change of Government and we owe it 
<br/>to the people of Fiji.  Now, there is more access for lawyers, over the weekend and this week, we can 
<br/>see some of the religious faiths have been permitted to enter.  That was a big no-no during the last 
<br/>Administration. I, for one, whenever I come to visit the head office, it is difficult.  You cannot go 
<br/>inside because the officers were trained like military officers. But all I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, in this Parliament is that there will be changes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the members of the Committee for the detailed Report, the observations, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>findings and, of course, the five recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they said that majority of the issues identified in the review 
<br/>have been adequately addressed.  As you are probably aware, most of these issues are infringes in 
<br/>terms of finance budgetary allocation.  I have been trying to impress upon the Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>and Minister of Finance.  I would like to invite him to visit the Corrections Centres and see firsthand 
<br/>what it is like.  Only then one can understand because in terms of the needs, infrastructure, et cetera, 
<br/>it will depend on the funding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We acknowledge the pressing nature of the issue and are firmly committed to implementing 
<br/>effective measures to ensure the the safety, security and rehabilitation of all individuals under the Fiji 
<br/>Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a significant concern regarding the smuggling of contraband into 
<br/>the Fiji Correctional facilities but with the nature of the organisation, such is bound to happen, but 
<br/>the Corrections Officers are supposed to be on top of their job.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  address  this,  the  Fiji  Corrections  Service  has  embarked  on  a 
<br/>comprehensive strategy aimed at enhancing security measures and reducing illicit activities within 
<br/>its facilities. These include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  purchasing  of  handheld  machines  and  metal  detector  walk-through  doors  for 
<br/>Correctional  Centres,  ensuring  thorough  screening  procedures.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, even then they still slip in as the human mind, and this 
<br/>was probably explained earlier on how they do things in prison without detection by the 
<br/>officers. 
<br/>It is also a provision of capacity support for our K9 sniffer dogs at the K9 Unit. 
<br/>There is also implementation of irregular and consistent snap security searches conducted 
<br/></span><span>by the K9 and Fiji Corrections Service personnel. 
<br/></span><span>There is also procurement of full-body x-ray scanner machine. 
<br/>There is also heightened surveillance and intelligence gathering by the Emergency Unit, 
<br/>facilitating proactive intervention and response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji Corrections Service’s core mission centres on the safe and effective 
<br/>rehabilitation of all prisoners and remandees. We understand the importance of individualised care 
<br/>and support, which is why we continuously implement rehabilitation programmes tailored to meet 
<br/>the diverse needs of inmates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Except for the Labasa Corrections Centre, all correctional facilities have separate facilities 
<br/>for  remanded  and  convicted  inmates.  Sadly,  this  will  be  a  capital  project  if  not  next  year,  then 
<br/>probably in the years to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  case  of  Labasa  Corrections  Centre,  there  are  separate  cell  blocks  for  remand  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>convicted inmates. Sadly, we have no control of the people put in remand.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – FCS 2018-2020 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>18</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I totally agree with honourable Naivalurua regarding the theft from farms. Let me share, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, when I was a Magistrate, especially when I go to the island, that is the sentence I actually 
<br/>impose, for them to plant more. But that is below the tariff, as honourable Ratu Niudamu will realise 
<br/>that. The tariff is two to nine months, so if you are a first offender for that, two to nine months then 
<br/>normally you will suspend it.  But if you commit another theft, it will be more. And the theft of farm 
<br/>produce, according to the Court is higher, but I have done it.  It has not been appealed because maybe 
<br/>it was done on the island but the  point is this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a creative and innovative way 
<br/>because that suits the particular offender - the point of being charged, appear in Court with fellow 
<br/>villagers  watching,  sentence  on  the  same  day,  but  when  they  go  out,  they  want  to  change  and 
<br/>sometimes it does help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We hope that in the future, there will be some dialogue with the Judiciary to implement other 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ways in terms of imposing custodial sentences for our prisoners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I acknowledge the shortfalls within our correctional facilities.  However, 
<br/>we are progressively working on addressing the concerns and limited resources. Unfortunately, as I 
<br/>have  said,  the  previous  Administration  failed  to  prioritise  the  overcrowding  concern  in  our 
<br/>correctional facilities, owing to the influx of offenders, including those with drug related offences. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the initiatives to address this include the utilisation of early release programmes for 
<br/>those inmates who are eligible, and the anticipated re-establishment of the Parole Board to facilitate 
<br/>early release applications. The Parole Board has been appointed, it is awaiting administrative setup 
<br/>from the Fiji Corrections, before it is submitted to His Excellency for their appointment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee also recommended setting aside a specialised facility for offenders 
<br/>who are mentally challenged, including those struggling with drug addiction. As I have said, as the 
<br/>years go by, there is always new initiatives for the Fiji Corrections Service and one of which has 
<br/>been  recommended  is  for  a  separate  hospital  facility  for  the  Fiji  Corrections  Centre.    That  is 
<br/>something for the new Administration to implement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As clarified by the honourable Prime Minister, we will be soon having a new Commissioner 
<br/>of Correctional Service, probably in the space of a month or two. Those are some of the projects that 
<br/>the new Commissioner and the new team at Fiji Corrections Service will take heed of in order to 
<br/>improve the status in the Fiji Corrections Centre. I fully endorse the Report of the Committee. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their contributions towards the motion before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, before I take my leave, I wish to thank yourself for allowing the 
<br/>Committee to visit all the correctional facilities.  We have been fortunate enough to have seen another 
<br/>world.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For you, honourable Members, who have not been inside the prison, we have been inside and 
<br/>it is totally different, as honourable Naivalurua, honourable Vasu and Mr. Speaker have shared with 
<br/></span><span>us.  It is totally different inside there, a totally different lifestyle and we met all sorts of people from 
<br/></span><span>all sorts of life - lawyers, teachers, policeman, politicians, with totally different lifestyle.  We are 
<br/>being fortunate, and I thank, Mr. Speaker, for allowing us to visit all these correctional facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a big thank you to the Fiji Corrections Service.  To the Acting 
<br/>Commissioner, Madam Panapasa and all the hardworking men and women in the Fiji Corrections 
<br/>Service, we thank you for your services, especially with a ratio of 4:1, given that most of them have

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>570 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to look after prisoners who are handling knives.  We thank you for your commitment and it is a very 
<br/>high risk environment.  Thank you to all the hardworking men and women in the Fiji Correctional 
<br/>Service.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a notable mention to our Liaison Officer, Deputy Commissioner 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Senior  Superintendent  Apakuki  Qurai,  who  accompanied  the  Committee  all  throughout  to  all  the 
<br/>correctional facilities around Fiji. He helped the Committee throughout the visitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that bring us to the end of the sitting today.  Before 
<br/>I adjourn Parliament, I think I was just informed a while ago that honourable Members are not able 
<br/>to listen or hear the bell being sounded from here, especially when you are in the Big Committee 
<br/>Room.  However, we made checks since it happened the last time and it seems that someone has 
<br/>lowered the volume.  Perhaps, it is only one of us here or one of the staff who has lowered the volume.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members  have  been  coming  in  late  to  the  sitting  when  the  bell  has  already 
<br/>sounded.  On that second bell when it sounded, I was still in my office and I could not hear anything.  
<br/>Yet, the Orderly who has been assisting me heard it.  Something strange is happening here.  The 
<br/>volume cannot go down on its own.  Maybe, we need to up the security again to ensure that bell is 
<br/>sounded at the same time everyone hears it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  you  all  for  your  contributions  today.    Honourable  Members,  Parliament  will  now  
<br/>adjourn until tomorrow at 9.30 a.m. In addition to that, I want to inform you honourable Members 
<br/>that dinner is being prepared in the Big Committee Room and I hope you will enjoy your dinner. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 6.05 p.m.
