<div><span>Redemption of Student Bus Cards 
<br/>(Question No. 39/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civil Aviation update Parliament on the status of the redemption of student bus cards? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Parliament has changed all for the better.  In 
<br/>the past, if a questioner was not here, the question was not asked.  So, thank you, Sir, for the new 
<br/>rules in Parliament that allows Parliament to operate as it should be in a democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education has data that 63,454 out of the 77,539 students have successfully 
<br/>redeemed their subsidised cards for Term 1 2024, inclusive of 2023 eligible students. The public was 
<br/>informed  accordingly  regarding  the  redeeming  of  subsidised  cards  for  Term  1  2024,  via  a  Press 
<br/>Release on 15</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2024.  The data given above is from the eligible families whose combined 
<br/>household income is below $16,000 per annum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a process that is involved in all these, and as highlighted, about 18 
<br/>percent of the students have not redeemed their cards.  There is a process in place which says, and I 
<br/>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Parents  and  guardians  must  ensure  that  the  transport  assistance  application  form  are 
<br/>submitted  at  school.  Head  of  School  assesses  the  application  and  update  verified 
<br/>application into Fiji Education Management Information System (FEMIS).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The Head of School will verify the status of the application in FEMIS.  Headquarters staff 
<br/></span><span>extract the transport assistance data of students that have applied and send it to Vodafone 
<br/></span><span>Fiji to provide the student recent card number and balance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Headquarters  staff  calculate  the  fare  from  the  families’  data  and  end  balance  from 
<br/>Vodafone Fiji to upload the funds to the subsidised cards to cater for them for the school 
<br/>term. Students redeem their subsidised cards at the redeeming centres.” 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the reasons, Mr. Speaker, Sir, why there is non-redeeming of cards by 18 percent is 
<br/>that the non-verification of student application in FEMIS is factoring this.  An area of concern is the 
<br/>change of card due to loss or damage.  However, the new card number information is not submitted 
<br/>to headquarters who, in  turn, are unable to submit it to Vodafone for loading of funds.  This is a 
<br/>critical  area.  Sir.    The  new  card  will  not  work  if  the  process  is  not  observed  about  the  lost  and 
<br/>damaged card.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also  had 2023 subsidised card holders who  have not  applied for the assistance of this 
<br/>academic year 2024.  They may have balances from 2023 and used it all at the beginning of the year, 
<br/>but because they have not applied for the new academic year, the card is not topped up.  Then the 
<br/>card has zero balance, students can no longer use it.  Then they or their parents realise and then they 
<br/>try to get new cards and re-apply.  The verification and lodging of the new application will depend 
<br/>on our schedules of payments with Vodafone. Also, multiple tapping of subsidised cards for other 
<br/>students and utilising the funds intended for a term are more rapid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, in the Ministry, are taking mitigation plans.  Our continuous reminders are being sent 
<br/>out  to  Education  District  Offices  and  schools  for  eligible  students  to  apply  for  the  assistance.  
<br/>Replacement cards are being updated in the FEMIS, District Offices are being informed accordingly, 
<br/>and new card numbers are loaded with funds.  Head of Schools to verify the 3,024 applications not 
<br/>verified, in FEMIS.  We are also looking at the introduction of Vodafone Point of Sale terminal for 
<br/>the redemption of subsidised and non-subsidised cards in other outlets, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  action  plans,  new  students’  application  cards  are  registered  and  sent  to  schools.  
<br/>Change of cards are submitted from the District Offices and funds are loaded accordingly.  Head of 
<br/>Schools remind parents and guardians to apply for the assistance.  Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is for 
<br/>those whose family income is under $16,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking at Point of Sales in schools, as opposed to what we 
<br/>currently have, to help rectify this.  Let me just say that the system has been in place since 2018.  We 
<br/>started off with 56,728 students, and at the end of 2023 and into 2024, there are now 71,203 students 
<br/>who are now using the e-ticketing system.  So, it has been there, it is growing by the day, but there 
<br/>are processes that need to be observed which is affecting the full implementation of the scheme.  But 
<br/>be  assured  that  we  are  working  towards  ensuring  that  everyone  has  access  to  this.    It  is  mostly 
<br/>operational, and assistance is forthcoming from the Ministry to ensure that everyone benefits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Transport Assistance 
<br/>Scheme for students was introduced by the previous Government to ensure that no child is left behind 
<br/>and  students  do  not  drop  out  of  schools.    Recently,  many  parents  and  students  have  expressed 
<br/>concerns over their failure to redeem student bus cards eight weeks into the term.  Can the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Education inform Parliament on the reasons behind that disarray, how the Ministry will 
<br/>compensate the parents, and the strategies to ensure that is not repeated in future?  According to the 
<br/>honourable Minister, thousands of students were affected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members  of  the  Parliament  and  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people of this country, there is no disarray. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a process.  As I have said, 82 percent of 
<br/>the  students  are  benefiting  already.    The  Heads  of  School,  parents  and  students  who  are  not 
<br/>benefitting from this, is due to the process not being observed, and we are taking steps to mitigate 
<br/>this.  There will be POS now in schools and there is back up every day.  There will be reminders 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everyday.  This is a system that has been here since 2018 and these are recurring problems.  When I 
<br/>listen to my people and the way they present this to me, they are very experienced people.  They 
<br/>know what is happening and it is amazing how they are controlling this, but like I always say, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, it takes two to tango. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  The Ministry of Education is  doing  its work, the parents  and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>students do their job and everyone will be cosy in this country in terms of this, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That sounds good; it takes two?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the problem with that side of Parliament is, they can 
<br/>make the announcements during budget, “We are helping the parents, we are helping the State, we 
<br/>are helping everyone”, but the implementation is so poor… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  …and  that  is  an  example  of  poor  implementation.  It  is  called 
<br/>“implementation deficit”.    The question to the honourable Minister is, when are you going to use 
<br/>all these money?  Why are you keeping that money for the last eight weeks, while parents are forking 
<br/>out money from their pockets?  Is that fair to the parents?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, if we can all cooperate to educate the parents and 
<br/>the students on how to do it, instead of going around spreading lies, we can all be happy about this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- There is funding there! There is money there.  We also play a role 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>here.  There is money there…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Where is the money? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- … and it is public funds.  There is a process in place, and as I have 
<br/>said, 82 percent are already benefitting, the 18 percent need our help to try and get them to do the 
<br/>right thing and the Opposition can help instead of telling other stories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.R. MATASAWALEVU.- Honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka, in my area 
<br/>in the border between Ra and Wainibuka, down to Northland, the Licensed Carrier (LC) operators 
<br/>have not been fully paid for 12 weeks now.  Does your Ministry have the funds, and if so, when will 
<br/>full payment be made to them? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Poor performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are about 615 Road Service Licence (RSL) 
<br/>providers in the country, about more than 600, and there is a process in place.  Let me read this out, 
<br/>and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="7">Page 7</a></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  following  payment  process  is  followed  by  transport  providers.    The  RSL 
<br/>summarizes,  and  the  vouchers  are  submitted  by  the  transport  provider  to  the  District 
<br/>Officer.  The District  Transport Assistant  Officer counts the vouchers  and verifies the 
<br/>RSL voucher summary is correctly filled as per the checklist.  Once the verification is 
<br/>complete and the checklist filled, the relevant documents are submitted to Headquarters.  
<br/>Headquarters verifies the summary before HMS input and further processing, and within 
<br/>three to five days we make payments.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You submit the correct summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Within three to five days, it is paid. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The question is, why are there delays?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said, there are 615 RSL providers in the nine Education Districts.  Non-compliance 
<br/>by RSL providers often lead to delay in payment - RSL voucher summary being incorrectly filled, 
<br/>checklist accompanying the summary being incorrectly filled, the requirements of the checklist not 
<br/>being met, so for any errors or incompleteness discovered at Headquarters for any of the summaries 
<br/>received, the summaries are reverted to the District Office.  So, that is where the delay is.  You do it 
<br/>right at that point, you get your money within three days or five days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we are doing what we can to educate them.  So, again, I say 
<br/>– it takes two to play this – them the RSL people, the Ministry of Education, and if the summary is 
<br/>right, within three or five days, you get paid.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute  
<br/>(Question No. 40/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the establishment of the Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (FPSLI)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also join you in welcoming the students who are 
<br/>here with us this morning.  I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to be a little late and have my question 
<br/>deferred to the next Sitting, but I tried to be back in time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was at the funeral service for the late Apisalome Tudreu, a long serving 
<br/>civil servant of Fiji and a product of the training systems and processes that were in place during his 
<br/>time as a civil servant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To answer the honourable Assistant Minister’s question, Cabinet approved the establishment 
<br/>of the Fiji Public Sector Learning Institute (FPSLI) earlier this year on 19th March, 2024.  By that 
<br/>time, we were well into the process of serving out the budget of the year, and the establishment of 
<br/></span><span>the FPSLI which will ensure the Fiji public sector as a skilled and experienced workforce needed to 
<br/></span><span>build a strong future for our nation.  The Institute, delivering high quality work and relevant learning 
<br/>programmes using timely  and cost-efficient  approach, will support the  realisation of Government 
<br/>priorities and improve service delivery to the community and businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training will cover the following: service examination; customer service; 
<br/>ethics and code of conduct; quality circles; project management and monitoring; various policies and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>
<div><span>576 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>initiatives introduced in the Civil Service, finance and non-finance officers, government legislations, 
<br/>governance and leadership, public administration and management; human resources management; 
<br/>and local government administration and management, et cetera.  The Institute will also provide high 
<br/>quality specialised courses for Fiji’s Foreign Service officers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  will  be  a  centre  of  excellence  for  sharing  best  practices  in  modern 
<br/>diplomacy.    Through  the  Vuvale  Partnership  with  the  Australian  Government,  support  is  being 
<br/>confirmed through various training providers including the Australian Diplomatic Academy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Institute will also help in creating a learning organisation, separate from 
<br/>the Civil Service, that will eventually build a reputation for quality learning and be accepted as a 
<br/>provider of choice by the Civil Service and the business community. And I refer to the late Apisalome 
<br/>Tudreu, who grew up in the Civil Service using the various stages of training provided by Public 
<br/>Service Commission of his time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the future, it is intended that fee-for-service programmes will also be provided or offered 
<br/>to other organisations outside of the public sector, also in the Pacific, especially the Small  Island 
<br/>States.  The budget will be implemented as part of the 2024-2025 Budget and the Cabinet approval 
<br/>was received towel into this Budget year.  Work programmes will also be initiated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is envisaged that an amount of $1.3 million would be sought for operational and capital 
<br/>expenditure.  The timeframe for the Institute to be implemented will be in three stages, including the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>design phase; 
<br/>preparation of the physical classroom and centre; and  
<br/>various MOUs with partner institutes in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stage one, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Institute involves enlisting the expertise 
<br/>of qualified consulting services to provide guidance and support to the Ministry of Civil Service in 
<br/>establishing and developing the FPSLI.  The consulting team will work closely with Government 
<br/>stakeholders to design the Institute’s structure, develop its curriculum, and establish key partnerships 
<br/>to ensure its success. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A Terms of Reference for a consultancy service  to investigate the establishment of FPSLI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will be advertised this week.   The following deliverables for the consulting firm are: 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Research and scope of the establishment of FPSLI. 
<br/>Development of FPSLI’s strategic plan, including vision, mission, goal and structure. 
<br/>Design and develop comprehensive curriculum framework and course materials aligned 
<br/>with FPSLI’s objectives. 
<br/>Facilitation of accreditation and registration processes with relevant authorities. 
<br/>Implementation and management of IT services, including website development, Learning 
<br/>Management Systems (LMS) setup and review and revamp of the current Moodle Platform 
<br/>and Training Packages. 
<br/>Delivery of training programmes to upskill current MCS, including how to write training 
<br/></span><span>packages for online platforms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stage 2, Mr. Speaker, Sir, involves improving the physical training and learning facilities to 
<br/>support  face  to  face  learning  and  provide  allocation  for  the  Institute  to  operate  as  a  recognised 
<br/>institute.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 577 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  refurbishment  of  the  Government  Training  Centre  in  Nasese  will  include  scoping  in 
<br/>2024, source funding 2024-2025 and completion in 2025-2026.  The budget of $1 million is requested 
<br/>under Head 50 for OAHU. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOUs, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Somare Institute of Leadership and Governance and 
<br/>the Vanuatu Institute of Public Administration and Management have been developed and submitted 
<br/>for endorsement.  The MOUs seek to explore opportunities for jointly extending learning services 
<br/>provided by these similar institutes in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, and provide roles 
<br/>in Fiji, including participation in experience sharing and institutional building activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the nature and legal status of the FPSLI, there will be consultations with the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Office of the Solicitor-General to determine this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I resume my seat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have allowed the Civil Servants today to take 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>half a day off and support our rugby teams either at the ground or on television. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I also wish to pay contribute to the late Mr. Apisalome Tudreu. 
<br/>We, the old students of Ratu Kadavulevu School, presented our </span><span>reguregu</span><span> there yesterday.  He was 
<br/>at RKS from the late 1970s to mostly 1980s. Of course, Vice-President of the Methodist Church of 
<br/>Fiji.  He was a civil servant, he contributed a lot and we do remember him and our condolences to 
<br/>Eka and the family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My simple question to the honourable Prime Minister Sir, is about Fiji Public Sector Learning 
<br/>Institute (FPSLI) as being a recognised institute.  This is going to deal mainly with adult training and 
<br/>one of the key aspects of adult training is what we call Recognition of Current Competencies (RCC) 
<br/>and Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).  My simple question to the honourable Minister is, how is 
<br/>FPSLI preparing or prepared for this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Leader of the Opposition  knows 
<br/>there are entry requirements which are perused by the selection panels and there are also competency 
<br/>assessments carried out by the various departments.  Those all account towards a clear progression 
<br/>of a civil servant and also towards a non-recommendation of a civil servant to continue their training 
<br/>in the Institute.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we enjoy this afternoon’s match, I hope we will be mindful of those who continue to serve 
<br/>in the police services, fire services and military services of our country - those who will not be able 
<br/>to come and watch the game with us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just along the same lines of the question that was 
<br/>asked by the honourable Leader of the Opposition, one of the things that we find in a lot of Ministries 
<br/>is that there are people that have the competency to be able to do things.  They have proven it in the 
<br/>way that they can write, and they can do things but because they do not have the same academic 
<br/>qualifications than others and not recognised as such.  So, my question is – is there a possibility of 
<br/>ticking off the competencies that they already have, so that when they fit into a programme, they do 
<br/>not have to go and re-do what they are already able to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Cross credit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Cross  crediting,  that  is  what  we  mean  by  Recognition  of  Current 
<br/>Competencies (RCC), so instead of having to do the whole programme, you will just have to do the 
<br/>portion to plug the gaps.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for some time now, I have been asking the office to 
<br/>try and reduce the size of the submission, paperwork required that they send up for my final approval 
<br/>for the final ‘yes’ or ‘no’, to the filling of some civil service positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, there is a lot of that being done right now but it is all on paper and I have asked the Service 
<br/>to  reduce  the  paperwork.    As  you  have  heard,  we  are  trying  to  have  a  lot  of  interaction  with  the 
<br/>computer,  have  a  portal  ready  and  available,  as  well  as  the  starting  point  of  the  Open  Merit 
<br/>Recruitment System (OMRS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for coming up with such initiative.  I am just trying to get some clarity, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has actually funded Pacific Polytech with a couple of million dollars.  Now, 
<br/>we are actually forming a new institute.  For clarification, why can we not use Pacific Polytech to 
<br/>provide the same training because the honourable Prime Minister is asking for another million dollars 
<br/>to establish this institute?  Having funded a particular institute, why can that institute not be used to 
<br/>provide this training? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member, but there was a 
<br/>distinct difference between what is provided for under Pacific Polytech and also in-service training 
<br/>and progression as will be covered by the Institute. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Status of the Seaweed Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>             (Question No. 41/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the seaweed farming having huge potential in coastal communities and maritime 
<br/>islands,  can  the  honourable  Minster  for  Fisheries  and  Forestry  inform  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>current status of the Seaweed Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before responding to the Oral Question this morning, 
<br/>please, allow me to clarify the issue highlighted in the </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> today, indicating the non-clarity of 
<br/>my statement yesterday.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span> indicated that I spoke about the assessment of net emissions under the Forest 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yet, the statement by the honourable Minister, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was 
<br/>actually  providing  some  clear  information  on  the    REDD+  and  FCPF  arrangements,  with  the 
<br/>Government detailing the work that has been carried out so far and where that works is currently 
<br/>placed at, as of this week.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  written  statement  clarifying  how  the  statements  for  the  net  emission  under  the  FCPF 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Programme, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will be presented for the information of this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to respond to the question and  I thank the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the farming of seaweed was initiated under the Commodity Development

<div><span>Framework Project in the 1980s.  It is a low-tech process, well suited to the lifestyle of rural coastal 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Echeuma</span><span> seaweed has already been technically feasible in Fiji.  Seaweed farming has proven 
<br/>to be a stable income source with proven health benefits and alternative food source.  Its universal 
<br/>appeal  is  evident  as  it  flourishes  across  the  Northern,  Central,  Western  and  Eastern  Divisions, 
<br/>establishing clusters in various locations, like Lakeba, Nakalou, Dama, Sasa and Dakuniba in the 
<br/>Northern  Division.    It  is  providing  economic  security  to  coastal  communities,  women  and  youth 
<br/>groups alike.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  although  the  commodity  is  well  developed  and  ready  for  large  scale 
<br/>commercialisation,  until  now  the  industry  has  not  reached  the  level  it  was  anticipated  to  reach. 
<br/>Seaweed farming has slowed momentum over the last three years with productions volumes dropping 
<br/>from an annual volume of 200 tonnes down to 85 tonnes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Market prices has always been a major challenge in seaweed farming. It must be sufficient to 
<br/>maintain  grower  interest,  compared  with  returns  to  competing  rural  income  sources,  like  fishing, 
<br/>copra, </span><span>dalo</span><span>, </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, to name a few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Coalition  Government  is  here  to  change  that.  The  unwavering  commitment  by  the 
<br/>Coalition Government towards the Seaweed Programme is evident through the increased allocation 
<br/>of $330,000 for the 2023–2024 fiscal year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a major turnaround made by the Ministry which aims to bring us back 
<br/>to where the seaweed industry needs to be. This will allow investors to partner with Government 
<br/>through the funding setup of seaweed farms and market accessibility.  The Ministry will, in  turn, 
<br/>provide  suitable  extension  and  advisory  services  for  the  10  viable  communities  to  considerably 
<br/>supply to this market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  partnership  will  also  improve  the  seaweed  farming  pricing  and  payment  structure. 
<br/>Communities will be able to make an arrangement with the investors on agreed buying price and this 
<br/>establishes quality standards and seaweed operating procedures for market needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  has  been  instrumental  in  augmenting  value  addition  and  expanding  market 
<br/>reach.    Through  strategic  partnerships  with  other  Ministries,  we  aim  to  unlock  new  avenues  for 
<br/>growth and sustainability, paving the way for a brighter future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking  ahead,  our  vision  is  ambitious,  yet  attainable.    We  aspire  to  produce  500  metric 
<br/>tonnes of seaweed annually within the next three years, engaging communities beginning with the 
<br/>Northern  Division,  expanding  to  other  Divisions.    By  2029,  our  goal  is  to  involve  60  percent  of 
<br/>coastal  communities  in  seaweed  farming,  fostering  inclusive  economic  development  with  an 
<br/>approximate return to community project owners of $1.2 million annually.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  believes  partnership  with  investors  and  the 
<br/>establishment of seaweed farmers’ cooperative will help to ensure the sustainability of the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  major  aspects  the  Ministry  believes  it  could  enhance  further,  is  to  develop  a 
<br/>strategic  approach  in  handling  over  the  commodity  setup  to  investors  and  support  community 
<br/>development programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In April last year, Cabinet approved the Ministry’s proposal for the adjustment to the current 
<br/>farming  arrangement  of  seaweed  to  cater  for  the  growing  market  demand.    This  underscores  our

<div><span>dedication to the growth and success of this initiative.  Our proposed strategy for mass production 
<br/>and integration underscores our dedication to improving efficiency and ensuring economic prosperity 
<br/>for all stakeholders involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry, for the first time ever, has signed a 
<br/>Public Private Partnership with a private entity, Soluk Island Fresh Company Limited.  This strategic 
<br/>partnership  aims  to  establish  a  community-based  seaweed  farming  collaboration  for  sustainable 
<br/>ocean management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this partnership, we will work together to promote eco-friendly and modern seaweed 
<br/>cultivation practices, creating new economic opportunities while preserving marine ecosystems.  By 
<br/>leveraging  the  collective  expertise  and  resources,  food  security  will  be  enhanced,  climate  change 
<br/>mitigated, and socio-economic development fostered in targeted seaweed farming communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister. That was quite a mouthful too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can understand that the global seaweed market 
<br/>has a forecasted value of $14.6 billion by 2031, and the 2023-2024 National Budget has allocated 
<br/>$330,000.  So, with this new allocation and knowing that the climate is one of the major issues, with 
<br/>the seaweeds being planted in shallow areas, with this $330,000 allocation, what innovative approach 
<br/>has the Ministry taken to mitigate these challenges for the farmers?  Mr. Speaker, Sir, part two of 
<br/>that is, if there is an issue of accessing to finance, you have mentioned about partnerships, what are 
<br/>the multilateral  and multisectoral  participatory  collaborations your Ministry is  endorsing to  boost 
<br/>these assistance and initiatives.? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Would you like to answer that question because you have covered the first 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>answer quite well?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is quite simple.  After giving us all the 
<br/>figures with respect to what is happening within the seaweed programme, what have you done to 
<br/>educate or otherwise, the community that does this seaweed farming with respect to value adding? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before you reply, honourable Minister, remember the initial question was 
<br/>raised by honourable Niudamu.  Are you doing seaweed farming up there in the hills?  You can reply 
<br/>to that question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are now starting with a new 360 degrees turnaround. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Opposition Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Listen! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is that the new variety? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- It is not the new variety, Sir, it is the damage they do to the seaweed

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>industry.  As I have mentioned in my statement, it has dropped from 200 tonnes to 85 tonnes, which 
<br/>means they are not producing for the last few years.  So, we are trying to build up this industry before 
<br/>doing training into value adding.  First, we need to start farming before we go into other things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- My supplementary question is similar to what honourable Rinesh Sharma 
<br/>asked.  The honourable Minister has just informed that there is increased budgetary allocation to the 
<br/>seaweed programme and despite that, there is a huge reduction in the production.  So, why so?  My 
<br/>question is when there is increased budgetary allocation, the production should increase. Is it due to 
<br/>the other factors? What are the other factors?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of research done during this period. We 
<br/>need to shift into various places that are suitable for seaweed farming. They have not been doing that 
<br/>in the previous years.  So, we need to go further, we need to do research on that. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, seaweed farming is we farm and we sell it a raw 
<br/>product.  There is an option. If we set up a factory or facility just to extract the carrageenan which is 
<br/>extracted from seaweed and is used in packed tinned product.  Canned meat, you have carrageenan 
<br/>in there.  If we go that way, set up that facility, maybe that will entice more people to go into farming 
<br/>and  then  we  can  export  the  carrageenan  which  will  bring  in  higher  value.    Has  there  been  in 
<br/>discussions along those lines? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU.- As I have mentioned earlier, once we have the stock the investors will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>come and they will establish that for that purpose. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Members.  The reply from the honourable Minister 
<br/>is very clear.  They are setting up the stock and then the investors will come running.  So, we will 
<br/>take it at that and leave it at that as well.

<div><span>Budget Implementation – Disaster Operations 
<br/>(Question No. 42/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  how  it  has  progressed  with  budget  implementation, 
<br/>concurrently  with  managing  disaster  operations  during  the  course  of  the  current  financial 
<br/>year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament;  I am pleased to provide a response on how the Ministry has progressed with its budget 
<br/>implementation and I thank the honourable Member for the question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst it continues to manage disaster operations during the course of this financial year. The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry strives to do its best in achieving its core responsibilities, that is, both the coordination and 
<br/>facilitation of rural development and managing disaster operations in its season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  average  results  of  93  percent  budget  utilisation  during  the  last  three 
<br/>years when the nation faced multiple hazards, namely Category 4 </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, Category 5 </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span>, 
<br/>Category 2 </span><span>TC Ana</span><span> and in the midst of COVID-19, is a testament of the Ministry’s commitment to

<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>diligently serve its people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have continuously informed and updated Parliament on the vulnerabilities that our nation is 
<br/>exposed to that has made extreme weather events a constant threat to our development gains.  This 
<br/>historical perspective not only sheds light on the challenges faced by the country but also underscores 
<br/>the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of its people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Environmental hazards including cyclones, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis have, over the 
<br/>years,  brought  about  devastating  consequences,  prompting  the  Government  to  prioritise  disaster 
<br/>preparedness and mitigation efforts.  However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the Adoption of Global and 
<br/>Regional Agendas and Mechanisms, Fiji has tailor-made the Disaster Risk Reduction Initiatives so 
<br/>that our development is risk informed and sustainable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I stand here today, the various communities of practice on Disaster Risk 
<br/>Reduction continues to churn our literature, programmes, initiatives and policies, all racing against 
<br/>time to ensure that the  Globe, including Fiji, achieves the Sustainable Development Goals  within 
<br/>agreed timeframes. While implementing them in-country to some extent, as reduced disaster risk, 
<br/>there still remains a level of risk for financial investments towards our public sector development 
<br/>programmes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  Minister  responsible  for  Disaster  Management,  I  have  been  entrusted  the  task  of 
<br/>mainstreaming disaster risk reduction into all aspects of development for our community, as well as 
<br/>Government as a whole, and within this enormous task lies the responsibility of ensuring sufficient 
<br/>financial  investments  to  manage  the  existing  risks  through  mitigation  preparedness,  response  and 
<br/>recovery efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, please, allow me to shed some light to Parliament of the Ministry’s overall 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget utilisation rate in the recent past three financial years, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in 2020-2021, 87 percent utilisation rate on the budget allocation of $16.6 million;  
<br/>in 2021-2022, 96 percent budget utilisation rate from the budget allocation of $14.5 million; 
<br/>and 
<br/>year 2022-2023, 97 percent utilisation rate on the budget allocation of $15 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these achievements were realised in the same period where Fiji experienced 
<br/></span><span>TC Tino</span><span>, </span><span>TC Herald</span><span> and </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> in 2020 to 2021 and 2022 to 2023 with </span><span>TC Harold</span><span>, </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, </span><span>TC 
<br/></span><span>Cody</span><span> and </span><span>TC Mal</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite those achievements, I would like to state that the Ministry has had 
<br/>its  fair  share  of  staff  retention  challenges  in  the  recent  years,  sometimes  Government  takes  for 
<br/>granted. This is mostly in the forms of previous Government’s lack of appreciation and compensation 
<br/>of  the  staffing  ability  to  work  long  hours  with  little  to  know  benefits  provided  any  disaster 
<br/>management operation, despite the assistance of our key line Ministries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As most civil  servants  usually take rest  during any disaster, our Ministry staff are usually 
<br/></span><span>engaged full time for this purpose, to ensure timely response and recovery for the people of Fiji.  As 
<br/></span><span>a result, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our staff resignations have increased from 2 percent to 5 percent in these 
<br/>three financial years. In the year 2020-2021, it was 2.4 percent; 2021-2022, it was 5.21 percent; and 
<br/>2022-2023, it was 5.46 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Staff resignation was mainly due to better offers from other line Ministries, including regional 
<br/></span><span>organisations that offered much better salaries and benefits to our staff because of the nature of work 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>

<div><span>Questions

<div><span> 583 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they undertake in the Ministry.  For the current financial year, the resignation rate has already reached 
<br/>3.82 percent and we are confident that the removal of short-term contracts by this Government will 
<br/>bring  some  sense  of  security  to  our  staff  and  civil  servants  as  a  whole.    On  a  positive  note,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges the dedication and commitment of the remaining staff who 
<br/>have decided to continuously serve the people of Fiji, despite all the challenges. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry had been allocated a total budget of $29 million for the current 
<br/>financial  year  (2023-2024).    Out  of  this,  $15  million  is  the  operating  budget,  of  which  about  51 
<br/>percent  has  been  utilised.    Our  personnel  costs  budget  is  about  51  percent  of  the  total  operating 
<br/>budget,  and  the  Ministry  has  utilised  67  percent  of  its  budgeted  personnel  costs.    Combined 
<br/>expenditures for the other five Standard Expenditure Groups have reached only about 35 percent.  
<br/>Out of the $13 million capital budget, 85 percent or $11 million has been released to the Ministry 
<br/>and overall, 48 percent of this has been committed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, I would like to note that budget utilisation for a number of capital development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>projects have exceeded 80 percent commitment.  Those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community  Access  Roads,  Footpaths  and  Footbridges  (CARFF)  Programme  where  85 
<br/>percent of its $2 million budget has been released to the Ministry, of which 88 percent is 
<br/>now committed. 
<br/>Self-Help Programme where 100 percent of its $1 million budget has been released to the 
<br/>Ministry, of which 87 percent is now committed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>High Risk Water and Sanitation Programme, where 100 percent of its $0.8 million budget 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has been released, of which 84 percent is now committed. 
<br/>Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance Scheme where 100 percent of this $0.5 million budget 
<br/>has been released to the Ministry, of which 82 percent is now committed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Upgrading of Staff Quarters Programme where 50 percent of its $1 million budget has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>released to the Ministry, of which 83 percent is now committed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as this august Parliament is fully aware, the Ministry was assigned three 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>new Capital Development Programmes in this financial year, and they are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rural Housing Assistance Programme; 
<br/>Rural and Outer Island Development Programme; and 
<br/>Seafaring Entrepreneurial Assistance (SEA) Programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  SEA  Programme  is  a  relatively  easier  one  to  implement  as  it  only 
<br/>requires procurement of boat and engine from approved tender suppliers, hence utilisation rate is now 
<br/>above 80 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rural Housing Assistance (RHA) Scheme and Rural and Outer Island Programme (ROI) 
<br/>requires more work, including the tender process for machineries to be procurred or hired under ROI, 
<br/>and  finalisation  of  plans  and  housing  materials  for  RHA,  let  alone  finetuning  guidelines  for 
<br/>implementation.  I believe that will answer a lot of the questions from honourable Premila Kumar, 
<br/>who was asking about the number of houses we have completed uptil now.  I must highlight that the 
<br/></span><span>Ministry was able to recruit the required personnel for these Programmes in the past three months, 
<br/></span><span>which has greatly assisted in progressing with the administrative works required for the programme 
<br/>implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  RHA  Programme,  I  have  already  provided  an  update  in  my  earlier  response  on 
<br/>Wednesday whereas for the ROI Programme, the Ministry is now successfully completing all the 
<br/>necessary  Tender  Board  approval  processes  which  should  be  progressing  with  procurement  and

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>service delivery in the next two or three months.  I note that the tenders, once awarded, will be valid 
<br/>for three years, which means for the new financial year, the Ministry should be ready to implement 
<br/>in the first quarter, once development projects have been identified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  November 2023, the Fiji  Meteorological  Services provided the 2023-
<br/>2024 Cyclone Season Outlook, forecasting two to three tropical cyclones which are likely to pass 
<br/>through Fiji’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) during the 2023-2024 tropical cyclone season.  Even 
<br/>while Fiji was impacted by Category 2 </span><span>TC Mal, </span><span>the intense rainfall brought about by rainbands has 
<br/>impacted parts of our country with flash floods and riverine flooding in the month of November, 
<br/>mainly impacting the Wainadoi area and recent March floods heavily impacting the Central, Western 
<br/>and Northern Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the cost of responding to </span><span>TC Mal</span><span> was $212,000, catering for fuel to support 
<br/>operations  and  initial  damage  assessments,  the  charter  of  vessels,  procurement  of  food  ration  for 
<br/>evacuees,  and  communication,  support  and  subsistence  allowance  for  the  officers  manning  our 
<br/>emergency operations centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Whilst the investment of the Fiji Government is acknowledged, it would be remiss of me not 
<br/>to mention the critical support provided by our partners in the region, particularly the Governments 
<br/>of New Zealand and Australia, who have always provided disaster response support in both cash and 
<br/>kind, in particular, the humanitarian emergency relief supplies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must acknowledge the work of the Ministry staff in trying to press on with 
<br/>its two core roles through a 12-month period.  One new programme that has been assigned to the 
<br/>Ministry  is  the  co-ordination  for  relocation  as  per  the  Standard  Operating  Procedure  for  Planned 
<br/>Relocation Guidelines.  I have already informed Parliament earlier this week about the progress on 
<br/>the relocation of the Nabavatu Village.  We are working with existing resources and agencies to co-
<br/>ordinate  this  project  with  other  agencies  of  the  Government.    The  Ministry  has  already  made  its 
<br/>submission  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  the  establishment  of  a  new  Relocation  Unit  as  per  the 
<br/>Planned Relocation Guideline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the Divisions of the Ministry worked together during cyclone and non- 
<br/>cyclone  season  to  achieve  its  planned  activities.    Of  course,  when  it  comes  to  saving  lives, 
<br/>development work will be secondary.   I must say that it is not always an easy journey for the staff 
<br/>as they know that their deliverables for those two core roles still have to be achieved, and I commend 
<br/>them for their passion and dedication.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like many of the Ministries, we are also working on reviewing our 10-year 
<br/>(2021-2031)  Strategic  Development  Plan.    Obviously,  we  will  have  to  align  to  the  new  Strategic 
<br/>Development Plan, and we are mindful of the review of the Fijian Administration which may have 
<br/>some impact on how the Ministry provides its service to the people of Fiji.  Nevertheless, the Ministry 
<br/>is  also  working  on  improving  its  employee  satisfaction  and  retention  strategy  through  ongoing 
<br/>training and re-training opportunities that would be ready for any inevitable change that may come 
<br/>our way in the foreseeable future, including mitigation efforts for our staff turnover.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  SDG17  on  Partnership  for  the  Goals  stands  as  a  guiding 
<br/></span><span>principle in our pursuit of sustainable development and disaster management and rural development 
<br/>which  underscores  imperative  cooperation  and  partnerships  in  our  collective  endeavour.    By 
<br/>emphasising  the  significance  of  multi-stakeholder  partnerships,  capacity  building  and  resource 
<br/>mobilisation, we affirm  our shared obligation to  address  global  challenges including  disaster risk 
<br/>reduction and resilience in developments.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 585 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  worst  disasters  that  we  had  was  the 
<br/>flooding that happened in the village of Cogea.  Cogea is a place where two rivers converge, and I 
<br/>was actually in that village to see it flooded, homes filled with mud and completely destroyed.  We 
<br/>were also part of the programme of trying to relocate the village, and we were there at the ground 
<br/>break.  I just would like to know if the honourable Minister might give us some update on how far 
<br/>that has progressed - the relocation of Cogea Village to the new site? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. DITOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, the Fiji Council of Social Services 
<br/>(FCOSS)  has  taken  lead  role  in  the  Cogea  relocation,  and  we  have  given  her  our  assurance  and 
<br/>commitment to see what she can be assisted with from the Government.  At the moment, I believe 
<br/>there is a German NGO, I think it is Brot fur die Welt, that is financing for that.  Sir, FCOSS has 
<br/>taken lead on that, but we are also providing oversight, and if there is any assistance that they need, 
<br/>we will provide that when they need it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is on 
<br/>the Rural and Outer Island (ROI) ProgrammeROI.  Sir, ROI as you are aware, honourable Minister. 
<br/>was with the Ministry of Agriculture.  You have just stated in your statement that there are still a lot 
<br/>of projects, or whatever it is, that is still undergoing the tender process.  My question is, there was a 
<br/>purpose behind ROI when it was in the Ministry of Agriculture, what has changed that the programme 
<br/>has now been shifted to the Ministry of Rural Development in terms of the purposes in which it was 
<br/>established, and the type of projects undertaken when ROI was with the Ministry of Agriculture?  So, 
<br/>what is the main difference now when that has been transferred to your Ministry?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, before you reply could you just explain what ROI 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stands for? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. DITOKA.- It is the Rural and Outer Island Development Programme.  I believe 
<br/>that it is aligned with what the Coalition Government has decided to focus on, which is to give all 
<br/>the core agricultural aspects of the Ministry of Agriculture’s work to them and the development of 
<br/>the rural areas which, sometimes in some areas, they overlap with each other, and it is that overlap 
<br/>area that we have decided to focus the development work on ROI.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, there being no further supplementary questions, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intend to adjourn Parliament now for tea and we will resume when the bell is sounded. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We shall move on and before we proceed, honourable Members I would 
<br/>like to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of His Excellency the Australian High Commissioner, 
<br/>honourable Ewen McDonald.  Thank you so much for being with us this morning, Sir.  It is a very 
<br/>important occasion for us especially when we were preparing for this afternoon, the Drua. They are 
<br/>becoming rugby crazy as well.

<div><span>Plans for Upskilling Individuals  
<br/>(Question No. 43/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Considering  the  skilled  labour  shortage  due  to  many  workers  leaving  Fiji,  can  the 
<br/>honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation 
<br/>inform  Parliament  on  any  plans  to  quickly  upskill  individuals  to  fill  the  vacancies  in  the 
<br/>tourism industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I would just like to recap what the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil Aviation said earlier on.  Strictly speaking, the tradition 
<br/>in Parliament is, when a question is being proposed and the mover of the question is not present, then 
<br/>that lapses automatically.  But, again, this time around, given that we are trying to build a very close 
<br/>relationship that we have and also to be mindful of the time taken in preparing questions, et cetera, 
<br/>especially from you, honourable Members, to our Tables and Committees Unit, it is a hell of a task 
<br/>being taken there to have them in this final form and after going through the Business Committee as 
<br/>well. So, I have taken it upon myself not to be so strict but to be lenient in the understanding that we 
<br/>can all enjoy this whilst the time is still here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to address the question raised by honourable 
<br/>Koya regarding the plan to quickly upskill individuals to fill the vacancies in the tourism industry.  
<br/>The concern is the increasing exodus of social skilled workers from Fiji to overseas countries.  Let 
<br/>me just, at the outset, Sir, say that the question is quite timely because the migration side of the story 
<br/>is well publicised while the education and training story is less known.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I would like to acknowledge the remarkable resilience of the tourism 
<br/>industry.  Despite the significant challenges brought by COVID-19 which led to a massive exodus 
<br/>of  workers  from  the  sector,  many  of  whom  transitioned  to  alternative  careers  or  pursuing  further 
<br/>education, the industry not only survived but is thriving.   Visitor arrival and hotel occupancy rate is 
<br/>at its highest level which is a testimony of the flexibility and adaptability of the industry.  We all 
<br/>know that 40 percent of GDP in this country is from tourism.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, the increased departure of skilled professionals has underscored the pressing need 
<br/>for swift action to upskill and reskill workers and fill the resulting vacancies.  I wish to highlight the 
<br/></span><span>proactive  efforts  of  the  Ministry  of  Education  and  the  Higher  Education  Commission  of  Fiji  in 
<br/></span><span>spearheading training, upskilling and reskilling initiative for both, unemployed and employed people, 
<br/>to take up jobs becoming vacant upon migration of the existing workers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on 4</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2024, a meeting was held at the Sheraton Hotel among the 
<br/>tourism stakeholders, Ministers and Ministry senior staff members to find solutions for increasing 
<br/>skill gaps in the industry due to the increased departure of skilled workers.  The Director of Sheraton

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Training Academy presented its industry-based interactive training method and offered to work with 
<br/>the Fiji National University (FNU) and other training providers in the country.  A follow-up </span><span>talanoa</span><span>
<br/>session  was  organised  by  the  Higher  Education  Commission  Fiji  on  17</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  2024,  bringing 
<br/>together key stakeholders and higher education providers to discuss how they could work together 
<br/>and collectively address the skills gap problem. The dialogue and development of a new programme 
<br/>is underway.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Coalition  Government  for  providing  1,800  grants  for  upskilling  and  reskilling 
<br/>unemployed  youth  in  the  country.    Out  of  1,800,  1,000  were  allocated  to  the  programmes  of  the 
<br/>tourism industry - 500 to mechanical courses and 300 to the construction industry.  This grant award 
<br/>gave a second chance to the unfortunate people who missed out on education themselves because 
<br/>they could not afford it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  player  that  has  recently  entered  into  the  field  of  education  is  Pacific 
<br/>Polytech.  With the grant given to them, they have graduated about 824 students with competency-
<br/>based certificates in various skillsets for the tourism and hospitality industry.  This is an example of 
<br/>the service providers that are out there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Higher Education Commission Fiji has started to hold Career Expo last year (2023).  It 
<br/>had one in Suva in October 2023 and in Lautoka in March 2024.  It plans to hold one next month in 
<br/>Labasa.  At the Careers Expo, Universities and Technical Institutions have their display booths and 
<br/>provide one stop platform to students and parents to understand the details of the qualifications they 
<br/>offer and respective job openings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the recent Lautoka Careers Expo, the topic, “New demand trends within 
<br/>Fiji’s tourism industry and skills required” was discussed.  The panel discussion was broadcasted 
<br/>live on </span><span>Fiji One. </span><span> The issues raised by the panel members and the feedback from the general public 
<br/>is  shared  with  the  qualification  providers  for  their  consideration  in  developing  new  tourism 
<br/>programmes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  was  unfortunate  that  Vocational  Centres  in  Secondary  Schools  were 
<br/>closed by the previous Government.  We are now reopening them, and the aim of these Vocational 
<br/>Centres is to offer Technical, Vocational and Education Training (TVET) programmes for Certificate 
<br/>Level I and Level II to Year 11 and Year 12 students respectively, and articulate them into Certificate 
<br/>III,  Diplomas  and  Degrees  offered  at  the  universities  and  technical  institutions.    Sir,  the  above 
<br/>initiative is per the curriculum reforms outlined in the </span><span>2023 Denarau Declaration</span><span> of the National 
<br/>Education Summit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Higher  Education  Commission  Fiji  is  implementing 
<br/>Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) policy within the higher education institutions.  This policy is 
<br/>a framework to evaluate the extensive experience of individuals without formal qualification, and 
<br/>award them with appropriate qualifications based on their industry experience.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Within the tourism industry, there are skilled professional workers whose industry expertise 
<br/>surpass  formal  qualification.    Yet,  a  first  limitation  in  career  advancement  due  to  not  having  a 
<br/></span><span>recognised  qualification  certificate.    The  introduction  of  RPL  addresses  this  gap  by  providing  a 
<br/></span><span>pathway  for  recognising  and  accrediting  the  valuable  experience  and  compensating  them  with 
<br/>deserving higher remuneration.  The aim is to hold back good workers from leaving the industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the imperative task of addressing the skills gap has been diligently cascaded 
<br/>to the Provincial Council level as well.  In November 2023, the Higher Education Commission Fiji 
<br/>held a meeting with the representatives from the 14 Provincial Councils, including Rabi and Kioa.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  aim  is  to  provide  education  and  training  to  the  unemployed  people  living  in  the  rural 
<br/>communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we all know, most of the people living in the nearby villages work as 
<br/>service staff in the hotels and resorts.  From the Provincial Council meeting, one representative from 
<br/>each Provincial Council has been chosen to identify unemployed youth who would be trained to work 
<br/>in the hotels and resorts located within their Provinces.   Sir, I have the pleasure in informing this 
<br/>august Parliament that through this initiative, a number of villagers have been trained and assisted to 
<br/>obtain gainful employment in nearby hotels and resorts. The cost of the training was paid by Tertiary 
<br/>Scholarship  and  Loans  Services  (TSLS)  from  the  1,800  competencies-based  skills  training  grant 
<br/>budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to ensure the relevance and efficacy of upskilling and reskilling initiatives, 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Education,  together  with  the  Ministry  of  Tourism,  will  continue  to  strive  in 
<br/>strengthening strategic partnership with the leading industry players.  This partnership will facilitate 
<br/>the  development  of  industry  relevant  curriculum,  provision  of  practical  career  opportunities  and 
<br/>access to mentorship programmes, thereby, assuring that upskilled individuals are well prepared to 
<br/>meet the evolving needs of the tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that from the above discussions, initiatives and 
<br/>plans of the Ministry of Education and the Public Service Commission, working collaboratively with 
<br/>industry stakeholders and the qualification training providers is adequately addressing the emerging 
<br/>skill gaps of the tourism and hospitality industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the testimony to my claim, I have here a table - a total of 2,035 students 
<br/>graduated  with  qualifications  in  various  skillsets  within  the  tourism  and  hospitality  industry  over 
<br/>2023 and into 2024.  On the other hand, Sir, it is interesting to note that in the year 2022, almost 100 
<br/>people were listed in the National Information Centre and are looking for work in the hotel tourism 
<br/>industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform this august Parliament that whilst there is an increase in 
<br/>skilled migration workers, our education and training providers are standing to the task and producing 
<br/>qualified and trained workers for the available jobs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  asking  the  question  and  giving  me  the  opportunity  to 
<br/>update Parliament on the issue of skills gap, the education and training of workers within the tourism 
<br/>and hospitality industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.-  I thank you for a comprehensive answer with respect to upskilling, et 
<br/>cetera, that needs to be done  and seeing that a lot is actually happening. In the short term, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister, is there a contingency plan, bearing in mind that our tourism workers are 
<br/>quite highly sought after, not  just by Australia and New Zealand and also by the UAE and other 
<br/>places, and bearing in mind also that migration is happening at break neck speed and the numbers 
<br/>are quite large, is there a contingency plan that incorporates us for the short term, bringing in foreign 
<br/>workers  into  the  industry  and  also  for  the  ancillary  industries  to  tourism,  like  the  laundry  guys, 
<br/></span><span>construction guys, et cetera? Have we had discussions with the Ministry of Immigration so that that 
<br/></span><span>can be facilitated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.-  The foreign content of the workforce is based on speciality bases - 
<br/>special skills. We do not have a programme in place where you could bring in workers, for the want 
<br/>of better words, at the entry level.  We are confident that we are producing sufficient numbers to 
<br/>meet any gaps at that level.  Just two weeks ago, I officiated in a graduation ceremony of 484 of our 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people, who had a six week training in tourism by Polytech, and that is the kind of training that we 
<br/>will do or carry out.   We know what they need to do, and we have people like that - service providers 
<br/>-FNU and others, who can train people within six or eight weeks to replace any gaps at that level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For foreigners, as I have said, it is only at that special skills level.  I do not think there is a 
<br/>need right now, Mr. Speaker, to go and bring in numbers as maybe contemplated by other industries 
<br/>in Fiji.  We can do it in tourism locally. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. RAVUNAWA.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Would the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister have the percentage of the graduates who have been absorbed into the workforce so far? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not have the exact numbers, but I can assure 
<br/>you that our graduates are competent. Something that I need to impress upon the employers is that 
<br/>they cannot be insisting on people to be work ready. That appears to be a limiting factor sometimes 
<br/>in the way we view our local graduates.  They have to give them time to adapt into their system.   I 
<br/>was part of a global chain, and it has its systems, its culture and everything else.  It took me a couple 
<br/>of months to get to know their system - some of the best developers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji today, we have chains like Hilton, Sheraton, Intercontinental, and they are some of the 
<br/>best in the world. So, our people are world trained, they can do the job, but work ready would take 
<br/>three months, four months or five months to get them to be accustomed to the system.  I was at the 
<br/>graduation ceremony for USP and FNU lately and being a hotelier myself, what I saw, I am very 
<br/>confident that our people there can rise to the challenge and take on senior roles or specialist roles in 
<br/>tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister, I totally agree 
<br/>with you that those who are coming out of institutions are not work ready.  They need to work under 
<br/>someone who will then pass on to them the nous of the job.  But in order to that, you need to have 
<br/>people in place that still have that level of competence that allows them to pass on the right things, 
<br/>the right habits, the right attitude, et cetera. So, do you still have that class of worker in the industry 
<br/>that will then be able to pass on this to the new graduates coming out into the hotels? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- The answer is ‘yes’.  Indeed, some of the big chains, like Mariott, 
<br/>are now working with FNU to help our graduates adapt to the Marriott system and this also happens 
<br/>with Intercontinental and other chains.  So, the answer is ‘yes’, the training programmes in these big 
<br/>chains is quite solid and I believe our people –joining those chains will perform to the expectations, 
<br/>as anywhere else in the world.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The beauty about this, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that our graduates, with a couple of years with the 
<br/>lives of Intercontinental, can join any Intercontinental in the world, and that is how good our people 
<br/>are.  Your time in a big name like that, we are marketable globally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I offer the floor to the next author of the question that is going to be 
<br/>raised, I would like to acknowledge once more the presence of a few faces in the gallery.  The first 
<br/>one being Mr. Devo, sitting in the gallery on the left, and he will be in charge of our retreat that is 
<br/></span><span>going to take place next week.  He is from Canada.  With them on the same side is once again Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Rasova and he is wearing blue and Mr. Rajesh Singh, the former Assistant Minister, not forgetting 
<br/>those on the right, the members of our public. Thank you for taking time to be present here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister is not available so 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Fire Report - Vatuwaqa Primary School 
<br/>(Question No. 45/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  inform  Parliament  as  to  whether  the  Fire  Report  from  the  National  Fire 
<br/>Authority on the Vatuwaqa Primary School fire in 2022 has been received? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it must  be my lucky day, three questions in a row.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I can confirm that the Ministry of Education has received the fire report of the fire at 
<br/>Vatuwaqa Primary School.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of 347 students and nine teachers were at the 
<br/>school  and  they  have  been  relocated  to  the  neighbouring  primary  school,  except  for  the  Head  of 
<br/>School.  The Police have reported that that incident is not accidental.  My Ministry has requested a 
<br/>thorough investigation and to prosecute the liable party or parties.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a bit of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The school started as a Government School 
<br/>in  1906.  The  controlling  authority  is  the  Parents,  Teachers  Association  (PTA)  after  Government 
<br/>ceased supporting the school.  The number of rooms fully damaged   were four classrooms, one office 
<br/>and one canteen; partially damaged - one library, one classroom and school hall. The fire started from 
<br/>the canteen area.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  leave  it  at  that  for  this  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  but  students  were  relocated  to  surrounding 
<br/>schools  including  Draiba  Fijian  School,  Veiuto  Primary  School,  Yat  Sen  Primary  School,  John 
<br/>Welsey  Primary  School  and  Pundit  Vishnu  Deo  Memorial  Primary  School  and  other  home  zone 
<br/>schools. Furniture was also supplied with school stationery items for students.  So, every student and 
<br/>teacher have been placed elsewhere.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you have noticed, the fire happened long time 
<br/>ago. I had asked this question last year and we were told in this Parliament that they were waiting for 
<br/>the  fire  report.    My  question  is,  16  months  now,  his  predecessor  in  the  last  sitting  committed  to 
<br/>repairing the school. Is the Government still committed to repair the school, now that they received 
<br/>the fire report in this financial year?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school budget for 2024-2025 includes the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>budget for the rehabilitation of the school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  students  from  Vatuwaqa  Primary  School  were 
<br/>moved to other schools.  Did the Ministry carry out any survey to understand the emotional impact 
<br/>on students in their studies?
