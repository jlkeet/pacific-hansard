<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for the week and also those joining us 
<br/>in the gallery and those watching the proceedings on television and the internet. Thank you for your 
<br/>continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament.</span><span>

<div><span>Honourable Members, please join me in welcoming the law students from the University of 
<br/></span><span>the South Pacific. Welcome to your Parliament and whilst Friday’s proceedings are usually short, I 
<br/></span><span>hope that you will have an appreciation of the mechanics of Parliament proceedings. This is about 
<br/>the second incoming batches to attend the sittings and we are so humbly proud of your presence here 
<br/>because at times we do not know whether there is interest in the workings of Parliament or not.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>People place less importance in the proceedings of Parliament, but this is where, let me remind 
<br/>you, you may have been taught this, this is where they make laws, this is where they repeal the laws, 
<br/>and this is where they amend the laws of the country. It is a very important duty that the honourable 
<br/>Members here are charged to be responsible with and answer back to the people who voted them in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the people’s House, this august Parliament, and we wish you well in your stay here 
<br/>with us. Learn as much as possible when you are here with us. Only learn the good things, not the 
<br/>bad  things.  The  bad  things  you  leave  behind  in  Parliament.    I  am  supposed  to  welcome  another 
<br/>gentleman, but he is not here, and that is alright.
