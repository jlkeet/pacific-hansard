<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, may I remind you that each Member may speak for 
<br/>up to 10 minutes.  The Minister or Minister’s responsible for the subject matter of the Member’s 
<br/>speech may response.  No seconder is required, and there will be no other debate soon after the speech 
<br/>has been delivered.

<div><span>Farmer’s Perspective on the Dairy Sector 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my End of Week Statement in relation to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Dairy Industry from the farmer’s perspective.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dairy industry in  Fiji started after the World War  I by the European 
<br/>servicemen. These farms in Tailevu were involved in churning cream and supplying to the first butter 
<br/>factory which was established in Korovou in 1921. By 1924, another two butter factories were setup 
<br/>-  one  in  Waila,  Nausori  on  the  banks  of  Rewa  River,  later  to  become  Rewa  Cooperative  Dairy 
<br/>Company Limited; and the other was in Navua known as Fiji Pastoral Company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Later on, some Sikh community moved to Tailevu to help further develop the industry and 
<br/>now  are  major  contributors  to  the  total  national  raw  milk  production.  I  was  told  Kashmir  Singh, 
<br/>together with his son Harvindar Singh, who are the largest single producer of raw milk in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By 1968, all these three companies had merged to become Rewa Cooperative Dairy Company 
<br/>Limited (RCDCL) and also by this time, the factory had moved or relocated to Nabua so it could be 
<br/>closer to the market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Mr. Speaker, Sir, production from the peak of over 10 million litres has dropped down to 
<br/>6 million litres in 2023. This decline in production was not the result of the factory being sold to 
<br/>RCDCL  but  was  due  to  prevalence  of  Bovine  Brucellosis  and  Bovine  Tuberculosis  in  the  dairy 
<br/>industry.  The industry has lost over 5,000 productive animals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not see any other career as dedicated and demanding as a dairy farmer. 
<br/></span><span>Day in day out, they have to go out there and manage the stock and carry out their farming duties.  
<br/></span><span>Farmers have to wake up as early as 3.00 am to bring the cows in for milking. This is not done five 
<br/>days a week or seven days a week, this is done in 365 days a year. No other job demands this kind 
<br/>of dedication and for this, I salute our dairy farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, not specific to dairy, but in Fiji, agriculture or farming is not seen as a career 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and this has resulted in aging farmers, the dairy is no exception. This has been influenced by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="24">Page 24</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>urban sector drift and for employment in non-agriculture sector, it is perceived to have better salary 
<br/>and better life. Dairy is seen as a labour intensive, risky and lack of prestige profession compared to 
<br/>the jobs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In most of the small holder farms, dairy farming is not commercially looked at. Some farmers 
<br/>resort to selling their animals to meet community engagements or other financial needs. They do not 
<br/>realise that this is their stock which is generating them income and replacing this sold stock will take, 
<br/>at least, a year and half or two years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, farmer trainings by relevant authorities have almost grinded to a standstill 
<br/>and the focus of these institutions have been shifted from serving the farmers and advisory to running 
<br/>coffee shops and supermarkets. Institutions have lost focus of its responsibility of serving the dairy 
<br/>industry and the dairy farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  cost  of  farm  inputs  have  risen  significantly.  To  gain  efficiency  in 
<br/>production,  the  industry  needs  consistent  supply  of  dairy  feed  of  good  quality.  Apart  from  two 
<br/>ingredients, the rest are either imported or a by-product of imported commodity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, soil conditions on the farms after generations of grazing has deteriorated. 
<br/>Liming is a common practice that needs to be done to improve soil condition, particularly in acidic 
<br/>soils. This neutralises the acidic soil, improves soil condition and improves nutrient uptake. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, land lease security is mandatory for dairy farming. There are some farmers 
<br/>whose  land  leases  have  not  been  renewed  and  this  is  sending  chills  down  the  spine  of  few  other 
<br/>farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, stock or animal theft on the dairy farms negatively affects production and 
<br/>the overall farm efficiency. The dairy sector has recently seen a surge in theft of dairy animals. Just 
<br/>on one farm, Sir, 24 animals were stolen within a span of five months. Reports have been lodged, 
<br/>culprits have been identified and still, nothing has been done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the assurance of the Permeant Secretary of Ministry of Defence, nothing has been 
<br/>done so far. The farmers are questioning whether the Police is capable of resolving the issue. The 
<br/>faith on the efficiency of Police is dwindling down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The farmers have also requested Government’s assistance in establishing pasture and fodder 
<br/>banks. Malato and juncao are two fodder species introduced by the previous Government, but more 
<br/>needs to be introduced, including other good fodder products.  This will enable the farmers to provide 
<br/>required nutrients to the dairy animals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Good quality pasture and good fodder can have a positive impact on milk quality and milk 
<br/>production. It also reduces the supplementary Fiji requirement in the dairy. Having a fodder bank on 
<br/>the farm will also cushion the effects of climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our farmers are struggling to meet the high cost of farm inputs. Farmers need 
<br/></span><span>assistance in dairy feed.  The price of one of our local product, molasses, have almost doubled in the 
<br/></span><span>recent years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Farm chemicals is mandatory for dairy farms to maintain quality and hygiene, and this needs 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to be subsidised so that, we are able to use the right product on the farm.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reliance on labour on dairy farm is heavy, therefore, investment in milking machines and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 593 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The reliance on labour on dairy farm is heavy, therefore, investment in milking machines and 
<br/>other  machines  is  important.    They  are  requesting  Government  to  subsidise  the  cost  of  milking 
<br/>machines and milking machine parts and dairy drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Animal health is of utmost importance in maintaining good efficiency on the farm.  Therefore, 
<br/>the  farmers  are  requesting  the  Government  to  assist  them  with  subsidised  dairy  drugs,  including 
<br/>antibiotics for control of mastitis, which is prevalent in our farms.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  in  conjunction  with  the  relevant  authorities 
<br/>needs  to  embark  on  a  breed  improvement  plan  for  all  farmers,  especially  those  who  have  lost  a 
<br/>significant number of animals due to bovine brucellosis and bovine tuberculosis.  The large farms 
<br/>are the ones which are commercially run and have the capability of increasing production.  Often 
<br/>these  breed  improvement  programmes  are  not  run  on  these  farms.    Farmers  are  asked  to  either 
<br/>eradicate the disease off completely before any assistance can be provided.  If the Ministry starts 
<br/>waiting long enough, there will be no large farms to provide any assistance to.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is evident that Fiji cannot import cattle from Australia and New Zealand 
<br/>due to diseases prevalent in these countries.  Therefore, the Government needs to embark on a major 
<br/>artificial breeding programme using embryo transfer and artificial insemination.  New Zealand has 
<br/>over 4 million cows and out of that, 3.9 million cows had been artificially bred in the dairy.   Fiji has 
<br/>less than 10,000 cows.  There is nothing that should stop us from doing so.  Calf rearing is another 
<br/>area the farmers need assistance in.  The subsidised calf milk needs to continue so that the farmer 
<br/>can rear good quality calves which can become better quality milking animals later on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr Speaker Sir, the elements of climate change has seriously affected the dairy industry.  First 
<br/>is the availability of clean water on the farms.  Some farms have almost no access to clean water on 
<br/>the farm.  The farmers have requested if other means could be explored, including boreholes on the 
<br/>farms so that they can have access to clean water and maintain quality on the farm.  Heat stress has 
<br/>significantly contributed to the decrease in the milk letdown.  The erection of pre-milking covered 
<br/>holding yards can help in reducing the heat stress.  The reduction of heat stress can increase the milk 
<br/>production by 5 percent to 7 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, continuous training is very important in the industry, therefore, the farmers 
<br/>have requested if a model farm and a heifer rearing farm can be established.  These farms, together 
<br/>with  these  courses  run  by  FNU  can  provide  training  for  optimum  management  of  dairy  farms.  
<br/>Farmers, together with their farm hands can be trained there.  This week, honourable Tubuna, while 
<br/>deliberating  on  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture’s  Annual  Report  asked  if  the  farmers  are  prepared  to 
<br/>change.   Yes, farmers are preparing for change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Please, do round off, honourable Nand. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Famers, if see it, feel it, they will change it.  
<br/>Finally, raw milk price has slightly increased over the last few years.  However, it was not sufficient 
<br/>enough to cover all the costs of production.  I thank the Government for providing a top-up on the 
<br/>farm gate price and look forward to their continued support.  However, Sir, they have also pointed 
<br/></span><span>out that the price of butter fat still stands at $5.80 a kilogramme.  One only needs to look at the price 
<br/></span><span>of butter on the shelves in the market to see the huge disparity.   The farmers have humbly requested 
<br/>the  Government  if  they  can  intervene  and  ensure  a  just  price  for  excess  butter  fat  is  received  by 
<br/>farmers. They will be forever grateful. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this, I would like to thank the honourable Members for listening to this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statement and thank the Government for its continued support to the dairy industry,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I look forward to this continued support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  thank  the  honourable  Sachida  for  a 
<br/>comprehensive speech on the state of the dairy industry in Fiji.  Let me just take us a little back in 
<br/>time. On Friday, 24</span><span>th</span><span> March 2017, just a little over seven years  ago, honourable Prof. Prasad had 
<br/>moved a motion and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“That  this  Parliament  agrees  that  in  light  of  the  struggling  dairy  industry  and 
<br/>worsening plight of dairy farmers, an extensive rehabilitation package be implemented 
<br/>for the vibrance and vitality of the dairy industry and the dairy farmers.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the then FijiFirst Government rejected the motion outright.  The 
<br/>then Attorney-General and Minister for Economy labelled the call for assistance to dairy farmers as 
<br/>political.  The honourable Prof. Biman Prasad was likened to a spider moving from the sugar industry 
<br/>to the dairy industry.  Now, seven years later the former CEO of FCDCL, the honourable Sachida 
<br/>Nand who is now a member of the FijiFirst Opposition wants dairy farmers helped and I thank him 
<br/>for that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, call it political grandstanding, one upmanship, </span><span>taulo, masipolo</span><span> or whatever 
<br/>it was then, I call on the Opposition to show a genuine sense of bipartisanship for now for the good 
<br/>of our dairy farmers and the nation.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, milk production statistics from 2009 to 2023 
<br/>shows that milk production has grown by 1.1 percent annually. However, the volume of formal milk 
<br/>production that is supplied directly to the dairy industry has fallen by 34.5 percent over the same 
<br/>period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During this period, formal milk production peaked at 8.96 million litres in 2014.  In 2023, it 
<br/>was 5.8 million litres.  Worse, Mr. Speaker, Sir, only 46 farmers supply 74 percent of formal milk 
<br/>production as of December 2023.  This is out of the 161 farmers engaged in the dairy industry.  In 
<br/>2023, the total  milk  production was 11.35 million  litres, only  5.87 million  litres were from  dairy 
<br/>farmers as formal production which is 51.7 percent of total milk production.  Therefore, 48.3 percent 
<br/>was not formal milk production.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite giving zero rated exclusivity to a corporate giant for 10 years, the former government 
<br/>miserably  failed  to  help  dairy  farmers  in  terms  of  both  boosting  their  production,  increasing  the 
<br/>number of farmers and reducing cost of production.  That company a subsidiary of a corporate giant 
<br/>milked profits and left the dairy farmers high and dry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  The  formal  milk  production  figures  is  testimony  to  this 
<br/>indisputable  fact.    Honourable  Sachida  Nand  knows  this  too  well  but  will  not  say  it  for  obvious 
<br/>reasons.  Nevertheless, dairy remains one of the important industries as it provides economic benefits 
<br/>for livelihoods and income generation to hundreds of dairy farmers and their families in Fiji.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  considering  the  high  number  of  challenges  faced  by  the  industry,  the  Government 
<br/>continues  to  support  and  provide  incentives  through  various  programmes  to  strengthen  the  dairy 
<br/></span><span>industry.  From 2010 to 2023, a total of $29 million have been allocated by the Ministry through the 
<br/></span><span>following programmes; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Dairy development programme; and  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Dairy industry programme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The highest amount of $5.5 million was allocated to the dairy industry this financial year by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 595 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Coalition Government.  Under these programmes, farmers have been assisted with initiatives like 
<br/>the price incentive where the Government provides a top up related to the milk price, subsidises milk 
<br/>cartage, feed, and calf milk replacer, provides basic infrastructures such as dairy sheds, calf sheds, 
<br/>stock  yards,  et  cetera.  These  initiatives  have  been  provided  to  enhance  the  productivity  of  dairy 
<br/>farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as has been rightly stated by my friend, honourable Sachida, apart from the 
<br/>above programmes, the dairy industry has also assisted in the control of Brucellosis and Tuberculosis. 
<br/>In 2009, Brucellosis re-emerged while Tuberculosis reached its peak of infections in 2014 causing 
<br/>severe devastation to the dairy industry. Initially some farms experienced a high prevalence rate of 
<br/>TB infected animals reaching up to 60 percent.  However, due to the Ministry’s Ongoing Testing 
<br/>Programme, these farms now have a prevalence rate of 1 percent to 2 percent.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has successfully decreased the Brucellosis infection with no 
<br/>cases  being  reported  over  the  last  three  years.      Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  the  Ministry’s 
<br/>Rehabilitation  Programme,  farmers  have  been  assisted  through  the  improvement  of  fencing, 
<br/>provision  of  calf  rearing  facility  for  farmers,  provision  of  stockyard  for  birth  control  of  animals, 
<br/>compensating farmers who lost their livestock through TB and Brucellosis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the challenges due to inbreeding on farms have been addressed by 
<br/>the Government through the introduction of the artificial insemination programme, and of course, 
<br/>the embryo transfer programme where we now have four new cattle breeds, one of them being the 
<br/>Brown Swiss which turns out to be both a dairy and beef breed.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, apparently the 
<br/>Ministry is providing bulls with improve genetics to farms that have been declared free of TB and 
<br/>Brucellosis in order to improve the genetics on those farms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like any other agriculture sector, the present generation are not interested in 
<br/>making dairy their livelihood. To combat this endemic issue, the Ministry and Fiji Higher Education 
<br/>Commission  in  collaboration  with  Navuso  Agricultural  Technical  Institute  have  introduced  a 
<br/>National Qualification Certificate in Dairy Production to young farmers. The first cohort of 15 young 
<br/>farmers have recently graduated from this Programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to address labour shortage, the Ministry has provided machines to assist 
<br/>farmers which include milking machines, roto harvesters, soft cutters to ease the process of milking 
<br/>harvesting  and  feeding  cattle.  Funds  have  been  provided  to  farmers  for  the  improvement  and 
<br/>establishment  of  parcels  through  land  preparation  using  tractors  and  diggers.  Recently,  the  dairy 
<br/>industry has encountered a significant increase in the cost of inputs. To mitigate these high costs, 
<br/>several activities are subsidised through the dairy development programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, land as correctly stated by the honourable Sachida is a sensitive issue and 
<br/>the Ministry is not mandated to negotiate lease renewal with landowners, but it works with iTLTB to 
<br/>deal with this issue and has been collaborating with other stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a lack of reinvestment by dairy farmers on their farms and farmers 
<br/>are mostly dependent on Government assistance to improve their facilities. These farmers also tend 
<br/></span><span>to invest elsewhere from the proceeds gained from the dairy business.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the financial technical support provided by Government has contributed to 
<br/>an increase in milk supply from 4.2 million millilitres to 5.87 million millilitres in 2023. There is an 
<br/>indication that the milk productivity per farmer and account numbers have increased, and farms are 
<br/>recovering well from the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of TB and Brucellosis.

<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  efforts  are  underway  by  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  to 
<br/>develop the informal dairy sector and capitalise on milk production mainly from smallholder farms 
<br/>to ensure that milk is pasteurised to reduce the risk of transmission of zoonotic disease.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s expansion plan, we will further develop the necessary 
<br/>infrastructure  for  dairy  farms  in  the  Western,  Central  and  Northern  Division.    The  Ministry  is 
<br/>committed to assisting farmers in addressing their challenges in collaboration with all stakeholders 
<br/>through various interventions to improve farm productivity and profitability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to draw your attention that we might 
<br/>be going over the 12.30 mark in our sitting today, and as such for the purpose of complying with 
<br/>Standing  Orders  with  respect  to  the  sitting  times,  I  now  call  upon  the  Leader  of  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament to move a Suspension Motion.
