<div><span>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE END OF WEEK STATEMENTS

<div><span>Cost of Living in Fiji Today 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Members, one of the single greatest 
<br/>thing affecting your normal every Fijian today is the cost of living.  The cost of what they have to 
<br/>pay or what they have to purchase in order just to live their normal lives.  Everyday (I think all of 
<br/>us),  we  meet  people  who  complain  about  these  all  the  time.  We  meet  them  in  the  taxis,  buses, 
<br/>churches, outside here or wherever we go  – in the markets, people are always complaining about 
<br/>these.  It is in sessions, and it is never ending.  I think people have the right to be able to do that 
<br/>because they are just talking about the problems that they face every day.  They have the right to talk 
<br/>about their day-to-day problems and we have all noticed these with our own eyes as we move around 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for me in particular, just speaking about myself, I live in Nakasi and we buy 
<br/>our vegetables at a little roadside market there.  There is a lady by the name of Mouna that we buy 
<br/>from, and this past year, I have seen the sizes of the pile of cassava that she sells for $10 get smaller 
<br/>and smaller and smaller.  Just in one year, it has really shrunk the amount of cassava that you can get 
<br/>for $10.  It has become much smaller.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few months ago, you could buy a sack of cassava wholesale at maybe at 
<br/>$60 or $70.  At one time, it shot up to $150 but that is what is happening, everything is getting much 
<br/>more expensive.  My family is one which eats rice very rarely, but today $10 worth of rice now goes 
<br/>far more than $10 worth of cassava.  The $10 worth of cassava just goes in one meal, so even for 
<br/>people like us, our dietary habits are beginning to change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As people try to make do with the resources that they have, I am lucky, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I 
<br/>have this job, I earn an income and if I want to eat cassava, I will eat cassava but that is not true for 
<br/>everyone else in the greater Suva region.   It is not true for everyone else. The price of everything has 
<br/>gone up. Everything! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Nothing where the price has gone down, everything has gone up, not 
<br/>just food items, wherever you pay VAT, that price has gone up and it is affecting everyone right 
<br/>across this country. To a large degree, people’s incomes have not moved up; so, when your income 
<br/>is not moving up and the things that you are paying, the price is going up. What happens? You are 
<br/>creating more and more hardship.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What this Government has done so far, so this country this past year, one thing it has achieved 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is giving more people hardship to the cost of living that is high. You have created hardships. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- The Deputy Prime Minister is smiling there, but he has not looked into 
<br/>people’s eyes, as I talked to them face to face, you can see the pain that they have in their eyes. Pain 
<br/>in  their  eyes  when  they  talk  about  this  thing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  They  wring  their  hands  like  I’m 
<br/>wringing my hands. What is going on? What is happening?  What is this Government doing? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hardship has been created in all of this, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA.- You created it during your time. That is why it is happening. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Miniter is going to 
<br/>say,  “hey,  that  inflation,  a  lot  of  it  is  imported.”      That  has  happened,  we  know  that  all  that  has 
<br/>happened because when the imported inflation comes in, it affects everything in your domestic. It 
<br/>affects the costs of fuel and affects everything else.  But here, the really bad thing is this.    This is 
<br/>the really bad thing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Oh come on! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very, very bad thing that happened.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.-What is that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – Were you being hit by this imported inflation then this Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>decided to increase VAT. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Yeah! 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- More and you are wrong. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When we were being hit by this imported inflation, let us put another 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nail in the coffin 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.-  Hogwash 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Then they increased VAT and then just exacerbated the whole thing. 
<br/>It made it worse right across the country. Everybody felt it, there is no part of this country where 
<br/>people did not feel that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What they basically did, they took our people, they waited for the bus, and they threw them 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>under the bus… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Very poor 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  … even while they were going through all that imported inflation. 
<br/>There are all kinds of things that happened then.  Have you have seen some funny things happened, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir? We have had even this thing happened in Fiji, it is shrinkflation.  That means, there 
<br/>used to be a bottle of milk cost like this, maybe it costs $5, they will say. “oh, the same bottle of milk 
<br/>is still at $5 but they reduced the amount of milk in the bottle; that is called shrinkflation.  That has 
<br/>been happening in some places and it has happened a lot in other countries and probably happening 
<br/>here too though.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier this week, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister was talking about 
<br/>the reduction in import excise of 10 percent. But the funny thing is this, with the reduction of that 
<br/>import excise on chicken portions, what happened to the prices of chicken portions in the shop, did 
<br/>it decline? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPPOSITION MEMBER.- No. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE. – No, it did not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So there is something going there.  Somebody is making money out 
<br/>of these policy changes. We run to the shop, we see it does not decline much. The point is, what is 
<br/>happening to all these things? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apology, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not only affecting the buyers. This week we went and visited 
<br/>some small shops in Suva. We visited one lady that sells handicrafts, and she says that the amount of 
<br/>sales that they have got from last year to this year has declined. When we interviewed her, she had 
<br/>not sold a single thing. It shows that people have less discretionary income to buy the things that they 
<br/></span><span>normally want to buy. Two other shops that we visited too they said the same thing, they did not have 
<br/></span><span>enough money and sales were down. People do not have enough money to buy the small things that 
<br/>they used to buy before and we hear this across the board for all the businesses in Suva where revenue 
<br/>is down.  Government has been saying that inflation is because of imports (fair enough)... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Is it shrinking? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Government needs to start asking what they can do.  We are thankful 
<br/>to Government for all the assistance to the social wages, all the things that it has done to help the 
<br/>people of Fiji, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister has already hinted one thing this week that 
<br/>maybe we could buy chicken from Indonesia rather than from New Zealand - we can explore those 
<br/>things.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We note also that FCCC has just announced it will undertake a market inquiry into the present 
<br/>practice of the supermarket industry from the 1</span><span>st</span><span> of next month. This is welcomed but I think this 
<br/>should have happened long time ago. As you have seen what had happened in the chicken portions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Obviously, when these things are happening, some people are playing funny business around 
<br/>the place.  Government needs to look at what it can do, so that it can help the people who are suffering.  
<br/>People are suffering under the high cost of living, suffering abysmally, they need some assistance, 
<br/>the Government needs to relieve the pressure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inflation was there, yes, but Government needs to do something to help the people of this 
<br/>country so that they can live with the high cost of living that they are facing right now. Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>statement.    I  am  afraid  honourable  Usamate  is  fast  earning  a  title  of  Mr.  Hogwash.    The  literal 
<br/>meaning of ‘hogwash’ is nonsense and a word designed to deceive the people.  Precisely, that is what 
<br/>the honourable Member was trying to do when he was talking about the cost of living.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of us appreciate the fact that there has been changes in the prices and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Usamate, being a statistician, understands this very well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make is that the Opposition actually fails to appreciate what the 
<br/>Coalition Government has been working very diligently to address some of the fundamental issues 
<br/>in the economy, starting from looking at how we can reform our revenue measures and aspart of that, 
<br/>we have instituted and implemented tax reforms.  They talk about VAT, they make a big deal about 
<br/>it, they go and actually lie to the people that everything has increased in terms of prices is simply 
<br/>because of VAT, and that is a complete lie. Let me just give for their purpose and for the people of 
<br/>this country the history of VAT.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, VAT was first introduced in 1992 under the SVT Government of 10 percent.  
<br/>It  was  raised  to  12.5  percent  in  2003  and  in  2011,  under  the  Bainimarama  Government,  it  was 
<br/>increased to 15 percent. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That was under Bainimarama Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then, Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we, in the Opposition, were raising the impact of VAT in 2016, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>it was high. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2016, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the same Government (FijiFirst Government) adopted 9 percent 
<br/>VAT with no zero rating on basic food items.  Then in 2021 and 2022, they changed it further to 
<br/>three rates - zero percent for 21 basic food items; 9 percent and 15 percent.  Obviously, that created 
<br/>quite  a  bit  of  distortion.    Government  was  actually  losing  revenue,  so  when  we  came  into 
<br/>Government, we reformed the system.  We kept the 21 items zero-rated, and on top of that, we added 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prescribed medicine.  So, if you go to a doctor, you get a prescription, you go to the pharmacy, you 
<br/>do not pay back.  We have now 22 items and we raised the VAT from 9 percent to 15 percent, and 
<br/>those that were 15 percent, we kept it there.  So, that is the history of VAT, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate agreed that there are other factors that cause the prices, 
<br/>for example, the Red Sea crisis right now, and he talked about imported inflation, that is always the 
<br/>case.  But, as a government, we recognised that even with zero percent VAT on 21 basic food items, 
<br/>post-COVID-19 and during COVID-19, when the freight costs went up by three times or four times 
<br/>up, that pushed the prices with zero percent VAT on basic food items.  So, even post-COVID-19, the 
<br/>freight cost remained high, so in some cases, even with zero percent VAT on basic food items, the 
<br/>prices still went up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, we, as a government, recognised that and one of the first things that we did when 
<br/>we came into Government, in the first month, we recognised that people needed support, we allocated 
<br/>$50 million, we paid $200 each to more than 200,000 students right from pre-school to Year 12.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We repeated that, again, this year, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Again, we put in $43 million and, again, 
<br/>we  have  more  than  212,000  students.    We  also  allocated  $7.5  million  to  continue  the  10  percent 
<br/>reduction in bus fares for additional six months, and we made sure that we forgive $650 million – 
<br/>the burden on 53,000 families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Graduates coming out of the university, having to start paying 
<br/>all that income, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is now in the pockets of those families and households.  We also 
<br/>made sure in the Budget that we did not touch the income tax threshold, so all those people earning 
<br/>below $30,000 are not paying any income tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do not want to hear the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>truth because this is what they do.  They go out there and lie to the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus on interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also reduced duties 
<br/>on a number of items.  This is the report I received from Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission 
<br/>(FCCC) - a brief, and contrary to what honourable Usamate said when he made the generalisation, 
<br/>he said that the prices of all things have gone up.  All things!  That was what he said and that was 
<br/>also what the report said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me redo the list of items on which the prices have actually gone down, Mr. Speaker.  I 
<br/>will give them this report so that they can take it and show it to the people and stop lying.  Let me 
<br/></span><span>read the list - edible oil, butter, liquid milk, powdered milk, baby milk, canned fish, corned meat, 
<br/></span><span>salt, margarine, tea leaves, under the produce, the prices of potatoes, onions, and garlic have gone  
<br/>down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Additionally, Mr. Speaker, from the Budget, whatever 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>
<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 601 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>additional  revenue  we  got,  we  increased  monthly  pension  for  all  Government  pensioners  by  15 
<br/>percent,  monthly allowance increased from $100 to $115 for people above 65 years and increased 
<br/>those from $100 to  $125 for people over 70 years. We increased the Family Assistance Scheme. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  increased  the  monthly  Children  Protection  Allowance,  allowance  for  Persons  with 
<br/>Disability  was  increased  from  $90  to  $104  per  month,  Bus  Fare  Allowance  for  the  elderly  and 
<br/>disabled  has  been  allocated  $25  per  month,  free  health  schemes  provided  to  patients  by  private 
<br/>general practitioners with a combined household income of $30,000 or less, continuation of the EFL 
<br/>and water subsidy.  So, these are things, Mr. Speaker, that the Government has done to mitigate, not 
<br/>impact… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C.PRASAD.- Not only that but also the impact of the imported inflation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Usamate…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Honourable Kumar is always very irritating, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PRO.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Honourable  Usamate  is  a  bit  of  an  economist,    he  needs  to 
<br/>understand this because you cannot hold the prices, even if you had zero VAT or no VAT at all, still 
<br/>you will find that the prices will increase because there are other factors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  important  thing  for  us  as  a  Parliament  and  as  a  government,  including  those  in  the 
<br/>Opposition, is that we have to understand that we have to find ways to increase the income, put more 
<br/>money into the pockets of the people.  Some of the measures we have done, are actually doing that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have said this in Parliament before, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that as a result of shortage of labour, 
<br/>formal sector employment has not only increased but the wages in the formal sector has also increased 
<br/>by about 10 percent to 12 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there are some natural corrective measures, and he talked about vegetables. He was trying 
<br/>to  give  the  story  about  vegetable  prices.    Mr.  Speaker,  vegetable  prices  is  based  on  supply  and 
<br/>demand.  If it has been raining for one-and-a-half   months and there is flooding, and you go to the 
<br/>market, you are going to get cassava this much and costing you more.  What is the economics there? 
<br/>Oh, that is simple supply and demand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the people of this country, yes, we understand that some 
<br/>prices have gone up, we that some people might be struggling, but as I have indicated, the Budget 
<br/>has a very clear plan in terms of helping our people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the next Budget, we have already announced that minimum wages is being reviewed and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>during the next Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will announce that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-    So,  I  want  assure  the  people  of  this  country  that  the 
<br/>Government is fully aware of that and the measures that we have to put in will help the people.  Thank

<div><span>Fiji’s Air Services Agreement  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of  Parliament  and  members  of  the  public  sitting  in  the  gallery  and  all  those  tuning  in  live  on 
<br/>Parliament </span><span>Facebook</span><span> channel;  I am pleased to present an End of Week Statement that gives insight 
<br/>into the rights that governs airlines of each country to fly into another country’s air space and land at 
<br/>their airports.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The freedom to fly from one sovereign State to another is not a right but rather an outcome 
<br/>of interstate negotiations, the outcomes of which are embedded in bilateral Air Services Agreements 
<br/>(ASAs).    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  ASAs  permit  international  air  transport  services  between  two  parties 
<br/>involved in a negotiation process and specify a wide terms and conditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the life of aviation is an admiration for whoever looks up to the clouds, stars 
<br/>and  sky.    Civil  Aviation  is  a  transnational  global  enterprise  that  supports  the  world  economy  by 
<br/>facilitating efficient cross-border air transportation. Air transport supports integration into the global 
<br/>economy and provides critical connectivity on national, regional and international levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of air transport stems from its ability to create and support 
<br/>jobs, enhance trade and connectivity between people and countries, promote tourism and connect 
<br/>remote communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  bilateral  Air  Transport  Agreement,  also  known  as  Air  Services 
<br/>Agreement, between two sovereignties, comprise various clauses and rules that govern the terms and 
<br/>conditions of international air travel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, due to the importance of this Agreements and the unique characteristics of 
<br/>individual  countries,  the  content  of  an  ASA  may  vary,  depending  on  a  number  of  factors,  most 
<br/>notably the preferences of parties and their territories. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nonetheless, there are certain basic components seen in most ASAs.  These features include 
<br/>the  route  designation,  tariffs  and  pricing,  capacity  and  frequency,  safety  and  security  standards, 
<br/>customs and immigration regulations and environmental and regulatory compliance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are three types of ASAs - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Traditional ASAs which specify the number of carriers, which country, the aircraft types, 
<br/>the number of flights and the destination that each country airline can serve. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Liberal ASAs which allows for greater flexibility and less government control over the 
<br/>number of carriers for each country, as well as the aircraft type and frequency of flights and 
<br/>destinations.    Liberal  ASAs  allow  for  market-based  pricing  but  they  also  allow  for 
<br/></span><span>government intervention. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Open Skies ASAs which do not limit the number of services, capacity and route an airline 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>can operate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, airlines in each country can determine their own prices based 
<br/>on market conditions.   Fiji currently has a total of 29 bilateral ASAs that have been negotiated over 
<br/>the years.  A few of these ASAs dates back to colonial times.  These ASAs are traditional and have

<div><span>limitation on capacity, frequency and the routes to be operated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  fundamental  consideration  before  engaging  into  discussions  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>potential destination is it will bring significant benefits to the Fijian economy and the tourism sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ASAs allow airlines that are parties to the Agreement to operate commercial 
<br/>air services under the terms of Agreement. Presently, nine international airlines provide commercial 
<br/>air services to Fiji, as a result of this ASAs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our national airline - Fiji Airways, directly operates to 24 destinations both, 
<br/>regional and international, and have recorded six consecutive years of successive growth in passenger 
<br/>numbers from 5 percent to 20 percent for the period 2018 to 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  most  of  the  existing  ASAs  are  considered  outdated  and  restrictive  with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>specific limitations.  This is the case with our existing ASAs in the Pacific Island region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is committed to support Fiji’s growth as a heart in the South 
<br/>Pacific through the restructuring of these ASAs whilst at the same time, safeguarding our national 
<br/>airline and the Fijian economy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  negotiations  are  currently  ongoing  with  likeminded  countries  about 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reviewing ASAs, as well as expansion of existing bilateral ASAs to cover code-share services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  airlines  are  continually  finetuning  their  routes  to  accommodate  traffic 
<br/>growth, changes in aircraft technology and other factors.  Consideration is extended to the economic 
<br/>viability of our national airline.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Marketing  arrangements  through  code-sharing  is  being  aimed  to  extend  the  scope  of  Fiji 
<br/>Airways’ route networks, eliminating double marginalisation, to establish our presence in foreign 
<br/>markets where they would otherwise not be allowed to operate due to regulatory reasons. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government in this regard has been able to establish a Memorandum of 
<br/>Understanding  (MOU) on co-operative marketing arrangements with  the government  of Korea in 
<br/>2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Government of New Caledonia and Fiji have entered into a new 
<br/>Code  Sharing  Agreement  that  has  enabled  code  share  relationship  between  Fiji  Airways  and  Air 
<br/>Caledonie.  As I speak, Sir, similar arrangements are being pursued with other countries as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, market access privileges which is commonly referred to as ‘traffic lights’ under 
<br/>the ASA have historically been subject to a number of protectionist conditions, including </span><span>inter alia</span><span>
<br/>or ‘caps’ on the number of flights flown over a given period of time, pre-determined limits on the 
<br/>number of passengers or cargo carried and the rates of return regulations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the commercial aviation industry is cyclical, such that revenues are generally 
<br/></span><span>high in the period of economic prosperity and expansion and are lower in the period of economic 
<br/></span><span>downturn and contraction.  There is a need to rationalise capacity and explore new markets in order 
<br/>to grow and generate revenue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  greater  commercial  freedom  allows  airlines  to  improve  productivity  and 
<br/>efficiency.  The  Fiji  Government  is  supportive  of  liberalisation  of  air  services  that  will  create  the 
<br/>freedom for airlines to operate on a fully commercial basis, allowing them to allocate capital more 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>19</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>efficiently, to respond better to changes in demand and markets and to improve productivity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, an Open Skies approach is now being implemented, allowing for the negotiation 
<br/>of Open Skies ASA on a case by case basis.  In advocating the review and potential modernisation 
<br/>of our existing ASAs, Government, at this time, is negotiating an Open Skies ASA with United States 
<br/>of America to boost passenger numbers and revenue for our national airline. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  initiative  aims  to  attract  40,000  additional  passengers  in  the  first  year, 
<br/>leading  to  projected annual  increases for up to  75,000. This  growth  is  expected to  generate $150 
<br/>million to $170 million per year in revenue, along with an extra  $20 million to $30 million from 
<br/>cargo and ancillary services, benefiting Fiji’s foreign current reserves.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, entering into an Open Skies ASA with the United States, will also allow code 
<br/>sharing between airlines of both countries.  Fiji Airways is a member of One World Alliance, which 
<br/>also  includes  American  Airlines.  Therefore,  Fiji  Airways  plans  to  include  the  Dallas-Fort  Worth 
<br/>Taxes as a new service destination.  It is home to the second largest airline hub globally and serves 
<br/>as the base for American Airlines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Members of Parliament and fellow citizens, the role of ASAs in 
<br/>Civil Aviation in Fiji cannot be over emphasised. These Agreements are instrumental in the efficient 
<br/>regulation  of  international  air  transport,  promoting  growth  in  the  aviation  industry  and  ensuring 
<br/>connectivity between Fiji and other nations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, please, allow me, on behalf of the honourable Prime Minister and the People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government, to convey our best wishes to both our men’s and women’s Fijian Drua Team 
<br/>the very best in their respective matches this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge the support of the Australian Government, its 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>people and sports organisations and sports development in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, just before I take my seat, I would also like to wish all the schools that will be 
<br/>participating in the Fiji’s Secondary Schools Rugby League semi-finals this Saturday. I would like 
<br/>to send good wishes to the Under 15 and 17 of Queen Victoria School Knights and the Under 19 Ra 
<br/>High School Roosters, that defeated the defending champion last Saturday to claim a spot in the semi-
<br/>final this week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, lastly, may I also wish all our athletes who are also preparing for  the upcoming 
<br/>Coca-Cola Games, the very best in their preparation. I wish the athletes from QVS and ACS also the 
<br/>very best in the upcoming games.  </span><span>Kui tale mada o Waimanu!</span><span> </span><span>Vinaka.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. CHAIRMAN.-  I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism and Civil Aviation for his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  commend  the  honourable  Assistant 
<br/>Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil  Aviation  on  her  comprehensive  statement  regarding  Air  Services 
<br/></span><span>Agreement (ASA).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we navigate the skies of progress, allow me to augment this discourse with figures and 
<br/>percentages that underscore the significance of this Agreement.  Air transport is not just about planes 
<br/>and  runaways,  it  is  about  livelihoods.  Our  aviation  industry  contributes  significantly  to  Fiji’s 
<br/>economy.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> 605 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  quantify  these  impacts,  the  passenger  numbers,  Mr.  Speaker,  Fiji  Airways  since 
<br/>consecutive  years  of  passenger  growth  has  grown  from  5  percent  to  20  percent,  which  reflects  a 
<br/>robust demand for Fiji and for our national airline. We may know that our national airlines is now a 
<br/>billion-dollar company, so it is growing quite significantly.  The Open Skies Agreement with USA 
<br/>aims to attract 40,000 passengers in the past year, leading to projected annual increases up to 75.  
<br/>There is this belief that we have tried to correct from the other side, that they are the only ones who 
<br/>care about Fiji Airways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Everyone in this country have been supportive of Air Pacific and its 
<br/>growth over the years.  We were weak, we intervened at a critical juncture in the life of Fiji Airways.  
<br/>Just cool down and please realise that it is our national airline, that we all love our national airline 
<br/>and we want it to perform to the best and under this Coalition Government, the years ahead are going 
<br/>to be very promising. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As indicated by my Assistant Minister, the American service will generate $150 million to 
<br/>$170 million from passengers and then cargo and as indicated, we are in the process of negotiating 
<br/>with the Americans.  The agreement as it stands today allows Fiji to fly to Honolulu, Los Angeles 
<br/>(LA) and San Francisco whereas the Americans have unlimited, there is no restrictions for them in 
<br/>this part of the world, even on a freedom basis, you can fly to Australia and New Zealand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ASA that we are negotiating with them will allow us to fly with any points in America.  
<br/>Cabinet recently revamped our ASA policies to enable us to go on open skies on a case by case basis 
<br/>with countries and the Americans, welcomed that, hence the confidence that we can fly into other 
<br/>points other than Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  current  routes  now,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  Australia,  New  Zealand,  USA  (as 
<br/>stated),  Singapore,  Hong  Kong,  Narita  and  various  Pacific  Islands.    In  the  eyes  of  the  global 
<br/>community, when they look at the Pacific Islands, Fiji is pivotal, and Fiji Airways plays a very big 
<br/>part in that.  We are also in the process of talking to the Chinese, they are also interested in coming 
<br/>to Fiji and we are also looking at ways we can facilitate that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On code sharing and global reach with Fiji Airways and Air Calédonie, a new code sharing 
<br/>agreement enables seamless travel between our nations, fostering connectivity and tourism.  We are 
<br/>looking at improving connectivity within the South Pacific - New Caledonia, Fiji, Apia, Cook Islands 
<br/>up to Papeete, and we want to bring in that connectivity that connects the island countries.  A lot of 
<br/>dialogue is going into this and driven also by our neighbours.  They want the connectivity, knowing 
<br/>the strength of Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Dallas  Fort  Worth,  Mr.  Speaker, Sir,  it  is  the home to  American  Airlines.   They have 
<br/>1,000  flights  a  day  into  Dallas.    With  American  Airlines,  they  have  a  frequent  flyer  programme 
<br/>numbering 154 million members.  Immediately we fly to Dallas with American Airlines, 154 million 
<br/>people will know about Fiji.  It will become part of the network, you cannot pay for that in dollars 
<br/>with that kind of numbers, committed frequent flyers while the people in the loyalty programmes for 
<br/></span><span>American Airlines and by extension, Fiji Airways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  had  historical  constraints,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  but  we  are  addressing  that  through 
<br/>bilateral on a case by case basis, opening up the skies.  We must explore new markets, adapt to the 
<br/>economic cycles and optimise routes to maximise revenue.

<div><span>I am asked questions about Korea. We have an agreement now with the Korean Government 
<br/>where we can talk to Korean Operators and co-share also. People keep asking me about Korean Air, 
<br/>there are other operators in Korea, Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years we  will continue to have this 
<br/>dialogue and get a better link to Korea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  passenger  surge,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  Nadi  now,  we  know  that  from  the  airline 
<br/>perspective it is exceeding two million passengers now, where they counts inwards and outwards.  
<br/>Nadi itself is getting busier by the day, indeed they are plans to expand the facilities in Nadi to enable 
<br/>us to cater to more flights.  Currently, if five or seven big jets leave at the same time in Nadi, you can 
<br/>feel the strength on what we currently have.  So that is all part of the aviation going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms  of ASAs, let us recognise that these agreements are not merely 
<br/>guarantees,  they  are  the  conduits  of  progress.  We  have  to  embrace  liberalisation,  rationalising 
<br/>capacity and fostering global partnerships to elevate Fiji’s aviation aspirations. Our skies show old 
<br/>promise, our national airline soars as a beacon of connectivity and something that we a proud of and 
<br/>will continue to support going forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Challenge of Drugs and Substance Abuse 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this use of drugs used and abuse amongst our 
<br/>children continue to be a challenge in our country today and that problem is multifaceted in nature 
<br/>and to address it will require the involvement of our children, parents, communities, government, 
<br/>civil society, religious organisations and partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the </span><span>2023 Denarau Declaration,</span><span> the health and safety theme targets the 
<br/>measures to be taken to ensure the protection of our students from harm caused by drugs and other 
<br/>illicit substance.  This includes proper legislation, education and psychosocial support services.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Substances Abuse Advisory Council regulates combats and school drugs surveys on an 
<br/>annual basis.  In 2022, there were 2,700 cases which represents 1.35 percent of the registered student. 
<br/>In 2023, there were 3,500 cases which represented 1.75 percent of the students. The percentage of 
<br/>student reported to be using drugs is less than 2 percent even though the percentage is small, a gradual 
<br/>increase in three years is a concern and will need the full attention of all stakeholders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot address the issue of drugs used and abused unless we answer the 
<br/>“why question”.  Why do the user use drugs?  Secondly, there is a need to understand the relationship 
<br/>between the user and the drug of their choice.  In my address this afternoon, Sir, I will provide some 
<br/>insights into the drug’s use and the drug abuse that was sourced in our nation and our young people 
<br/>and the children have become victims and in some cases peddlers and mules.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the years the Substances Abuse and Advisory Council has gathered 
<br/>evidence  and  with  the  referral  reports  from  school,  we  have  begun  to  now  clearly  identify  and 
<br/>understand the drug problem in our society today.  Some use drugs due to peer pressure.  Sadly, some 
<br/>observe drugs being used in their families, communities and out of curiosity decided to experiment.  
<br/>Another sad reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the fact that students use drugs as a coping technique to mask 
<br/></span><span>the emotional pains they endure in their lives, such as abuse, neglect and exploitation.  The other 
<br/></span><span>level is students being exploited by adults to peddle drugs for petty cash. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the use of drugs by students contribute to many of the social ills, school 
<br/>dropout,  mental  health  issues,  economical  disempowerment,  rise  in  our  petty  crimes,  increase  in 
<br/>unplanned  and  unwanted  pregnancies,  and  general  decays  in  the  morale  and  social  fabric  of  our 
<br/>society today.  To address the issue effectively, we must address it as a national security crisis, a 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>public health crisis, a social crisis, an economic crisis, a community crisis and individual crisis that 
<br/>transcends religious, cultures, geographical, age, status and educational identity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this regard, our Ministry is working closely with the Ministry of Home 
<br/>Affairs, in the development of our National Narcotic Strategy.  The strategy outlines the role of each 
<br/>Ministry and stakeholders will play in questioning the problem of drugs in our society.  The Ministry 
<br/>has also been working with sects to draft the Volatile Substance Abuse Act 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Drugs Regulation is currently in the workflow circulation, and we investigate, and once 
<br/>adopted will provide more power to our teams and stakeholders to uphold the retails and the peddlers 
<br/>of  getaway  drugs  and  inhalants  responsibility  by  our  current  society  today.    The  possibility  of 
<br/>penalties and the threat our prosecution will act as an additional deterrent to those peddling and using 
<br/>inhalants to get high in society that we are in, and at present we can actually see the impact in our 
<br/>country today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education is responsible for the demand and the high reduction components.  
<br/>The  demand  components  involve  legislation,  curriculum,  training  and  awareness  programme, 
<br/>targeting our students today, the youths and the community members on changing their mindsets and 
<br/>attitude.    The  harm  reduction  on  the  other  hand  involves  the  provision  of  psychological  support 
<br/>through  counselling,  mentoring  service  to  students  and  likewise  our  parents  who  are  here  in  our 
<br/>beloved nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry  of  Education  gets  in  place  the  legislations  and  policies  to  guide  teachers  in 
<br/>schools, and procedures they will follow to help and discipline students who are involved in any drug 
<br/>related  issue.    These  policies  are  reviewed  every  three  years  to  be  relevant  to  the  new  changes 
<br/>experienced.  However, the topic on the drugs and other illicit substance are included in our school 
<br/>curriculum in the subject of Healthy Living at Primary School and through Family Life Educational 
<br/>at Secondary School.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the training programme is  conducted every year to  teachers  and student 
<br/>leaders on how to address problems of drug use by various students in our schools.  Some schools 
<br/>have increased their level of monitoring and supervision by installing close circuit television cameras 
<br/>within  the  school  premises  and  working  closely  with  parents  and  community  leaders  during 
<br/>community outreach programmes seeking their support in their children’s education.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Substance  Abuse  Advisory  Council  (SAAC)  has  conducted  training  to  prefects  and 
<br/>teachers in schools on the dangers of drugs and other substances.  The content includes the policies, 
<br/>signs of drug use, effect of prolonged drug use, health coping skills, good mental health, leadership 
<br/>and life skills.  Those that attend the training would conduct training and awareness in their respective 
<br/>schools.  Sir, SAAC has a total of 1,053 students, prefects and 384 teachers from 2023 to 2024. The 
<br/>SAAC conducts training to teachers, faith-based community, leaders on the topics of drugs abuse 
<br/>and strategies on how to assist the students in their respective communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They conducted schools and community-based training, empower individual to contextualise 
<br/>the solution to fit the local government, resource structure that is family, the  </span><span>vanua</span><span> and the faith-
<br/></span><span>based system.  In addition to the awareness carried out in schools, communities during this Annual 
<br/></span><span>International Day Against Drugs Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking on 26th of June every year.  The 
<br/>school take parts in the drugs prevention and awareness programme performing various activities 
<br/>including oratory, artwork, debate and essay writing based on the theme.  The school also invites 
<br/>special guest speakers to address the students on the danger of drugs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry also conducted community awareness during school organised community

<br/>SAAC  has  also  participated  in  faith-based  rallies  where  our  groups  conduct  awareness  during 
<br/>evangelism and during church service on Sunday. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  through  SAAC  has  also  developed  and  printed  into  fabric 
<br/>materials  all platforms including school  media have been used to  campaign on the importance of 
<br/>substance abuse drugs as a chronic health education and social implication and notedly on the child 
<br/>but the family. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are thankfully in partnership with the government of Australia under the 
<br/>Vuvale Partnership.  The Education Ministry might have to setup four counselling hubs as students 
<br/>support hubs in the government schools in the four educational divisions, the provision of counsellors 
<br/>in schools is needed as drugs and addiction is treated as mental health problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To  conclude  with  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  invite  the  members  of  this  august  Parliament  to  be 
<br/>proactive and join the Education Ministry.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us be heroes and not zeros, say no 
<br/>to drugs, do not even try it and help to save our children here in our beloved nation, Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to reiterate that my Ministry is committed 
<br/>to the fight against this drug scourge.   We are dedicated and committed to holistic education of each 
<br/>student, and this includes their health and well-being.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our other strategic partners are the Pacific Conference of Churches (PCC), 
<br/>NGOs such as Drug Free Fiji, Empower Pacific, Medical Services Pacific and International Non-
<br/>Government  Organisation  (INGO).    In  our  most  recent  dialogue  with  Drug  Free  Association  and 
<br/>PCC, we are pleased to confirm that a taskforce will be setup to develop a framework that will target 
<br/>youths in an age-appropriate manner.  We know that one size does not fit all but the need for targeted 
<br/>interventions for specific population and age including targeting specific groups in the community 
<br/>will be key to systematically addressing this issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have also begun dialogue with the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, the Bose 
<br/>Levu Vakaturaga and the Ministry of Rural Development to partner with us to eradicate this scourge 
<br/>from within our homes and villages.  This approach is in response to our recognition that the drugs 
<br/>have infiltrated our villages and rural settings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I invited the Council of Churches for dialogue on this and in the 
<br/>dialogue His Grace the Archbishop together with the Council of Churches will be working closely 
<br/>with the Ministry of Education to find ways to eradicate drug usage from within our youth population 
<br/>in Fiji. We are quite encouraged with the way His Grace set up presented the structure within the 
<br/>Catholic Church on how they segmentize youth and how to approach those issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would be asking other churches to visit us and do likewise because what I shared with them 
<br/>yesterday, Mr. Speaker, is that we now know that it is coming into the villages, but our people appear 
<br/>to think that it is someone else’s problem, and it will just go away. It is like burying our heads in the 
<br/>sand, Mr. Speaker.  So, that is why I am asking the church to play a big role in this and let people 
<br/></span><span>know at the </span><span>vanua</span><span> level that they cannot divorce themselves from the initiatives or from whatever 
<br/></span><span>we need to do to eradicate drug usage in our villages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am sure we all know that they know in communities who is dealing in drugs, who is using 
<br/>drugs, but they seem to be waiting for someone else to do something about it.  I am encouraging the 
<br/>churches through the pulpit fire and brimstone, get the message across that we cannot just sit back 
<br/>and let this thing happen. You have to take ownership of it.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>His  Grace  was  talking  about  some  of  the  retreats  that  the  youth  in  the  Catholic  Church 
<br/>normally go to. He said that at the end of the weekend all the youth come back really motivated, fully 
<br/>committed to whatever the retreat was trying to impart to them, but he said that as soon as they come 
<br/>home, it is a different story.  So, it is going to be the youth and the parents also hence my request to 
<br/>the church to really take this on from the pulpit and get people to realise that it will not go away. We 
<br/>have to take ownership of it, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That said, the Ministry of Education has in place legislation and policies to guide teachers in 
<br/>schools on the procedures they will follow to help and discipline students who are involved in any 
<br/>drug related issue. These policies are reviewed every three years to be relevant to the new changes 
<br/>experienced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I once again invite the Members of Parliament to be proactive and join us 
<br/>fight  the  drug  problem  very  slowly  plaguing  our  beloved  Fiji.  I  reaffirm  the  statement  by  the 
<br/>honourable Assistant Minister for Education, “let us be heroes and not zeros.  Say no to drugs and 
<br/>help to save our children and our Fiji.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that brings us to the End of the Week Statements. I 
<br/>like that suggestion that the Churches be involved. Perhaps, if you could take it further, honourable 
<br/>Deputy  Prime Minister  and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil  Aviation, the financing  of 
<br/>these Churches to take care of those surveillance because from our National Budget, the Churches 
<br/>need to be helped as well.  They have the network there, but it is just the funding of this, extra hands 
<br/>to be brought in on board for them to fully undertake what is required of them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have had some very bad experience in my village, the young gentleman murdered his wife.  
<br/>He had three children, two are attending QVS and there is another one who is still in the village, but 
<br/>they are left without a mum now, and their mum happens to come from my clan, so it is a nasty 
<br/>experience.  I think we need to all pitch in and help the Government, Churches and our communities 
<br/>to try and tackle this scourge.    It is quite a challenge, but it is out there for us.  It is amazing, even 
<br/>in my village, there is this drug - ice.  It is freely exchanged there but my village is some distance 
<br/>away from Suva.  Anyway, we shall move on and hopefully we can get some mind sets there to thrash 
<br/>this out once more. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  have  been  advised  that  there  are  no  Bills  for  consideration  today.  
<br/>Honourable Premila is always very, very watchful of this particular item.  If there is no Bill, then 
<br/>slowly she reacts.  I think you just bear with us and hold on for a while.  Five are coming as advised 
<br/>by Attorney-General.
