<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, please, take note 
<br/>that I have allowed Question No. 13/2024 to be asked later on as the honourable Minister for Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection has to attend an official event at this point in time.  When she enters, 
<br/>we will allow that question to be asked of her.

<div><span>Development of Yawe to Lomati Road – Status &amp; Plan 
<br/>(Question No. 11/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>inform Parliament of the status and plan to complete the road that was initially developed to 
<br/>connect the southern end of Kadavu from Yawe to Lomati and to Daviqele? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  question 
<br/>raised by the honourable Member regarding the road connection from Yawe, Lomati and Daviqele 
<br/>on the southern end of Kadavu.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This road project through the Fiji Roads Authority actually started in 2017 which involved 
<br/>the construction of a new 4.7 kilometre road along the Yawe District from Nakorovou to Naqalotu. 
<br/>This was completed in 2021 despite the effects of COVID-19 disruptions which had impacted on the 
<br/>logistics and schedules including movement of contractors, labour and material supply. The contract 
<br/>was awarded to Prem Civil Engineering Limited to upgrade the existing 9.7 kilometres road from 
<br/>Vunisea to Nabukelevu-i- Ra and the further construction of a new 4.7 kilometre road along the Yawe 
<br/>District for a total value of $5.3 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government through the FRA is planning to progress with this new road development in 
<br/>the  next  phase  from  Naqalotu  to  Lomati  which  is  approximately  eight  kilometres  in  length.  
<br/>Following this phase will be the road connecting from Lomati on the east coast to Daviqele on the 
<br/>south coast with additional 3.5 kilometres. These proposed rural developments are part of the current 
<br/>FRA Plan Scope which will involve investigation and detailed design of the new road alignment, the 
<br/>necessary details of works will include topographical survey and environmental and social safeguards 
<br/>including community consultations, geo-technical investigation and necessary costing of the whole 
<br/>construction  works.  These  planned  requisite  activities  are  envisaged  to  commence  in  the  next 
<br/></span><span>financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Do you have a supplementary question, honourable Leader 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Opposition? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the question to the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is, have you been to this place? You will need to understand the problems and the difficulties that 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these people face. Kadavu is well-known for drug cultivation, Madam Deputy Speaker.  We have 
<br/>issues on access, particularly the </span><span>vanua</span><span> because </span><span>Tikina</span><span> Nabukelevu is divided because of the villages 
<br/>that are on the other side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  project  was  between  rural  development,  they  were  undertaking  the  road  from  the 
<br/>Daviqele side (from Nabale).  They were already pursuing that.  Forestry was already doing some 
<br/>logging in the area, they were doing some work in that as well.   So, it is bringing the stakeholders 
<br/>together and sharing the cost because rural roads is about access, not so much about standards.  Have 
<br/>you been there, honourable Minister, and hopefully you can have a better understanding of this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  I  note  the  request  from  the  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- So, have you been there, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- No, but we are planning to visit; it is part of the plan.

<div><span>MOU - Australia and Port Infrastructure Services  
<br/>(Question No. 12/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament on the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Australia and 
<br/>Port Infrastructure Services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  most  Members  would  be  aware  that  the 
<br/>proposed  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  on  the  Port  Infrastructure  and  Services  comes 
<br/>under the umbrella of the elevated Vuvale Partnership which was a great initiative continued by the 
<br/>FijiFirst Government and we have decided to continue with that.  We signed the elevated part of it in 
<br/>October  last  year.    It  was  signed  between  the  Prime  Minister  of  Australia,  honourable  Anthony 
<br/>Albanese and I.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You may also recall, Madam Deputy Speaker that the </span><span>Vuvale</span><span> Partnership articulates our joint 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development priorities.  The priorities are encapsulated under five pillars and they include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening our people-to-people links; 
<br/>Enhancing our security cooperation; 
<br/>Deepening our economic relationship; 
<br/>Regional international cooperation; and 
<br/>Fostering closer institutional linkages in support of strong inclusive societies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  December  of  last  year,  our  joint  teams  (the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  Ministry  of 
<br/>Foreign Affairs and the Australian High Commission) agreed on a range of development priorities 
<br/>to  be  considered  under  the  umbrella  of  the  </span><span>Vuvale</span><span>  Partnership  which  includes  support  in  the 
<br/>development of our port facilities and service sector.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The development and management of key infrastructure, in particular Fiji ports, is of utmost 
<br/></span><span>importance  in  light  of  the  broader  implications  on  connectivity,  security  and  prosperity  and  is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="15">Page 15</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>385 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>therefore considered central to Fiji’s sovereignty.  The MOU also implements the People’s Coalition 
<br/>Government’s  commitment  to  revive  the  shipbuilding  industry  which  also  includes  include 
<br/>shipwreck and maintenance.  That is to support my vision for Fiji to become the hub of the Pacific 
<br/>as the major port of entry, transhipment port and provide services to the Pacific fishing fleets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the ongoing geo-political competitions, the upgrading of our ports is in line with 
<br/>the Zone of Peace concept that we had proposed as a vision for the region.  Earlier this year in March, 
<br/>Cabinet agreed to the proposed MOU on port infrastructure services which was to have been signed 
<br/>on 16th March, 2024 in Lautoka but because of the flooding we were experiencing here in Fiji, at the 
<br/>last moment, the Australian Team decided to give us time to recover and later on come.   They were 
<br/>supposed to have come this week but as I have mentioned this morning, the mother of the Minister 
<br/>for Foreign Affairs, Honourable Penny Wong, died yesterday so she could not come for that reason. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the MOU outlines the framework for the preparation of proposed 
<br/>life investments into Fiji’s Port infrastructure and services as managed by the Fiji Ports Corporation 
<br/>Limited (FPCL).  The FPCL manages the Ports of Suva, Lautoka, Levuka, Vuda, Malau, Rotuma 
<br/>and Wairiki.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The MOU falls under the Australian Infrastructure Funding Facility (AIFF). The development 
<br/>of Fiji Ports will provide the necessary impetus to strengthen the local shipbuilding industry.  Due 
<br/>consideration  will  also  be  given  to  skills  development,  with  the  aim  to  see  benefits  to  the  local 
<br/>industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  meantime,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  preparatory  work  on  the  feasibility  study 
<br/>continues.  We are grateful to Australia for its understanding and support and especially, for standing 
<br/>with Fiji in this important infrastructural work.  Last month, I was in Perth to receive the Guardian 
<br/>Class Patrol Boat, </span><span>RFNS Puamau</span><span>, donated by the Australian Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further  and  as  for  grant  financing,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Australia  is  Fiji’s  largest 
<br/>development partner, having provided more than AU$95 million or US$62 million in ODA in the 
<br/>2022 to 2023 period.  During the period 2019 to 2021, Australia provided US$306 million to Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  the  maritime  State,  it  is  critical  that  ports  and  related  services  are  developed  to 
<br/>international standards and maintained at that level.  We look forward to cooperating with Australia 
<br/>in the development priority, as articulated in our </span><span>Vuvale </span><span>Partnership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA- I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his answer.  Honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, as you had rightfully spelt out, we are a hub in the Pacific, and it is a massive opportunity 
<br/>for us. But one of the most critical components with this transhipment hub, et cetera, and Australia 
<br/>has been a party to all of these, is biosecurity.  My supplementary question is, has biosecurity formed 
<br/>a big component with respect to the development of our infrastructure because the problematic part 
<br/>with  respect  to  being  a  transhipment  hub,  et  cetera,  has  always  been  biosecurity?    I  am  sure  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Trade would agree with me that it needs to, and seeing that Australia is such 
<br/>a huge trading partner with us and because we are transhipment hub, is biosecurity a component in 
<br/>this particular agreement, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  it  is  a  very  important  part  of  the  whole 
<br/>development.  Two weeks ago, we had a Biosecurity Workshop in Nadi where this was brought up 
<br/>and discussed very, very seriously by the participants.  It was an international participation workshop.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are very, very mindful, not only of our concern but also the region, particularly in ensuring 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that what we get from overseas ports allow for our own participation in the inspections at those ports 
<br/>of departure.  Also, we will allow officers from those designation ports to be in Fiji to make sure that 
<br/>those that tranship through Fiji to their country as destination will also participate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  have  a  simple  question  to  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister.  It is good that he is mentioning about the shipbuilding industry in Fiji 
<br/>and hope that this can be expedited because under the SVT Government, the ship building industry 
<br/>lost its stature in Fiji.  So, the simple question is, when will this be reinstated?  It is important for us 
<br/>as a maritime nation, the fishing industry has a lot of potential in terms of the services and even the 
<br/>Naval boats.  We have been in discussion with Australia if this can be serviced here in Fiji rather 
<br/>than the half-life refit and others to be taken to Australia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>will be surprised at how quickly we are going to bring this.  Last week, we had two of our Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries  looking  at  the  Bataan  Ship  building  Port  and  they  came  back  with  recommendations 
<br/>which will very soon be discussed in Cabinet.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last big ship that we built was the 73 metre vessel,  </span><span>MV Reef Endeavour</span><span>, and it was a 
<br/>really good vessel.  We would like to use those who had participated in the building of that, while 
<br/>they are still alive and are still capable, and quite a few of them are still there and are capable.  They 
<br/>would be among the first to be recruited, as well as those who will be coming through the technical 
<br/>training - thanks to our Ministry of Education and the FNU, et cetera.  Yes, I am sure before the end 
<br/>of this year, we will be discussing the implementation of the ship building industry.

<div><span>Update on the Relocation of Nabavatu Village 
<br/>(Question No. 14/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Management update Parliament on the progress of the relocation of Nabavatu Village? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, I thank the honourable Member for this question.  Before I provide an update 
<br/>on the Nabavatu Village Relocation Project, let me give you some background.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Nabavatu  Village  was  critically  affected  by  a  geohazard  event  that  shocked  the 
<br/>community in January 2021, following </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>.  As we all know, </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, although was a Category 
<br/>2 Cyclone, it happened in less than a month after Category 5 </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> that also hit Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the geohazard event in Nabavatu involved a series of land slumps, 
<br/>landslides,  tensional  cracks  and  associated  ground  displacements,  which  were  experienced  in  the 
<br/>village.  The tensional cracks identified at the hillside posed risks to more than 20 buildings, resulting 
<br/>from high rainfall, associated with poor surface drainage.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The rainfall recorded in Dreketi at that time was around 309.5 millimetres, one of the highest 
<br/>rainfalls experienced during </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>.  The amount of precipitation received at that time was a decadal 
<br/>one,  one  in  a  10-year  event.    Seismic  activity  with  a  magnitude  of  5.8  megabytes  was  also 
<br/>experienced.    Structural  damages  such  as  cracks  on  walls,  floors  and  pavements,  including 
<br/>detachment  of  concrete  slabs,  tilting  of  buildings  and  movement  of  building  foundations,  were 
<br/>evident on standing buildings, including the church.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>387 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, following the event, taskforces were formed at divisional, district 
<br/>and  village  levels.    The  Commissioner  for  Northern  Division  was  tasked  to  Chair  the  Divisional 
<br/>Taskforce,  assisted  by  the  Divisional  Planning  Officer.    The  District  Taskforce  was  led  by  the 
<br/>Assistant District Officer Seaqaqa, while the </span><span>Turaga Ni Koro</span><span> of Nabavatu led the Village Taskforce 
<br/>Team.  The reporting line was a top-down and bottom-up approach, to ensure information integrity 
<br/>and accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  based  on  GPS  and  aerial  mapping  conducted  by  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources over the current village site in February 2021, it was revealed that the 
<br/>majority of the dwellings in the village were at high risk.  According to a report by the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources, all buildings and houses located within the medium to high risk zones 
<br/>would need to be relocated as a precautionary measure for the villagers and community’s safety.  The 
<br/>village, in its present condition, was considered not safe for future habitation, as there remained the 
<br/>risk of reoccurring geohazard event in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, due to this geohazard event in 2021 and upon the advice from the 
<br/>Ministry of Lands and Mineral Resources, the villagers of Nabavatu had to relocate to the Dreketi 
<br/>Assemblies of God Church compound, which is approximately one kilometre from the village site.  
<br/>The church compound has been the village’s temporary relocation site since the geohazard even in 
<br/>early 2021 and I believe most of us have seen the pictures of the tent village and that is exactly where 
<br/>it is. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to state, at the outset, that the Ministry is managing this 
<br/>relocation  in  alignment  with  the  Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP)  of  the  Plan  Relocation 
<br/>Guideline.    This  SOP  was  designed  in  alignment  with  the  Interagency  Standing  Committee 
<br/>Framework for durable solutions for internally displaced persons.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  document  launched  in  March  2023,  sets  out  a  clear  process  for  the  assessment  of 
<br/>communities  who  plan  relocation.    The  SOP  has  embedded  lessons  learnt  from  the  previous  six 
<br/>relocation  projects,  to  ensure  future  relocations  improve  on  the  gaps  identified  from  previous 
<br/>projects.  We thank the previous Administration for a lot of the work that was carried out on this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the SOP streamlines Government’s approach, ensuring strengthened 
<br/>coordination of departments involved in the various stages of relocation processes.  The SOP also 
<br/>outlines processes for non-government partners to provide support where expertise and resources can 
<br/>be leveraged to assist Government’s efforts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SOP is guided by the Climate Change Act 2021 and Climate Change Policy 2018-2030 
<br/>and includes a comprehensive Risk Assessment Methodology to assess and rank the communities, 
<br/>providing justification for selection of a community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Nabavatu Village relocation is the first in the country to adopt 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the new SOP on planned relocation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On progress todate, there are four phases to the project. Phase 1 is civil works which includes 
<br/></span><span>road access upgrade, drainage works and land clearing, which is in progress at the site.  The Ministry 
<br/></span><span>of Public works and the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways are two agencies involved in this 
<br/>activity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  first  payment  tranche  was  released  last  month  through  our  Climate  Change  Division, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>totalling $244,335.06, and the breakdown are as follows:

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, scoping is in progress for the connection of service lines through 
<br/>Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) and Water Authority of Fiji (WAF).  Once civil works are completed, 
<br/>EFL is to peg and provide quotations.  The expected timeline is by 30th April, 2024, for Phase 2.

<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Government  and  community  partnership  continues  with  the 
<br/>provision of timber logging activity to assist the community. The </span><span>Mataqali </span><span>Uluitoga, with the support 
<br/>of  Government  agencies  in  the  Northern  Division,  has  made  arrangements  with  Gold  Hold  Pte 
<br/>Limited to log the timber from their land. This timber will be processed and Gold Hold Pte Limited 
<br/>will reimburse the value of the timber by supplying building materials to affected households.  As of 
<br/>now, 207 cubic metres has been logged at the site. Consultation with the other five </span><span>mataqali</span><span> continues 
<br/>for the proposed logging sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, discussion is in progress with the re-diversion of initiative above 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>towards the building of the community evacuation centre and community hall.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry continues to allocate funds for payment of water usage by the community at the 
<br/>temporary relocation site.  Payment of water bills from 2022 until today, stands at $11,385. This will 
<br/>continue until the community are safely moved to the permanent relocation site at Nadoiviri.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  continues  to  work  closely  with  the  community  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensuring that wellbeing and safety is protected.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  must  also  place  on  record  and  thank  our  partners  -  the  United  Nations  Population  Fund 
<br/></span><span>(UNFPA), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Adventist Development and Relief Agency 
<br/>(ADRA), Live and Learn and Habitat for Humanity, just to name a few, for their unwavering support 
<br/>towards  the  rehabilitating  the  Nabavatu  community  at  the  current  temporary  relocation  site.  The 
<br/>Government  continues  to  engage  with  our  partners  for  the  wellbeing  and  safety  of  the  Nabavatu 
<br/></span><span>villagers.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>389 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have several Members on the  Opposition standing up. 
<br/>Can I just ask honourable Members to, please, keep your questions concise.  I know I have been 
<br/>letting you meander around a little bit this morning. I am also getting murmurings from the other side 
<br/>asking, “what’s the question?  But I thank you, honourable Members, for the spirit in which you are 
<br/>asking questions today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, . a very pertinent question with respect to the 
<br/>site that the village has actually been moved to - the permanent site. My question to the honourable 
<br/>Minister is, was there a thorough geotechnical assessment done of that particular site that they are 
<br/>moving to?  Is it contained in the SOP for future use with respect to that because we all know the geo 
<br/>surrounding of that area? Was it an independent institution that did the geotech or was it our own 
<br/>Ministry of Lands that did out the geotech assessment? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  Yes, there was a very detailed Geo-Tech Survey that was carried out. It was a very thorough 
<br/>one  as  well.  It  took  much  longer  than  we  thought  it  would  take  but  that  is  how  thorough  our 
<br/>Department of Lands had done the work.  I believe we only accept work that is done through the 
<br/>Department of Lands as far as our work is concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- We truly sympathise with the community at Nabavatu for what 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>they had to endure during this couple of years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank the honourable Minister for his answer.  Initially after </span><span>TC Yasa</span><span> and </span><span>TC Ana</span><span>, a few 
<br/>members of the Nabuavatu community were reluctant to relocate and land negotiations and other 
<br/>things were going on. I would like to ask the honourable Minister, has that stance changed? Is this 
<br/>relocation going to take the 100 percent relocation of the affected community? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I would like to thank the honourable Member for the question.  That 
<br/>was one of the reasons why it took so long. There is quite a bit of disagreement in the community.  I 
<br/>think  there  are  only  37  households  that  are  at  the  present  relocation  site  and  those  are  the  37 
<br/>households  that  we  are  focussing  on  and  that  we  are  intending  or  planning  to  move  to  the  new 
<br/>relocation site.  But the village site will be prepared for 100 percent of the people when they decide 
<br/>to move over.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Just one final question, Madam Deputy Speaker.  I did hear from 
<br/>the honourable Minister that Gold Hold Pte Limited will be involved, so it is just the community 
<br/>contribution that I want to ask of the honourable Minister.  Is it cash in kind?  To what extend is the 
<br/>contribution from the community when it comes to this relocation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, what they provided was just the timber which 
<br/>Gold Hold Pte. Limited logged and in return, they would pay for all of the houses that were going to 
<br/>be built.  I think there are only about five houses that are involved. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Before  I ask honourable Tuinaceva to  ask Question No. 
<br/>15/2024,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  Professor  Jon  Fraenkel  from  the  Victoria  University,  a 
<br/></span><span>professor  in  politics,  who  is  sitting  in  the  public  gallery  this  morning.  He  is  a  former  university 
<br/></span><span>lecturer here at the University of the South Pacific.  Welcome, Sir.

<div><span>Road Upgrade - Valewaqa Settlement, Vunilagi, Cakaudrove  
<br/>(Question No. 15/2024)

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management inform Parliament on when will the upgrade on the road to Valewaqa Settlement 
<br/>in Vunilagi, Cakaudrove, commence so that buses and other light PSVs can start providing 
<br/>services to the residents? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  Madam Deputy Speaker, please, allow me to provide an update on the Community Access 
<br/>Roads, Footpaths and Footbridges (CARFF)Development Programme under the Ministry of Rural 
<br/>and Maritime Development and Disaster Management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the CARFF is part of the programmes that we carry out in the rural 
<br/>areas.    It  improves  community  access  to  the  main  transportation  network,  markets  and  essential 
<br/>services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For road access, these access roads are not the rural roads used by public transport that are 
<br/>being upgraded by the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA).  They are smaller access roads, connecting rural 
<br/>communities including farmers, to Fiji’s main centres.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Footpaths and footbridges connect communities for better accessibility and in improving the 
<br/>standard of living.  Approximately, $2 million allocated to the Ministry in the financial year 2023-
<br/>2024 was for this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the breakdown of the released funds and the number of projects for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this financial year per Division are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner Western Division with 42 projects - $816,578. 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner Northern Division with 23 projects -  $607,164. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner Central Division with 37 projects -  $684,365; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner Eastern Division with 28 projects -  $498,221. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the funds that are mentioned for the Rural Development Programme 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is limited to only $50,000 per project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the question, the Valewaqa Settlement at Vunilagi, Cakaudrove, has a total population of 
<br/>75 with 12 households, a 1.3 kilometre road with iTaukei land ownership.  Part of the community 
<br/>that reside at Valewaqa are members of the Melanesian community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The last road upgrade at Valewaqa Settlement  was done by FRA through the Community 
<br/>Access Fund in 2015.  The Programme allows FRA to work with the Divisional Commissioner on 
<br/>the community access priority for repair and maintenance.  In 2017 the programme was shelved.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the road access is serviceable by RSL and school pick up carriers 
<br/>continue to service the settlement. The road access is earmarked to be upgraded through the Office 
<br/>of  the  Commissioner  Northern  under  the  Community  Access  Road  Programme  that  I  had  just 
<br/>described in the next financial year - 2024 – 2025. The Ministry will continue to engage with the 
<br/></span><span>community and Fiji Roads Authority through the Community Access Road Programme to enable 
<br/></span><span>better access to the community.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N.T. TUINACEVA.– Madam Deputy Speaker, through you. I just want to thank the 
<br/>honourable Minister for his response. The latest update I received from the Valewaqa community 
<br/>which was last night, even four-wheel drives cannot access the road because of poor road condition. 
<br/>I know the programme the honourable Minister is talking about; it will happen and that takes a bit of

<br/>quick fix to enable the movement of vehicles to provide services to the people?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is already done.  I have already called the

<div><span>Office of the ICAO Pacific Liaison Officer 
<br/>(Question No. 16/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  establishment  of  the  Office  of  the  International  Civil 
<br/>Aviation Organisation Pacific Liaison Officer for the Pacific Small Island Developing States. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, since forming the Coalition Government, 
<br/>one of our goals is to bring our Pacific Island communities together which we had witnessed on many 
<br/>occasions including the Pacific Islands Forum Special Leaders Retreat in 2023 by our honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, another initiative of strengthening and improving Fiji’s relationship 
<br/>with  its  Pacific  Island  brothers  and  sisters  in  the  area  of  aviation  is  establishing  an  office  of  the 
<br/>International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  for  the  Pacific  Small  Island  Developing  States 
<br/>(PSIDS) in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  PSIDS  are  a  group  of  unique  islands  which  share  distinct 
<br/>sustainable  development  challenges  characterized  by  many  factors  including  limited  resources, 
<br/>remoteness  in  terms  of  distance,  poor  connectivity,  high  cost  of  travel,  vulnerability  to  natural 
<br/>disasters,  public  health  emergencies  of  international  concern  and  excessive  dependence  on 
<br/>international  support.  Most  PSIDS  do  not  have  the  capability  to  fully  discharge  their  ICAO 
<br/>membership obligations or engage constructively with ICAO on programmes and activities and gain 
<br/>the best possible benefit from their membership. Therefore, an ICAO presence in the Pacific is an 
<br/>essential component of strengthening the relationship between the PSIDS and ICAO.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Cabinet  in  its  meeting  held  on  9</span><span>th</span><span>  May,  2023,  approved  the 
<br/>establishment of the office of ICAO, Pacific Small Island Developing States Liaison Office and the 
<br/>ICAO  Pacific  Liaison  Officer.    This  is  the  first  ever  office  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation 
<br/>Organization in the Pacific region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, more than 65 percent to 70 percent of all arrivals into Fiji are carried 
<br/>by Fiji Airways. Therefore, our tourism relies on aviation to bring in visitors and aviation relies on 
<br/>tourism to generation demand and fill seats. Given the importance of the role of civil aviation in the 
<br/>Pacific region in supporting the tourism industry as our nation’s  lifeline, the physical presence of 
<br/>ICAO in Fiji only provides the added benefit to Fiji but also the Pacific region.  The ICAO office is 
<br/></span><span>set  to  enhance  our  status  in  the  global  aviation  community,  creating  opportunities  for  capacity 
<br/></span><span>building,  skills  development  and  knowledge  transfer  contributing  of  the  ICAO  initiative  of  no 
<br/>country left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  at  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  introduce  the  ICAO  appointed 
<br/>Pacific Liaison Officer, Mr. Shane Sumner, was formally assigned this current position in August 
<br/>2023  by  ICAO.    His  professional  background  in  aviation  is  in  Air  Traffic  Management,  serving

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>various roles in Australia as an Air Traffic Controller and in Air Traffic Management.  Prio to taking 
<br/>up his role in Fiji, he served as Regional Officer Air Traffic Management in the ICAO Asia Pacific 
<br/>Regional Office in Bangkok.  The ICAO Office in Fiji is located at the CAAF compound in Nadi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  since  taking  up  office  in  Nadi,  Shane  has  physically  visited  a 
<br/>number of Pacific Island States.  Currently, he is coordinating with ICAO and PSIDS for the conduct 
<br/>of Critical Safety Oversight Officer Training to be held in Fiji later this year.  The role of Pacific 
<br/>Liaison  Officer  will  be  more  focussed  on  supporting  improvements  in  addressing  regulatory  and 
<br/>technical  outcomes  and  assist  PSIDS  in  addressing  their  resource  and  capacity  challenge  and  to 
<br/>enhance communication and coordination with the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, the Pacific Islands 
<br/>Forum  Secretariat,  UN  organisations,  Multinational  Development  Banks  and  other  relevant 
<br/>international regional stakeholders and facilitate technical assistance as required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  co-ordination  and  facilitation  of  ICAO  support  for  the  39th-
<br/>ICAO member PSIDS which are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States 
<br/>of  Micronesia,  Nauru,  Palau,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  Tonga,  Tuvalu  and 
<br/>Vanuatu remain paramount for ICAO Pacific Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, by establishing a physical presence in Nadi, ICAO aims to facilitate 
<br/>closer  collaborations  with  the  PSIDS,  providing  targeted  assistance  and  expertise  to  address  the 
<br/>unique aviation requirements and the Fiji Government is very proud to be able to have had an active 
<br/>participation in making these facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- We have a follow-up question first of all from the original 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>questioner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my supplementary question is, when 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>was Fiji aviation last audited by ICAO  and what were the results? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for the supplementary question. 
<br/>The last ICAO audit of Fiji was carried out in 2019 and we expect the next one in 2025.  On the 
<br/>results, Madam Deputy Speaker, Fiji scored 76.3 percent.  This sits above the Asia Pacific average 
<br/>of 65.5 percent and global average of 69.4 percent, so Fiji is doing well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The lower score, Madam Deputy Speaker, was in areas of accident investigation, we need to 
<br/>strengthen that and also the primary and secondary legislations are relating to aviation.  The Act to 
<br/>have, Madam Deputy Speaker, goes back to 1976, almost 50 years ago so we need to bring that today 
<br/>and is part of a legislative programme for this year.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the technical qualifications, personal numbers and technical training, we find it very 
<br/>difficult  to  keep  our  trained  and  experienced  people  in  aviation.    They  are  poached.    Once  they 
<br/>become competent, once they have an added profile, they are poached by our neighbours.  It is a huge 
<br/>challenge and is something that will continue to challenge us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Luckily for last year, we managed to get the full budget required by the aviation, thanks to 
<br/></span><span>our honourable Minister of Finance.  That was welcomed and will go a long way in strengthening 
<br/></span><span>the Civil Aviation Authority in Fiji.  At one time, we needed a full complement of 76 staff, we are 
<br/>only sitting at about 65 or so.  The audit picks on that, that we are not fully staffed in the right areas.  
<br/>In terms of global rating, Fiji is 11</span><span>th</span><span> in the Asia Pacific Region.  That is quite significant for our small 
<br/>country and what we do for our neighbours. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my question is related to our representation at 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ICAO,  and  ICAO  Conferences  has  not  just  been  helpful  to  Fiji,  but  also  to  our  Pacific  Island 
<br/>neighbours and the SIDS that honourable Minister talks about.  In terms of the future of civil aviation, 
<br/>at the last Civil Aviation Conference that honourable Gavoka and I attended, one of the key topics 
<br/>was Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question relates to the fact that by setting up this particular office and having a Liaison 
<br/>Officer, because that was very high on the agenda with respect to civil aviation fuels, and if I may 
<br/>just digress a little bit, Europe has totally gotten behind Africa in terms of sustainable aviation fuels, 
<br/>and the Pacific has been left behind; left behind to the extent that even Australia and New Zealand 
<br/>have been left by the wayside.  Will this Liaison Officer have at the top of their agenda our charge 
<br/>with respect to the development of sustainable aviation fuels in Fiji and for the purposes of Pacific 
<br/>and Australia and New Zealand?  Is that going to be part of their work? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  yes,  SAF  is  very  much  part  of  the 
<br/>requirements  of  the  work  of  our  Liaison  Officer  and  to  help  develop  SAF.        I  will  be  making  a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement on this on Thursday.  Suffice to say that I was happy that honourable Koya 
<br/>accompanied me to Dubai, where I chaired the Conference on Civil Aviation Alternative Fuel.

<div><span>Maintenance of Cane Access Roads – Ministry of Sugar Industry  
<br/>(Question No. 17/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  is  ensuring  cane  access  roads  are  maintained  well  before 
<br/>harvesting season. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, unfortunately, honourable Pillay is not here, 
<br/>but, I will give him a copy of my answer as well for his reference.  Honourable Pillay has a wide 
<br/>knowledge of the sugar industry given his background as a cane farmer, and I express my gratitude 
<br/>for his insightful question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We recognise the critical role of the Ministry is ensuring that the cane access roads needs to 
<br/>be well maintained. These roads, Madam Deputy Speaker, not only transport sugarcane from farms 
<br/>to mills but serves other agricultural farmers and the public as well who are not farmers including 
<br/>linkages through the villages and many informal settlements in the deep interiors of our rural sectors. 
<br/>These roads serve as a vital outreach of our nation’s sugar industry enabling timely harvesting and 
<br/>delivery of sugarcane while minimising logistical challenges for our hardworking farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is important to note, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the maintenance of cane access roads is 
<br/>basically avoided during the rainy season which spans from November to April.  This precaution is 
<br/>taken  largely  to  prevent  the  road  upgrades  being  damaged  and  washed  away  by  heavy  rains  and 
<br/>floods which we have just witnessed in January. This strategic decision explains, Madam Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, while repairs of cane access roads have yet to commence too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To ensure the best value for money, maintenance activities usually begin in May and extend 
<br/>into the early stages of the crushing season.  As we prepare for the 2024 harvesting season, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, preparations are already in the final stages to upgrade 3,000 kilometres of roads and 
<br/>supply of culverts and repair costings with an allocated budget of $2 million.  Since 2012, a total of 
<br/>$39.4  million  has  already  been  expanded  for  this  purpose.    On  average,  my  Ministry  allocates 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approximately  $500  per  kilometre  of  the  road  each  year  and  is  often  insufficient  for  the 
<br/>comprehensive maintenance given the impacts of climate change that we are experiencing now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, we have progressed very well as my Ministry’s workplan, the road 
<br/>contractors for the 2024 maintenance season have been selected through a tender process and every 
<br/>month our accounts are being signed.  Maintenance work is scheduled to commence in the first week 
<br/>of May aiming for the completion by the mid harvesting season to minimise stand over cane.  As the 
<br/>contractors undertake the essential repairs on the ground, our field staff from the Sugar Cane Growers 
<br/>Council, my Ministry and FSC will actively monitor their progress.  Their presence ensures that the 
<br/>quality of work is continuously maintained throughout the duration of the project and as we have 
<br/>clearly defined, specification for the scope of work detailing the right type of material, et cetera to be 
<br/>used.  The  continued  effort  between  the  contractors,  farmers  and  the  field  staff  underscores  our 
<br/>commitment  to  upholding  higher  standards  and  delivering  effective  results  in  the  maintenance  of 
<br/>cane access roads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to add on, I must also inform Parliament that we have successfully 
<br/>completed the In-Field Drainage Project after years of neglect and deterioration which forms part of 
<br/>the foundation of many roads across these farm areas. In tandem with overseeing of the repairs of the 
<br/>cane access roads, this Government is also actively pursuing the restoration of extension of our rail 
<br/>system.    Following  the  extensive  discussion  during  my  recent  visit  to  India,  we  are  exploring 
<br/>pathways  forward  and  revitalizing  our  extensive  rail  network  that  holds  promise  for  significant 
<br/>elevation  and  maintenance  workloads.    Moreover,  I  extend  to  reduce  transportation  cost  for  our 
<br/>farmers in enhancing the sugar industry.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in a matter of relevance and accountability, 
<br/>I need to quote this, FBC stated on 31st March, 2023 on cane access road and I quote, “A Minister 
<br/>said,    we  are  focused  on  bringing  in  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  Department  to  work  on  rural 
<br/>infrastructure as said by the Minister for Finance.”  We noticed the poor and sluggish efforts under 
<br/>the Ministry of Sugar because there were complaints of cane access roads not being attended to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Question! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  I  would  like  to  ask  the  honourable  Minister  for  Sugar,  were  the 
<br/>promises of the honourable Minister for Finance fulfilled and his instructions obeyed to on how the 
<br/>Public Works Department assisted in the maintenance of cane roads to assist our farmers?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think the honourable Member should direct 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that question directly to the honourable Minister for Finance because he had said it, not me. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- It is an irrelevant question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, this is to the honourable Minister, I just 
<br/></span><span>heard it from him, improvement of the rail system.  You have visited India which is good but when 
<br/>will this improvement take place?  I had brought this issue already after visiting Labasa last year, 
<br/>particularly  for  the  farmers  from  Wainikoro  because  this  is  good  for  the  farmers  in  terms  of 
<br/>minimising costs and at the same time, in terms of climate change, reducing our carbon footprints, 
<br/>we need this rail system.  When will this rail system be fixed and improved?

<br/>called RITES.  They actually come had and understudied in Fiji earlier and they are coming back to 
<br/>us with an update of the rail system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said that, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is  going to happen.  There is a team  already 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engaged with us, they should be here in the next couple of months, and it will not take 16 years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- When? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- 16 years! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, last year we had a real issue in regards to the 
<br/>upgrading of cane access roads, for instance, where the estimate cost to upgrade a cane access road 
<br/>was $1,000 but few loads of gravel were delivered.  I want to ask the honourable Minister whether 
<br/>that trend will continue or the full amount that is allocated is given for upgrade? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think we have made a point that there is a  $2 
<br/>million  allocation for cane access roads and we will make sure that we take care of all the farmers 
<br/>and the roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Only one month left, when will you make sure? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- You stand up and talk! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my question to him is, you have got only one 
<br/></span><span>month left, we are in the month of April, we have got May, June is the new budget.  When are you 
<br/>going to use that money to fix the roads, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- There was a rainy season in place, it has dried up now.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I just mentioned earlier in my reply that there 
<br/>was a rainy season in place, now it has dried up and we will start with the contractors to go on the 
<br/>road. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. D. KUMAR.- Rain season.

<div><span>Update on the Suspension of PALM Registration  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Question No. 18/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>update Parliament on the reason(s) why the PALM registration is being suspended? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, just for the record, our workers were engaged 
<br/>in  short-term  seasonal  work  in  both,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  since  2015.    Reforms  of  the 
<br/>Australian Labor Mobility Programme took place in 2022, resulting in the merging of both the short-
<br/>term  visa  of  up  to  nine  months  and  the  long-term  visa  of  up  to  four  years.    Both  Australian 
<br/>programmes are now known as the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) Scheme.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  since  the  inception  of  foreign  employment  opportunities,  both 
<br/>Australia’s Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and New Zealand’s Recognised Seasonal Employer 
<br/>(RSE) Work Scheme registrations are done manually by the National Employment Centre (NEC), 
<br/></span><span>together with the records of the workers and assessments that are manually recorded and filled with 
<br/></span><span>workers passing the assessment criteria, placed into work ready pool – ready for the recruitment and 
<br/>selection process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  inception  of  the  long-term  visa  in  2019  opened  up  more 
<br/>opportunities for Fijians to register their interest for the Scheme and the industry preference that they 
<br/>wish to work for.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>397 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the influx of interest in this PALM Programme, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, 
<br/>through  NEC,  has  been  overwhelmed  with  the  number  of  registrations  in  all  our  seven  District 
<br/>Offices around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, it has been noted that registrations increased multiple fold in 2019 
<br/>to  2023  and  is  an  indication  that  registered  clients  are  eagerly  waiting  for  the  opportunity  to  be 
<br/>considered to work in Australia.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this long wait has occasionally caused a lot of frustrations amongst 
<br/>clients, resulting in complaints that are escalating to higher authorities even and the Ministry staff 
<br/>had been trying to manage this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  just  for  the  record,  the  numbers  registered  under  the  In-Country 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recruitment Database is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Year 
<br/>2019 
<br/>Number Registered  2,922 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2020 
<br/>2,893 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2021 
<br/>6,215 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2022 
<br/>2023 
<br/>15,091  8,041 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total 
<br/>35,162 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the temporary suspension of Client Registration under the PALM 
<br/>Scheme is for seven months, which commenced from 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2024, and will conclude on 31</span><span>st</span><span>
<br/>July, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  updating  of  the  backlog  manual  registration  work  is  progressing  well.  The  process 
<br/>includes the sorting and cleansing transfer of manual registration into the In-Country Recruitment 
<br/>Database, as well as the process improvement to enhance the efficiency of NEC services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, recognising the magnitude of this task, we have engaged volunteers 
<br/>to assist in that critical work.  In addition to our volunteers, all our NEC staff in the District Offices 
<br/>have  been  actively  participating  in  this  initiative.  Their  expertise  and  understanding  had  been 
<br/>invaluable in ensuring that the data is accurate and reflective of the current demographics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are committed to completing this task efficiently and effectively, and we appreciate the 
<br/>patience and understanding of all during this period.  We will continue to  provide updates as we 
<br/>move closer to the completion of this project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As of now, we are processing applications from the year 2021 for all work sectors.  The only 
<br/>exception is the aged care where we are currently processing applications from 2022.  So, that is the 
<br/>kind of backlog we are faced with, Madam Deputy Speaker, and the Ministry will resume registration 
<br/>from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  I.  TUIWAILEVU.-  My  supplementary  question  to  the  honourable  Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>how many workers are currently in Australia and New Zealand at the moment?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for iTaukei Affairs for his 
<br/>supplementary question.  As I speak, we have a total of 6,669 Fijians deployed in  Australia since 
<br/></span><span>2021.  Currently, we have 5,000 who are in Australia.  The numbers include the short term and long 
<br/></span><span>term employees.  Some 700 are currently working in New Zealand and we are expecting another 47 
<br/>to leave our shores next month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- I thank the honourable Minister for his response.  The teething 
<br/></span><span>issues that we faced are particularly on worker’s rights, labour laws, because there are reports that 
<br/></span><span>some of our workers appreciate the scheme, but some of our workers  are ill-treated, and that is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>398 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>major concern for us.  They are seen as, sort of, lower- or second-class workers, as compared to the 
<br/>countries that do receive our labourers.  My simple question to the honourable Minister is, what are 
<br/>we  doing  to  address  these  issues  and  are  our  workers  fairly  represented  while  they  are  there  in 
<br/>Australia or New Zealand? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition for his supplementary question.  I have alluded to this matter in Parliament in the past.  
<br/>When we came into office, we were criticised for visiting our workers in Australia and New Zealand.  
<br/>Some honourable Members from the Opposition said that we were going on excursion trips. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Madam Deputy Speaker, sometimes we have to deal  with the elements as well.  
<br/>When  we  visited  both,  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  we  realised  that  we  did  not  have  any 
<br/>representative of ours who could look after our workers there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH.-  We appointed three Country Liaison  Officers, who are now looking 
<br/>after our workers’ interests in Australia.  I must repeat that in 2021, the Australian Government had 
<br/>already  allocated  funds  for  us  to  appoint  a  Country  Liaison  Officer,  but  we  never  appointed  the 
<br/>officer.  But now, we have appointed three of them and the fourth one will be appointed soon.  The 
<br/>workers have a direct link to them, they are able to call them any time and they make sure that the 
<br/>minimum standards are observed, equal to those how Australian workers are treated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I have also met with my Australian counterpart and New Zealand 
<br/>counterpart, and we have discussed the minimum standards.  The Labour Ministries in both countries 
<br/>have assured us that they are going to make sure that inspections are done, our workers are treated 
<br/>well and that all minimum standards are observed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly,  we  have  met  with  the  unions  in  Australia  and  New  Zealand  and  the  respective 
<br/>workers  unions  have  also  assured  that  they  will  organise  them  and  they  will  make  sure  that  the 
<br/>minimum standards are met.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our communities in both Australia and in New Zealand are also assisting us in this matter, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker.  So, we have network, we have made sure that our people out there are 
<br/>getting  what  they  rightly  deserve  as  far  as  treatment  by  the  employers  is concerned,  and  we  will 
<br/>continue to do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I think it is a great insult to the staff of NEC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>because they did very well without these Liaison Officers… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- ... and it is unfortunate that the honourable Minister had to make that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>comment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Going back to the question, Madam Deputy Speaker, there were some talks that the family 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>members can join the workers.  I just want to know how far this has progressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.D.  SINGH.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  wish  to  thank  the  former  Minister    for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Employment, Productivity and Industrial Relations.  The records speaks for itself.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>399 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  this  initiative  begun  last  year  by  the  Australian  Government 
<br/>whereby some workers’ families can join them for the period that they are working out there and the 
<br/>benefit that would be accorded them would be that the spouse would also be allowed to work, and 
<br/>the children would be allowed to receive that education that they deserve.  The pilot project begun 
<br/>with Timor-Leste and one other country (Vanuatu, I think) last year and now, it is our turn.  We are 
<br/>working closely with the Australian authorities to progress this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, in all his answers, not once has he mentioned 
<br/>that we have a fully-fledged Embassy and a Mission in Australia to take care of a whole lot of stuff 
<br/>that they ought to. It is their job. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- No! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the  Pacific  Labour 
<br/>Mobility Scheme brings in, if my memory serves me correctly, I think it is about $39 million a month 
<br/>into Fiji.  I am not sure if you have actually answered your question yourself, but the reasons given 
<br/>for suspension really are technical things that you need to do with respect to getting data, et cetera, 
<br/>all those things that you have  actually  mentioned.  Because of the fact  that we  earned about  $39 
<br/>million a month, do you not think it was rather a hasty decision to suspend it and the fact that there 
<br/>are a lot of families that are benefiting out of this?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.D. SINGH- Madam Deputy Speaker, if I understand correctly, I think there is some 
<br/>confusion  I  would  like  to  clarify.    While  the  registration  has  been  suspended,  the  sending  of  the 
<br/>workers has not been suspended, that is continuing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said earlier, Madam Deputy Speaker, there are 35,000 pending applications that we 
<br/>are  processing,  so  the  processing  is  ongoing.  As  I  have  stated  earlier  in  my  contribution,  47  are 
<br/>leaving in two weeks’ time for New Zealand.  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.

<div><span>Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan 2023-2028 
<br/>(Question No. 13/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection  informed 
<br/>Parliament  on  29</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2023  that  the  Ministry  would  be  rolling  out  the  Fiji  Women’s 
<br/>Economic Empowerment Plan (2023-2028). Can the honourable Minister update Parliament 
<br/>on how and when the Plan was developed and how well it has been implemented thus far? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to thank the honourable Member for 
<br/>the interest in the Women’s Economic Empowerment Plan.  Women’s Economic Empowerment is 
<br/>essential for sustainable development and inclusive growth.  The former President, Barrack Obama 
<br/>stated, “The best judge of whether or not a country is going to develop is how it treats its women.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Global evidence demonstrates that by dismantling social, institutional and structural barriers 
<br/></span><span>and challenging gender discriminatory stereotypes and norms, and by fostering women’s leadership 
<br/></span><span>across all facets  of women’s lives, we can unlock tremendous economic potential.  This includes 
<br/>ensuring  women’s  access  to  markets,  control  over  productive  resources,  opportunities  for  decent 
<br/>work, bodily autonomy and meaningful participation in economic decision-making at all levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  upcoming  Fiji  Women’s  Economic  Empowerment  National  Action  Plan  (WEENAP), 
<br/>represents the Coalition Government’s commitment to unlocking the economic potential of Fijian

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>women  and  girls,  ensuring  their  full  participation  and  leadership  in  our  economy.    On  that  note, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am honoured to give a brief context and update on the WEENAP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To effectively spearhead the development of this WEENAP, the Ministry took proactive steps 
<br/>since  early  2023.    On  13</span><span>th</span><span>  and  14</span><span>th</span><span>  April,  2023,  we  organised  a  high  level  technical  advisory 
<br/>workshop.  This event was more than just a meeting.  It represented a convergence of minds and 
<br/>efforts, uniting 50 leaders and experts from Civil Society, Government agencies, the private sector, 
<br/>informal sector and Women’s Rights Organisations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  workshop  is  to  foster  a  collective  dialogue  through  a  thorough  examination  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>economic growth that Fijian women hold within our society, and the barriers they encounter.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We identified a significant burden of unpaid work on Fijian women and girls –

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Their over representation in the informal economy;  
<br/>issues  of  bodily  autonomy,  with  high  prevalence  of  gender-based  violence,  as  well  as 
<br/>reproductive cancers;  
<br/>limited access to sexual and reproductive health rights;  
<br/>daily impacts of the climate crisis;  
<br/>limited knowledge access and productive use of digital technology and e-commerce;  
<br/>limited access to financial resources; and  
<br/>the presence of gender blind policies and discriminatory norms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Fiji Country Gender Assessment confirms that Fijian women 
<br/>are predominantly employed in low paying jobs, within the precarious informal sector.  Only 35.2 
<br/>percent of women are in formal employment, on a count of less than three interns engaged in paid 
<br/>informal work.  This disparity is underscored by the labour force participation rate of 45.5 percent of 
<br/>all women, compared to 82.6 percent of men, revealing a significant gender gap of 38 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover, the challenges extend beyond employment, Madam Deputy Speaker.  Nearly two-
<br/>thirds of Fijian women experience intimate partner violence, with an associated economic cost to our 
<br/>nation of approximately $400 million annually, that is about 7 percent of our GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  our  academic  institutions,  despite  women  representing  65  percent  of  students,  as  it  is 
<br/>evidenced  by  our  students  who  sit  in  the  gallery  today,  over  half  of  the  graduates  face 
<br/>disproportionately high unemployment, particularly among young women aged 15 years to 24 years, 
<br/>where 30 percent are neither in education, neither in employment nor in training.  That is, three times 
<br/>the rate of young men.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in the MSME sector, which contributes 18 percent of Fiji’s GDP, 
<br/>about  half  the  businesses  are  owned  by  women.    Yet  only  19  percent  of  these  enterprises  are 
<br/>registered under women’s names, and they often operate in low productivity sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In our homes, Fijian girls and women spend two times to three times, the amount of time on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>unpaid domestic and care work, compared with boys and men.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A significant proportion of Fijian women lack the autonomy to make their own healthcare 
<br/>decisions.  Notably, cancers of the reproductive organs, such as cervical and breast cancer, are the 
<br/>leading diseases causing death amongst women of all ages in Fiji, with these cancers being among 
<br/>the top five causes of cancer deaths.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>401 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  key  point  from  the  workshop  I  mentioned  earlier,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  was  that 
<br/>women’s control over their bodies is crucial, not just for health, but also for economic empowerment.  
<br/>A healthy woman is a productive woman.  Bodily autonomy lets women make important decisions 
<br/>that affect both their personal and work lives.  It helps them fully participate in the workforce, start 
<br/>or  grow  their  businesses  and  reach  their  economic  goals.    Therefore,  supporting  and  promoting 
<br/>women’s bodily autonomy is vital for them to succeed in all areas of their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  highlight  this  key  data  because  it  powerfully  demonstrates  the  Coalition  Government’s 
<br/>commitment in taking decisive action in steering a new course.  In this context, the Ministry has acted 
<br/>on  the  outcomes  document  from  the  workshop  I  mentioned  earlier,  because  it  underscores  the 
<br/>importance of the WEENAP.   The Ministry has prioritised its development by mobilising necessary 
<br/>technical resources for further consultation and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial statement! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- You asked for a statement and answer, I have 20 minutes to respond.  
<br/>Thank you, honourable Kumar.  I would hope you would be supportive of what I am talking about.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We extend our deep appreciation to the Government of Australia for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their generous support in moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Cabinet has endorsed the implementation of the WEENAP.  Following this endorsement 
<br/>in  February  this  year,  we  assembled  the  team  of  experts  to  drive  this  initiative  forward.    The 
<br/>Department of Women is expanded to include a National Coordinator for the WEENAP, a consultant 
<br/>for the WEENAP, who collaborates closely with our WEE Desk at the Ministry and also our Gender 
<br/>Advisor.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chaired  by  the  Permanent  Secretary  of  the  Ministry,  the  secretariat  includes  key  society 
<br/>organisations, like the Fiji Women’s Rights Movement (FWRM), DIVA for Equality, the Women’s 
<br/>Entrepreneurship  Business  Council  (WEBC)  and  the  Fiji  Women’s  Fund  (FWF).    We  also  have 
<br/>representatives  from  the  private  sector,  like  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).    The  secretariat  is 
<br/>mandated  to  provide  technical  oversight  for  the  consultation  and  development  process  of  the 
<br/>WEENAP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  am  also  pleased  to  announce  that  we  have  developed  a  robust 
<br/>consultation framework for the WEENAP. This consultation phase is set to commence in May, next 
<br/>month,  and  will  run  until  the  end  of  July.    This  consultation  aims  to  alleviate  awareness  of  the 
<br/>importance  of  women’s  economic  empowerment,  spotlighting  the  significant  contributions  of 
<br/>women and addressing the challenges that hinder their full participation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, there are approximately 104 stakeholders in this process, who are 
<br/>directly or indirectly contributing to the consultation of the WEENAP, and these stakeholders are 
<br/>categorised into nine categories.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Ministerial Statement! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  What was the question, honourable Kumar?  The question was to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>give an update on the development of the WEENAP.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>! </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- These stakeholders from the nine categories include:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>educational institutions;  
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>WEE programmes and projects; 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Government agencies;  
<br/>10.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development agencies; 
<br/>private sector; 
<br/>financial institutions; 
<br/>networks and associations; 
<br/>civil society; 
<br/>faith-based and women’s rights organisations; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>informal sector; etc.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I shall highlight to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that in the consultation process, we continue 
<br/>to  lean on the expertise  of women-led civil  society  organisations and the engagement of NGOs  - 
<br/>something that the former Government failed many times, to engage civil society organisations in 
<br/>the development of any Government policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is bullying. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, a final report will be scheduled for August 
<br/>this year (2024), and also upon completion of this consultation, we will be drafting the Women’s 
<br/>Economic Empowerment Plan.  This document is expected to undergo validation by the taskforce in 
<br/>September  this  year  and,  of  course,  will  be  submitted  to  Cabinet  for  approval,  with  the  launch 
<br/>planned, hopefully, at the end of this year or early next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note also, I wish to report to this Parliament that the Ministry is working with the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance and commencing the design of the second phase of the Gender Transformative 
<br/>Capacity  Development  and  Gender  Responsive  Budgeting.  Why  is  this  important  to  highlight?  
<br/>Because  for  the  first  time  ever  in  the  history  of  Fiji  under  the  Coalition  Government,  we  have 
<br/>achieved Gender Responsive Budgeting.  We may have little representation in Parliament, but we 
<br/>certainly are results oriented.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  first  time  in  last  year’s  budget,  there  were  actual  budget  allocations  in  Ministries 
<br/>committed to gender. So, for the three Ministries with the National Action Plan to prevent Gender-
<br/>Based Violence - the Ministry of Youth, Ministry of Education and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>have budget lines committed to the National Action Plan on Gender Based Violence (NAP-GBV).  
<br/>Yes, honourable Premila Kumar we are spending the money. Yes, we are.  In fact, honourable Vasu 
<br/>and I have just returned from a workshop that gathered our traditional leaders, so they are consulted 
<br/>on the way forward in order to implement the NAP-GBV.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- We commit to Parliament continually to all Fijian women and girls 
<br/>and  we  will  be  informing  you  of  the  progress  of  this  Fiji  WEENAP  and  we  assure  you  that  our 
<br/>Ministry will continue to be the driving force for gender equality within our Government, but I am 
<br/>very gratefully for the able leadership of our honourable Prime Minister, Mr. Sitiveni Rabuka who is 
<br/>the Champion for Gender Equality and continue to commit budget (actual finances) so it is not just

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>403 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all talk Opposition during your time, committed so that these action plans will be realised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the  question was in two parts: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Update how this Plan was developed; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>the implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From  the  very  comprehensive  Ministerial  Statement  received,  I  see  that  it  is  all  about 
<br/>development  and  workshops.  Is  this  another  no  action  talk  only  activity  of  this  Coalition 
<br/>Government? It is only talk. It has taken them one year to develop the activity plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- When will they start implementing?  After they finish their four-year term 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Parliament? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  really  thank  the  enthusiasm  of  the 
<br/>honourable  Member.  I  do  not  think  he  was  listening  to  my  response  when  I  stated  that  in  the 
<br/>meantime, we have to undertake extensive consultations and then come up with a plan to implement 
<br/>which is at consultations, something they never did during their time. They just came out with plans 
<br/>without consultations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  conducting  proper  consultations  with  the  stakeholders  including  the  women’s 
<br/>organisations. We need talk to the women in order to come up with a plan. I mentioned the entire 
<br/>timeline, honourable Member, by late this year or early next year we will be able to have that fully 
<br/>consulted National  Action Plan before we  can then implement  which is  what  is  happening  to  the 
<br/>National  Action Plan to prevent  Gender Based Violence.  We started it last year, it is  now being 
<br/>implemented from the 1</span><span>st</span><span> March this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Thank you, honourable Minister for the very comprehensive speech.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Sharma, please, be concise with your question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Sure, I will be, Madam Deputy Speaker.  To curb the graph of gender 
<br/>imbalance  when  it  comes  to  landownership  and  cultivation  for  Fijian  women,  I  was  looking  and 
<br/>trying to hear where it is covered in your statement about the Women’s Economic Empowerment 
<br/>Plan?  Where is it going to address the ability for women to acquire land and increase participation 
<br/>in  agriculture  with  the  sole  purpose  of  them  being  agri-entrepreneurs.    As  you  have  highlighted, 
<br/>participation at all levels, so I was looking for this important aspect because the way to improve this 
<br/>country is through agriculture. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, it is not often that I agree with honourable 
<br/>Sharma, but this point that he has made, yes, we do need to engage our women in agriculture and the 
<br/>Ministry for Agriculture is committed to women in agriculture in terms of their programmes.  But, 
<br/>yes, they are being consulted also in this process that I mentioned and then when we do have the plan 
<br/></span><span>in place, then we will be able to implement but we are engaging by the end of this year (I mentioned) 
<br/></span><span>or early next year   will be the implementation of the plan.  We are heavily consulting our women 
<br/>including our women in the agriculture space. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  we  ratified  Convention  on  the 
<br/>Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), now you are coming up 
<br/>with another terminology Women’s Economic Empowerment National Action Plan (WEENAP).  I

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have stated so many times in Parliament, the action must match the rhetoric - data, consultation, data, 
<br/>consultation.  There is a difference between action and consultation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- You did nothing, you never did consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- We have so much data in the Household Income and Expenditure 
<br/>Survey (HIES) Report that talks about poverty throughout gender, sector, geographic regions; data 
<br/>is already in existence.  What the women of this country want to ask, and they need answers on is, 
<br/>what is there now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRAN.- That is data, not consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.-  Thank you honourable Leader of the Opposition.  In terms of the 
<br/>timeline, yes, we start off with the data, but we do need to consult and that is what we are doing now 
<br/>to consult our women.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- It is going to take some time to consult because we are looking at 
<br/>several  key  settings  which  includes  traditional  leaders,  our  faith-based  organisations  but  most 
<br/>importantly is talking to our women.  Did you talk to our women during your time?  No, even the 
<br/>data does not reflect that.  We are now talking to our women, we need to listen to our women to 
<br/>inform our decisions and we are putting money where our mouth is, we are putting money through 
<br/>our budget and that is what is happening in this Government; something that has never been done 
<br/>before especially by the previous government.  So, we are very happy to actually commit financially 
<br/>and also the political will to do so, and that is what we are committed to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I thank you.  Our Oral Question time 
<br/>is over, I see 12.38 p.m. on the clock.  We are going to adjourn for lunch and the first bell after lunch 
<br/>will ring at 2.30 p.m.

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you will have noticed yesterday and 
<br/>today that we have had few cohorts of students from the University of the South Pacific and we have 
<br/>another group here with us this afternoon. Welcome to your Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and I 
<br/>hope you will learn a few good lessons from us and from how Parliament works.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, can I raise a Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- What is your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  Standing  Order  74(1)(a)  and  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Any member may only raise a point of order if – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there is an alleged breach of Standing Orders or practices of Parliament.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Earlier this morning, the honourable Leader of the Opposition in raising a question around 
<br/>infrastructure, I think with shipping, he mentioned that the demise of the shipbuilding industry was 
<br/>caused  by  the  SVT  Government.  I  think  he  has  myopia.    The  Qarase  Government  created  the 
<br/>shipbuilding industry and then the FijiFirst Government actually killed it. 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, on public record, can the honourable Leader of the Opposition correct his 
<br/>statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- That’s not a Point of Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It’s a practice, you need to be accurate in Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM  DEPUTY  SPEAKER.-  Can  I  please  have  the  advice  of  the  Madam  Secretary-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank  you  for  your  patience,  honourable  Members.    The  Madam  Secretary-General  has 
<br/>clarified that it is a clarification perhaps that Deputy Prime Minister Kamikamica raised a Point of 
<br/>Order on.
