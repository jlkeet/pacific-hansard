<br/>workings of your Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming another cohort of PL100 students sitting 
<br/>in the public gallery.  Welcome, it is good to see you.  They are Government and Politics Law students 
<br/></span><span>from the University of the South Pacific.  Welcome to your Parliament and I hope the proceedings 
<br/></span><span>this morning will give you a better idea of how your Parliament works.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You might have also noticed some gentlemen in the purple jerseys.   I walked in and I thought 
<br/>they were from the Melbourne Storm.  They are, in fact, members of the Kabara Cricket Team who 
<br/>are with us in the gallery this morning.  </span><span>Ni sa bula vinaka saka</span><span>, </span><span>malo</span><span>, welcome to your Parliament.
