<div><span>REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT  
<br/>2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Local Government Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report 2018-2019 which was tabled on 21st November, 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is designed to deliver across two areas: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government; and 
<br/>Town and Country Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Department of Local Government monitors legislative compliance of municipal councils 
<br/>and oversees the delivery of effective and efficient services and quality infrastructure for the Fijian 
<br/>people at the Local Government level. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Department  of  Town  and  Country  Planning  on  the  other  hand  is  responsible  for  the 
<br/>overall administration, planning and regulating of land use through the Town Planning Act Cap. 139 
<br/>and the Subdivision of Land Act Cap. 140. Its focus is on strategic planning of urban and rural areas, 
<br/>the formulation of related regulations and compliance with development laws. The Department also 
<br/>offers physical planning and land use development advice to the whole of Government as well as to 
<br/>the private sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry during the year under review undertook major capital 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>projects which includes the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The improvement of ventilation and lighting of the Lautoka Market; 
<br/>The continuation of construction works at Laqere Municipal Market and Lautoka Botanical 
<br/>Garden; 
<br/>The swimming pool in Lautoka; 
<br/>The completion of Namaka Market; and 
<br/>The redevelopment of Govind Park in Ba. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry also continues to improve on rezoning applications, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>building approvals and service goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee as part of its findings and recommendations identified the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Ministry produce timely submission of its Annual Reports; 
<br/></span><span>The Committee notes the delay in completion of capital projects and recommends that the 
<br/>Ministry works in consultation with relevant municipal councils in ensuring that products 
<br/>are monitored to ensure timely completion of these capital projects; and 
<br/>The  Committee  noted  that  late  submission  of  proposals  for  Government  funded  capital 
<br/>projects by the municipal councils and recommends that the Ministry work together with 
<br/>the municipal councils on trainings and learning development plans as this will contribute

<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024            Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>407 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the capacity building of municipal staff. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on that note, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the motion. I have a list of speakers as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable R.R. Sharma; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government; 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable P.D. Kumar; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to contribute to the debate on 
<br/>the Review of the Ministry of Local Government Annual Report 2018-2019.  If I highlight one of the 
<br/>recommendations, the Committee is asking for timely submissions of the Ministry’s Annual Report 
<br/>and this is imperative as it calls for the Ministry of Local Government to place priority in getting the 
<br/>accounts of all the municipalities audited and up to-date.  This will provide accurate and up to-date 
<br/>financial information that is necessary for effective decision making.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, one of the things highlighted was one of the projects that has been 
<br/>on the lips of every Fijian in the past few years, the Lautoka Swimming Pool Project. It was the vision 
<br/>under  the  Lautoka  City  Council  to  build  a  swimming  pool  of  international  standards.  Just  as  we 
<br/>witnessed  the  success  of  the  Churchill  Park  being  able  to  host  international  games,  inspire  the 
<br/>younger generation for a career in sports, boost income generation and also boost the confidence of 
<br/>our Fijian enterprises and consumers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  for  a  pool  to  meet  international  standards  and  comply  with 
<br/>Federation Internationale de Natation or International Swimming Federation (FINA) requirements, 
<br/>this was the reason for the construction cost to increase to $12.6 million.  The Lautoka Swimming 
<br/>Pool  concept  was  approved  in  January  2017,  with  construction  beginning  in  2018.    Despite  the 
<br/>delays, and with Fiji witnessing a global pandemic, countries fell, economies fell, about 90 percent 
<br/>of the construction is done.  What has been done is the kids pool, a training pool and an Olympic-
<br/>size pool.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in fact, some of these esteemed politicians harped about the financial 
<br/>mismanagement and waste of taxpayer’s money behind the Lautoka Swimming Pool project, it was 
<br/>part of most people’s election campaign and their social media.  However, in the 2023-2024 National 
<br/>Budget, the Coalition Government sets aside $4.5 million for the completion of the pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Because it was a mess. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- I am coming to your mess.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in a matter of accountability and transparency, I would like to refer 
<br/></span><span>to this media article because I need to provide evidence with everything we say here.  Thank you, 
<br/></span><span>honourable Manoa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, on 12</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024, it says, “One pool may be demolished and the 
<br/>Olympic size pool  will be downsized.”  This  is  an article in  the  </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>.  With reference to  this 
<br/>article, who gives a staggering amount of $4.5 million to demolish and downsize a swimming pool 
<br/>that was 90 percent complete - this Coalition Government.  From this article, it can be referred that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>408 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if there is a change of scope, then there is a need for a project manager.  It would be obvious that a 
<br/>project manager will be required to lead this and the people of Lautoka are talking, “I wonder which 
<br/>one  of  the  Coalition  candidates  or  supporters  will  get  this  job.”    Who  knows,  we  hope  to  see  an 
<br/>Expression  of  Interest  for  the  job  opportunity,  if  there  is  one.    With  reference  to  this  article,  if  I 
<br/>generalise this,  instead of completing and filling water into the swimming  pool,  it seems  that the 
<br/>Coalition Government has allocated $4.5 million to put soil in the pool by downsizing it for domestic 
<br/>use only.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this is disastrous for our economy and the youths of the country who 
<br/>seem to have a career in sports.  In the last 16 months, after the $122 million turbine deal blunder, 
<br/>this is another rumoured disaster, one of the many.  This is the level of wastage of taxpayers’ money 
<br/>under the Coalition Government just within 16 months.  God forbid, can imagine 16 years of running 
<br/>a  country.    I  urge  the  honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government  to  ask  serious  questions  to  the 
<br/>Lautoka City Council.  With reference to this media article, with $4.5 million to downsize a pool 
<br/>shows the lack of vision of the Coalition Government, the lack of understanding for the need of such 
<br/>an infrastructure to boost the career in sports for our youths.  This is the level of wastage and is of no 
<br/>surprise under the honourable Minister for Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, to conclude, poor accountability and poor transparency seems to be 
<br/>a continued practice under the Coalition Government.  As the responsible honourable Minister for 
<br/>Finance,  in  fact,  I  have  grown  up  watching  Parliament  sessions,  he  was  a  person  who  stood  in 
<br/>Parliament and spoke about economic policies.  He preached and lectured about economic policies, 
<br/>but I urge the honourable Minister for Finance to get out of his economic books and deal with the 
<br/>practicality of running Fiji’s economy.  Again, I urge the honourable Prime Minister to conduct a 
<br/>surprise  reshuffle  very  soon.    This  is  disastrous  under  this  Government.    I  fully  support  the 
<br/>recommendations made by the Committee and I call upon the Ministry of Local Government to take 
<br/>necessary steps to implement that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion that is 
<br/>before Parliament.  After listening to the presentation by honourable Sharma this afternoon, he raised 
<br/>a point that he was trying to justify some of the wrongdoings and mismanagement of only one capital 
<br/>project which is the Lautoka Swimming Pool.  But the report itself talks about four key findings of 
<br/>the report and he should have focused more on those findings rather than focusing on a project that 
<br/>was disastrous in terms of the former Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government 
<br/>acknowledges the key findings and recommendations of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs 
<br/>and I thank them for their thorough review and practical recommendations. There were key issues 
<br/>that were identified by the Committee and if you analyse all these key findings, these are all legacy 
<br/>issues and all governance-related issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Madam Deputy Speaker, is the timely submission of the Ministry’s Annual Report.  
<br/>This issue has been a recurring matter, not only in the Ministry but also with all Municipal Councils 
<br/></span><span>in Fiji, but we have managed to address this legacy issue.  As  of now, the Office of the Auditor-
<br/></span><span>General has completed audits of the Ministry’s financials for four financial years, that is, 2019, 2020, 
<br/>2022 and 2023.  The Ministry is finalising the narrative of the Annual Reports, and we shall complete 
<br/>and table all these Reports in Cabinet and Parliament before the end of 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Madam Deputy Speaker, is for the Ministry to review relevant legislations as this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will impact the work of the Ministry.   The Ministry has commenced groundwork on the review of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024            Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>409 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>relevant legislation that govern the whole Ministry.  These are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Town and Country Planning Act 1946; 
<br/>Subdivision of Land Act 1937; and 
<br/>Local Government Act 1972. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, Madam Deputy Speaker, we have reviewed the Local Government Act in terms of 
<br/>reducing the default interest rates on the accrued general rates from 11 percent to 5 percent.  It also 
<br/>changed the methodology from compound interest rate to simple interest rate.  This is, indeed, a great 
<br/>relief for defaulting ratepayers who have difficulty in repaying their current dues, as well as their 
<br/>arrears.    In  addition,  the  said  Act  has  been  amended  to  include  the  necessary  changes  for  the 
<br/>upcoming Local Government elections.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, work is also underway for the review and amendment of the Town 
<br/>Planning Act to reflect the proposed changes that have been undertaken.  Furthermore, there will be 
<br/>further amendments that will be done to reflect the digitalisation of the building permit applications 
<br/>and approvals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very important issue that was highlighted by the Committee is the timely monitoring and 
<br/>completion of capital projects for all Municipal Councils.  Madam Deputy Speaker, weak project 
<br/>monitoring policies and supervision in the that past years have contributed to poor supervision and 
<br/>monitoring of some key Municipal Council projects, like the Lautoka Swimming Pool, the Govind 
<br/>Park in Ba and we have one in Suva, the Ratu Sukuna Park.  That is why there is a need to bring back 
<br/>the Local Government elections. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  We  need  to  have  Local  Government  elections.    We  need 
<br/>councillors, we need people who are going to take full responsibility and accountability in managing 
<br/>the affairs of respective councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry has also provided a Project Management Policy, with 
<br/>monitoring  and  reporting  templates  to  guide  the  Municipal  Councils.    The  Councils,  as  of  this 
<br/>financial year, have been providing detailed project management templates for the release of grants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils manage capital projects in accordance with the Local Government Act 1972, 
<br/></span><span>the  Procurement  Regulation  2010  and  other  enabling  legislations.    In  addition,  Madam  Deputy 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, the Ministry monitors projects through regular site visits, project meetings and respective 
<br/>project teams.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A very important issue that was identified is for the Ministry to work with Municipal Councils 
<br/>on  training  and  learning  development  plans  as  this  will  contribute  to  the  capacity  building  of 
<br/>Municipal staff.  This is something that we take very seriously and the Ministry, in collaboration with 
<br/>the Office of the Auditor-General, recently conducted training on audit processes, financial reporting, 
<br/>internal controls and key accounting areas for all Special Administrators, Chief Executive Officers, 
<br/></span><span>Finance Managers, as well as Accountants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  has  provided  training  on  both,  Finance  and  Human 
<br/>Resource Manuals to CEOs and Finance and Human Resources Teams. Furthermore, the Councils 
<br/>further underwent training by the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) on Masterplan for 
<br/></span><span>Solid Waste Management for 30 Municipalities as part of the Japanese Technical Cooperation Project 
<br/></span><span>for promotion of regional initiative on solid waste management.  In addition to the above, the Ministry 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>410 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will work with Councils collectively to look at the standard training and development policy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee has also highlighted the need for Municipal Councils 
<br/>to complete the two major capital projects - the Lautoka Swimming Pool and Govind Park in Ba.  
<br/>The Coalition Government is committed to complete these capital projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Lautoka  City  Council  has  recalled  the  tender  to  engage  the  lead  consultant  who  will 
<br/>oversee the project management and construction works.  Upon finalisation of this process, the tender 
<br/>for the contractor will be published.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was also a comment by honourable Sharma regarding the demolition of the swimming 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pool. I do not know where he got his information from and that needs to be verified…  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- The </span><span>Fiji Sun</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- … but it is something that the Council is going to review.  There 
<br/>will be a change in the scoping of the whole project.  We are going to rescope the project before we 
<br/>finalise all the details about the Lautoka Swimming Pool.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, for the Govind Park Project, honourable Bala is very keen about this because he started 
<br/>the project and has completed the first phase.  The tender for the contractor to undertake civil works 
<br/>of  phase  two  of  the  project  was  advertised  last  December  by  the  Fiji  Procurement  Office.  So, 
<br/>currently,  evaluation  is  in  the  process  and  hopefully,  tender  should  be  finalised  soon.    We  also 
<br/>expected the construction work to begin before the end of this financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you, once again, for this opportunity to speak on this motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in Parliament and I fully support the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion that is before 
<br/>Parliament, and I take this opportunity to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the 
<br/>comprehensive Review Report on the Ministry of Local Government for the fiscal year 2018-2019.  
<br/>I also would like to thank speakers who have contributed to the debate before me, particularly our 
<br/>Minister for Local Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry of Local Government plays a pivotal role in delivering 
<br/>range of vital services or essential services for individuals and businesses, and it is done through 13 
<br/>Municipal Councils, as well as the National Fire Authority. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Local Government’s importance in the economy is well understood.  That is 
<br/>where the business takes place.  It is a centre where people play, they live, they shop and they conduct 
<br/>their business. And if anything, Local Government is the hub where people come together to conduct 
<br/>various activities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in 2018-2019 fiscal year, it was marked as notable achievements for 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  Local  Government.    Highlights  include  the  completion  of  Namaka  Market,  the 
<br/></span><span>opening of new National Fire Authority building in Rakiraki, the completion of Rakiraki and Laqere 
<br/></span><span>Markets, the construction of a new modern toilet facility in Korovou Town and, of course, the iconic 
<br/>playground that we have just before our Parliament which is the Albert Park. All these work was 
<br/>completed during that year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During that year, the work on the construction of the Lautoka Swimming Pool and Govind 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Park continued.  It signified that FijiFirst Government’s commitment to enhancing community 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024            Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>411 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure was always there, and it continued with the development projects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I mentioned so many projects that this Government completed and 
<br/>my list can go on, like Levuka Market, Savusavu Market is under construction, Ratu Sukuna Park 
<br/>Project which is also under construction.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, out of all these projects, we have problems with only two projects 
<br/>which is Lautoka Swimming Pool and the Govind Park.  Actually, there is no problem there, but the 
<br/>key problem was with the Lautoka Swimming Pool.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  we  hear,  like  the  honourable  Minister  has  said,  there  is  mismanagement  and 
<br/>wrongdoing. If there is mismanagement and wrongdoing, I challenge the Government - you conduct 
<br/>your investigation, you produce the report, you file the complaints with FICAC. Just do not come 
<br/>and say things here. You need to understand the root cause of the problem.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, when we build our own house, we go through so many difficulties 
<br/>with the contractor. Sometimes, the contractors run away with our money and sometimes the builders 
<br/>do not pay the contractor. Now, similar situation was faced with the Lautoka Swimming Pool where 
<br/>there was a dispute between the contractors and the Lautoka City Council.  The dispute was there, 
<br/>and the dispute had to be solved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must say, there was a vision for Lautoka Swimming Pool. The vision was to fit into Lautoka 
<br/>City Council’s vision which was to make Lautoka City a sports city. At that time, there were students 
<br/>from Australia and New Zealand who were used to come and play sports in Lautoka and for that 
<br/>reason, the mission, vision and the thinking was to develop Lautoka City as a sports city.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Everything  was  working  in  that  direction.    Initially,  the  plan  was  to  build  a  community 
<br/>swimming pool and then it was changed to an aquatic centre – Olympic international standard.  Of 
<br/>course, the cost will go up.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the cost did go up so now, when the dispute did arise, it was decided 
<br/>that the Ministry of Local Government and Lautoka City Council should not be involved because it 
<br/>was Government  funding and, therefore, Construction Implementation  Unit  (CIU) stepped in  and 
<br/>they conducted a peer review, in consultation with the stakeholders, and a report came out.  The idea 
<br/>of that report was to solve the issue that was before us.  But then  the Election took place and, of 
<br/>course, it is history now and we expect the Government side to complete the project.  So, that is the 
<br/>story on the Lautoka Swimming Pool, Madam Deputy Speaker.  It is very important that we complete 
<br/>that  project  in  the  way  it  was  designed  because  we  can  already  see  the  benefits  accruing  from 
<br/>Churchill Park when rugby games are held there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  why  should  we  deny  the  people  of  Lautoka  from  having  this 
<br/>competition in Lautoka?  Whenever there is a competition, why should everyone come to Suva?  It 
<br/>is decentralising the activities in two cities.  That was the whole plan, so we had that vision. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I also want to highlight that if they are really going to downsize the 
<br/></span><span>project, then obviously it is not going to fit into the vision of Lautoka City Council.  Therefore, I urge 
<br/></span><span>the ratepayers to step in and they should ensure that this project is completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But Madam Deputy Speaker, it appears that this Government is actually anti-development.  
<br/>That  is  why only  20 percent  of the National  Budget  went  to  its capital  works and 80 percent  for 
<br/>operational, so that they can travel overseas more frequently, for excursion trips, et cetera.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With FijiFirst Government, Madam Deputy Speaker, we had 60 percent of our budget that 
<br/>was used for operational, whereas 40 percent went towards capital works.  That is why today when 
<br/>you go to Rakiraki, you see this nice market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- You go to Levuka, you will see a nice market there and that is how we 
<br/>grow the economy.  We provide a place for small businesses to come to this place and they conduct 
<br/>their business.  Along with that, we also provided accommodation for women. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  honourable  Minister  can  speak  about  the  problems  that 
<br/>Municipal Councils had previously and I can assure you after your four year term, you will find that 
<br/>the problems still persist.  I can guarantee you that because there are lot of challenges when it comes 
<br/>to planning, execution and monitoring of projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the FijiFirst  Government, we had  established CIU.  The  work of the CIU was to  be 
<br/>responsible for public projects funded by the Government and it was actually to centralise all the 
<br/>expertise in one place for better standards, better designs and for the better outcome.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, the Government has disbanded CIU.  What does that mean?  It simply means 
<br/>that each and every Ministry, like the Ministry of Local Government, need to have that expertise, so 
<br/>additional cost to the Ministry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- It was a complete disaster. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- All that is now required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members,  we are also eating into honourable Kumar’s speaking time.  Thank 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you for your respect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  future  vision  of  consolidating 
<br/>Government funded projects under CIU’s purview,  from inception to handover, mirrors well with 
<br/>international best practices observed in countries like UK, Australia and many other countries. For 
<br/>example,  in  the  UK,  they  have  Infrastructure  and  Projects  Authority.    In  Australia,  they  have 
<br/>Infrastructure Australia.  So, what do we see in Fiji?  We are just going backwards with our projects.  
<br/>For example, we can see the Government’s reluctance to embrace forward thinking strategies and 
<br/>that hampers progress and undermines the potential for impactful change.  This Government is stuck 
<br/>in the past, it lacks innovation in service delivering across Government and now we will see it in 
<br/>Local Government as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Can I just, please, remind honourable  Members  that my 
<br/>title is “Deputy Speaker”.  Mr. Speaker, is actually watching this, I do not want to get demoted this 
<br/>afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>contribute to the Review of the Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, Madam Deputy Speaker, I am intrigued with the preoccupation of the other side of 
<br/>Parliament with the swimming pool because the fact of the matter is,  they have made a mess of that 
<br/>project.  This is the real fact.  When they selected the contractor to do that project, that person was 
<br/>not qualified to build that swimming pool. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are lying.  You are misleading Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- There is only one contractor in Fiji  that is actually qualified 
<br/>to do it.  I heard that from the person who is  actually the qualified contractor. So, from the word 
<br/>‘go’… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are misleading.  You should be ashamed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- …they  actually  selected the wrong contractor.   They are 
<br/>talking about this and that but, in fact, I heard that the swimming pool was not even to the correct 
<br/>measurement.  It was short by about 10 centimetres or something. It was short, and that is why the 
<br/>rectification is taking place.  So, stop meandering around and saying this and that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- You are misleading. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The real story is, you mucked up.  And it reminds me of my 
<br/>analogy, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the Nabukalou Creek.  The tide goes out, what do you see? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The mess, that is, the people on the other side of Parliament  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have created.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, allow me to contribute in terms of the spirit of the Report.  The first 
<br/>thing that caught my attention was the second paragraph in the background that states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The  Department  of  Local  Government  monitors  legislative  compliance  of  the 
<br/>the  delivery  or  efficient  services,  quality 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal  Councils  and  oversees 
<br/>construction….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, the honourable Assistant of Finance talked about the lack of governance in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Municipalities, Madam Deputy Speaker. What he actually said troubled me, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In  fact,  what  was  clear  that  the  Municipal  Council  and  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/>Government  were  not  serious  with  the  PAC  recommendations  after  it  was  raised 
<br/>numerous occasions in Parliament for them to address those recurring audit issues.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the other side of Parliament are standing on a broken ship. They had 
<br/></span><span>actually been mismanaging Local Government for so many years.  It has gone into a stage where 
<br/></span><span>they are actually using Government funds to subsidise Local Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last four years, for the record year, the Budget was about $85 million and I can bet my 
<br/>last dollar on this, Madam Deputy Speaker, had they been running local Councils that were actually 
<br/>elected Councils and had proper governance and procedures, we probably would not be spending this 
<br/>kind of money on Local Government.

<div><span>Review Report-Ministry of Local Government 2018-2019 Annual Report  16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sad to say to the other side of Parliament when you look at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government, remember Nabukalou Creek. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, just to round off, I thought I just talk a bit about some of the positive 
<br/>things that this side of Parliament is doing. One of the areas of oversight by the honourable Minister 
<br/>is the Department of Town and Country Planning.  I would like to address specifically the Ease of 
<br/>Doing Business.  We know for a fact that investment in this country has been held back significantly 
<br/>because of the inefficiencies in the Department of Town and Country Planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Over the last few years, started by the previous government, but we are going to finish it, we 
<br/>are embarking  on an actual process  of automation that will transform the approval process  in  the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government.  Right now, you actually have to make three copies of all your project 
<br/>documentations, hand it over to the Local Government and it gets distributed amongst all the agencies 
<br/>of Government, and lots of the time the excuse is, it is lost, we cannot find it.  By next year, we will 
<br/>actually have an automated system in place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- We started bizFIJI.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  A document gets submitted once and it actually gets sorted 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>out.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  contrary  to  what  honourable  Premila  Kumar  is  saying,  we  are 
<br/>forward looking.  We are committed to actually bring about genuine Ease of Doing Business in this 
<br/>country  and  we  are  working  very  closely  with  the  honourable  Minister  for  Local  Government  to 
<br/>ensure that what is normally in some cases, a three-year process… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>… is contracted to about 12 months to 18 months.  If we can achieve that, there will be a 
<br/>ripple effect on the economic growth in this country.  Finally, if the country wants to ask, “Why is 
<br/>the Ministry for Local Government in such shambles?”  It is very simple, they decided to remove the 
<br/>election of the Councils.  They removed a fundamental aspect of democracy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- They are learning democracy now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  This  is  a  learning  for  them.    When  you  empower  your 
<br/>people, they  will deliver for you.   In this case, if you will look  at  what  the honourable Assistant 
<br/>Minister had said, I will read this out so that the people of Fiji can hear it.  This is about delayed 
<br/>financial statements: Nadi - 2017; Sigatoka - 2020; Tavua - 2016; Rakiraki -2020 and 2021; Levuka 
<br/>- 2014 and 2015; Labasa - 2018; Lami - 2015; Nausori - 2015; Savusavu - 2011 and Nasinu - 2011 
<br/>and 2012.  It is a mess.  Nabukalou Creek.  This is what they have given to the people of Fiji, and 
<br/>this side of Parliament will fix it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament.  I have 
<br/>no further comments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
