<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>which was tabled on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> November, 2023.

<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Public Rental Board (PRB) was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>established on 16</span><span>th</span><span> May, 1989 under the Housing (Amendment) Decree No. 12 of 1989.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the past 33 years, the PRB has provided affordable rental accommodation to low-income 
<br/>earners on transitional basis, and is committed to achieving its organisational roles, together with its 
<br/>social obligations, such as to reduce squatter settlements and promote healthy living.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Committee  also  highlighted  a  few  findings  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  PRB  facilities  are  accessibility  to  persons  with  disabilities  and  recommends  that  it 
<br/>develops more rental facilities that are accessible to people living with disabilities. 
<br/>The PRB’s lack of funding to finance proposed housing estates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee recommends that it considers partnership with investors and stakeholders in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>financing proposed housing estates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate  We 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will start from the Opposition, as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. J.N. Nand; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hon. A.N. Tuicolo; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the Public Rental Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2020 Annual Report that is before Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  of  all,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the  Public  Rental  Board  (PRB)  for  their 
<br/>commendable  work  as  detailed  in  the  2020  Annual  Report.    This  Report  sets  light  on  both  the 
<br/>achievements in providing affordable housing for low-income Fijians and the ongoing  challenges 
<br/>they face. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB’s mission is clear and critical and, that is, ensuring Fijians 
<br/>have  access  to  safe  and  affordable  housing.    Their  success  is  undeniable.    Over  1,600  families, 
<br/>translating to thousands of Fijians, can build their lives with the security of a decent roof over their 
<br/>heads.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The dedication extends purely in the construction evidenced by upgrades made to existing 
<br/>estates in places, like Kalabu and Kia Street.  These improvements demonstrate a clear understanding 
<br/>of the importance of the comfortable living conditions for tenants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  recently  completed  flats  in  Lautoka,  though  delayed  by 
<br/>unforeseen  COVID-19  challenges,  signifies  the  PRB’s  commitment  in  expanding  services  in  the 
<br/>Western Division.  This has provided the much needed housing options promised in Lautoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  finance  responsibility  is  crucial  for  any  organisation  and  PRB’s 
<br/>commitment to this is evident in their extending and consistent operational profits. This  financial 
<br/>strength ensures the organisation can manage resources effectively and maintain long sustainability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the PRB prioritises accessibility by ensuring all their flats are constructed to be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>accessible for persons with disabilities, fostering a truly inclusive living environment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the demand for affordable housing continues to what we supply.  
<br/>We must acknowledge and address these key challenges head-on.  Facilitating home ownership for 
<br/>tenants is a key concern. While affordable rent is crucial, we also want to empower tenants to achieve 
<br/>their dream of owning a home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>423 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  acknowledges  the  low-average  of  only  five  tenants  transitioning  to  home 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ownership per year.  We need to explore ways to improve this further. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, securing funding for new projects remains a significant obstacle. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The PRB requires a steady stream of resources to keep up with Fiji’s growing housing needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report mentions a lack of available land as a major hindrance, especially in urban centres. 
<br/>Creative  solutions  are  needed  to  maximise  land  usage  while  maintaining  affordability.  Rising 
<br/>construction cost due to material and labour further complicate things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB is also exploring the development of residential housing 
<br/>and even commercial ventures. This diversification could generate a sustainable source of income to 
<br/>support  future  affordable  housing  projects.    However,  the  Report  rightly  emphasises  the  need  to 
<br/>balance affordability for tenants with any diversification effects. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The 2020 PRB Annual  Report showcases a remarkable organisation. The achievements in 
<br/>providing affordable housing are commendable, and a commitment to innovative solution paves way 
<br/>for a brighter future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  by  acknowledging  the  challenges  and  working  together,  the 
<br/>Government, private sector and the Fijian people as a whole, we can ensure every Fijian family have 
<br/>access to secure and affordable home.  We must seek further details on PRB’s plans for a long term 
<br/>financial sustainability on the rent to own specific schemes and the impact on affordability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the PRB in their mission. Together, we can create a future 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>where affordable housing is not just a dream but a reality for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, I fully support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to contribute to the motion and 
<br/>commend the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on the review of the Public Rental 
<br/>Board 2020 Annual Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  review  of  the  Public  Rental  Board  2020  Annual  Report 
<br/>commended PRB with achievements in providing affordable housing and outlined recommendations 
<br/>to  enhance  its  operations,  promote  inclusivity  and  address  challenges  in  the  housing  sector.    The 
<br/>Report  underscores  the  importance  of  sustainable  development,  financial  prudence  and  social 
<br/>responsibility and PRB’s mandate to serve the community effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB plays a crucial role in providing affordable, quality and 
<br/>appropriate housing flats to low income earning customers since its establishment.  The PRB provides 
<br/>options for those who may otherwise struggle to find affordable housing. The key contribution not 
<br/>only addresses an immediate need for shelter but also alleviate poverty and inequality in our society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, PRB provides a total of 1,673 rental flats throughout its 21 estates 
<br/></span><span>across Fiji. With 11 estates, it has a total of 1,037 rental flats in the Central Division, six estates with 
<br/></span><span>a total of 432 rental flats in the Western Division, and four estates with the Northern Division with a 
<br/>total of 204 rental flats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is very interesting to note, Madam Deputy Speaker, that from the above data, a total of 257 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tenants out of 1,673 tenants, or equivalent to 15 percent, have been renting for more than 20 years. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>424 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, graduating from public rental to home ownership is a significant 
<br/>milestone  for  individuals  and  families.  It  requires  careful  planning,  financial  discipline  and 
<br/>perseverance.  In the past five years, a total of only 42 families have graduated from public rental 
<br/>and have achieved their dream of owning a home.  The rate of people graduating from renting to 
<br/>home ownership is really low and it is a big challenge for the Board to address this issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, graduation to home ownership will now be complemented with the 
<br/>formulation of a rent to own scheme that will transition tenants from renting to owning their homes. 
<br/>This  scheme  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  tenants  who  may  not  have  the  financial  means  to 
<br/>purchase a home outright.  The Ministry together with the Public Rental Board (PRB) are currently 
<br/>working on this policy and hopefully it should be completed before the end of this financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Madam Deputy Speaker, the PRB tenants have been offered financial literacy 
<br/>and home ownership programme to provide them a pathway in understanding the process of owning 
<br/>a home.  It is imperative that PRB estates are inclusive of people living with disability, therefore the 
<br/>Board will ensure that accessibility audits be carried out on the existing estates to identify areas that 
<br/>may require retrofitting to improve access for tenants living with disabilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Board will also ensure that any future development projects will 
<br/>have disability friendly features such as ramps, handles and accessible bathrooms to allow people 
<br/>living with disability easy access within and around their units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, while we promote inclusivity in rental housing, demands for rental 
<br/>unit also increases.  It is very interesting to note that the Board’s waiting list as of the year 2020 was 
<br/>152.    The  Board  has  been  receiving  applications  to-date,  the  number  of  waiting  applicants  has 
<br/>increased  to  200.    It  indicates  the  demand  that  exist,  hence  the  need  to  provide  more  affordable 
<br/>housing units. To address this issue, the PRB will be completing the Lagilagi Low Cost Housing 
<br/>Project that will produce 36 units. This will be internally funded by the Board and have also pursued 
<br/>development sites at Namelimeli in Navua, Matavolivoli in Nadi and Waitovu in Levuka, which is 
<br/>estimated to provide a total of 157 units. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Government  provides  grants  to  PRB  for  rental  subsidies 
<br/>allocated  by  the  Board  to  tenants  based  on  the  tenant’s  weekly  gross  income.    To  receive  rental 
<br/>subsidy, a household should earn an annual income of less than $13,000 or a weekly gross income 
<br/>of $250 or less.  For the year under review, the Board’s recent allocation of $1.36 million for rental 
<br/>subsidy for a total of more than 1,000 families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you once again for allowing me to contribute to the Review 
<br/>of the Public Rental Board and I also wish to thank the staff and management of PRB for all their 
<br/>hard work and contributions to-date.  I fully support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to make a short contribution to the 
<br/>motion moved by the honourable Bainivalu, the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/>Affairs on the Review of the Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report.  I would also like to take this 
<br/>opportunity to thank the Chairperson and honourable Members of the Standing Committee on Social 
<br/></span><span>Affairs  in  formulating  this  review.    I  commend  the  Public  Rental  Board  for  the  work  they  do  in 
<br/></span><span>ensuring  Sustainable  Development  Goal  11  targets  are  being  met  in  ensuring  access  for  all  to 
<br/>adequate, safe and affordable housing units and basic services which also contributes to reducing 
<br/>population in informal or squatter settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I noted that the Committee through its deliberation, formulated three 
<br/>key findings and one of the findings was the slow graduating of rental tenants to owning homes which 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="55">Page 55</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>425 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is an average of five every year.  Promoting migration to home ownership is one of the Public Rental 
<br/>Board’s  missions  which  ensures  that  it  achieves  its  vision  which  is  to  be  the  leading  provider  of 
<br/>affordable, quality and appropriate rental housing for its tenants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, many have their own reasons when applying for rental flats from 
<br/>the Public Rental Board.  I was one of the pioneer tenants at the new Raiwai PRB Flats.  Most of us 
<br/>were residing out of Suva and our only need was finding a dwelling that was decent, convenient, safe 
<br/>and  affordable  and  that  it  would  accommodate  us  whilst  working  or  attending  a  high  education 
<br/>institution in Suva.  For five years, the rented flat was home to our family and the option of migrating 
<br/>to  home  ownership  was  not  a  priority.    Our  priority  was  securing  a  decent  and  affordable 
<br/>accommodation to house our family whilst working and studying in Suva.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker, most of the current  PRB tenants  at  the Raiwai PRB Flats would 
<br/>have similar reasons for renting in this particular property, which I believe could be a contributing 
<br/>factor to the slow movement of graduating tenants from rental to home ownership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second key finding  was that the PRB’s facilities are accessible to  persons living with 
<br/>disabilities.  I understand that the new Raiwai PRB property accommodates a few elderly tenants and 
<br/>tenants  currently  living  with  disabilities.    With  the  existing  building  plan,  PRB  should  consider 
<br/>modifying the access to these bottom flats so that it can be disability friendly.  With the Committee’s 
<br/>recommendation, PRB should consider when developing housing that will enhance community living 
<br/>and is disability friendly in future projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  also  noted  that  the  Committee  recommends  a  partnership  with 
<br/>investors and stakeholders in financing proposed PRB Housing Estates.  Securing the funding will 
<br/>not only provide additional rented flats but it will also fulfil its social and economic obligations and 
<br/>that is to reduce squatter settlements, promote healthy living and house urban workforce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish to highlight a few ongoing issues raised by tenants in some 
<br/>of the RPB Estates which is the low water pressure experienced by tenants residing on the top flats, 
<br/>noise  becoming  a  major  concern  to  tenants  due  to  children  left  unsupervised,  </span><span>kava</span><span>  and  liquor 
<br/>consumption  within  the  premises  and  inconsiderate  attitudes  of  individuals  who  indulge  in  such 
<br/>activities and the delay in maintenance of flats that are currently occupied by tenants. These problems 
<br/>have been brought to my attention which I believe PRB must look into these issues and must rectify 
<br/>the problem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  conclusion  the  growing  demand  and  high  number  of  wait  list 
<br/>clearly shows that there is a market and that PRB and the Government must seriously consider ways 
<br/>to address the shortage of rented flats that would generate more income.  I support the motion before 
<br/>Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not intend to keep us here until 
<br/>before 4.30 p.m. May I just, perhaps add to the contributions in Parliament this afternoon that from 
<br/>2018 to 2024 the figures from the Ministry of Finance would suggest that in throughout all those 
<br/>years,  just  below  $7.5  million  had  been  allocated  in  terms  of  operating  and  capital  grant  by 
<br/></span><span>Government  to  PRB  to  sustain  the  operations  of  providing  accessible  and  affordable  housing  to 
<br/></span><span>Fijians where the 20 estates are allocated all throughout Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would also like to commend the work that had been put thus far by the management and the 
<br/>staff of PRB, in addition to their Report that we have this afternoon. There is also to be noted, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker, that the management of PRB has gone to great lengths to strengthen mechanisms 
<br/>of governance and to ensure that their Annual Reports are updated and tabled before us, before the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="56">Page 56</a></div>
<div><span>426 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>completion date that is required.  The Annual Report for 2021 have also been completed while the 
<br/>2022  Annual  Report  have  been  approved  by  the  Board  in  preparation  for  publishing.    So,  this 
<br/>organisation you will see has a very good measure of efficacy in their operation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I want to commend the work that has been put into the operations 
<br/>of PRB thus far by the CEO or the Head of PRB, Mr. Timoci Naleba and his management staff, and 
<br/>in the thought of diversifying the products from PRB, from just rental housing to actual ownership 
<br/>of residential housing, as well as some commercial development which is in line with the Ministry 
<br/>of Housing’s proposal to provide for the rent to own housing opportunities. So far, the Ministry of 
<br/>Lands has issued a total of 79 leases for the development of affordable housing for low- and middle-
<br/>income earners:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Rental Board - 14  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division – 2; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Central/Eastern Division – 10; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Division – 2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The People’s Community Network (PCN) of course, we all know of the story in the Central 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Division, commonly known as the Lagilagi Housing;  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Authority - 57  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division - 4;  
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Central/Eastern Division – 35; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Division – 18. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Housing Assistance and Relief Trust – 7 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Northern Division – 1; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Central/Eastern Division – 5; and 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Western Division – 1. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> These various sites where Housing and PRB are situated includes the Narere Barracks in 
<br/>Nasinu; Lagilagi Housing in Jittu Flats in Raiwai; Edenville in Turaki and Vesida/Kinoya, just to 
<br/>name are few.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry,  as  the  need  arises,  is  also  able  to  identify  idle  and 
<br/>expired leases in cities and around towns which can now be reserved for the provision of expansion 
<br/>of affordable housing for the low- and middle-income earners to housing institutions such as, PRB 
<br/>and Housing Authority.  Of course, there are some challenges as we all know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is a common challenge and issue which is the identification of low-income earners who 
<br/>are  genuinely  in  need  of  this  Government  initiative  in  the  provision  of  affordable  and  accessible 
<br/>housing.  There are tenants living in these PRB flats or other flats built for low-income earners who 
<br/>have rented their flats, while others are offering them up for sale.  There have been scenarios in which 
<br/>tenants are selling the flats at a very high cost.  With its vision, the Ministry is always willing to assist 
<br/>the PRB in addressing common challenges that may contribute to social issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  another  issue  is  the  issuance  of  development  lease  for  housing 
<br/>purposes.  Some of the long-term leases issued are sometimes being left undeveloped.  When land 
<br/>are left undeveloped, they attract illegal squatting on that land.  Therefore, it is always advisable for 
<br/>agencies, such as PRB to always comply with the conditions of the lease.  Quickly develop, otherwise 
<br/>there will be a lot of challenges years later when you will try to do relocation of illegal occupants.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>427 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  current  reality  of  our  citizens  needing  affordable  housing  is 
<br/>evident in the increasing existence of informal settlements near our cities and towns.  Majority of 
<br/>these prime State lands and if partnership with investors and stakeholders, as proposed in the Report 
<br/>are established to finance proposed housing estates.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Residents  of  these  informal  settlements  can  have  improved  living  conditions  with  the 
<br/>proposed housing estate developed to its maximum potential.  With the aim of providing affordable 
<br/>and accessible housing to our low-income earning bracket, with recreational spaces to curb crimes 
<br/>that  are  committed  by  our  youths  and  children,  providing  security  and  wellbeing  and  backyard 
<br/>gardening spaces, it would be great to witness PRB meet its objective of being the leading provider 
<br/>of affordable, quality and appropriate rental properties for all of its customers. I support the motion 
<br/>that is before Parliament this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank all honourable 
<br/>Members who have contributed to the debate on the motion before Parliament. The Committee had 
<br/>the opportunity to visit the various housing estates last year to examine the capital works that was 
<br/>carried out in this reporting year, and similarly the Committee’s recommendations were derived from 
<br/>what the Committee had seen firsthand from this site visit.  I have no further comments, Madam 
<br/>Deputy Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.

<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I just wish to stand and raise a Point of 
<br/>Order, Standing Order 74 and of course consistent with Standing Order 81 as well on clarification 
<br/>and for the purposes of Standing Order 32 on the record of the  </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.  I need that to be 
<br/>corrected  based  on  the  Point  of  Order  that  was  raised  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister 
<br/>concerning the shipbuilding industry.  It was not FijiFirst that caused the demise of the shipbuilding 
<br/>industry.  It is very mischievous of the honourable Minister to state that, but of course, it is a known 
<br/>fact  that  during  the  SVT  days  the  shipyard  or  the  shipbuilding  industry,  what  was  created  then 
<br/>because it was sold off and that needs to be corrected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I want that to go on record in the </span><span>Daily Hansard </span><span>before it comes out 
<br/>tomorrow morning and that is the Point of Order that I want to raise to clarify that statement of fact.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/>Members.  See you tomorrow morning at 9.30.
