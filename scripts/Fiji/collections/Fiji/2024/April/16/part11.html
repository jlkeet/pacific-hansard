<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Councils.  The Report covers the audit of 13 Financial Statements for 10 Municipalities that include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sigatoka; 
<br/>Tavua; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Nadi; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>Rakiraki;

<br/></span><span>Levuka;

<br/></span><span>10.</span><span> </span><span>Nasinu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Savusavu; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the Audit Report, the Committee noted that there are common audit issues raised across 
<br/>the 10 Town Councils, recurring over the years from 2011 to 2021 financial years.  The common 
<br/>significant matters which were found within these Councils, include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Significant delays in submission of Draft Financial Statements; 
<br/>Non-Compliance with the accounting standards; 
<br/>Limitation of scope due to insufficient supporting documents; 
<br/>Poor records management; 
<br/>Poor asset management; 
<br/>Lack of documentation; 
<br/>Policies and procedures not updated or non-existent; 
<br/>Poor collection and recording of municipal rates; and  
<br/>Absence of proper reconciliation of cash, debtors, VAT, rates and payroll expenses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the above, the Committee also noted some common internal control weaknesses 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that were identified within these Municipalities, and these are related to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Cash and revenue management; 
<br/>Journal voucher documentation and reconciliations; 
<br/>Procurement of goods and services; 
<br/>Payroll control; and 
<br/>Management of assets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, what was clear was that Municipal Councils and the Ministry of Local Government 
<br/>were  not  serious  with  the  Public  Accounts  Committee  recommendations  after  it  was  raised  on 
<br/>numerous occasions in Parliament for them to address those recurring audit issues.  One can look at 
<br/>the latest three Reports (apart from the one we are presenting today) that were tabled in Parliament 
<br/>and debated, and those are the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2013 tabled in May 2019; 
<br/>Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2014-2019 tabled in May 2020; and 
<br/></span><span>Review of the Audit Report of Municipal Councils for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 tabled in 
<br/></span><span>August 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On today’s Report, madam Deputy Speaker, it is important to highlight that modified audit 
<br/>opinions  were  issued  on  six  Financial  Statements  and  Disclaimer  of  Opinion  on  seven  Financial 
<br/>Statements  that were audited, which reflected negatively  on Municipal Councils’ senior staff, the 
<br/>Councils’ respective governing bodies (Councils and Administrators), as well as the Ministry of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>375 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Local Government staff and Ministers. I am not sure who were the Ministers from that period - 2013 
<br/>to 2020.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  as  you  are  aware,  when  one  talks  about  modified  opinion  or 
<br/>qualified  opinion,  it  means  that  the  auditors  were  unable  to  obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit 
<br/>evidence on which to base their opinion.  When a Disclaimer of Opinion is issued, it means that there 
<br/>is  insufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  provided  or  obtained  and  there  are  undetected 
<br/>misstatements which could be both, material and pervasive, on the Financial Statements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from the poor quality of the Financial Statements, timeliness of financial reporting is a 
<br/>major concern that needs to be addressed by those in charge of the governance of Municipal Councils. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, the Committee is not satisfied with the actions taken by Municipal Councils and the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government.  These reflected badly on the Councils’ leadership and the Ministry’s 
<br/>monitoring responsibilities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  these  bad  reports  must  stop  and  apart  from  the  recurring 
<br/>recommendations  put  forward  in  this  Report,  the  Committee  is  making  some  practical 
<br/>recommendations which we wish to put in place now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have briefly shared our intentions with the honourable Minister responsible and the senior 
<br/>staff of the Ministry and all the Councils on the way forward as per our Recommendations No. 12, 
<br/>13,14, and possibly 15, on the audit issues that were continuously raised by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General as well as the Public Accounts Committee over the years.  Those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 12 
<br/>All the Councils, with the help of the Ministry of Local Government, within the next three 
<br/>months  to  submit  an  Action  Plan to  the Committee  and  Parliament  on  the  updating  of  all 
<br/>Financial Accounts and clearance of all unsubstantiated balances, as well as identifying and 
<br/>resolving  all  audit  issues  raised  from  2013  to  2018.  The  Action  Plan  should  include 
<br/>recommendations and implementations of verifications and finally, any recommendation for 
<br/>write-off. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 13 
<br/> Subsequently  within  the  next  6  months,  we  hope  can  be  done  by  January  2025,  after  the 
<br/>submission  of  the  Action  Plan,  as  stated  in  our  recommendation  12,  all  actions  must  be 
<br/>implemented in the 2025 financial period. Hence, the 2024 accounts should be the last that 
<br/>face a delay and/or contain an audit issue that may deem the account modified or qualified. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 14 
<br/>As  with  our  Recommendations  12  and  13,  any write-off  and/or  adjustment  to  the  account 
<br/>balances should follow the approved laws and guidelines and those are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14.1  pursuant to section 34(1)(a) of the Financial Management Act 2004, which provides 
<br/>for the provision for writing off public money, the authority is with the Minister of 
<br/></span><span>Finance  to  inter  alia  write  off  losses  in  respect  of  public  money  and  that  is  after 
<br/></span><span>scrutiny  and  further  checking  whether  we  can  verify  some  of  those  long 
<br/>unsubstantiated credit balances. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14.2  Pursuant to subsection 2, the power to write off losses includes the power to abandon 
<br/>or discontinue the recovery of amounts of revenues, debts and overpayments.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14.3  The Ministry of Local Government with the councils after making their last attempt 
<br/>to clear the outstanding matters, should write to the Ministry of Finance in line with 
<br/>our recommendations 14.1 and 14.2. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>14.4  The Ministry to ensure that the uniform internal controls and measures supposedly to 
<br/>be in place with the councils from 2017-2018 be monitored strictly so that the same 
<br/>timely and quality issues will not be repeated and that is reflected through unqualified 
<br/>audits. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation No. 15 
<br/> Adequate additional Budget must be set aside for the Office of the Auditor-General to bring 
<br/>the audited accounts up to date, especially up to 2024 and also 2025 financial year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  with  the  above  specific  recommendations  as  highlighted,  we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>anticipate that all issues will be cleared in the 2025 account. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation to the Committee Members, who 
<br/>were part of the successful compilation of this bipartisan Report, namely, honourable Sakiusa Tubuna 
<br/>(Deputy Chairperson), honourable Jovesa Vocea, honourable Alvick Maharaj and honourable Hem 
<br/>Chand. I also extend my appreciation to honourable Isikeli Tuiwailevu, honourable Aseri Radrodro, 
<br/>honourable Virendra Lal, honourable Taito Matasawalevu and honourable Vijay Nath, who stood in 
<br/>as Alternate Members, pursuant to Standing Order 115(5). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most importantly, Madam Deputy Speaker, in view of the Committee’s findings, the Standing 
<br/>Committee on Public Accounts recommends that Parliament takes note of the recommendations in 
<br/>this Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, with those few words, I now commend this Report to Parliament.

<br/>2017-2018 on 27</span><span>th</span><span>  March, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, this Report captures the review findings and recommendations of 
<br/>the Committee with respect to the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption (FICAC) Annual 
<br/>Report. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presentation of Reports of Committees 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>377 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Committee noted seven key findings from its review, and these 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are on the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rationale on filing a </span><span>nolle prosequi</span><span> on the matter of certain disposed cases. 
<br/>Involvement of Ministry of Health Officials in corruption-related offences. 
<br/>Selection of communities by FICAC to conduct training sessions on corruption prevention. 
<br/>Effectiveness  of  the  awareness  programme  undertaken  by  the  FICAC  on  selected 
<br/>communities. 
<br/>Education level of the National Anti-Corruption Curriculum taught in Schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>6.</span><span> </span><span>Monitoring  and  Reporting  mechanism  of  FICAC  in  achieving  targets  set  out  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sustainable Development Goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Unclear  terms  derived  on  certain  expenditures  by  the  Commission  as  listed  under  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Financial Statements of its Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, those were some of the key findings that the Committee had noted from 
<br/>its review and I, therefore, would like to highlight some of the recommendations that the Committee 
<br/>agreed upon, and they are as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  recommended  that  the  Commission  provides  timely  submission  of  its 
<br/>annual reports to Parliament. 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the Commission ensures there is a formal SDG compliant 
<br/>component in all future reports. Furthermore, that the annual peer review report be also in 
<br/>the schedule of all future reports. 
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  communities  such  as  Rotuma,  Rabi,  Kioa  and 
<br/>Melanesian communities be also visited annually to conduct such trainings, given that these 
<br/>communities are confirmed recipients of project development funds from the Office of the 
<br/>Prime Minister. 
<br/>The Committee recommends that the training information be translated into all vernacular 
<br/>languages in Fiji, and it not be limited to any.   
<br/>The  Committee  recommends  that  the  anti-corruption  education  be  emphasised  at  all 
<br/>educational levels, from primary to tertiary, and it to be part of the compulsory curriculum. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, those were some of the recommendations that the Committee had 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sought following its review of the FICAC Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In that respect, Madam Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Committee’s 
<br/>Report on the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption Annual Report from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2017 to 
<br/>31</span><span>st</span><span> July, 2018 to this august Parliament and seek the support of all the honourable Members to take note 
<br/>of the recommendations by the Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
