<div><span>REVIEW REPORT- MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY  
<br/>AND POLICING 2018-2019 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Ministry of Defence, National Security and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Policing Annual Report 2018-2019 which was tabled on 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 2023. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I second the motion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, the Report has five recommendations.  You 
<br/>are well versed of this Report yourself and before I gloss through the recommendations, if I may just 
<br/>take this opportunity to wish our peacekeepers all the best especially those serving in the Middle-
<br/>East given what is happening over there, the attack from Iran to Israel, those in the Golan would be 
<br/>somewhere in the middle, those serving in Iraq much more closer to Iran; our prayers are with them 
<br/></span><span>and their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the five recommendations in this Report, we feel that if the Ministry 
<br/>implements will help them in achieving the outcomes that they have.  The fifth recommendation is 
<br/>on the War Memorial, and we are recommending that attempts be made to finish the National War 
<br/>Memorial, I think almost all the names that are there at the War Memorial has some connections to 
<br/>most of the Fijians.  We hope that some money can be allocated in the next financial year to finish 
<br/>off that project. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recommendation on the Search and Rescue Bill is a good one, we are recommending that 
<br/>it be fast-tracked so that  we can have this umbrella where the Search and Rescue Manual  comes 
<br/>under.  It will establish the Fiji Rescue and Coordination Centre.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, there is a recommendation on human trafficking.  We found that there was very little 
<br/>information on human trafficking, both from the Ministry and also from the Fiji Police.  We called 
<br/>both the staff from the Ministry and the Police during our </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session.  We find that very little 
<br/>information is provided in that report on human trafficking, but I think the Ministry and the Police 
<br/>are the two responsible agencies for dealing with human trafficking.  We get reported on by the US 
<br/></span><span>and we are given a rating on human trafficking, we are currently on tier 2.  We are asking that human 
<br/></span><span>trafficking be part of the Report so that it remains at the forefront of policymakers thinking because 
<br/>the people that do it, they go underground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  is  a  recommendation  on  the  Security  Industry  Act  2010  and  the  need  for  it  to  be 
<br/>reviewed as and when required and perhaps put in place the measures to collect the fees.  There is a 
<br/>much outstanding  fee, we understand that those outstanding  fees had  to do with  COVID-19 also.  
<br/>They were allowed to just operate and collect the fees afterwards and perhaps that can be done.  I 
<br/>will leave it there, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I think there are some who would like to speak on 
<br/>those topics.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the list of speakers is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Aliki Bia; 
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration;

<div><span>         Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security  
<br/>and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Ioane Naivalurua; and 
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Lands and Mineral Resources; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise to make my contribution on the Report before  
<br/>Parliament which is the Review of the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Policing Annual 
<br/>Report 2018 - 2019.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At  this  juncture,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Committee  Chairman  and  the  members  of  the 
<br/>Committee for their thorough deliberation and findings on the Report being reviewed.  I wish to dwell 
<br/>on one of the important findings of the Committee and that is the call for a Review of the Security 
<br/>Industry Act.  The Committee clearly highlighted in the Report that there is no mechanism in place 
<br/>to establish the total number of security companies in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Review Report by the Committee noted that they were informed 
<br/>by the Ministry that a draft Cabinet Paper has been prepared to advise Cabinet of the review of the 
<br/>Security  Industry  Act.    It  is  very  critical  and  important  to  fast  track  this  review  of  the  Security 
<br/>Industry Act given the role they play in our communities and neighbourhood.  Given the increase of 
<br/></span><span>social issues  and continuous change of the behavioural  pattern of our young generation, this also 
<br/></span><span>increases the threat our local security officers face on a daily basis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, proper scrutiny of security companies is vital to ensure that they 
<br/>recruit the best people for the job.  If you look at the context of the work of our security officers, they 
<br/>are very close to our homes more than the police officers.  So, families in the communities do entrust 
<br/>their safety and protection of their wealth and assets to the security officers when they are at any job 
<br/>site given on the day. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  support  the  Committee  in  the  call  for  a  review  of  the  Security 
<br/>Industry Act to ensure that security personnel and various security companies are well resourced and 
<br/>equipped  with  the  necessary  tools  of  maintaining  the  safety  and  peace  of  all  Fijians.    With  that, 
<br/>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support the motion and the Report before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  first  of  all  I  thank  you  for  the 
<br/>opportunity to share a few thoughts on the Report of the Committee that is before Parliament right 
<br/>now and a Committee of which you are a member.  As your Chairman had alluded to earlier that you 
<br/>are quite familiar with the recommendations that are here, the five main ones are noted.  Today I 
<br/></span><span>would like to stick to the five recommendations and inform Parliament and the nation in terms of 
<br/></span><span>what the Ministry is doing, particularly about these recommendations that you have put to Parliament.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to thank the Chairman and the Members of the Standing 
<br/>Committee for a very comprehensive Report.  I know that the Report was for 2018 and 2019, but I 
<br/>note  that  some  of  the  recommendations  that  you  have  made  are  quite  pertinent  to  now  and  the 
<br/>experiences that we are facing and the needs that we have. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The first thing that I would like to assure Parliament today is that the Ministry is cognisant of 
<br/>this Report and the recommendations that are within because it is actually quite elaborate, and I thank 
<br/>the Committee for that.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Chairman of the Committee has actually shared much of the information that I would 
<br/>like to inform Parliament, particularly some of the Bills and the legislations that the Committee is 
<br/></span><span>proposing  because  these  are  really  ongoing,  particularly  about  the  search  and  rescue  that  the 
<br/></span><span>Chairman had referred to earlier.  This is very important.  In the last Cabinet, we discussed about the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="47">Page 47</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security  
<br/>and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>417 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disaster Management Policy of Government going forward. It has not come to Parliament yet but it 
<br/>is kind of trying to integrate all of the national effects, allow for all of us to work together and part 
<br/>of  that  also  is  search  and  rescue  on  how  Government  deals  with  the  agencies,  particularly  the 
<br/>Republic of Fiji Navy that does a lot of this work at sea, also and those that have  to go out into inland 
<br/>to do search and rescue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The legislation is surely supposed to complement that search and rescue. We will continue to 
<br/>push for these legislations, particularly the Bill to come before Parliament. I know that the Search 
<br/>and Rescue Manual was launched in 2019 so the Bill is yet to be tabled.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, I want to talk about human trafficking.  The mention of the National Action Plan 
<br/>and  the  National  Referral  Mechanism,  which  is  what  they  are  calling  now,  we  have  a  National 
<br/>Committee that is looking at that chaired by the Ministry.  Obviously, this is a very complex area as 
<br/>the Chairman has  mentioned and the lack of data is  something we recognise, but  that has been a 
<br/>persistent issue, we recognise that and we want to improve on it.  It is the safety of our people, we 
<br/>hear all these sorts of ridiculous stories about people trying to steal our nationals so to speak and take 
<br/>them overseas for reasons of their own.  We are very mindful of that, and we would like to make sure 
<br/></span><span>that we do not continue to repeat the same mistakes but that can only be done by good data. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like talk about the Security Industry Act.  This is also under 
<br/>review at the moment and the honourable Member is quite right in that a lot of people, companies in 
<br/>particular, homes depend on security officers, but we have got to make sure that they are properly 
<br/>legislated and certain laws allow them to be able to do   their work properly and secure their own 
<br/>homes and businesses.  We are understanding of that need, and we would like to respond to it.  The 
<br/>Security Industry Act obviously is something that we are reviewing because it requires the stringent 
<br/>measures that we need to put in place to be able to ensure the companies that we register, and they 
<br/>are coming by the dozens are effective and value for money for Fiji.  They are actually there for the 
<br/>purpose of which people have sought their services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fourth recommendation refers to vacancies within the Ministry.  A lot of that has been 
<br/>filled for the benefit of the Committee.  We are experiencing a very high turnover especially at the 
<br/>Department  of  Immigration  and  it  is  very  hard  to  keep  these  people  here  because  they  are  very 
<br/>attractive on the market, so we need to continually look at this as well, especially now that we have 
<br/>the Department of Immigration in our care, subject to a lot of debate right now as well as the Ministry 
<br/>too.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  commencing  the  National  Security  and  Defence  Review,  so  we  are  reviewing  the 
<br/>whole Ministry.  Really this is the central of the work that we want to do.  Once the head is fixed 
<br/>then  I  am  sure,  the  three  major  functions  under  Ministry;  the  RFMF,  Fiji  Police  Force  and  the 
<br/>Immigration  that  have  their  own  legislations  and  laws  should  be  able  to  align  with  the  national 
<br/>policies that the values that we want to uphold.  That really is the essence of a lot of the work that we 
<br/>do, and this report is about that.  I would like to assure Parliament and the Committee for bringing 
<br/>this Report that we are trying as much as we can to, not only fill these vacancies, but make sure that 
<br/>we are staffed and equipped properly to do the work that we are mandated to do. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last but not least, on the matter of the War Memorial that is in the work that we want to do 
<br/>next  year,  we  are  doing  some  of  the  maintenance  work  right  now  but  those  additions  that  the 
<br/>Committee has alluded to, one particular one is the National War Museum. I think the building is 
<br/>there and that is one of the major recommendations.  We are allocating money for that. I know there 
<br/></span><span>is a lot of RFMF and military historians that want to capture the stories of our experiences in the past.  
<br/></span><span>Unfortunately, there is no place where this is stored and we would like to make that available to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security  
<br/>and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>public  to  understand  the  sacrifices  that  our  ancestors  made  for  us  to  be  able  to  be  here  today, 
<br/>particularly technically providing for us the peace that we enjoy.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also very important to remember the past, so part of this work that  we are doing and 
<br/>hopefully something that we are putting up to Ministry of Finance in this next year’s budget is to 
<br/>help us build the National War Museum. So former Commanding Officers of the First Battalion and 
<br/>Second Battalion, I know the First Commanding Officer of the Second Battalion is very eager to 
<br/>capture  the  lessons  from  Sinai  from  when  it  started.  We  are  working  hard  plus  all  of  the  other 
<br/>requirements in trying to make the National War Memorial a place that we can all go to and honour 
<br/>the memory of those that had served their lives for our future and also for our today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, my contribution to the motion on the 
<br/>floor  will  be  very  short,  especially  after  the  presentation  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Home 
<br/>Affairs.  His made my work much easier and shorter. Let me take this time to simply say that human 
<br/>trafficking is here. It is happening here at home not only locally but also abroad. That is the reality 
<br/>of the situation. If it is not addressed, confronted, or effectively taken care of, it can be the same as 
<br/>what we are confronted with right now with drugs. We had talked about many substantives and very 
<br/></span><span>important issues relating to our economy, prosperity and the future, but you know and I know that 
<br/></span><span>all these things can only come about when we have a safe, stable home and prosperity; economic 
<br/>growth will come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  issue  at  hand  therefore  to  me  and  I  am  sure  to  all  of  us  is 
<br/>absolutely critical at this point in time. Not many of us understand what human trafficking in person 
<br/>is  all  about.  Let  me  relate  very  shortly  my  experience  with  this.  When  I  was  in  China  as  a 
<br/>representative of Fiji, we received an urgent report relating to three females who were stranded in 
<br/>Hong Kong. It took us some time to intervene. To cut the story short, when we sent a team to Hong 
<br/>Kong, we found out that they were lured into Hong Kong for a job opportunity. When we traced and 
<br/>investigated further, they were basically reported here at home as missing from home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, that is exactly how many of us understand what human trafficking 
<br/>in person is about. I thank the honourable Minister for his assurances of the things that needs to be 
<br/>done  and  addressed  to  this  particular  issue.  We  have  noted  there  is  progress  at  work  under  the 
<br/>National Action Plan and I hope that there will be closer supervision and oversight of the work to get 
<br/>all those outstanding issues done.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps in conclusion, Madam Deputy Speaker, for the benefit of Parliament let me read out 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to you the definition of human trafficking in person under the Palermo Protocol and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Trafficking  in  person  shall  mean  the  recruitment,  transportation,  transfer, 
<br/>harbouring or receipt of persons by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of 
<br/>coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of 
<br/>vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent 
<br/>of  a  person,  having  control  over  another  person  for  the  purpose  of  exploitation.  
<br/>Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or 
<br/>other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to 
<br/>slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is an accepted definition of human trafficking in persons.  </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, let me end by urging the honourable Minister for Home Affairs, to 
<br/></span><span>make  sure  that  all  those  outstanding  Action  Plans  are  dealt  with.    Secondly,  I  also  appeal  to  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>         Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security  
<br/>and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>419 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning,  National 
<br/>Development and Statistics for the support of this Human Trafficking Unit.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a small element of it at the Home Affairs Headquarters but has a budget of only 
<br/>$10,000. I hope given the nature and the substantive issue of this, that the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister may consider, and likewise, at the Police operational level, a full support on handling of 
<br/>these issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I support this fully. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.-  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I thank you for the opportunity  to 
<br/>contribute to the motion that is before Parliament this afternoon on the Review of the Ministry of 
<br/>Defence, National Security and Policing Annual Report of 2018-2019. Perhaps, if you would just 
<br/>allow me to first wish our strong 80 RFMF and 20 Police Officers or 100 security personnel from 
<br/>Fiji, who flew out of Fiji on Saturday to join the Solomon Islands International Assistance Force in 
<br/>the country’s preparation towards their General Election which will happen tomorrow. I am sure that 
<br/>like the Solomon Islands population, would rely on security forces during the Elections prior and 
<br/></span><span>after, we, and our population here in Fiji, rely on our strong RFMF and our Police Force to provide 
<br/></span><span>us with the necessary security along our EEZ, our land and our local policing scenarios.  They were 
<br/>farewelled in Nadi by the Commander of the Joint Task Force Command (JTFC), Brigadier-General 
<br/>Manoa Gadai, on Saturday past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, I commend the Report that have been shared and commented on 
<br/>today.  I must say it is a very hard task to speak after three decorated soldiers who had taken the floor 
<br/>today, one a former Commander, a former Police Commissioner, Deputy Commander of the RFMF 
<br/>and, of course, the present Minister for Home Affairs and Immigration.  They have, of course, set a 
<br/>very high bar for me this afternoon, beginning with a very funny joke.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, we note, Madam Deputy Speaker, the need to strengthen the policies on human 
<br/>trafficking, to address the issue of human trafficking, nationally and transnationally, that has been 
<br/>shared on the floor of Parliament this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have a very tough legislation, tough in its definition, tough in its sentencing as well.  I 
<br/>guess the problem is in detection, investigation and in prosecution, and those might be areas that, of 
<br/>course, some source of Government assistance and funding will also have to be directed towards, so 
<br/></span><span>that we can make our contribution to this rather larger than all of us international human trafficking 
<br/></span><span>problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji  also  has  recently  signed  the  Palermo  Protocol  which  is  the  only  global  binding 
<br/>international instrument that contains agreed upon definition that has been shared in Parliament today 
<br/>by honourable Naivalurua on the trafficking of persons.  Of course, Fiji is still considered a tier two 
<br/>in terms of effort by Government on anti-trafficking capacity as published in the US 2023 Report.  
<br/>Although, we know that we are probably not fully compliant at this stage, we all would agree that as 
<br/>a country and as a bipartisan Parliament, we are making every significant effort to be compliant with 
<br/>the required standard. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, in contribution today from my Ministry, we are delighted to say that 
<br/>from our part, we have secured land for the construction of the Maritime Essential Services Centre, 
<br/>which is up in construction in Lami.  Of course, that is going to be monitored and mastered by the 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Navy.  Over the years, we have worked hard to secure Government Stations for Police Posts, 
<br/></span><span>Military Bases and camps, and this also includes the Vuda Ex-Serviceman Battery Site up in the hills 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Review Report – Ministry of Defence, National Security  
<br/>and Policing 2019-2019 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Lomolomo.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  Ministry  anticipates  working  with  the  Ministry  of  Defence, 
<br/>National Security and Policing; Ministry of Youth and Sports; Ministry of Women, Children and 
<br/>Social Protection; and the Ministry of Local Government and Housing in securing viable land that 
<br/>would provide for recreational and sporting spaces that would be used by our youth and children, so 
<br/>that it brings out a positive impact in their wellbeing and security, thus taking them away from the 
<br/>urges of urban crime and its incentives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have recently visited some sites here along the Suva-Nausori corridor, where, in the next 
<br/>financial year, we will be putting across to the Ministry of Finance some funding requests so that we 
<br/>can build proper parks, volleyball courts, basketball courts, as well as spaces where our children will 
<br/>be able to play in their spare time, thus, achieving what we all want them to achieve, that is, to take 
<br/>them out from the invitation to depart from crimes in their communities.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, through the capital projects of the Ministry of Lands and Mineral 
<br/>Resources this year, we have been able to upgrade the Geodetic Datum, that has allowed, over the 
<br/></span><span>years,  a systemic and incremental improvement to the accuracy and position of our global positioning 
<br/></span><span>system for our Fiji Navigation System.  Also, this is significant in assisting search and rescue for our 
<br/>Fiji Navy, and it includes also the monitoring of our Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, the Ministry, in 2022, had signed a Memorandum of Understanding 
<br/>with the Fiji Police Force in the monitoring of the illegal river gravel and sand activities, and also to 
<br/>assist  in  the  protection  of  these  development  resources,  working  in  collaboration  in  information 
<br/>sharing  through  community  policing  and  also  would  be  paramount  for  our  Ministry  and  also  in 
<br/>collaboration with the Ministry of Defence. I support the motion before Parliament, Madam Deputy 
<br/>Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Madam Deputy Speaker, if I can just use this few minutes, just to put 
<br/>a bit of emphasis on the first recommendation on search and rescue and the need for the Bill to be 
<br/>hurried through, if you like. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Search and rescue is quite complex.  You have maritime search and rescue, land search and 
<br/>rescue, aeronautical search and rescue – sometimes it starts in the air and ends up as land rescue or 
<br/>as a maritime rescue.  So, there is a lot of moving parts and a lot of agencies that are involved in 
<br/></span><span>search and rescue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, just three weeks ago, I was getting into my car at Cost-U-Less when 
<br/>this lady came up to  me with  a painting  and said, “This  is  for you.”  I took the painting  and was 
<br/>looking at her, not too sure. I was trying to remember her name, but I could not put a name to the 
<br/>face.  Then she said, “Liliana from Vanuavatu.  Do you remember me?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then I remembered that this this lady who would be 44 years now, we had rescued her 29 
<br/>years ago when she was 15 years old.  She and her elder sister who was 18 years.  A successful search 
<br/>and  rescue  in  the  most  atrocious  weather  conditions  and  she  introduced  me  to  her  husband  and 
<br/>children - two girls. I was looking at them and said, “Man, had we failed that day, those two girls 
<br/>will not be standing there.”  But search and rescue is a lifesaving mission and when we do it well, 
<br/>with the organisation flows, we are able to save lives, like this lady, Liliana.  That was way back in 
<br/>1995 and the honourable Prime Minister was the Prime Minister then at that time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It involved a lot of agencies. We had called the Ministry, it was the Ministry of Home Affairs
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>         Review Report – Public Rental Board 2020 Annual Report

<div><span>then, for some money to charter an aircraft to fly, it was nearly dark, which was Fiji Airways.  They 
<br/>flew, we could not see them, then we had to ask for the search and rescue plane that was in New 
<br/>Caledonia.    We  had  to  involve  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs  so  that  they  can  get  diplomatic 
<br/>clearance, et cetera.  They flew, they located, and we managed to save these two girls who are now 
<br/>adults.  I think both of them are grandmothers, these two ladies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, I would like to say that the Search and Rescue Bill is really needed as the umbrella so that 
<br/>all these little pieces can be put in a way in the manual and all the agencies that are involved in trying 
<br/>to save lives are included in there.  It is smooth and the result would be like that lady.  We can save 
<br/>lives if it is done well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish the honourable Minister and staff well 
<br/>in the big job that they do in keeping our country safe. I certainly commend the motion to Parliament 
<br/>for noting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
