<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the honourable Prime Minister and

<br/>Enterprises and Veteran Affairs has given notice to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing

<br/>his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than five minutes. There will be no other debate 
<br/>following that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  I  rise  to  deliver  my  Ministerial  Statement  on  the  Constitutional 
<br/>Offices Commission (COC) which I Chair and is mandated by the Constitution of the Republic of 
<br/>Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The COC is established under Section 132(1) of the Constitution of Fiji.  The Commission 
<br/>comprises  the  Prime  Minister  as  the  Chairperson,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  the 
<br/>honourable Attorney-General, two persons appointed by the President on the recommendation of the 
<br/>Prime Minister, and one person appointed by the President on the advice of the honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Prime Minister’s current nominees are Ms. Cema Bolabola and Mr. John Apted.  The 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition’s nominee is Roko Tupou Draunidalo. The Secretary of the 
<br/>Commission is the Solicitor-General, who is assisted by the Secretariat Team of designated Senior 
<br/>Legal Officers in the Office of the Solicitor-General.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, under Section 133 of the Constitution of Fiji, the COC is responsible 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for providing advice to the President on the appointment of the following Officers, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>379 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces; 
<br/>Auditor-General; and 
<br/>Governor of the Reserve Bank. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Madam Deputy Speaker, pursuant to Section 138(4) of the Constitution of Fiji, 
<br/>the COC establishes and maintains its own rules and regulations, governing its internal procedures 
<br/>and functions.  As such, the COC, for the first time, resolved to consider formulating its own Standard 
<br/>Operating Procedures (SOPs) with respect to the conduct of its procedures and functions.  Following 
<br/>that decision, the first draft of the COC’s SOPs were circulated among the members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, for the information of Parliament, COC was allocated $20,000 for 
<br/>this financial year.  At present, the SOPs are being reviewed by the COC members, to ensure that it 
<br/>is comprehensive, it is coherent and compliant with the constitutional provisions and the objectives 
<br/>of COC.  The SOPs will serve as a starting point for COC to implement and enforce its functions and 
<br/>responsibilities in alignment with the stipulated sections of the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  draft  SOPs  contain  procedures  with  respect  to  the  quorum  for  COC  meetings, 
<br/>appointment  and  tenure  of  COC  members,  responsibilities  of  the  secretary  to  the  COC,  the 
<br/>appointment  process  for  constitutional  office  holders,  dealing  with  urgent  COC  matters,  decision 
<br/>making processes of COC, the independence of COC and provisions regarding regular updates and 
<br/>advice to Parliament.  Once finalised, these SOPs will not only streamline the internal operations of 
<br/>the  COC,  but  it  will  also  provide  clarity  and  guidance  to  its  members  regarding  their  roles  and 
<br/>responsibilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>transparency  and 
<br/>accountability  within the COC, fostering trusts amongst  stakeholders  and the public of Fiji.   It  is 
<br/>expected  that  the  finalised  SOPs  will  be  officially  adopted  by  the  COC  following  thorough 
<br/>deliberations and consensus building amongst its members.  For the benefit of Parliament, under the 
<br/>COC, we have seen the appointment of Mr. Luke Rokovada as the Chairman of the Public Service 
<br/>Commission and Ms. Barbara Malimali as Chairperson of the Electoral Commission.  The following 
<br/>substantive offices are currently vacant: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  SOPs  will  enhance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supervisor of Elections; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Auditor-General; and 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, there are existing acting appointments in those offices namely, Ms. Ana Mataiciwa 
<br/></span><span>as the Acting Supervisor of Elections; Mr. Sairusi Dukuno as the Acting Auditor-General and Ms. 
<br/>Salote Panapasa as the Acting Commissioner of Fiji Corrections Service, all of whom were appointed 
<br/>by His Excellency the President on the advice under my tenure.  The recruitment process for these 
<br/>substantive officers is underway and the COC intends to deliberate on the suitable candidates for the 
<br/>appointment in its next meeting later this month.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  for  the  first  time  ever,  the  COC  established  an  Independent 
<br/>Committee  to  advice  the  COC  on  the  appropriate  remunerations  and  allowances  that  should  be 
<br/></span><span>payable to all constitutional officers under its responsibility as referred to earlier.  The Independent 
<br/></span><span>Committee consists of Mr. Cama Raimuria as Chairperson, Ms. Salote Uluinaceva and Ms. Elenoa 
<br/>Biukoto.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The remuneration and allowances for future appointments, including those for Supervisor of 
<br/></span><span>Elections,  Commissioner  of  Fiji  Corrections  Service  and  Auditor-General  will  be  based  on  the 
<br/></span><span>recommendation of the Independent Committee as mandated by Section 136(2) of the Constitution.

<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  previous  COC  did  not  adhere  to  that  constitutional 
<br/>requirement, and some of the previous office holder’s remunerations or allowances are subject to 
<br/>certain investigations by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During  its  meetings  on  18</span><span>th</span><span>  and  26</span><span>th</span><span>  January  of  last  year,  the  COC  considered  serious 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>complaints of abuse of office made against certain former constitutional officers, namely the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Supervisor of Elections - Mr. Mohammed Saneem; 
<br/>Commissioner for Fiji Corrections Service - Mr. Francis Kean; and  
<br/>currently suspended Police Commissioner - Mr. Sitiveni Qiliho.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those  individuals  were  provided  an  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  allegations,  following 
<br/>which the COC deliberated on whether, based on the allegations made, the question of their removal 
<br/>ought to be investigated, in which case the COC was required to appoint a tribunal in accordance 
<br/>with Section 137(3)(a) of the Constitution.  A tribunal appointed will be required to inquire into the 
<br/>matter and provide its written report to His Excellency the President.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the case of Mr. Saneem as Supervisor of Elections, the COC received a complaint against 
<br/>Mr. Saneem which had not been dealt with by the former COC members.  On 6</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, this 
<br/>complaint was forwarded to Mr. Saneem to provide any necessary responses before the COC decided 
<br/>on whether to appoint a tribunal to investigate the complaints in accordance with Section 137(4) of 
<br/>the Constitution. Mr. Saneem responded on 9</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023 to those complaints and his responses 
<br/>were brought before the COC.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 26</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, the COC after considering the complaints and responses provided by 
<br/>Mr. Saneem agreed to refer the allegations to a tribunal composed of the honourable Justice Filimoni 
<br/>Jitoko as Chairperson, the honourable Justice William Calanchini and the former honourable Judge 
<br/>Jiten Singh.  On the advice of the COC, the President suspended Mr. Saneem, pending the referral 
<br/>and appointment of the tribunal.  However before the tribunal could conduct its work, Mr.Saneem 
<br/>resigned as Supervisor of Elections, bringing that matter to an end.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  case  of  Mr.  Kean  as  Commissioner  of  Corrections  Service,  the  COC  received  five 
<br/>complaints against him.  On 18</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2023, these complaints were forwarded to Mr. Kean to 
<br/>provide  the  necessary  responses  before  the  COC  decided  on  whether  to  appoint  a  tribunal  to 
<br/>investigate  the  complaints  in  accordance  with  Section  137(4)  of  the  Constitution.  Mr.  Kean 
<br/>responded on 23</span><span>rd</span><span> January, 2023 to those complaints and his responses were brought before the COC.  
<br/>On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  2023,  the  COC  agreed  to  refer  the  complaints  of  misbehaviour  to  a  tribunal  to 
<br/>enquire into the complaints and provide a report to the President.  However, Mr. Kean tendered his 
<br/>resignation letter on 14</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2023, and therefore there was no need to proceed with the tribunal 
<br/>proceedings. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  case  of  Mr.  Qiliho,  the  Commissioner  of  Police,  three  separate  complaints  of 
<br/>misbehaviour  were  lodged  against  him.    On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  January,  2023  the  COC  agreed  to  refer  those 
<br/>complaints of misbehaviour to a tribunal to enquire into the complaints and provide a report to the 
<br/>President. The COC also agreed to recommend the suspension of Mr. Qiliho to the President which 
<br/></span><span>is  still  in  place.  Overall,  ensuring  the  smooth  operations  of  constitutional  offices  has  been  the 
<br/></span><span>cornerstone of the COC’s work in recent years reflecting its ongoing commitment to efficiency and 
<br/>functionality within this vital institution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building on these initiatives on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> November, 2023, the COC embarked on laying the ground 
<br/>work for establishing an independent secretariat.  The start is pivotal in enhancing the COC’s capacity 
<br/>to facilitate its functions effectively, ensuring streamlined processes and better support its functions.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>381 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  in  recent  weeks  complaints  against  constitutional  office  holders 
<br/>have been highlighted in various media reports.  In accordance with due processes and the rules of 
<br/>natural justice, all complaints against constitutional officers will be dealt with by the Commission.  
<br/>The officers in question will be given the opportunity to respond before the Commission makes any 
<br/>further decision in accordance with the Constitution.  I expect an update on these at the upcoming 
<br/>meeting of the COC of the week beginning 29th April, 2024 and thereafter will update Parliament 
<br/>and the people of Fiji on the work of the Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Madam Deputy Speaker, first of all, let me take this opportunity to say 
<br/>‘thank  you’  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  for  delivering  this  Ministerial  Statement  on  the 
<br/>Constitutional Offices Commission.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  we  all  know,  Madam  Deputy  Speaker,  the  COC  forms  a  very  critical  component  as 
<br/>provided for in our Constitution.  In the actual Constitution, as spelt out by the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, the performance and functions of each of those commissions and tribunals is looked after 
<br/>within Section 138 of the Constitution and it applies to the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Electoral Commission; 
<br/>Judicial Services Commission; 
<br/>Legal Aid Commission; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission; 
<br/>2.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Mercy Commission; 
<br/>6.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>7.</span><span> </span><span>Accountability and Transparency Commission; 
<br/>8.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>9.</span><span> </span><span>Constitutional Offices Commission; and 
<br/>10.</span><span> </span><span>any  tribunal  or  medical  board  established  or  appointed  under  this  Constitution  to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Service Disciplinary Tribunal; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public Service Commission; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consider the question of removal from office of any person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that particular section applies to those bodies and the performance or functions of commissions 
<br/>and tribunals and those particular performances and functions of those tribunals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I am referring to honourable Prime Minister, within that particular section, there is a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sub-section 3 which reads, and I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“A decision of a commission, tribunal or board to which this section applies requires 
<br/>the  concurrence  of  a  majority  of  its  members  and  the  commission,  tribunal  or  board  to 
<br/>which this section applies may act despite the absence of a member but, if, in a particular 
<br/>case, a vote is taken to decide a question and the votes cast are equally divided, the person 
<br/>presiding must exercise a casting vote.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Why I read this, I think this is very applicable to something that you have before you and 
<br/>something that had been floated about in our social media with respect to issues that have been raised 
<br/>by a particular Chairman from them.  It is not for us to adjudicate upon it, Sir, it is for the COC to do 
<br/>so.  That  is  a  very  important  provision  especially  regarding  the  concurrence  of  a  majority  of  its 
<br/></span><span>members.  So, when in receipt of something from one of these chairpersons, we must always ensure 
<br/></span><span>that, that letter has come by virtue of concurrence from the actual Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  an  overview  perspective,  obviously,  the  functions  and  responsibilities  like  has  been 
<br/>covered, the COC oversees the appointment of quite a number of people and there is a constitutional 
<br/>mandate.  Madam Deputy Speaker, most of all, the COC’s mandate is to uphold the Constitution by 
<br/>ensuring  that  a  fair  and  transparent  process  is  there  for  appointments  for  Constitutional  Office, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="12">Page 12</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statement 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>16</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>something which the honourable Prime Minister has actually spelt out.  We are happy to see that as 
<br/>an SOP currently being worked out with respect to all of those being at the forefront of that particular 
<br/>SOP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The independence of the COC is critically important to a country like ours because this body 
<br/>encompasses important institutions within Fiji.  The independence of the COC and what we must 
<br/>also  remember  is  the  transparency  issue  is  critically  important  also.  The  transparency  and 
<br/>accountability of the Commission itself is important.  When you actually sit there whether it be as 
<br/>Chairman or whether it be as a normal member, you actually put a very different hat on because these 
<br/>bodies that you are actually looking after are critical components in the efficient running of a nation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have said, the mandate is to uphold the Constitution. There is 
<br/>one issue, what we really want to know is in terms of the development of the SOP, honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister, what is actually being followed or who are we looking at?  What are the guidelines that 
<br/>have been given regarding this SOP?  Who was it been given by?  Is it being a transparent process 
<br/>where we are looking at, even with a SOP, although it is a self-governing issue, you are allowed to 
<br/>within the constitution, it is important that the public actually knows, apart from the people who are 
<br/>involved in the development of the SOP, is it the independent institutions that have been allowed to 
<br/>be a party to and privy to the development of that SOP? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We commend the Government with respect to its strong commitment to the COC, as I have 
<br/>said, it forms a critical component for all of us and we believe that by addressing head-on the recent 
<br/>concerns  as  alluded  to  by  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  we  are  actually  fostering  a  culture  of 
<br/>transparency.  I commend the honourable Prime Minister’s move to actually ensure that all of that is 
<br/>done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MADAM DEPUTY SPEAKER.-  Honourable Members, I see the time is around 10.26 a.m. 
<br/>and I will be adjourning Parliament for morning tea.  I trust that the speakers in the morning tea room 
<br/>in the Big Committee Room have been fixed so at least the volume turned up so we do not miss the 
<br/>bell like most of us did yesterday morning.  Thank you, honourable Members, enjoy your morning 
<br/>tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament adjourned at 10.26 a.m.
