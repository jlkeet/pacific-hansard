<div><span>REVIEW REPORT- FIJI NATIONAL PROVIDENT FUND 2022 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review of the Fiji National Provident Fund 2022 Annual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Report, which was tabled on 20</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, the Fiji National Providence Fund (FNPF) is a 
<br/>defined contribution Fund that provides superannuation services to its members.  The operation of 
<br/>the Fund is guided by the Fiji National Provident Fund Act 2011.  The Fund collects compulsory 
<br/>contributions from employees and employers towards the retirement savings of all workers in Fiji.  
<br/>It  also  provides  pre-retirement  benefits  such  as  housing,  medical,  unemployment,  education 
<br/>assistance and funeral.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, the Fund is also known to be the major investor in Fiji and is one 
<br/>of  the  country’s  largest  property  owner.    It  also  owns  majority  shares  in  Amalgamated  Telecom 
<br/>Holdings Pte Ltd, Home Finance Company Pte Ltd, and fully owns the Intercontinental Fiji Golf 
<br/>Resort and Spa, the Natadola Bay Championship Golf Course, the Yatule Resort and Spa at Natadola 
<br/>Beach, Holiday Inn in Suva, Fiji Marriott Resort Momi Bay, Sheraton Fiji Resort, the Westin Resort, 
<br/>Denarau Golf and Racquet Club and the Grand Pacific Hotel.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, during the year under review, the FNPF accumulated a total of $8.7 billion 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>worth of assets.  This achievement was a result of the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The net income of $650.8 million as compared to $543.5 million in the year 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>General Reserve stands at $1.7 billion. 
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Members Fund is at $6.7 billion. 
<br/>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Total Contribution received from employers for the employees was at $395.2 million and 
<br/>$370.3 million was the credited amount as interest to members’ accounts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had highlighted the following.  It is recommended that the FNPF: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Continues  and  builds  on  the  participation  in  environmental,  social  and  governance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>investments by FNPF through public private partnership. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Work on a scheme that is accessible for voluntary members in the informal sector. This will 
<br/>ensure that when retiring from being farmers or market vendors, they have saved for life 
<br/>after retirement.  The Committee had further recommended that the FNPF develop schemes 
<br/>and create awareness for voluntary members in the informal sector as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Had  highlighted  that  it  is  still  a  challenge  to  pursue  the  substantial  number  of  inactive 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>4.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>members.   
<br/>To continue to build on the Fund’s awareness programmes, targeting tertiary institutions 
<br/>and secondary schools.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Hon. V. Pillay. 
<br/>Honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications. 
<br/>Hon. K.K. Lal. 
<br/>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic  Planning, 
<br/>National Development and Statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have 10 minutes each. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand today in support of the Fiji National Provident 
<br/>Fund 2022 Annual Report as reviewed by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs.  This Report 
<br/>paints  a  positive  picture  of  FNPF’s  financial  health  and  its  commitment  to  the  wellbeing  of  its 
<br/>members and Fiji as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, let us acknowledge the impressive financial performance with total assets exceeding 
<br/>$8.7 billion, net income of $650.8 million and a strong member fund of $6.7 billion.  The FNPF 
<br/>stands as a pillar of financial security for Fijians.   This translates into tangible benefits for members.  
<br/>Over  $467  million  was  paid  out  in  benefits  in  2022,  including  retirement  payments,  housing 
<br/>assistance and death benefits. This highlights the crucial role FNPF plays in safeguarding the future 
<br/>of Fijian families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee’s  findings  reveal  another  commendable  aspect  -  FNPF’s  commitment  to 
<br/>responsible  investing.    Their  involvement  in  environmental,  social  and  governance  initiatives  to 
<br/>Public Private Partnership (PPP) demonstrates a focus on sustainability and positive social impact.  
<br/>This aligns perfectly with the growing global focus on responsible investing and ensures that FNPF’s 
<br/>growth benefits both its members and the wider Fijian community.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the development of Schemes for voluntary members in the informal sector is a 
<br/>significance step towards financial inclusion.  A large portion of Fiji’s workforce operates within the 
<br/>informal sector and this initiative has a potential to empower these individuals and provide them with 
<br/>much needed safety net for their future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  Report  also  identifies  key  areas  for  improvement.    A  significant  number  of 
<br/></span><span>inactive  members  highlights  the  need  for  increased  awareness  programmes.  The  Committee 
<br/></span><span>commends  FNPF’s  existing  initiatives  targeting  young  people  in  schools  and  encourages  further 
<br/>expansion of these programmes.  Educating future generations about the importance of saving for 
<br/>retirement will be crucial in ensuring long term sustainability for the FNPF and the financial security 
<br/>of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee’s site visit further eliminates the tangible impact of FNPF’s investment, the 
<br/>success  of  projects  like  the  Nadi  FNPF  Plaza  and  the  renovated  Sheraton  Resort  showcases  the 
<br/>potential for economic growth and job creation.  Additionally, the Ba Aspen Hospital, a product of 
<br/>PPP provides the advanced medical care and free heart surgeries, directly addressing a critical need 
<br/>within the community.  However, the challenge remains.  Addressing ambulance service limitations, 
<br/>parking deficiencies at the Ba Hospital and the shortage of medical personnel are crucial steps in 
<br/>assuring the continued success of this vital facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, the Report highlights the FNPF’s contribution to several Sustainable Development 
<br/>Goals set by the United Nations by providing retirement savings and facilities access to healthcare.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>367 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FNPF tackles poverty and promotes good health and wellbeing, that is, SDG1 and SDG3. Their 
<br/>commitment to Environmental, Social &amp; Governance (ESG) investing in climate friendly strategies 
<br/>showcases the alignment with SDG11 and SDG13 respectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  the  FNPF  2022  Annual  Report  demonstrates  responsible  financial 
<br/>management and a commitment to social impact and a vision for a more secure future for Fijians.  
<br/>By  implementing  the  Committee’s  recommendations  and  addressing  its  existing  challenges,  the 
<br/>FNPF  can  solidify  its  position  as  a  cornerstone  of  financial  security  and  a  driver  of  sustainable 
<br/>development in Fiji.  Let us all work together to support the FNPF in securing a brighter future for 
<br/>generations to come.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the honour to rise and provide some 
<br/>contributions on the debate of the review of the FNPF Annual Report 2022.  Perhaps, may I start by 
<br/>saying that when we were outside Parliament as aspiring politicians, one of the things that concerned 
<br/>us was the use of the FNPF as perhaps, the national cheque book by the other side of Parliament. I 
<br/>have  to  pay  credit  to  the  Management  of  FNPF  under  those  who  have  left  and  the  current 
<br/>Management. They were able to keep an even keel, even when there was a lot of pressure brought to 
<br/>bear at various times in its operation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  congratulate  FNPF  for  the  tremendous  contributions  it  has  made  to  our 
<br/>country, and we need to attribute credit where credit is due, Sir.  We need to credit the late Ratu Sir 
<br/>Kamisese Mara and Mr. A.D. Patel for their vision and wisdom for mirroring the investment process 
<br/>and system that was in Singapore, which is now FNPF, and we are all benefitting from that vision.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, allow me, because of my role particularly in the investment trade side, to 
<br/>perhaps, provide some colouring in terms of where FNPF is headed and some places where we are 
<br/>trying to work with FNPF to try and ensure that the Fund diversifies.  As we agree, there is a lot of 
<br/>concentration in hotels and properties and clearly, there is a need to widen the investment net (if you 
<br/>like) so that we continue to have a diversified portfolio in the FNPF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now, there are some very active discussions in terms of commercial 
<br/>agriculture with some very promising players and I am hopeful that in this year, there will be some 
<br/>investments in that area.  If that happens, Sir, that will help greatly in diversifying the Fijian economy 
<br/>and I know its music to not only this side of Parliament but certainly to the honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition, who is only too acutely aware of the potential of commercial agriculture in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second, Sir, is in the area of communications.  As you know that through the hard work 
<br/>of this side of Parliament, we managed to get </span><span>Google</span><span> to establish in Fiji within seven months.  What 
<br/>that  means  is  that  we  have  an  opportunity  for  institutional  investors  in  Fiji,  including  FNPF,  to 
<br/>participate in this investment.  I am hopeful that they will be able to do it because there are some very 
<br/>good  returns  if  they  are  able  to  secure  a  parcel  of  the  investment  that  this  company,  </span><span>Google</span><span>,  is 
<br/>investing in the Pacific wide network. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally,  Sir,  as  part  of  that,  we  have  to  congratulate  FNPF,  particularly  Amalgamated 
<br/>Telecom Holdings (ATH) ,for their investment in Papua New Guinea. I have been closely watching 
<br/></span><span>what  they  have  been  doing  there,  even  outside  Parliament,  Sir,  and  there  is  a  major  potential 
<br/></span><span>investment opportunity there with some very good returns to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, those are some of the opportunities that are in front of FNPF and our Fund, if anything, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will only make the Fund stronger and we look forward to some of these things coming to fruition.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that we also talked about outside Parliament before we came in, Sir, is, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>368 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, looking at a medical scheme for the members of FNPF.  I am hopeful that, that conversation 
<br/>can continue because it will broaden the benefit of healthcare to all our people in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Sir, going back to the idea of a national cheque book, I am hopeful, Sir, that we will 
<br/>allow FNPF to invest more offshore.  That is one way of taking funds out of the country and putting 
<br/>them offshore so that not even our government, but governments that may come after us will not 
<br/>have this ability to just go in and take the funds of our members and use them where they want to.   I 
<br/>know the honourable Minister of Finance is also looking at that and if it does, as we know, the returns 
<br/>in offshore investment managed funds is a lot higher than what we get in our beloved country.  With 
<br/>those few words, Sir, I totally support the Report before us and again would like to congratulate the 
<br/>management of FNPF for their prudent management of what is a core underlying asset in our nation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of the Report presented by 
<br/>the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Review of the FNPF Annual Report 2022. This 
<br/>Report  stands  as  a  testament  to  the  diligent  work  of  the  FijiFirst  Government  in  overseeing  the 
<br/>anagement of one of our nation’s most crucial institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First  and  foremost,  I  commend  the  FNPF  for  its  remarkable  achievements  during  the 
<br/>Financial Year 2022 with total assets reaching an impressive $8.7 billion.  It is evident that the FNPF 
<br/>is effectively managing the contributions of its members.  The significant increase in the net income 
<br/>to  $650.8  million  compared  to  $543.5  million  the  previous  year,  demonstrates  the  Fund’s 
<br/>commitment to financial stability and growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  the  FNPF’s  effort  to  support  its  members  during  challenging  times  deserve 
<br/>recognition.   Despite the adverse economic environment, the Fund continued to  provide essential 
<br/>services and benefits to its members, from early retirement withdrawals to housing assistance and 
<br/>migration support.  The FNPF remains steadfast in its mission to safeguard the financial well-being 
<br/>of its members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to commend the FNPF for its strategic investment and partnership, particularly 
<br/>in projects aimed at improving healthcare and infrastructure in our nation.  The refurbishment of the 
<br/>Sheraton  Resort,  the  completion  of  Nadi  FNPF  Retail  Complex  and  the  partnership  with  Aspen 
<br/>Medical  for  the  upgrading  of  Ba  Aspen  Hospital  are  all  initiatives  that  contribute  to  the  social 
<br/>economic development of our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I applaud the FNPF’s commitment to environmental, social 
<br/>and governance investment as highlighted in the report by actively participating in ESG initiatives 
<br/>through  Public-Private  Partnership,  the  FNPF  is  not  only  generating  financial  returns  but  also 
<br/>contributing to sustainable development and community welfare.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to the FNPF’s achievements, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the diligent work and 
<br/>the oversight conducted by the Standing Committee on Social Affairs.  Through a thorough review 
<br/>analysis,  the  Committee  has  provided  valuable  insights  and  recommendations  for  the  continuous 
<br/>improvement of FNPF’s operation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  those  words,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  conclude  and  urge  all  honourable  Members  of  the 
<br/></span><span>august Chamber to support the Report in front of us.  We must recognise and celebrate the exemplary 
<br/>work of the FNPF in safeguarding the financial future of our citizens.  We must commend the FijiFirst 
<br/>government,  a  responsible  government  which  has  always  looked  after  its  people,  the  Fijians  and 
<br/>FNPF and for its unwavering commitment to good governance and oversight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Ketan, you are referring to the past Government because we 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>369 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have the present Government here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.K. LAL.- The FijiFirst Government, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, the past government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  Chairperson  of  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee and all the honourable Members who have spoken before me.  I just wanted to pick on a 
<br/>number of issues and highlights some of the figures with respect to 2022.  Although the Fund in 2022 
<br/>still recorded negative contributions which is contributions less withdrawals of $71.8 million.  This 
<br/>was a big improvement from the previous negative net contribution of about $179.5 million.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This increase, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is attributed to an increase in the contributions received due 
<br/>to the 2 percent increase on contribution rates and a decrease in members’ withdrawals.  One of the 
<br/>largest component of the Fund’s investment return is the interest income from Government bond, 
<br/>subscriptions and returns from equity investment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  mentioned  with  respect  to  FNPF’s 
<br/>ability to diversify its investment portfolio apart from the investments in the hotels and properties, 
<br/>particularly  offshore  investment  to  be  able  to  move  away  from  perhaps  just  relying  on  the 
<br/>Government bonds subscriptions and returns from that.  Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the interest rate that 
<br/>FNPF receives from Government bonds when compared to what is available in the market right now 
<br/>could be much higher, so the Government will also have to look at whether we can continue with the 
<br/>same interest rate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point that I want to make, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government committed 
<br/>to  restoring  their  contributions  rates  to  the  normal  18  percent  in  2024  and  we  have  done  that 
<br/>accordingly as announced in the last Budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fund’s  investment  portfolio  was  valued  at  $8.6  billion  in  2022  and  the  Return  on 
<br/>Investment (ROI) new was 7.4 percent.  This was a significant increase from the 6.1 percent return 
<br/>in the previous year.  Key investment highlights for 2022, of course, as mentioned by the Chairperson 
<br/>was the completion of the refurbishment and reopening of the Sheraton Resort, the completion and 
<br/>opening  of  the  Nadi  Retail  Centre,  Fiji  Airways  acquisition,  and  of  course,  the  Ba  and  Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital as Public-Private Partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  inform  Parliament  that  the  Cabinet  has  considered  the  situation  with 
<br/>respect to the Public-Private Partnership with Aspen and FNPF, in which the FNPF owns majority shares 
<br/>within the Health Care (Fiji) Pte Ltd (HCF). Of course, there are several issues there and at some point, 
<br/>when we have dealt with, the Parliament will  be informed of that.   The  Fund continues to invest in 
<br/>opportunities  that  align  with  its  long-term  objectives,  and  as  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister 
<br/>Kamikamica said that the Fund's portfolio growth must increase.  It is important that they do that, but also 
<br/>as  we  move  in  the  future,  we  need  to  look  at  very  carefully  what  was  the  original  intention,  the 
<br/>Chairperson of the Committee mentioned that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Historically,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Kamikamica  talked  about  the  late  Ratu  Sir 
<br/></span><span>Kamisese Mara and the idea of the FNPF was first mooted by the late Mr. A.D. Patel, the former Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition, and the National Federation Party as a member of social services in the Legislative 
<br/>Council, which led to the formation of the FNPF.  The original objective was to make FNPF a retirement 
<br/>fund so that when members retire, they have significant a social protection because of their pensions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>370 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FNPF 2022 Annual Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Chairperson mentioned about the FNPF Act 2011, and you would recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that was a Decree that was put in place by the Bainimarama Government and unilaterally, the pension 
<br/>rate of 25 percent based on whatever the actuarial advice at that time was.  We can argue about the 
<br/>financial implications, but the fact is, the way in which it was done, about 1,500 pensioners abruptly were 
<br/>put off.  Some chose to remain on pension at a lower rate, and the Coalition Government recognised the 
<br/>pain and suffering that some of them went through. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> In fact, we  now have  a  pension rate  of 9  percent and,  in  fact, the  FNPF  had  already  moved 
<br/>towards  further  reducing  the  pension  rate.    What  is  happening  is,  a  lot  of  people  are  not  going  on 
<br/>retirement on pension. More than 60 percent of the people who were members of the FNPF have balances 
<br/>of about less than $10,000, and when these people retire, what they will have will not be enough.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FNPF Board together with the Government, we are looking at this very 
<br/>carefully.  I think the Board and the management are working together to look at what are some of the 
<br/>other innovative ways, apart from looking at increasing the investment portfolio, increasing the return 
<br/>because FNPF by law receives a certain amount of income.  There are, of course, voluntary contributors.  
<br/>In  2022,  there  were  about  19,000  people,  these  were  people  who  could  voluntarily  go  and  become 
<br/>members of the FNPF and contribute.  So, there were 19,145, which is only 5 percent of the total Fund 
<br/>membership.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  that  means,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  that  while  looking  at  the  return,  while  looking  at  the 
<br/>investments,  et  cetera  has  to  make  sure  that  it  looks  at  more  innovations,  particularly  the  National 
<br/>Insurance Scheme because that is one of the most difficult things for people who retire after 55 years 
<br/>(now after 60 years) is to continue with the income source through which they can look after their health 
<br/>and through which they can maintain their families.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  recognises  the  pain  particularly  those  who  had  low 
<br/>balances in 2011.  They had planned their whole life based on what they were getting and suddenly 
<br/>some of their contributions went down by about 50 percent and less than that.  In the last Budget, we 
<br/>recognised  that,  it  was  not  tokenism,  it  was  a  recognition  that  the  Government  had  some 
<br/>responsibility, Parliament which makes law about FNPF has a certain responsibility to look at those 
<br/>members who actually went to become members and worked in the country to ensure that they have 
<br/>retirement.  So, we provided additional $100 for those below 70 years and those over 70 years, $125. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  working  with  the  FNPF  to  look  at  how  best  we  can  further 
<br/>compensate and make sure that those who are still alive, those who are still on reduced pension and 
<br/>those who took lump sums and have not been able to maintain their income level are compensated.  
<br/>That is what the FNPF, Mr. Speaker, Sir, going forward will do. I know the Chairperson gave the 
<br/>responses on a number of recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All those recommendations make sense, and as a Government, we will be working with FNPF 
<br/>very closely to make sure that some of the legacy issues are addressed to the satisfaction of, not only 
<br/>the pension plus making sure that the FNPF remains a credible retirement pension fund, not just a 
<br/>fund where people put their contributions, get the interest rate and withdraw it towards the end of 
<br/>their retirement. That is what the FNPF Board and the management are working on.  I want to thank 
<br/></span><span>the  Board,  Chairman,  CEO  and  the  management  team  for  co-operating  and  working  with  the 
<br/></span><span>Government and managing FNPF in light of the challenges that are there to ensure that it remains a 
<br/>credible retirement Fund.
