<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the following Ministers have given notice to make 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements under Standing Order 40:   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport; and 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Minister for Agriculture and Waterways 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministers  may  speak  up  to  20  minutes  and  after  the  Minister,  I  will  then  invite  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate, to speak on the Statement for no more than 
<br/>five minutes. There will be no other debate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Water Sector 2050 Strategy 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker,  the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, members of the public in the gallery 
<br/>and  those  who  are  listening  in  nationally;  I  am  pleased  to  stand  today  to  brief  this  esteemed 
<br/>Parliament on Fiji’s first National Water Sector Strategy officially launched as the Water Sector 2050 
<br/>Strategy earlier this month in the presence of all our major development partners.  Before I delve into 
<br/>the document, I would like to stress on the profound significance of the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, 
<br/>as  the  roadmap  for  climate  resilient  and  equitable  water  and  sanitation  service  provision  for  all 
<br/>Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Water Sector 2050 highlights the Coalition Government’s robust commitment 
<br/>to address water and sanitation issues that continue to affect so many of our citizens. As I stand here, 
<br/>I note the difference between 16 years of previous Government versus just 16 months of this Coalition 
<br/>Government.    In  16  years,  Sir,  under  the  rule  of  those  opposite,  our  water  sector  endured  sheer 
<br/>neglect. They had no plan and, at worse, they continued to reduce Water Authority of Fiji’s much 
<br/>needed capital budget. In just 16 months, this Government has worked with all segments of the Fijian 
<br/>society with our development partners with the renewed focus to restore the water sector.  The Water 
<br/>Sector 2050 Strategy is our plan to deliver on that vision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, soon after my appointment as a Minister for Public Works, I was briefed by 
<br/>the Water Authority of Fiji’s Executive Team on the state of the water infrastructure the Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government inherited from the previous Government. It was obvious to me at that very moment that 
<br/></span><span>we cannot get out of the mess that we have inherited by doing more of the same and keep on doing 
<br/>more of the same as the FijiFirst Government, which was the </span><span>ad hoc</span><span> reactive strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  of  the  first  task,  we  appointed  a  skills-based  Board  with  the  right  experience  and 
<br/>qualifications, to lead the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF).  I tasked the new Board and the Executive 
<br/>to urgently develop a Strategic Action Plan to improve water and sanitation for all Fijians.  I must

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>327 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commend  the  Chairman  of  the  Water  Authority  of  Fiji  Board,  Ratu  Savenaca  Seniloli,  for  his 
<br/>leadership in making the Water Sector 2050 Strategy a reality.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  quote  the  honourable  Prime  Minister’s  speech,  included  in  the  Water 
<br/>Strategy’s  Foreword,  “This  plan is  more than just  a blueprint  for development, it  is  a promise to 
<br/>prioritise  developing  of  our  people.  It  is  a  call  to  action  for  collaboration  and  cooperation  across 
<br/>sectors and communities.” Significantly, the Coalition Government is not planning for its survival in 
<br/>four years, but is planning for the next three decades, irrespective of who is in government. We are 
<br/>not here for political survival, but we are here for the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  collaboration  and  cooperation  has  been  the  hallmark  or  process  that  WAF 
<br/>followed in developing the Strategy.  This included consultation with major development partners 
<br/>through an ideation workshop which kick started the journey.  The workshop formed the basis for 
<br/>the national debate during the National Economic Summit in April 2023. This was followed with 
<br/>consultation  workshops  in  Suva,  Nadi  and  Labasa,  reaching  out  to  WAF  customers  and  all 
<br/>stakeholders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Strategy  outlines  Fiji’s  Water  Sector  Priority  Projects  and  Programmes  over  the  next 
<br/>three decades, aimed at transforming our services are delivered, responding to climate vulnerability, 
<br/>renewing  our  aging  water  and  wastewater  infrastructure,  contributing  to  the  succulent  economy, 
<br/>enhancing the national environment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, with the support from our key development partners such as UNDP, World Bank and 
<br/>Asian  Development  Bank,  WAF  was  able  to  carry  out  extensive  research,  rigorous  stakeholder 
<br/>consultation and obtained innovative expert insights. It is, therefore, a direct product of the first ever 
<br/>collective planning exercise that united stakeholders from the public sector, private sector, tourism, 
<br/>NGOs, academia, development partners, as well as citizens. The document is not just a list of priority 
<br/>projects and investments, it is a shared vision for water and sanitation in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to seek the indulgence of Parliament as I highlight some key investment priorities 
<br/>in  the  Water  Sector  2050  Strategy.    It  identifies  that  $3.5  billion  is  required  over  the  next  three 
<br/>decades to improve the water infrastructure. Half of this investment is earmarked for improving asset 
<br/>health, in other words, $1.75 billion is needed to renew Fiji’s new water infrastructure  assets that 
<br/>now need replacement, as they are nearing the end of their life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to reiterate in this august Parliament that the direct result of 16 years of under 
<br/>investment is resulting in current disruptions and inefficiencies.  Just in the long Easter weekend, we 
<br/>experienced a double whammy of climate change and aging infrastructure.  As honourable Members 
<br/>are aware, continuous heavy rainfall caused a landslide rupturing the bulk water pipeline to Tamavua.  
<br/>It resulted in thousands of citizens with no access to water.  Such impacts of climate change now 
<br/>regularly  affect our provision of reliable drinking water.  It is  exactly why the  Strategy identifies 
<br/>critical water assets that now need to be upgraded with robust climate resilient design. I previously 
<br/>informed Parliament in my earlier water updates that our water supply system currently loses around 
<br/>47 percent of the total clean water produce. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nationally,  the  WAF  Team  is  responding  to  over  125  pipe  leak  breaks  for  every  100 
<br/></span><span>kilometres of water pipelines. I would like to point out to those sitting opposite that water assets are 
<br/>not magic pudding, they need maintenance and renewal. Therefore, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy 
<br/>calls for significant urgent investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Strategy adopts a hub-and-spoke model for extending piped water supply to areas 
<br/>currently not serviced by WAF. This model will rely on investing in building water treatment plants 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in larger population than just creating water treatment hubs, water catchments and reservoirs.  As 
<br/>population in the adjoining areas would grow, pipelines will be extended to connect the hubs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the key identified projects moving forward are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  Northern  Division,  water  treatment  hubs  in  Labasa,  Seaqaqa,  extension  from 
<br/>Savusavu, Nabouwalu water treatment hubs to other population centres; 
<br/>In the Western Division, hubs in Matovo, Keiyasi, Nadarivatu and extension of networks 
<br/>from areas around Nadi.  
<br/>In  the  Central  Division,  hubs  in  Wainadoi  and  Navua  with  extension  networks  in 
<br/>surrounding areas and, of course, additional reservoirs in strategic locations as mentioned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  let  me  focus  on  wastewater  and  sanitation  aspects  of  the  Strategy.  These  requires  or 
<br/>identifies a dire need of $5 billion in investments, including infrastructure and management.  The 
<br/>complete and utter neglect of wastewater over the last 16 years is nowhere more obvious than in the 
<br/>wastewater infrastructure.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The previous Government developed Fiji’s National Development Plan 2017-2036 and that 
<br/>Plan promised that they would ensure improved sanitation, promising 78 percent of the population 
<br/>will have access to centralised sewage system by 2036.  Sir, as of today, only 17 percent of urban 
<br/>residential  customers  have  access  to  sewage  sanitation  infrastructure,  a  staggering  78  percent  of 
<br/>residents rely on septic systems.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Fiji currently has no infrastructure in place to receive and treat septic faecal sludge 
<br/>from the systems.  The current state of wastewater infrastructure suggests that while the previous 
<br/>Government had developed the National Development Plan, they were not serious about investing in 
<br/>wastewater  infrastructure.  The  WAF’s  11  out  of  11  wastewater  treatment  plants  do  not  have  the 
<br/>capacity to effectively treat wastewater they receive, they are well over-capacity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the strategic pillars underpinning the Water Sector 2050 Strategy is environment and 
<br/>tourism nexus.  Sustainable tourism development is heavily dependent on healthy and pristine rivers 
<br/>and beaches.  The wastewater services need to be urgently upgraded to ensure healthy rivers and 
<br/>beaches into which treated affluent is often discarded. Collaboration with our development partners 
<br/>is  critical  to  develop  the  urgent  upgrade  of  WAF’s  aging  wastewater  infrastructure  to  ensure 
<br/>environmental compliance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that front, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Wastewater Sector Strategy identifies upgrade works to 
<br/></span><span>the Kinoya Wastewater Treatment Plant as number one priority, and further discussions and progress 
<br/>is being made with our development partners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the Water Sector 2050 Strategy has given the current Coalition Government or those who 
<br/>will  be  coming  after  us,  let  me  emphasise,  coming  after  us,  it  does  not  have  to  be  us,  so  we  are 
<br/>forward  looking  and  not  for  our  political  survival,  with  a  structured  roadmap  to  implement.    To 
<br/>develop vision of this Strategy, we need to work together and look beyond one term parliamentary 
<br/>politics.  Water infrastructure by definition requires long term thinking, and I urge the honourable 
<br/></span><span>Members on both sides to familiarise themselves with this document and committing for us to work 
<br/></span><span>together to making it a reality. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to end by noting that this Coalition Government has already made some tough 
<br/>decisions to  save the Fijian economy.   The Water Sector 2050 Strategy now provides us  with  an 
<br/></span><span>opportunity to invest in this critical essential service with a significant multiplier effect to strengthen 
<br/></span><span>the economy even further.  A total investment need of $8.5 billion is, indeed, a sobering number.  It 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>329 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is obvious that the entire amount cannot be afforded by public sector investment.  Asset upgrades for 
<br/>climate resilience will be suitable for seeking climate finance, which is what we are pursuing at the 
<br/>moment.  At the same time, public-private sector partnership opportunities, especially in wastewater, 
<br/>will  be  explored.    Our  development  partners  like  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the  European 
<br/>Investment Bank and World Bank, who have been part of this Water Sector 2050 Strategy, will also 
<br/>play a key role. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unlike  our  predecessors,  this  Coalition  Government  understands  that  water  infrastructure 
<br/>needs investment and we will not shy away from making tough decisions in moving forward.  We 
<br/>also  understand  that  a  financially  viable  WAF  will  be  critical  for  delivering  on  the  Water  Sector 
<br/>Strategy.  The financial model needs to be re-examined, there needs to be reduced dependency on 
<br/>public  sector  grants,  which  will  give  the  WAF  more  autonomy  and  financial  viability,  which  is 
<br/>something we envisage in the not too distant future.  I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to very briefly speak on the Water Sector 
<br/>Strategy for 2050 and I congratulate Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) for taking it to the next step.  It 
<br/>is the height of naivety for this Government to imagine that just because it came into being that this 
<br/>Water Sector Strategy actually came in.  The formulation of this was something that was already in 
<br/>place, so to try to take all the applause or credit for that, is really, really idiotic, to say the least.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you go back to  the National  Development  Plan for 2017-2037, one of the major policy 
<br/>outcomes there is to come up with a next stage of the Water Strategy.  That was part of the 2017-
<br/>2022 plan, so these things were already in motion… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- …all these things that you are talking about.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- For 16 years, you did not have a strategy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- First of all, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to say, it is great that this is 
<br/>being done.  I want to congratulate the WAF Board that was there before this current Board, and I 
<br/>think we have a very good team at WAF - Dr. Amit Chanan, Mr. Seru Soderberg and the Team.  They 
<br/>have been very good at putting all these things together, then we have seen progress.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we had the 2017 Strategy, the access to clean water was only around 78 percent.  From 
<br/>that time, it has gone up to 82 percent.  The target that we had was to go up to 92 percent.  There 
<br/>have been challenges because when you are talking about water, there is always the challenge of 
<br/>dealing with your own infrastructure and meeting your current needs.  One of the problems that we 
<br/>have had over these past few years is the explosion of population into these greater Suva urban area.  
<br/>For the people at WAF, you always have to think, “Shall I use money just to replace the aging assets 
<br/>but also meet the current need?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- It took you eight years before you worked it up?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hang on, hang on!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Did you have a strategy for that?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- These things were in the process and we are glad to see that that is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taking place.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Tamavua Water Plant was built in 1961, the next one that came after 
<br/>that was Waila in 1982.  The first government that used Green Climate Funds to deal with the biggest 
<br/>water problem that we have in Fiji was the FijiFirst Government that came up with the project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  J.  USAMATE.-  That  is  something  that  is  now  in  place  in  2024.    So,  it  shows  the 
<br/>devotion of the FijiFirst Government at that time, to make sure that we can meet this need for water 
<br/>for everyone.  Yes, that challenge is with sanitation with the treatment of wastewater, but there is a 
<br/>whole lot of other issues in that.  It is not just about the plants, it is about the wrong stuff getting into 
<br/>the pipes - stormwater, wastage from the various factories and commercial areas, all of these things  
<br/>had to be addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I must say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate WAF.  The honourable Minister now is riding on 
<br/>the horse that was already moving before he got there. The saddle was there, the stirrups were there, 
<br/>and he has gone hullabaloo saying,</span><span> </span><span>“We did it all along.” So, thank you, WAF, and we look forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By the way, honourable Minister, it is not a plan, it is just a strategy. After this, you have to 
<br/>develop a plan.  There is a difference between a strategy and a plan. A plan is what your actual target 
<br/>is. If you go to the National Development Plan (NDP), you will see the specific targets that were 
<br/>there for 2017 to 2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish the honourable Minister well because the people of this country need water.  There has 
<br/>been no Government in the annals of Fiji’s history that has done as much for water as the FijiFirst 
<br/>Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  It  is  great  to  listen  to  these  kinds  of  positive  speeches  where  even  the 
<br/>Opposition are praising the Board of the current Water Authority of Fiji. That is quite pleasant to 
<br/>hear, and I only hope we continue that way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drainage Plans for Farmers and Reinstatement of Drainage Board 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Cabinet Ministers, 
<br/>honourable Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, those in the gallery and those watching 
<br/>the live telecast; I rise to make a statement on the state and progress of the drainage plans for farmers 
<br/>in the Western, Central and Northern Divisions, and the reinstatement of the Drainage Board.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the importance of Fiji’s waterways, historically and currently, cannot be 
<br/>over-emphasized. Our major rivers and streams and creeks have sustained our people’s livelihoods 
<br/>as a means of transportation, source of food and supply of the much-needed water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if we take good care of our waterways, such that there is less pollution, 
<br/></span><span>erosion, dumping of household garbage, plastic bottles, containers and bags, these same waterways 
<br/></span><span>can be transformed into what it used to look like historically, and re-used as a means of transportation 
<br/>and livelihood for the majority of our population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  wish  to  make  clear  that  the  Waterways  Division  of  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways is specifically tasked with de-silting the main waterways which includes 
<br/>our major rivers and main drains within the drainage scheme areas. It is important to note that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>331 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maintenance of farm drains that discharge into these main drains falls under the care of individual 
<br/>farmers. Rest assured that the wellbeing of our farmers who play a crucial role in our community 
<br/>remains a primary focus for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  taken  significant  steps  to  recognize  the  importance  of 
<br/>drainage  and  protecting  farmlands  and  wellbeing  and  reducing  flood  risks.  As  part  of  this  effort, 
<br/>FJ$1.5 million has been allocated to the drainage of farmland areas through the Hire of Machinery 
<br/>Programme in the Ministry budget for this financial year. This initiative is a fundamental part of the 
<br/>Ministry’s strategy to tackle the impacts of flooding in farmland areas, including the Sigatoka valley.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  also  initiated  several  proactive  measures  through  the 
<br/>Programme  mentioned  above  to  improve  drainage  infrastructure  in  agricultural  areas.    These 
<br/>initiatives involve maintaining current main drains, including building new ones, installing suitable 
<br/>water management systems and enforcing soil conservation activities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in addition, the Ministry has effectively addressed requests from farmers by 
<br/>utilising  the  hire  of  machinery  contracts  with  civil  contracting  companies  in  the  Sigatoka  area  to 
<br/>perform the desilting of 24.2 kilometres of main drains and ensure sustainability of farmland in the 
<br/>valley.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as  of now, the Drainage for Farmland Areas Programme has effectively 
<br/>cleared  69.3  kilometres  of  primary  drains  in  the  Western  Division,  assisting  approximately  295 
<br/>farmers.  However, there are still around 380 kilometres of drainage awaiting completion which, once 
<br/>finished, will bring benefits to more than 1,000 farmers.  Additionally, the Ministry will conduct 233 
<br/>kilometres and 262 kilometres of drain excavation and desilting works in the Northern and Central 
<br/>Divisions respectively, assisting approximately 1,158 farmers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  is  committed  to  tackling 
<br/>drainage issues in all active agricultural producing areas with the view to strengthening the resilience 
<br/>of our farming communities.  Clearing of the main drains through desilting will promote better water 
<br/>flow and minimise the chances of localised flooding during periods of heavy rain in the short-term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways  is  collaborating  with  the 
<br/>Ministry of Sugar and the Drainage Board, to  ensure that all main drains  connected to  sugarcane 
<br/>growing areas are maintained.  The Ministry machines are currently being utilised to upgrade farm 
<br/>access roads, and to maintain main drains in the sugarcane growing areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Ministry  staff  have  also  had  meetings  with  their  counterparts  from 
<br/>Municipalities and the National Disaster Management Office on the state of drains that come under 
<br/>the Municipalities and how those drains are contributing to blockages from irresponsible garbage 
<br/>disposal.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipalities  currently  do  not  have  a  budget  for  clearing  and  maintaining  drains,  so  the 
<br/>Ministry will work closely with the Ministry of Local Government on how this can be accommodated 
<br/>under  the  current  budget.    We  need  to  consult  on  future  budgeting  with  the  Ministry  of  Local 
<br/></span><span>Government for the maintenance of drains under the Municipalities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are also main drains connected to drains that fall under the jurisdiction 
<br/>of the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), which are also in need of timely maintenance and clearing, to 
<br/>ensure necessary water flow.  The Ministry is collaborating with the FRA to identify these drains and 
<br/>work with them to ensure that these drains are cleared in a timely manner.

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, based on the complaints received through my Office and the Waterways 
<br/>Division,  it  is  evident  that  the  abolition  of  the  Drainage  Board  seven  years  ago  has  significantly 
<br/>contributed to majority of the problems relating to blocked drains and flooding that we face now, 
<br/>which has led to negligence of drainage infrastructure, with total neglect of the collapsed floodgates 
<br/>and clogged main drains during that period. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to inform this august 
<br/>Parliament that during my participation in the 2023-2024 National Budget debate, I had discussed 
<br/>and  proposed  the  re-establishment  of  the  Drainage  Board.  I  am  grateful  for  the  support  of  the 
<br/>Coalition  Government  in  passing  the  Drainage  (Amendment)  Act  2023,  which  enabled  the 
<br/>reinstatement of the Drainage Board in Fiji.  Just a few days ago, on 11</span><span>th</span><span> April, the Ministry formally 
<br/>welcomed and inducted 35 new members to the Drainage Board.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  rationale  for  introducing  the  Drainage  Board  is  based  on  its  crucial 
<br/>function in maintaining designated drains throughout the Northern, Central and Western Divisions.  
<br/>These drains encompass essential structures such as turbine, seawalls, access roads, culvert crossings, 
<br/>main drains and outfall structures including flood gates, flap gates and spillways.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With a combined total value reaching into the millions, these projects primarily benefit both, 
<br/>sugarcane and non-sugar agricultural land.  Acknowledging the crucial impact that efficient drainage 
<br/>systems  have  on  farming,  environmental  protection  and  mitigating  disaster  risks,  highlights  the 
<br/>necessity of reviving the Drainage Board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  consequences  of  the  abolition  taken  seven  years  ago  led  to  the 
<br/>elimination of sanctioned drainage schemes under the previous Administration, creating unplanned 
<br/>development which converted land that had approved drainage schemes into residential subdivisions.  
<br/>The  increase  in  rural-urban  migration  resulted  in  most  of  these  unplanned  development  and 
<br/>expansion of residential subdivisions, which impacted both, sugarcane and non-sugar cane farmers 
<br/>in Fiji.  As a result, the re-established Drainage Board is confronted with a daunting task of meeting 
<br/>these  diverse  demands  from  the  sector  to  mitigate  drainage  issues,  and  to  ensure  efficient  water 
<br/>management by all parties involved.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Acting  within  my  capacity  as  Minister  responsible,  as  I  had  alluded  to,  members  of  the 
<br/>Drainage Board have been appointed and each Board will comprise of a chairman, a secretary and 
<br/>an  engineer  from  the  Waterways  Division.    This  ensures  a  comprehensive  representation  and  the 
<br/>availability of technical expertise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through collaborative efforts, a Standard Operating Procedure is formulated, 
<br/>ensuring  a  streamline  process  for  addressing  grievances  from  the  farmers,  stakeholders  and  the 
<br/>public.    This  framework  will  enable  a  smooth  transfer  of  relevant  information  to  the  Waterways 
<br/>Division  and  the  Drainage  Board  for  timely  maintenance  and  mitigation  actions,  promoting 
<br/>transparency and responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in our pursuit to improve service delivery, we are committed to tackling not 
<br/>just the drainage problems in the Sigatoka Valley, but also to address farmland drainage issues across 
<br/></span><span>Fiji.  These issues can be achieved through the ongoing Drainage for Farmland Programme within 
<br/></span><span>the Waterways Division.  The aim is to bolster resilience, safeguard livelihoods and ensure success 
<br/>and sustainability of our agriculture sector in the face of evolving climatic conditions.  Moreover, the 
<br/>re-establishment of the Drainage Board will complement the Ministry’s efforts to address the various 
<br/>issues and obstacles impacting farmers and stakeholders in Fiji.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, finally, I plead to all users of our national waterways, whether it be our 
<br/>major rivers, streams, creeks or main drains - let us act responsibly to keep them clean.  Please, refrain 
<br/>from dumping household garbage into our waterways, as these can cause unnecessary blockage that 
<br/>leads  to  unnecessary  flooding  and  contributes  to  unforeseen  hardships  within  our  communities.  
<br/>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  respond  to  the  Ministerial  Statement  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways.  To begin with, I would like to congratulate the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways for the appointment of the Drainage Board.  I 
<br/>hope these Boards are not just a setup but has good tooth to bite with and would love to see some 
<br/>work done by them.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FijiFirst Government had a reason for abolishing the Drainage Board.  Previously, these 
<br/>Boards only looked after their own areas and were not concentrating on the holistic approach.  For 
<br/>example, if a Board in Lakena is appointed, they will only look at the drainage in Lakena. What it 
<br/>does to the water or drainage in the other areas, whether it gets flooded or not, is not their concern.  
<br/>That is why the Ministry of Waterways was set up, to look at the holistic approach and that was what 
<br/>we were doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  setting  up  of  the  Drainage  Board  is  duplication  of  duties  -  we  have  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Waterways and then we have the Drainage Board.  Is the Ministry not capable of doing its own work? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- That is why flooding is everywhere. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- The management of fresh water is also a key part of the drainage system.  
<br/>So, is this Drainage Board which the honourable Minister has very proudly set up, will be involved 
<br/>in the management of waterways and the freshwater system?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, $1.5 million has been allocated for drainage in this financial year and the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  has  said  that  they  have  done  substantial  amount  of  drainage  in  the  Western 
<br/>Division, and he is planning to do some in the Central and Eastern Divisions.  However, he failed to 
<br/>mention the Northern Division.  What is being done in the Northern Division?  Are people there not 
<br/>requiring drainage solutions?  Farms in Soasoa always get flooded with seawater during heavy rain 
<br/>and nothing has been done about that.  I would have loved to see a holistic approach where all the 
<br/>areas are taken into consideration.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the drainage waterways, where is the demarcation of boundaries?  There is town council 
<br/>drains, road drains, FSC drains and there is agricultural drains.  Will the Drainage Board look after 
<br/>all these drains, or is the Ministry of Agriculture and Waterways going to look after the other areas 
<br/>and the Drainage Board is only looking after the rural and agricultural drains?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I see a lot of duplication of duties.  I do not see a holistic approach, and setting up of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Drainage Board is just a promise being fulfilled by the Coalition Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Holistic approach brought you nothing! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  It  is  just  a  promise  that  is  being  fulfilled.    It  is  creating  jobs  for  old 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>supporters and cronies so that they can come and sit in the Board.

<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Time will tell if they have tooth to bite.  Time will tell if waterways in this 
<br/>country  has  improved.    Let  me  remind  Parliament,  especially  the  Government  side,  that  no 
<br/>government  either previously or now, has done  as much as the  FijiFirst  Government  has done in 
<br/>terms of drainage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. NAND.- In 16 months, how much have you done?  So, put your money where your 
<br/>mouth is and get the drains intact.  Do not create boards just to show the public that you are doing 
<br/>duties.  Get the drainage issues solved, get the flood issues resolved. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  I  thank    the  Opposition  for  their  response  and  I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>intend to adjourn Parliament now for morning tea.

<br/>to come back and reply.
