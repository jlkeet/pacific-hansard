<div><span>Fiji’s Membership of GDN – Progress of 
<br/>(Question No. 02/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises  and  Veteran  Affairs  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  Fiji’s  Membership  of  the  Assembly  of  the  Global  Development  Network 
<br/>(GDN)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- I thank the honourable Member for her question for oral reply.  Before 
<br/>I do so, I acknowledge the students of the University of the South Pacific and I convey to them the 
<br/>condolences  of  the  Government  on  the  loss  of  Dr.  Samu  Bogitini,  a  long  serving  member  of  the 
<br/>University.  He started as the Director of Labasa Centre before it became a full blown Campus and 
<br/>asked me to be the Chairman of the Advisory Committee to the University Centre in Labasa.  Our 
<br/>condolences go to his family and the sad thing is that his younger daughter graduated on the day he 
<br/>died. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question.  The Global Development 
<br/>Network  (GDN)  is  a  public  international  organisation  that  supports  high  quality,  policy-oriented, 
<br/>social science research in low and middle income countries with a mission to promote better lives.  
<br/>The GDN promotes research on the premise that contextualised the local driven research that leads 
<br/>to more informed policies, increased policy ownership, better informed implementation and more 
<br/>sustainable and inclusive development choices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  GDN  also  focuses  on  strengthening  research  capacity  across  countries  and  their 
<br/>disciplines.    The  GDN  fosters  collaborative  efforts  among  socio-economic  research  institutions, 
<br/>individual researchers, policy makers and donors that encourage capacity building and networking 
<br/>to accelerate development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since 1999, GDN has supported over 4,000 development research grantees 
<br/>from over 140 of these countries.  Sir, GDN was created in the aftermath of the landmark World 
<br/>Bank World Development Report 1998/1999 - Knowledge for Development, which set the stage for 
<br/>active promotion of policy research, particularly in developing countries.  Some of their research and 
<br/>findings could easily have been seen as race-based, but it was mostly on the social difficulties that 
<br/></span><span>various groups go through in their countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The GDN Headquarters is in New Delhi, India, with additional presence in Washington DC, 
<br/>USA, and a newly established office in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  Furthermore, GDN works on all 
<br/>aspects  of  development  and  has  previous  experience  in  such  field  such  as  development  finance, 
<br/>agriculture,  research  systems,  governance,  industrial  productivity,  natural  resource  management, 
<br/>biodiversity and education, as it continually incorporates new topics on an annual basis.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  pleased  to  inform  Parliament  that  on  18</span><span>th</span><span>  October,  2023,  Cabinet 
<br/>approved Fiji’s membership of the GDN Assembly, thereby, enhancing participation of our nation in 
<br/>GDN hosted events.  The annual cost of Fiji’s membership is US$100,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Given that Fiji has always played a major role in promoting development 
<br/>in  the  Pacific,  our  membership  of  GDN  will  provide  participating  researchers  and  development 
<br/>practitioners with global recognition and visibility, and further strengthen the work carried out by 
<br/>our people for the development and betterment of the lives at both, local and regional levels. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry of Finance and Strategic Planning, National 
<br/>Development and Statistics is currently coordinating with the University of the South Pacific (USP), 
<br/>on behalf of the Fiji Government, to host the 25</span><span>th</span><span> Annual Global Development Conference in Fiji in 
<br/>November of this year, marking the return of GDN flagship event to the Pacific. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji to host this historic meeting is timely, as  the Coalition Government 
<br/>has re-established the Strategic Planning Office within the Ministry of Finance to ensure better co-
<br/>ordination and formulation of a strategic and robust development pathway for the nation.  Through 
<br/>the Conference, we envisage building our research capacity, improving our network capacity and our 
<br/>networking  and  also  strengthening  collaboration  with  universities,  as  well  as  with  GDN  member 
<br/>countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Conference will be an important step in Fiji’s global engagement around 
<br/>sustainable  development  issues.  Fiji  has  commenced  initial  discussions  with  the  GDN  and  the 
<br/>planning and logistic aspects of hosting that Conference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  alluded  earlier,  the  Strategic  Planning  Office  from  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Finance is collaborating with the USP as a co-partner in hosting the event.  The GDN Conference is 
<br/>tentatively scheduled for the last week of November of this year.   The USP, being the local partner, 
<br/>will fund an amount of US$300,000 towards that GDN Conference.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s membership will enable policy makers, researchers, academic and 
<br/>professional bodies to undertake and produce evidence-based policies that are contextualised to the 
<br/>local  and  to  the  region.    The  GDN  will  generate  and  share  knowledge  and  forge  new  working 
<br/>relationships  with  donors,  partners  and  with  key  stakeholders,  to  deepen  research  capacity  at 
<br/>individual and institutional levels.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  hosting  the  annual  GDN  Conference  will  enable  a  larger  contingent  of 
<br/>participants from the Pacific and local and regional research institutions’ knowledge to be featured 
<br/>on a theme to be mutually agreed in line with the 95 development priorities in the Pacific. Fiji will 
<br/>sign the agreement to become a member of the GDN during the 25</span><span>th</span><span> GDN Conference in November 
<br/>of this year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  annual  GDN  involves  high  level  inclusive  evidence-based 
<br/>debates  on  current  development  challenges  and  priorities.  The  GDN  Conference  intends  to  bring 
<br/>around  about  800  participants  in  a  hybrid  mode,  out  of  which  roughly  250  to  400  are  in  person 
<br/></span><span>participants from across sectors and disciplines.  Sir, we will be presenting Fiji to the world, and look 
<br/></span><span>forward to welcoming GDN Conference to Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his 
<br/>response.  In his response, he did mention about building our research capacity which is something 
<br/>that we would appreciate.  My simple question is, will GDN be doing all the research for us now or 
<br/>is there a Ministry that is going to be dedicated and working together with GDN so that we can start  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>337 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with this research capacity that is badly needed locally? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Prime Minister, there are two parts of the question that was 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>being raised.    Is it going to be allocated to a separate Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can  I just elaborate further because there are 
<br/>overlaps in this work. The honourable Prime Minister has mentioned about the Strategic Planning 
<br/>Office,  we  have  Poverty,  and  then  Rural  Development  under  the  Centre  on  Integrated  Rural 
<br/>Development for Asia and the Pacific (CIRDAP) which we are already a member of, so there are 
<br/>overlaps in the work that we do.  With the linkage to GDN, where will the co-ordinating office in 
<br/>Fiji be – USP, Strategic Planning Office or Poverty?  That is my question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it will soon be with the Ministry of Finance and 
<br/>Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics.  They will initially push it forward, they 
<br/>brought a paper to Cabinet to work with the University, and they will have to sort out the finer details 
<br/>of that working towards the Conference in November and also after that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reduction of Duty – Imported Chicken Portions 
<br/>(Question No. 03/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  of  Finance  and  Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  inform  Parliament  of  the  impact  of  the 
<br/>reduction of duty from 15 percent to zero percent on imported chicken portions on the local 
<br/>poultry industry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  his 
<br/>question.  In fact, the question is factually wrong, and I will explain why.  But I think the intention 
<br/>of the question …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have raised a question with the learned Professor here, so having a go at the way the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question was couched, he is trying to answer that.   Let us listen to the answer. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  allowed  the  question  because  the 
<br/>intention of the question is relevant.  I will correct the factual side of it, as well as answer the question 
<br/>in terms of the intent.  Before I do that, let me just set this in the context.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tariff protection has always been an important economic policy tool for countries to protect 
<br/>and support local industries where it is imperative.  In the 1970s and 1980s, we started by that  - we 
<br/>had  huge  protection  for  the  rice  industry,  protection  for  manufacturing  and  some  of  it  is  still 
<br/></span><span>continuing.    These  were  all  done  in  line  with  fair  market  practices  that  eventually,  encouraged 
<br/></span><span>competition and consumer options which could lead to price reduction as well.  The idea of tariff 
<br/>protection, in economics we call it “infant industry argument”, where tariff protection is given to 
<br/>allow industries to grow up, to compete, and progressively reduce the tariff.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Historically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has had substantial protection for numerous local business 
<br/>industries,  and  we  started  with  tariff  reforms.    It  actually  started  under  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>
<div><span>338 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable  Prime  Minister,  Sitiveni  Rabuka,  in  the  1990s.    It  was  designed  to  promote  trade 
<br/>liberalisation, and in some sense, this outward looking strategy for economic growth paid dividend.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite  the  initial  reforms,  certain  protections  persisted  and  were  supported  by  all 
<br/>Governments  in  Fiji  and  continued  over  a  period  of  time.    Some,  however,  have  been  gradually 
<br/>phased out and the subsequent phasing out involved assessing and lowering of fiscal duties, and the 
<br/>most common form of protection is tariff protection - import duties and taxes on imports.  Of course, 
<br/>the old strategy, again, was quota, but most countries do not go towards quota anymore, it is basically 
<br/>tariff protection.  The global trading environment is one designed to gradually reduce tariff.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the poultry industry, this is one of the most heavily protected 
<br/>industries in Fiji.  The good news, as a result of that, is that we are almost self-sufficient.  However, 
<br/>self-sufficiency and the support for local industry must be carefully balanced with the cost to our 
<br/>people.  What happens is, sometimes when the tariff rate is very high, even if the item is imported, 
<br/>the cost to the consumers can be very, very high and we need to ensure that industries that get tariff 
<br/>protection are, at the same time, able to reduce prices, improve quality and offer greater choice to 
<br/>consumers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we recognise and reduce the import excise duty on chicken 
<br/>portions from 10 percent to zero percent, not 15 percent to zero percent.  So, it was the import excise 
<br/>duty on chicken portions only, not the whole chicken, from 10 percent to zero percent and not 15 
<br/>percent to zero percent, as the question puts out.  That is why I said it is factually incorrect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But more importantly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, despite the reduction from 10 percent to zero percent 
<br/>in the import excise duty, the duty of 32 percent still remains.  So, even if someone who is importing 
<br/>chicken portions today, that importer still pays 32 percent instead of the original 42 percent. So, a 
<br/>total tariff protection of 42 percent is still applicable for anything which includes whole chicken other 
<br/>than chicken portions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  we  found  out,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  when  we  were  doing  the  budget,  even  with  the  42 
<br/>percent duty, some of the importers of chicken portions, chicken wings and chicken drumstick were  
<br/>still able to sell in the local market at a lower price than our local producers and that to me was, in 
<br/>some sense, unethical, because we realised that the whole chicken still has a duty of 42 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we  have in  this  country, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is  that  we are only,  at  the 
<br/>moment, importing chicken from New Zealand.  If we import chicken from Indonesia, for example, 
<br/>and Indonesia has quality chicken, Japan imports (from the figures that I saw) about 40 percent of 
<br/>chickens from Indonesia,  we will probably end up landing the chicken here with 42 percent duty and 
<br/>still sell those chickens at a much lower price than what our local producers sell.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we did in the budget, we reduced the duty and extended it to lamb, 
<br/>beef, prawns, ducks, corned meat and tinned fish, to facilitate price reductions for domestic products. 
<br/>What we have found is that the prices of some of those items actually came down.  While we reduce 
<br/>the  duty  on  chicken  portions,  we  have  still  maintained  a  high  level  of  protection  for  the  whole 
<br/>chicken, which is about 42 percent - 32 percent fiscal duty, plus the 10 percent import excise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, I want to repeat, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the highest level of protection.  After the 
<br/>Budget, some of the producers played funny.  It was all designed to bring out this negativity about 
<br/>the Budget and suddenly because of the Budget, because of the increase in VAT from 9 percent to 
<br/>15  percent  on  some  of  the  items,  that  suddenly  the  price  of  chicken  went  up  and  then  when  the 
<br/>Government intervened, the prices were brought down. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="19">Page 19</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>339 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- It has gone up again. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- The other point that we want to make, Mr. Speaker, is the 
<br/>local producers.  Between the three of them, they employ 2,400 people, and we know that even with 
<br/>the reduction in duty for chicken portions, their profitability has not been affected because the sign 
<br/>that we are getting, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, on the other day, 
<br/>officiated at the new investment made by Crest (another $22 million) and all the producers that we 
<br/>had discussions with are actually, in the end. satisfied with what the Government had done.  So, I do 
<br/>not see, Mr. Speaker, any significant impact on the local production as far as investment and what 
<br/>the three producers are getting.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the point I want to make, again, as I have said, is that the poultry industry 
<br/>is still one of the most heavily protected industries. The Government is paying for it.  When we put 
<br/>those very high duty, the cost, even if there was zero VAT, if you raise the duty, it is a tax on the 
<br/>consumers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The people who import, Mr. Speaker, Sir, do not pay for those taxes. All they do is simply 
<br/>pass it onto the consumers.  So, if someone imports whole chicken, for example, from New Zealand, 
<br/>they pay 42 percent duty and if they sell it in the market, they are not the ones who are going to 
<br/>subsidise. They will simply add that 42 percent onto the cost.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  the  signal  that  we  provided  in  the  Budget,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  was  to  say  to  the  local 
<br/>producers,  “Look  at  your  pricing,  look  at  your  efficiency.  Do  not  just  concentrate  on  making 
<br/>exorbitant  profit  at  the  cost  of  the  prices  to  the  consumers.”  In  terms  of  jobs  (2,400),  yes,  we 
<br/>appreciate that -n2,400 families or less than that, but the important thing is that we have 800,000 
<br/>people in the country. So, that is the message that we wanted to give to the producers as a result of 
<br/>what we did and it brought down the prices of chicken portions, wings, and people appreciate that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.  NAND.-  A  supplementary  question,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    Before  I  ask  my 
<br/>supplementary question, I would like to correct the honourable Deputy Prime Minister.  In the </span><span>Daily 
<br/>Hansard </span><span>of Friday, 30</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2023, it states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The Government will also reduce import excise on chicken portions such as wings, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>drumstick, legs, feet, thighs, et cetera, from 15 percent to zero percent.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is mentioned 15 percent to zero percent. If you are saying this is wrong, you should have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gone and corrected the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- The  question is, has your reduction in duty worked?  How long does it 
<br/>take for a whole chicken to be cut in four or five portions and shipped to Fiji to destroy our local 
<br/>chicken industry and you have set the precedence? Has the reduction in duty from 15 percent (as 
<br/>mentioned in the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>) to zero percent worked? Has the price of chicken portions come 
<br/>down significantly? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear, it is from 10 
<br/>percent to zero percent, that is the protection.  It could have been a mistake, but the point is, when 
<br/>you reduce the duty and the duty, as I have said very clearly is not produced on a whole chicken. I 
<br/>also said that even with the 42 percent duty, those who were importing chicken portions were actually 
<br/>selling at a lower price than what was available locally. The price of chicken portions now being 
<br/>imported with a reduction duty of 10 percent (import excise duty) the prices have gone down.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is more from the consumer perspective.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The intent of the policy was to assist consumers to get affordable protein.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The intension was good, but if you look at the pricing itself, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with 15 percent 
<br/>VAT increase  -10 percent  reduction in  the duty, still the price has not  been  cheaper.   Chicken is 
<br/>consumed by each and every household.  If you go to the supermarket, you can see the price have 
<br/>gone up.  In fact, my question to the honourable Minister is, can the Minister admit that his policy 
<br/>failed and that it failed the consumers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  sometimes, I do not get what the Opposition 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is trying to point out.  What is their point? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.PRASAD.-  On  one  hand,  they  are  worried  about  the  impact  on  the 
<br/>producers, suddenly they turned away from consumers to be concerned about the impact it will have 
<br/>on the producers, then they are saying, “Oh, because of the reduction in the duty, you are not going 
<br/>to have….” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The answer to her question is, firstly, she is wrong because the VAT of 9 percent it is not an 
<br/>increase of 15 percent, VAT was increased from 9 percent to 15 percent.  Before the budget, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we had three rates of VAT.  We had zero on basic food items, we had 9 percent on 
<br/>others, and we had 15 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. P.D. Kumar interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- She is caught now!  She said VAT increased by 15 percent.  
<br/>The VAT only increased by 6 percent. The reduction in duty was 10 percent, so there is a 4 percent 
<br/>net reduction in the cost to the produce and that has been passed on to the consumers.  If they go 
<br/>around  and  look  at  the  price  in  the  market,  ask  the  consumers  who  are  buying  chicken  portions, 
<br/>chicken wings, chicken drumstick, they will find that the prices have gone down further because even 
<br/>with the 9 percent VAT and even with the 42 percent duty, the prices were lower than what was being 
<br/>made locally.  So, that is a policy that is working. It is a signal to the producers to look at their own 
<br/>pricing, become more competitive and pass better prices to the consumers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my supplementary question would be, while we 
<br/>actually give duty protection to certain industries  in Fiji, is Government looking at some kind of 
<br/>price regulations because what we have seen is that, when some of these companies are given duty 
<br/>protection of 30 percent or 33 percent, at the end of the day, their gross profit is much more than 
<br/>what their duty protection is.  So, if we are giving duty protection, is the Government actually.… 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj, the issue regarding the first question that was raised 
<br/></span><span>is to do with chicken - the 15 percent, zero percent and 10 percent VAT that has been added and 
<br/>decreased, so that is the argument that is going around.  So, what are you really referring?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am still referring to the poultry industry, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR .- Chicken.

<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>341 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- There are only three producers that are being affected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Yes, because if there are only two or three,  price curtailing  can go 
<br/>on and I think the honourable Minister of  Finance is well versed with this particular scenario where 
<br/>it has actually happened in the past.  So, what I am asking is for all the industries that do get duty 
<br/>protection, is the Government intending to do some price regulation so that this massive GP is not 
<br/>actually obtained by this particular industry?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the question makes a lot of sense and 
<br/>I thank the honourable Member because he his right.  If the producers are not passing the benefits of 
<br/>protection - the profits that they make to the consumers, then it is unethical and some of them engage 
<br/>in unethical pricing.  I think, as a Government, price control is economically not the best thing to do 
<br/>when  you  are  trying  to  promote  competition  and  all  that,  but  if  the  Government  finds  that  our 
<br/>producers, having had this huge protection, are not moving towards providing a price which makes 
<br/>sense, from their point of view, the profit they make and what the Government provides in terms of 
<br/>protection, then the question is right, that Government will have to look at price regulation as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think there is an End of Week Statement on the Dairy Industry but for 10 years, we had 32 
<br/>percent protection for the import of dairy products.  We protected one company and look at the prices 
<br/>of milk, butter, et cetera, until that 10 year period ended.  You now see a reduction in the price of 
<br/>milk and dairy products generally. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue about price regulation in the face of a lot of protection, a lot of the 
<br/>producers have carried on like that for many, many years at the expense of the consumers.  The signal 
<br/>that we provided as a result of the decision we made on chicken portions is exactly that signal, and 
<br/>we want the producers to think about it carefully, pass the right prices to the consumers, at the same 
<br/>time keep on investing and making profit.

<div><span>Benefits of MSME Strategic Plan to MSMEs 
<br/>(Question No. 04/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives, 
<br/>Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on how the proposed 
<br/>MSME  Strategic  Plan  will  benefit  the  MSMEs  and  increase  their  contribution  to  Gross 
<br/>Domestic Product (GDP)? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his 
<br/>question.  Perhaps, before I answer the question, may I be allowed to answer a lot of utterances that 
<br/>have recently been made in media and social media about the Government doing nothing. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Just answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Sir, I was asked when I first came into Government what 
<br/></span><span>did I think.  I said, it is like sitting at high tide in Nabukalou Creek.  When you sit at Nabukalou 
<br/></span><span>Creek at high tide as you know, Sir, everything looks really nice.  It is almost like being in Venice or 
<br/>France, but as soon as that tide goes away, what do you see?  You see the mess that is there. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order, Mr. Speaker.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order on Standing Order 74, Sir, on relevance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.-  I am coming to it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, he can make that part of his speech if he comes up with a 
<br/>Ministerial Statement.  There is a question that is asked of him, could he, please, answer it.   The time 
<br/>for Parliament is quite valuable.  If he wants to answer things that have come up in social media or 
<br/>whatever it is, there is a different forum for him to do it, Sir.  Please, stick to the question.  We value 
<br/>the time that we get because we get little.  please, relevance, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you.  I take note of your concern, honourable Koya, but I will allow 
<br/>the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  he  is  just  coming  to  that  point.    I  always  provide  that 
<br/>allowance to the Opposition.  The floor is yours Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Sir, what I was trying to say is 
<br/>that this is a message to the people of Fiji as well. There are certain things that are a mess in this 
<br/>country. We have just heard the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and 
<br/>Transport talk about it, so that is one aspect.  The second is that we need to plan better in this country. 
<br/>That is why I am making this response here today.  The third is, we are also picking up on the good 
<br/>things that our government did on the other side, Sir.  So, with those ones, we are trying to develop. 
<br/>That is why it is relevant to the answer that I was trying to make. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government, through the Ministry of Trade, Co-operatives, Small and 
<br/>Medium Enterprises and Communications are embarking on, I believe, is probably the first Micro, 
<br/>Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Strategic Plan done, at least, in the last 20 years or so. The 
<br/>last one, I think, was done by the Qarase-led Government, which actually went well until they threw 
<br/>it away, but this is another attempt to actually plan better for the future of this sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We all agree that the sector is a very important one in our country.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 
<br/>actually the backbone of the country, with MSMEs worldwide, accounting for about 50 percent to 
<br/>60 percent of the global GDP, 90 percent of businesses, and 70 percent of global employment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, Sir, there are approximately 30,000 registered MSMEs that account for 82 percent, if 
<br/>not more, if you consider the informal sector.  In addition, over the last three years, the sector has 
<br/>contributed  about  $191  million  in  taxes.    So,  no  doubt,  a  well-crafted  strategic  plan  will  be  an 
<br/>enabling tool to build capacity, organise participatory processes, empower stakeholders, and grow 
<br/>MSMEs in Fiji, as it is very critical.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It will also allow the Government to actually build something that I feel is lacking, which is 
<br/>a comprehensive ecosystem, an ecosystem where, as we all know, MSMEs come into the economy 
<br/>at different levels.  So, there are those that come at the micro-level and there are those that come at 
<br/>the operation level.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  new  strategic  plan  will  ensure  that  all  those  needs  are  addressed  in  a  comprehensive 
<br/>manner,  and  then  it  will  allow  this  Government  to  actually  plan  and  execute  better.  And  I  am 
<br/></span><span>reminded of that saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are hoping this plan will pave the way towards an increased 
<br/>contribution  to  the GDP, hence growing  the economy.  At this stage of the five-year plan, we are 
<br/>looking at a transition from about 18 percent to 25 percent, with a stretch target of maybe 30 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Having said all that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the consultant that we are dealing with through the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="23">Page 23</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>343 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), has been 
<br/>engaged in carrying out consultations in the country from 26</span><span>th</span><span> February, 2024 to 8</span><span>th</span><span> March, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the level of consultations has been very exciting, with 
<br/>contributions  across  the  whole  country  –  from  the  private  sector,  obviously,  the  MSME  Sector 
<br/>themselves,  business  development  providers,  the  banking  institutions  and  also,  a  few  Fintech 
<br/>institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another initiative that occurred during this time, Mr. Speaker, Sir, was the launching of the 
<br/>first  ever  MSME  Conference  from  7</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2024  to  8</span><span>th</span><span>  March,  2024,  which  was  organised  by 
<br/>Business Assistance Fiji, that provided a very valuable platform on which the MSMEs have raised 
<br/>their concerns and also contributed towards the strategic plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some  of  the  key  elements  that  I  would  like  to  share  and,  hopefully,  will  come  out  in  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>strategic plan, include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>A more nationally-defined MSMEs – an actual database for MSMEs, which will allow 
<br/>us to track how our MSMEs are doing across our nation and target assistance where 
<br/>required. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Better coordination amongst Government agencies which will be critical. 
<br/>3.</span><span>
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>More importantly, ensuring that youth and women participation in business occurs in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increase in resource owner participation in business and commercial spaces.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>these sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5.</span><span> </span><span>Adoption of technology and safe transition into digital spaces is also a key. 
<br/>6.</span><span> </span><span>Regulatory compliance, of course, with business registration and others.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the other things that I hope to bring forth in this venture which has never been done is 
<br/>to actually try and enshrine within the education system for that secondary level and at tertiary level 
<br/>MSME entrepreneurial education, so that we do not start building our entrepreneurs up at 30 years, 
<br/>or on retirement, we start  at  a very young age,  Mr. Speaker, Sir.   I have to  say without a formal 
<br/>structure, what we are seeing in the MSME sector amongst our people is very exciting already, so 
<br/>this plan will only enhance their capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By addressing the things that I have mentioned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the plan seeks to maximise 
<br/>MSMEs’ contribution to shared prosperity, inclusive economic growth, sustainable production, and 
<br/>also contribute quite significantly to the Sustainable Development Goals.  In addition, the plan entails 
<br/>to focus on capacity development at MSMEs, including access to finance, formalisation, and also 
<br/>improving digitisation and also assisting with the green and blue economy.  Access to finance is a 
<br/>key challenge for the MSMEs and this Government and the People’s Coalition will do its utmost to 
<br/>ensure that this issue is addressed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the MSME strategic plan will be a comprehensive forward thinking 
<br/>approach that supports the development of MSMEs in Fiji and laying the foundation for sustained 
<br/>growth in the long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In short, the overall vision is to provide a clear path toward increasing GDP contribution, as 
<br/></span><span>I have mentioned, post COVID-19 levels and provide our roadmap with roles, responsibilities and 
<br/></span><span>an execution plan, if you like, to ensure that we have a proper blueprint for MSME development over 
<br/>the next five years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  will  also  have  costing  components,  through  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and 
<br/>Minister of Finance, to navigate what he can provide, but the plan will outline a national vision for 
<br/>MSMEs, a strategic direction where we wish to take the MSMEs and also how we wish to get there.

<div><span>This roadmap with then consolidate from within Government and donor partners that implementation 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to answer this question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Minister for paying such 
<br/>close attention to the MSMEs network.  As we all know, Sir, they form a considerable part of our 
<br/>economy and from memory, I think I remember that they contribute roughly about $300 million in 
<br/>taxes, et cetera, towards our economy pre-COVID-19 and it is about 18 percent of our GDP.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of strategic plans, I also do understand.  Thank you for acknowledging all that has 
<br/>been done within that particular sector at the Ministry and I know you are building on it to do the 
<br/>strategic plan with a lot of work that actually that went into it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the critical  components of this, and I am  getting to my question is, for Fiji, it is  a 
<br/>massive, massive tool for our engine for growth and also with respect to diversification.  I appreciate 
<br/>the fact that he is now going across and doing some work with respect to education, et cetera.  My 
<br/>question is, honourable Minister, this issue of diversification will require massive coordination with 
<br/>different Ministries, et cetera, in order for that to be done.  Will that consultation take place so that, 
<br/>that coordination is done so that we can stop relying so heavily on tourism, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Koya.  Honourable Members, please, take note that 
<br/>even to raise a supplementary question, we have timed that as well.  So, if the bell is sounded, then 
<br/>you have gone over the time allocated for a supplementary question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for that excellent 
<br/>question.  In fact, the MSME strategy is very much part and parcel of the economic diversification 
<br/>of  this  country.    If  you  have  been  hearing  me  in  this  Parliament  when  I  talk  about  economic 
<br/>diversification, the MSMEs come under that particular deliverable, if you like, because it is  very 
<br/>important that we actually drive the economy and diversify it through MSMEs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Allow me just to give one story, Sir.  This is on the potential that exists in the MSMEs sector.  
<br/>There is a very young couple who have an IT company that is already doing IT blockchain solutions 
<br/>for the Government of Seychelles. Now, the Government of Fiji is using them thankfully a lot more.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a couple who have developed something from scratch in Fiji and now 
<br/>have about 20 staff, and the way they are going, they are going to be quite big.  Honourable Koya 
<br/>was supporting them, and we have continued to support them.  These are the types of initiatives that 
<br/>we will commit to support.  So, just to assure honourable Koya, the MSME sector is very much a 
<br/>floundering  sector  when  it  comes  to  the  diversification  of  the  economy  and  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>coordination with other agencies, that is something that we will need to improve on, but it is certainly 
<br/>going to be part of the overall strategy as mentioned, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the presence of former 
<br/>Parliamentarian, Mr. Rasova.  He has been fairly busy around the corridors of Parliament.  Welcome 
<br/></span><span>to this Sitting, Mr. Rasova.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will move on to the next Oral Question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister was extensively 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>covered in his Ministerial Statement this morning, so I am quite satisfied with that.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you still want to raise it? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question that I was supposed to ask this morning 
<br/>on the progress of drainage plans for farmers in Valley Road, as nearly all farms were inundated with 
<br/>the  recent  flash  flooding  with  substantial  cash  income  being  lost,  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Agriculture and Waterways covered this in his Ministerial Statement this morning, but if he wants to 
<br/>elaborate, he can do so.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- This is like a fishing expedition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You just tell us whether you want to withdraw your question, or you still want to continue?  You are 
<br/>putting in something half and half. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he can continue, that will be better.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That still does not give us a clear.  For the sake of you being a veteran in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament, now I will ask the honourable Minister to, at least, answer the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.T.T.K.  RAYALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the 
<br/>question.  I have covered this subject extensively during my Ministerial Statement.  My Assistant 
<br/>Minister has already visited the area in question, and we are fully aware of the drainage problems 
<br/>faced by our farmers in the Sigatoka Valley.  We are already moving to fix those problems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  think  that  provides  a  good  answer  for  your  half  and  half  fishing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expedition, Sir.

<div><span>Update on the SPTE 2024 
<br/>(Question No. 06/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and 
<br/>Civil  Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  forthcoming  South  Pacific  Tourism  Exchange 
<br/>(SPTE) 2024 event to be hosted by Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of Parliament and the public, please, 
<br/>allow me to briefly share what the South Pacific Tourism Exchange (SPTE) is.  It is a major annual 
<br/>event hosted by the South Pacific Tourism Organisation (SPTO), formerly the Tourism Council of 
<br/>the South Pacific.  It is the Pacific region’s flagship tourism event which brings together industry 
<br/>leaders, tourism professionals, stakeholders and partners from across the Pacific under one roof. The 
<br/>event was born from our collective commitment to offer our valued international travel partners the 
<br/></span><span>opportunity to see and experience our regional tourism products and suppliers so that they can sell 
<br/></span><span>the Pacific as their destination of choice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what makes this event more special is that, this is the first time for Fiji or 
<br/>any other Pacific Island Country to host the SPTE.  It has been hosted primarily in Australia and New 
<br/>Zealand, and now we are proudly bringing it closer to home. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, well over a decade ago, we would host the Bula Fiji Tourism Exchange 
<br/>(BFTE).  Over the years, Fiji, like many of our other neighbours, began hosting their own expos.  
<br/>That is how the Fiji Tourism Exchange (FTE) was born.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  the  Coalition  Government’s  renewed  commitment  to  regionalism,  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Tourism and Civil Aviation has partnered with SPTO to bring this element of Pacific back.  Fiji’s 
<br/>hosting also gives the opportunity for our small island brothers and sisters, who may not have their 
<br/>own expositions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is a founding member and host country to the SPTO.  Nine Pacific 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Island countries  founded this  organisation and today, we have  a membership  of 21 countries  and 
<br/>about 200 private sector members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  SPTE  2024  will  be  held  from  4th  to  5th  May  in  Nadi,  serving  as  a 
<br/>platform  for  fostering  regional  collaboration,  promoting  sustainable  tourism  practices  and 
<br/>showcasing the diverse cultural and natural attractions of our Pacific nations.  There will also be a 
<br/>series of workshops and training.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The SPTE 2024 will be held along the margins of our very own Fiji Tourism Exchange.  We 
<br/>are expecting, at least, 80 buyers from across the Globe and 80 sellers from the Pacific during the 
<br/>two-day event.  The SPTO and Tourism Fiji also collaborated on a co-hosted buyer programme to 
<br/>bring in 15 buyers from the United Kingdom and Europe, to participate in both, the SPTE and FTE 
<br/>events. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it will be a very busy few days for the tourism industry beginning 30</span><span>th</span><span> April 
<br/>to 7</span><span>th</span><span> May, 2024, so much so that we are calling it “Tourism Super Week”.  Tourism Fiji will be 
<br/>leading  a  number  of  engagements,  including  workshops  covering  sustainability,  adventure  travel, 
<br/>digital, destination development and a two-day cruise symposium.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Along  the  margins,  SPTO  will  also  be  conducting  workshops  for  its  regional  tourism 
<br/>organisations,  including  a  four-day  Research  and  Statistics  Capacity  Building  Workshop,  the 
<br/>Sustainable  Tourism  Regional  Consultation,  Pacific  Tourism  Digital  Champions  and  Marketing 
<br/>Managers Workshop. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  being  selected  to  host  this  year’s  SPTE  is  a  testament to  Fiji’s  renewed 
<br/>commitment to regional tourism and the commitment of the Fiji Government to promoting tourism 
<br/>that is empowering, resilient, prosperous and inclusive.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I would like to acknowledge the presence of more 
<br/>students from the University of the South Pacific.  I am sorry, I really do not know whether you are 
<br/>part of the old group or is this a new group altogether.  Are you all studying law?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>STUDENTS.- Yes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Students, we are so grateful for this kind of visit from you to come and learn where we make 
<br/>new laws, we amend laws and we repeal laws and even endorse dealings with the rest of the world 
<br/>in whatever policy the Government of the day fits that Parliament endorses, this is our attachment 
<br/>will other countries as well. We are so grateful for your presence, and we hope you will learn how 
<br/>best your representatives here have been trying all their best to, at least, say something in the hope 
<br/>that changes the view of Government in how it is doing things. Welcome, once more.

<div><span>Before  I  offer  the  seventh  Oral  Question  for  today,  I  would  like  to  remind  honourable 
<br/>Members that the first question that was raised, we have taken note of that, and I would like to offer 
<br/>this time to honourable Usamate, who was supposed to be raising that question and, hopefully, the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Public Works could also prepare for a reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE .- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I apologise for being late.  I would 
<br/>just like to add a note that the bell did not sound in the place where we were having our morning tea. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- These are things that will eventuate because of these new clocks.  If they 
<br/>do not reach your ears wherever you are in the precincts, we seek your forbearance.  We will try and 
<br/>do our best  to  ensure that when the bell is  sounded, it reaches the four corners of the Parliament 
<br/>precincts that we are in.

<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on the progress of the re-establishment of the Public Works Department 
<br/>and what it has achieved so far? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise as I was not also here at that time 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and I thank you for allowing the question and my response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Public Works Department (PWD) that is a work case study in what not to do. Looking 
<br/>back, it was, sort of, irrational in the way things were done and in terms of how it was dismantled 
<br/>without really assessing and analysing the critical role it plays in the development of our nation.  It 
<br/>is a challenge in terms of the Ministry working through that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The decision, Sir, from the view of the Coalition Government, it was a huge mistake.  It had 
<br/>its expertise in planning, designing, constructing and all those technical know-how in terms of public 
<br/>infrastructure, et cetera, as we all know. Looking back, we just cannot understand how that happened.  
<br/>It is not only a part of Government as a part of the Civil Service, but it plays a very critical role in 
<br/>terms of infrastructure and essential services such as roads and water.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The consequences were, really, I would, detrimental. We can write a thesis on it …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Will you be able to end that thesis?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Let me just say that we do not want to dwell on the mistakes 
<br/>of the past. We will not look back. Basically, there was nothing there when we came in, in terms of 
<br/>equipment, manpower, et cetera, so it is really starting from scratch.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think the Opposition is asking, “why are you re-establishing it?” It is basically the lack of 
<br/>services to our people, for example, roads. When we look at roads, there has been a lot of neglect 
<br/>because they divided the roads - FRA and non-FRA roads. When you say non-FRA roads, there are 
<br/>quite a lot of communities involved in non-FRA roads. Also, rural roads were neglected.  That is part 
<br/>of our policy is to rebuild it and it has commenced.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have issued contracts for the purchase of construction and maintenance equipment and 
<br/>the first batch of machinery have arrived. This marks a pivotal step towards equipping Public Works 
<br/>Department to effectively carry out its functions. As I have mentioned, there is nothing there – nil 
<br/>equipment, even nil experienced operations staff.  For example, even a grader, you need to know 
<br/>how to operate it, not drive it. There has been quite a lot of complaints in terms of the private operators 
<br/>in terms of how they do that.  That lack of know-how and skills contributes to the current predicament 
<br/>we face.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms  of the  Building  Section, we have  already  been  engaged in  repairing Government 
<br/>buildings that were left in disrepair. This is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Health, for 
<br/>example, assisting in some of the urgent works at the Colonial War Memorial Hospital, and also with 
<br/>other Ministries like the Ministry of Agriculture. This will intensify in the next financial year when 
<br/>the maintenance of all Government buildings is envisaged to be centralised. We are looking forward 
<br/>to this being streamlined and enhance efficiencies in property management, especially in terms of 
<br/>quality and durability of the kind of work being done which we have found to be lacking in terms of 
<br/>some of the private sector providers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While PWD undergoes the process of reform, the maintenance of rural roads and rural water 
<br/>will continue to be with Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) and Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), but with 
<br/>FRA, it will be working with PWD in terms of complementing each other, with some depots expected 
<br/>to commence operations in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, when you are looking at a technical department such as PWD, human resources is very 
<br/>critical.  When PWD was done away with, that was a big gap in the sustainability of human resources 
<br/>in technical areas.  For example, plumbers, electricians, even those who were operating specialised 
<br/>equipment, so it takes time to rebuild that. You cannot rebuild that in just 12 months.  A lot of the 
<br/>experienced staff have left, so it is quite a challenge rebuilding that, but we will be doing that as we 
<br/>move forward, for example, in terms of apprenticeships.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is basically the update which, in order to answer that question, I think is a challenge, but 
<br/>it will be good to bring it back as we are doing now, as part of the Coalition Government’s strategy 
<br/>to plug the gaps that are there. We see that the Drainage Board is coming back.  That will be working 
<br/>in collaboration with our Ministry and also, complementing the gaps which are there in the services 
<br/>by FRA in terms of our rural roads which have been neglected for quite some time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have mentioned this morning when I was discussing the Water Sector 2050 Strategy, we 
<br/>also  need  a  Fiji  National  Roads  Policy  and  Strategy  moving  forward,  so  probably  with  the  same 
<br/>timeline  and  also  by  decade.    Currently,  we  are  engaging  development  partners.    Thank  you, 
<br/>honourable Minister of Finance, and not only them but also the Ministry of Climate Change to look 
<br/>into climate financing for water, energy and also roads in order that these are climate resilient moving 
<br/>forward for the next three decades. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  In August 2023, this was 
<br/>what  the  honourable  Minister  said,  that  he  would  equip  some  depots  but  no  depots  have  been 
<br/>equipped.  He said that they would work on some rural roads but according to his answer, no such 
<br/></span><span>work has been done.  In January of 2024, he said they would work on the maintenance for the next 
<br/></span><span>six months, not any one of these roads have been maintained over the past six months.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that I would like to say is that he is talking about the repairs…. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- How do you know?

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>349 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I know because I walked some of the routes of those roads and we 
<br/>built  those  roads  without  PWD.    We  built  it  with  the  Divisional  Engineers  and  their  teams.    My 
<br/>question is, if you say something that you are going to do, when are you going to do it?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>He has not answered my question at all, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  He has gone on a long lament.  I 
<br/>think you are learning from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister this side to go on this meandering 
<br/>round the Mississippi.  So, when are you going to deliver what you said in August and what you said 
<br/>in January? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I mentioned, you cannot rebuild what you 
<br/>destroyed over 16 years in 16 months.  Some of the issues he raised is very specific and maybe if he 
<br/>rephrases the question to specific items, I can answer that.  But as I have mentioned, generally, we 
<br/>are doing it in a very responsible way.  If we had been an irresponsible Government, we would have 
<br/>just come in and abolish FRA, like what you did to PWD, resulting in hundreds of technical people 
<br/>who are needed by the country who are just out there, and we do not know where they are. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Go to NEC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  The  other  thing  we  do  not  know  about  is  the  $8.6  million 
<br/>worth of equipment, I do not know where they are.  We are doing it in  an incremental structured 
<br/>responsible way, so that whatever we do complements rather than duplicates.  I do not want to repeat 
<br/>basic management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question to the honourable Minister 
<br/>is, where are we heading and what are we doing?  If we read past reports by ADB and World Bank, 
<br/>it talks about reducing cost to government and those that can be taken by the private sector has to be 
<br/>outsourced.  Where are we heading?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My simple question to the honourable Minister is, when PWD is fully established, you have 
<br/>not given a timeline.  What will be the overall cost to Government (taxpayers of this country)?  Again, 
<br/>it goes back to my question, there were so many reports in the past about outsourcing, what can be 
<br/>done by the private sector so that we minimise cost to Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What the honourable Minister was  stating in his earlier reply was that, you 
<br/>were looking at streamlining and having a system where both FRA and PWD are going to be brought 
<br/>together but the timing and all that, that is still left to the Government to come up with.  Honourable 
<br/>Minister, the question now raised by the honourable Leader of the Opposition. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  he  raised  one  very  important  point,  the 
<br/>participation  of  the  private  sector  because  basically,  they  brought  in  the  private  sector  to  replace 
<br/>PWD.  One good example is what happened at FRA, where we have looked at the accounts and did 
<br/>a special audit.  That was $400 million which was expended through questionable decisions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That was revealed by special audit. The other issue with the 
<br/>private contractors, if you look at them, the one which was engaged by FijiFirst, nearly all of them 
<br/>were contributing to the FijiFirst campaign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Oh!

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- When they are talking about the recommendation by World 
<br/>Bank, ADB or IMF to move to the private sector, as a developing country, we need to really assess 
<br/>that properly.  We need to have the right balance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- What number? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Standing Order 60 – Relevance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what the honourable Minister should refrain from doing is point fingers at 
<br/>contractors, et cetera, because companies do not contribute to political parties, it is individuals that 
<br/>do that.  So, please, do not point fingers at contracting companies because they are not involved with 
<br/>political parties, it is individuals who contribute to it.  I think he should withdraw what he just said.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think my answer to your Point of Order, honourable Koya, is that he is 
<br/>just making a grand statement here regarding the contributions and all from individuals who are also 
<br/>part of companies. I take that as just a general statement.  But, again, if you want to continue to point 
<br/>fingers at people who are participating in campaigning and all that for political parties, please, you 
<br/>either name the individuals - that is their freedom, or the company that they are representing, and you 
<br/>have to have evidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I note that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and honourable Member.  What 
<br/>I was saying was in terms of what was raised by the Opposition, the participation of the private sector 
<br/>to replace a government entity.  What we, on this side of Parliament, are saying is that, that was the 
<br/>wrong decision because in terms of cost, it was quite astronomical.  Was there was any cost benefit 
<br/>analysis  properly  conducted  -  the  cost  of  engaging  the  private  sector  against  the  cost  of  keeping 
<br/>PWD? That is the fundamental question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  That would involve a really good study.  
<br/>Honourable Usamate was saying, “when, when?”  But we do not want to repeat the same mistake by 
<br/>bringing wholesome the PWD back to replace and remove everything that was there. We need to 
<br/>have the right balance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. J. Usamate interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Yes, I may have said that but as a Minister... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- So you lied?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- … I need to move forward in a responsible way in terms of 
<br/>taxpayer funds.  We need to have the right balance to complement rather than duplicate.  That is the 
<br/>fundamental issue here.  For example, in CWM Hospital, a lot of repairs that were done by private 
<br/></span><span>carpenters were not up to the standard because the monitoring was not done by the relevant section 
<br/></span><span>of PWD, which used to do it.  That is something we need to have there, to have a more effective 
<br/>delivery by the private sector.  I am not against the private sector, but there needs to be a right balance, 
<br/>moving forward.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a quick question to the honourable Minister, and I 
<br/>hope that I am going to get a short answer.  In terms of what you have just philosophised now, and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>351 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in terms of the future of PWD and FRA, in short, you will not be engaging private contractors any 
<br/>more to do any work with respect to PWD and FRA?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- That is the question being raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is not correct.  We will continue to work towards the 
<br/>right  balance,  both  private  sector  and  public  sector,  for  cost  effectiveness  and  responsible  use  of 
<br/>taxpayer funds.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister.  He has been educating all of us in this 
<br/>Parliament.  He even came up with that idea of, ‘they are not driving, they are operators, so they have 
<br/>to be taught the right way to do that’. Ever since he became the Minister, I have noticed that he starts 
<br/>on the defensive, then he moves slowly to answering the questions because may be, he is from the 
<br/>province of the gift of the gab.

<div><span>Assistance to Cane Farmers and Cane Harvesting Co-operatives 
<br/>(Question No. 07/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry  inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  is  assisting  farmers  and  cane  harvesting  co-operatives  to 
<br/>prepare their harvesters and personnel for the crushing season? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to  respond to  the question by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Pillay and thank him for his continued observation of the sugar industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  is  committed  to  supporting  farmers  and  cooperatives  in 
<br/>optimising their operations and ensuring that we have a successful harvest this season, despite the 
<br/>many  challenges  that  we  have  in  the  industry,  such  as  the  impacts  of  climate  change,  aged 
<br/>infrastructure, mills and shortage of manpower.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per my Ministry’s operational plan, we have, so far, implemented several initiatives in 
<br/>assisting  farmers  and  cooperatives  in  preparing  their  mechanical  harvesters  and  cane  cutters  for 
<br/>crushing.  Firstly, we have been actively assisting cooperatives that intend to bring in operators for 
<br/>their harvesters from India by facilitating letters of support to the Department of Immigration.  This 
<br/>initiative enables the cooperative to bring in harvester operators and technicians from India to address 
<br/>the shortage of skilled people to operate harvesters within the season.  In addition to facilitating the 
<br/>importation of skilled labour, my Ministry has recognised the ongoing skilled labour shortage in the 
<br/>agriculture sector, especially during the harvesting season.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is imperative to note that the labour shortage extends beyond the sugar 
<br/>industry  and  represents  a  nationwide  challenge  too,  basically  in  almost  all  skilled  areas  of  our 
<br/></span><span>manpower needs.  I am also an employer and I know these problems first hand.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have taken steps to engage with India and Bangladesh, to address these 
<br/>issues by sourcing workers for our farmers.  Recently, a strategic partnership was established between 
<br/>the Sugar Cane Growers Council and the Anchor Care Global Migration Consultant Limited to bring 
<br/>in  foreign  workers  from  Bangladesh  to  benefit  not  only  the  sugar  industry,  but  also  broader  the 
<br/>agriculture sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="32">Page 32</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has collaborated with the Fiji Corrections Service 
<br/>from  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  under  the  Yellow  Ribbon  Project,  engaging  our  inmates  to 
<br/>harvest sugarcane, particularly in the hilly terrain where mechanical harvesters have limitations.  This 
<br/>has  alleviated  some  of  the  burden  of  the  farmers  in  the  hilly  areas  where  the  current  mechanical 
<br/>harvesters are not able to operate and to also assist farmers with other cane cutters.  This year, we are 
<br/>planning to engage 120 inmates in harvesting sugarcane for the 2024 season as per the Memorandum 
<br/>of Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recognising the need of mechanised harvesting in the hilly terrain, the Ministry has procured 
<br/>equipment and machines to the Fiji Sugar Corporation for this purpose. These machines will undergo 
<br/>trial during the harvesting season and if successful, will acquire additional harvesters to assist farmers 
<br/>in the hilly terrain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Government  has  also  allocated  funds  for  the  procurement  of  42 
<br/>additional  cage  bins.  These  bins  will  support  mechanical  harvesting  and  decrease  transportation 
<br/>expenses from the distant areas of Lautoka Mill and Labasa Mill.  This investment, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  
<br/>is expected to facilitate the transportation of additional 20,000 tonnes of cane.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding direct support for the farmers, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have allowed that the farmers 
<br/>receive a third cane payment of $2,314 without any deduction, while the next cane payment will be 
<br/>in May, just in time for the next crushing season begins.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  first  time  in  our  history,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  since  the  establishment  of  the  sugar 
<br/>industry,  the  Government  had  implemented  $1  per  tonne  payment  for  all  manual  harvesting  to 
<br/>incentivise production and yield to further support the farmers.  This measure has brought relief to 
<br/>our farmers who have to harvest cane manually. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in acknowledgment of the incentive of increased protection, a reward of $5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>per tonne has been distributed to all farmers who have increased their production in 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this initiative, historically, is strategically structured to alleviate financial 
<br/>burden of cane farmers and enhance cash flow, creating a conducive environment for the optimum 
<br/>of crops. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those words, I would like to assure the honourable Member that we 
<br/>have fully prepared ourselves for the crushing season and we will make sure that this year’s crushing 
<br/>becomes very smooth flowing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question.  Most of the cane harvesters 
<br/>have gone past their warranty period and the repair and maintenance is very costly due to the high 
<br/>price of parts and spares.  Also, most of the harvesters are very old and those need to be replaced in 
<br/>the near future.  What is the Ministry doing to assist financially to mitigate the high cost and what 
<br/>support will be there to replace the old harvesters with new machines?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are very mindful that the machines are getting old 
<br/></span><span>and the parts are very expensive. However, our Ministry has done some submissions for the next 
<br/></span><span>budget so that we can assist the farmers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  R.R.  SHARMA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  is  in  regards  to  the  mitigation  of 
<br/>manual harvesting cost.  It is quite known that the manual harvesting price is regulated but the manual 
<br/>harvesting cost is not - it is quite intensive and expensive.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>353 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe a bit of a background before I ask my question.  On 7th April, 2024, 
<br/>the honourable Minister for Sugar Industry said and quote, “…Fiji is looking at bringing in more 
<br/>Bangladeshi nationals”.  Sir, it goes out to show that the Ministry has failed to promote new sugarcane 
<br/>farmers and Fijian people to the sugar industry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Hon. M.S.N. Kamikamica interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, how is the honourable Minister 
<br/>working towards  mitigating the manual harvesting cost with the increase of VAT and their recently 
<br/>announced National Minimum Wages that will go up because that is not regulated?  Can farmers 
<br/>expect the price of sugarcane tonne to even go up?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just answered that we are getting Bangladeshi 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>workers because our local workers are not interested to work, so what is wrong with that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, the idea is this, recently I had brought in nine workers from Bangladesh.  Now, 
<br/>by them being on the farm, the locals are now watching and the time will come again. I am telling 
<br/>you, they are doing a better job on the cane farms. So, as far as mitigation is concerned, yes, everyone 
<br/>has to bear the cost.  The answer to your last question is, you surely will expect a better price for cane 
<br/>this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of mechanical investors is good 
<br/>but there are some teething issues as well.  My simple question to the honourable Minister is the issue 
<br/>of drivers and technicians that do look after the machines. How is this being handled by the Ministry? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  C.J.  SINGH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  your  information,  I  was  the  first  importer  of 
<br/>harvester in Fiji. My harvester is still running well because they are maintaining it, we are maintaining 
<br/>it, and putting oil at the right time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, as far  as the workers are concerned, there are technicians who have come from 
<br/>India and they are beside the farmers, on harvesters as well and even the operators. So, yes, those 
<br/>who  have  imported  harvesters  have  managed  to  bring  their  own  operators,  but  the  supply  of 
<br/>harvesters, they have technicians on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  PILLAY.-    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  question  to  the  honourable  Minister,  why  is 
<br/>training not organised locally for our local people to operate our harvesters?  A lot of people could 
<br/>be trained to operate harvesters. Why is the Ministry of Sugar, together with FSC, not organising and 
<br/>providing training to our locals? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have only been here for  1½ years but they have 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>been in Government for  18 years, why did they not train them? 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.30 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, before we proceed, I would like to acknowledge, 
<br/>once again, another group who are out there in the gallery - another group of PL100  students from 
<br/>the University of the South Pacific.  I hope I am correct that they are also doing law.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We welcome you to your Parliament and I hope that you will learn more about the proceeding 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Parliament and that relates to what you are studying at the University.  We wish you well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members,  we will now proceed to the eighth Oral Question 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strategic Measures to Address Outdated Education Curriculum 
<br/>(Question No. 08/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Minister and Minister for Education, Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on the strategic measures that the Ministry is taking to address 
<br/>the issue of outdated education curriculum? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for the 
<br/>question.  Concerns have been expressed that our curriculum is outdated and irrelevant, not reflective 
<br/>of the needs of a modern society.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Ministry  believes,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  to  some  degree,  it  is  relevant,  however,  to 
<br/>improve the teaching, resources need to be reviewed to capture new emerging concepts, such as the 
<br/>Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  the  7Rs  and  the  3Rs,  which  is  Reduce,  Reuse  and  Recycle;  the  Blue 
<br/>Pacific concept of regional approach for resilient region of peace, harmony, security, social inclusion 
<br/>and prosperity that ensures opposite peoples can lead, free, healthy and productive lives and gender 
<br/>equity, to name a few.  Hence, we acknowledge that it needs to change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that our Fiji citizens, who have graduated through our education 
<br/>system  are  quite  marketable  and  are  in  demand  abroad.    Our  neighbouring  countries  continue  to 
<br/>provide incentives and attractive packages to lure our citizens which is proof that our curriculum, for 
<br/>the most part, is up to par with the knowledge and skillsets needed in a global market.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Globally, we are competitive, we are succeeding and, however, the key now is to ensure that 
<br/>we continue to do so within our resources and in line with the strategic direction for the National 
<br/>Development Plan and SDG4, that no one is left behind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, strategies have been implemented to  ensure that the national curriculum 
<br/>remain relevant, culturally cognisant, technologically savvy and globally competitive.  Students who 
<br/>acquire  concepts  from  these  outcome-based  curriculum  apply  and  reinforce  these  at  home  and  in 
<br/>different parts of their lives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We say that every space that a child sets foot in, is a school.  The home is a school, the church 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is a school, this august Parliament is a school, our playgrounds and our parks are all schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our outcome-based curriculum syllabi and all the archaic prescriptive output 
<br/>driven one,  however, needs to be reviewed to embed that very new emerging issues, such as those I 
<br/>have highlighted earlier, including the global pandemic resilience skills, online learning platforms,

<div><span>knowledge and innovative world of engineering and technology and at the same time, sustain our 
<br/>cultural heritage, moral and civic values and responsibility in the forever changing global trends. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  past  Administrations,  including  some  of  my  colleagues  across  the  floor 
<br/>instituted  a  top-down  approach  like,  “I  have  woken  up  this  morning  and  I  want  to  change  the 
<br/>curriculum.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Last week, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was part of the two days’ USP Graduation Sessions, and it was 
<br/>quite conspicuous that 95 percent of the graduates, who were conferred with undergraduate and post-
<br/>graduate  degree  -  information  technology,  maths,  physics,  financial  management  and  forensic 
<br/>accounting, already did not have many </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and I hate to bring this into Parliament.  But I am 
<br/>stating something that I believe is unfair.  Is this the result of a new life math curriculum that one of 
<br/>you people thought and introduced overnight?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The interaction of Life Math may have influenced most </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>students to opt for it instead 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of the Pure Math, which all of us in this august Parliament learnt in school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  I  witnessed  got  me  thinking  over  this  weekend  because  of  our 
<br/>forefathers used celestial spheres or coordinates in their inter-island travel, our grandmothers used 
<br/>geometry for weaving maths and metrics when they made salt or pottery, math has been part of our 
<br/>culture.  But to have Life Math as an easy way out has a huge impact on the future of opportunities 
<br/>in terms of scholarships, eligibility criteria for STEM job opportunities from aviation, engineering, 
<br/>maths, science, including financial management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unforgiveable to create a new subject without much research and global 
<br/>benchmarking, nor contributions from maths experts in our tertiary institutions, and two streams of 
<br/>maths have been shoved down the Curriculum Unit for senior secondary school students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in fact, honourable Members of the Opposition are fully aware that they 
<br/>even disallowed the monitoring of the implementation of the curriculum at school level.  This led to 
<br/>a huge disconnect between those developing the curriculum and the implementation of the curriculum 
<br/>by our teachers.  Teachers have limited training on the teaching curricula which is to deliver the new 
<br/>invented subjects, thus impeding teaching and learning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  to  make  matters  worse,  the  Curriculum  Unit  was  downsized  from  60 
<br/>Officers to 19.  As a result of this, some of the curriculum specialists were sent back to school during 
<br/>the restructure of 5</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2020.  The restructure altered the roles of the curriculum officers.  The 
<br/>above roles became highly taxing in many aspects, as one officer was expected to handle the tasks 
<br/>of two or three curriculum officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  example,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  restructure,  one  primary  curriculum  officer  took 
<br/>charge of Elementary Science for Year 1 to Year 4, Basic Science for Year 5 to Year 8, and Healthy 
<br/>Living  for  Year  1  to  Year  8,  and  for  the  secondary  curriculum  specialist,  for  Year  9  to  Year  13.  
<br/>Again, one sole officer was expected to look after three subjects, as well for maths for Year 9 and 
<br/>Year 10, Life Math for Year 11 to Year 13, Pure Maths for Year 11 to Year 13 and Physics for Year 
<br/></span><span>11  to  Year  13,  along  with  preparation  of  national  examination  papers.  It  was  quite  a  load,  Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it  was  quite inconsiderate  and,  in  many ways, modern slavery, and had, 
<br/>unfortunately,  taken  its  toll  on  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  my  officers.  I  am  saddened  that  with 
<br/>additional unnecessary work pressure, one of the Curriculum Specialists passed on in February, and 
<br/>another will be buried tomorrow, while two are still under doctor’s observations.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  due  to  the  heavy  workload  of  the  Curriculum  Unit,  we  struggled  with 
<br/>recruitment from January 2024 for another 17 additional officers, along with a Director and another 
<br/>Principal Education Officer, to be reinstated for much-needed professional ease for the Curriculum 
<br/>Unit to function effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At this juncture, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stated in this august Parliament with confidence that my 
<br/>capable, qualified and competent Curriculum Specialists have already begun the necessary work and 
<br/>the scoping within and across the key learning areas from Early Childhood Education (ECE) to Year 
<br/>13 based on the correct curriculum perspectives that underpin the National Curriculum Framework 
<br/>(NCF)  which  are  considered  crucial  to  a  broad  and  holistic  curriculum  framework  to  identify 
<br/>curriculum gaps. These include careers, citizenship, education for sustainable development, literacy, 
<br/>numeracy, special aids, spiritual and values education. These important perspectives are integrated 
<br/>across the curriculum to ensure meaningful and lifelong learning takes place in each student’s life 
<br/>journey.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  ensures  that  curriculum  content  is  culturally  relevant  and 
<br/>inclusive,  representing  diverse  perspectives  and  experiences.  The  curriculum  is    designed  to  be 
<br/>flexible and enables our Fiji citizens to adapt to changes in society, technology and industry trends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Curriculum Development Unit has been revamped.  Work has begun in 
<br/>the  right  direction  from  the  core  function  of  curriculum  review  which  involves  working  with  the 
<br/>teachers  in  evaluating  and  identifying  the  curriculum  gaps  through  hybrid  workshop  modes  to 
<br/>national examination work preparations for Years 8, 12, and 13.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, after 18 long years, the Ministry of Education held its National Education 
<br/>Summit whereby a framework titled the “</span><span>2023 Denarau Declaration</span><span>” was formulated, which has the 
<br/>guidelines on the way forward for the curriculum and education sector for the next 10 years. The 
<br/>recommendations  of  the  2023  National  Education  Summit  and  Cabinet  endorsement  for  the 
<br/>formation of the new Education Commission are interconnected and complementary in their efforts 
<br/>to review and improve the education sector and its curriculum being a critical component. The new 
<br/>Education  Commission  will  contribute  valuable  insights  and  perspectives  to  the  global  education 
<br/>discourse and will also consult and make recommendations on the seven thematic areas and these 
<br/>includes  enhancing  our curriculum  in  terms  of content, design,  teaching,  pedagogies and relevant 
<br/>types of assessments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I certainly believe in the potential of education to offer a pathway out of our 
<br/>current challenges, and the review of the curriculum framework will ensure that our children have 
<br/>the right skills and competencies to take on the challenges and opportunities of global trends. I plead 
<br/>with you and Members of this august Parliament to partner with us as the national curriculum review 
<br/>is a critical aspect of the transformation of our education system that will benefit our children and 
<br/>the future of our beloved Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, unfortunately, the honourable Minister was all over 
<br/>the place. The question was rather simple. He could have presented it as a Ministerial Statement, but 
<br/>he is so confused.  That is why we need a change in the Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker Sir, the way it was presented as if no work was done.  
<br/>Global partnership in education where we had already sought $1 million to get the work done, but 
<br/>here we have a Minister who does not know what he is doing or what he is saying.  My question is, 
<br/>if you want a curriculum update, you need to work with Fiji’s National Curriculum Framework.  Is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Curriculum Framework done or not?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have highlighted that the Framework is being 
<br/>developed and as we all know, new things have happened - </span><span>2023 Denarau Declaration</span><span>, the Education 
<br/>Commission, which was never considered by them all these years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  H.  CHAND.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  fact,  the  honourable  Minister’s  response  has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>confused me.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> He  was  all  over  the  place;  very  confusing.    My  question,  Sir,  which  approach  will  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Education take to review the curriculum? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- As you may know, in the </span><span>2023 Denarau Declaration</span><span> there are seven 
<br/>thematic areas and I have highlighted them in my speech, so that covers what needs to be done to 
<br/>take education forward.  This is what you did not do, you did not have a summit, you did not have 
<br/>an Education Commission, so the confusion is on their side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I highlighted the Curriculum Unit used to have 60 officers.  I believe 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>he was in HR and he brought it down to 17, Mr. Speaker.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- What hope have we got?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a question to the honourable Minister,.  It is good 
<br/>that  we  have  a  curriculum  developed  and  congratulations  to  those  who  were  involved.    But  the 
<br/>question is, in terms of the training management cycle, it is one thing to have a curriculum, it is one 
<br/>thing to conduct a training but one of the most important components is training validation.  How is 
<br/>the Ministry prepared to do the validation so that it can feed back into the system, particularly on 
<br/>labour demand?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Part of the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Wait, wait! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all part of the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- That is asking the obvious. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- May I just add, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the number of training providers 
<br/>that we have today is producing the number of people who need to fill in the gaps that have occurred 
<br/>over the last couple of months.  We now have training providers at village level, even at tertiary level,

<br/>they get recognised and the proof in the pudding is where they can join the workforce and they are.
