<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review of Levuka Town Council Annual 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Levuka  Town  is  a  site  rich  with  the 
<br/>historical landmarks with its Colonial infrastructure and cultural history that gives it a very unique 
<br/>and special significance to Fiji and the Pacific.  The history of Levuka tells the story of different 
<br/>people, such as the Colonial White Settlers, the Indentured Labourers, Chinese, indigenous people 
<br/>and other immigrant races coming together in what is referred to as the melting pot of Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  was  referred  these  Annual  Reports  on  17th 
<br/>February, 2023, and tabled its findings to Parliament in the November 2023 Sitting.  During the years 
<br/>under review, the Committee noted a few highlights of the Levuka Town Council which are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Back to Levuka Carnival which was revived and held in October 2015 raised a revenue 
<br/>of $20,745. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span> </span><span>Hosted Animals Fiji VET from UK for a week on de-sexing clinic for domesticated and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>wildlife animals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span> </span><span>Hosted the Levuka Weightlifters who represented Fiji in the 2015 South Pacific Games.  
<br/></span><span>4.</span><span> </span><span>As part of improving its internal controls, the Council recruited an Accountant, an Events 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coordinator and a Web Assistant in 2014. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Committee’s findings and recommendations, the Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had highlighted the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka is listed as a heritage site, and this is a challenge for homeowners and building 
<br/>owners as it is costly to renovate by keeping to its original plan.  By way of recognition, the 
<br/>Heritage  Bill,  as  a  legal  framework,  is  needed  to  support  Levuka  as  a  heritage  site.  
<br/>Therefore, the Committee had  recommended the re-introduction  of the  Heritage Bill in 
<br/>Parliament  as  this  piece  of  legislation  will  protect  and  support  the  work  in  improving 
<br/>heritage sites in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee was also informed that the CEO position had not been confirmed to-date 
<br/>and  it  was  recommended  that  the  process  be  expedited  so  that  the  position  could  be 
<br/>confirmed, and this is vital for the effective operation of the Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  notes  the  lack  of  financial  support  to  fund  and  maintain  these  sites, 
<br/>infrastructure and buildings which are of heritage status and is recommending that the 
<br/>Council  continues  with  the  Public-Private  Partnership  Scheme  to  further  develop 
<br/>Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee also wishes to highlight in this august Parliament that despite 
<br/>correspondences being sent to Government Departments pursuant to Standing Order 121(6)(b) on a 
<br/>substantive  response  to  the  Committee’s  Report  within  21  days  of  receiving  the  Report,  it  is 
<br/>unfortunate that those responses were not forthcoming. Such responses would contribute to debate 
<br/>such as this and with that being said, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion and 
<br/></span><span>before I offer the floor, I just wish to remind us that the honourable Whips of both sides of Parliament 
<br/>have agreed to that the following be undertaken in terms of the time: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Five minutes for the Mover of the motion, that is, the Chairperson of the Committee and 
<br/>he/she will have another five minutes with a right of reply;

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In between, two speakers have been chosen from each side and they are to speak for 10 
<br/>minutes each. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To open the floor for debate, I am now offering the floor to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable V. Pillay; 
<br/>2.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government;  
<br/>3.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable H. Chand; and  
<br/>4.</span><span> </span><span>Honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs and Culture, Heritage and Arts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand in support of the Levuka Town Council Annual 
<br/>Reports  2014  and  2015  and  would  like  to  commend  the  efforts  of  the  Levuka  Town  Council  as 
<br/>outlined in the 2014 and 2015 Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Levuka, a town steep in  history and cultural significance is on an upward trajectory.  The 
<br/>Council’s achievements are a testament to their dedication and commitment to the town’s wellbeing.  
<br/>Back to Levuka Carnival in 2015 is a prime example.  This celebration not only injects vibrancy into 
<br/></span><span>the community but also serves as a potential economic driver, attracting tourism and fostering local 
<br/></span><span>businesses. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Council’s  proactive  approach 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is 
<br/>commendable - upgrading the drainage system, public convenience and market fencing through the 
<br/>Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) projects which improve the lives of Levuka residents.  
<br/>These  essentials  upgrades  enhance  sanitation,  public  health  and  provide  a  more  conducive 
<br/>environment for commerce.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure  development 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  the  Report  also  sheds  light  on  some  pertinent  challenges.    Preserving  Levuka’s 
<br/>historical buildings, a cornerstone of the town’s identity, presents a significant cadre.  The stringent 
<br/>regulations associated with heritage status often led to exorbitant renovation costs. These highlights 
<br/>the crucial need for the Heritage Bill.  Such a legislation will provide much needed financial support 
<br/>and  streamlines  the  process,  ensuring  the  continued  preservation  of  Levuka’s  rich  heritage  for 
<br/>generations to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Report  also  identifies  the  lack  of  confirmed  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  limited 
<br/>employment opportunities as areas demanding attention.  A permanent Chief Executive Officer with 
<br/>a clear vision and leadership expertise can provide much needed stability and direction for the Town 
<br/>Council.  Additionally, fostering trade skills and higher education opportunities in Levuka is critical 
<br/>to empower residents and expand their prospects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Encouraging Public-Private Partnership could be a key strategy in achieving this. Partnering 
<br/>with private entities can unlock investment opportunities, create new jobs and stimulate economic 
<br/>activities.    It  is  important  to  acknowledge  the  positive  aspects  highlighted  in  the  Report.  The 
<br/>Council’s commitment to gender equality, evident by the high percentage of women in leadership 
<br/>roles, aligns perfectly with Sustainable Development Goal 5.   Furthermore, their focus on sanitation 
<br/>and  waste  management  initiatives  contribute  to  Sustainable  Development  Goal  11  in  promoting 
<br/></span><span>sustainable cities and communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Levuka  Town  Council  deserves  our  praise  for  their 
<br/>achievements,  they  are  tackling  challenges  head  on  while  actively  seeking  solutions.    By 
<br/>implementing the recommendations outlined in this Report, we can propel Levuka towards a brighter 
<br/>future, a future that honours its heritage, empowers its residents and fosters sustainable growth. Let 
<br/>us join hands in supporting the Levuka Town Council as they navigate this journey.

<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>361 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUSIMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I respond to the motion before Parliament 
<br/>this afternoon, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Coalition Government on behalf of 
<br/>the </span><span>vanua</span><span> of Nabukebuke, Namosi to extend our heartfelt gratitude on the release of the </span><span>Vunivalu Na  
<br/>Tui Namosi</span><span> yesterday 14</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024. It was indeed a joyous and gracious reception by the </span><span>vanua. 
<br/></span><span>Today the </span><span>Vunivalu</span><span> is chairing the </span><span>Bose Vanua</span><span> </span><span>o</span><span> </span><span>Nabukebuke</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I take this time to also thank the Standing Committee on the Consolidated 
<br/>Review of the Levuka Town Council Reports from 2014 and 2015. I also take this time to thank the 
<br/>Acting Chief Executive Officer, management and staff of Levuka Town Council for doing a great 
<br/>job in administering the affairs of Levuka Town.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  few  areas  that  I  need  to  share  this  afternoon,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>findings by the Committee.  One is the need to maintain and upkeep of the Council’s property as well 
<br/>as heritage sites. Levuka Town is a very small one with only 144 ratepayers and income level of close 
<br/>to $315,000.  So, this is really a challenge for small Councils like Levuka to maintain its properties 
<br/>as well as maintain the heritage sites around Levuka Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is mindful of the lack of development in Levuka in this regard, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir,  The  Ministry  together  with  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  and  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts, 
<br/>Ministry of Rural Development, Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and Ministry of Trade with 
<br/>the support of UNDP is working on a comprehensive plan for the development of Levuka.  Agencies 
<br/>are working with UNDP to finalise its terms of reference and engage a consultant who will work on 
<br/>a three to five years as well as 10-year master plan for Levuka.  It will set out investment in strategic 
<br/>assets  and  infrastructure,  strategies  to  attract  investments  from  domestic  and  foreign  investors 
<br/>focused on culture and heritage tourism.  All these will be done, Mr. Speaker, Sir, whilst maintaining 
<br/>the heritage status of Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another very important issue that was highlighted was the need for a timely submission of 
<br/>Annual Reports. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to share that the annual accounts for 2018 has been 
<br/>audited while the annual reports for 2016 and 2017 had been tabled in Parliament this morning. The 
<br/>Council is in the midst of updating its accounts for the remaining years; 2019 till 2023 by end of July 
<br/>2024.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, the importance of the re-introduction of the Heritage Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is believed 
<br/>that this legislation once review is completed will aim to protect and support the work in improving 
<br/>heritage sites in Fiji. There was also a need for the Council to work in consultation with the Ministry 
<br/>of Local  Government,  relevant  Ministries, tertiary institutions and resource owners to  design  and 
<br/>develop strategies to enhance paid skills in respect of TVET, as well as to provide higher education 
<br/>facilities  to  accommodate  the  students  of  Levuka  and  the  Lomaiviti  Province  as  a  whole.      Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  the  Council  will  continue  to  work  with  key  partners  in  Levuka  to  bring  up  these 
<br/>institutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also very interesting to know, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that on 28</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, the Soqosoqo 
<br/>Vakamarama  of  the  Lomaiviti  Province  hosted  a  soli  for  the  acquisition  of  land  in  Suva  for  the 
<br/>children of the Lomaiviti Province as their hostel or place of lodgement.  Another important issue 
<br/></span><span>that was raised is the need to complete the process of appointing a Chief Executive Officer.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has been working in collaboration with all the newly appointed 
<br/>Special Administrators on the way forward on how the Ministry is going to appoint the new CEOs 
<br/>for all the 13 Municipalities and also develop an Expression of Interest (EOI), in terms of reference, 
<br/>as well as role description for all the CEOs.  The EOI has already been advertised by the Ministry of 
<br/>Local Government on behalf of the Council. The EOI closes on 22</span><span>nd</span><span> April, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also a need, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the Council to continue with the Private Public 
<br/>Partnership Scheme to further develop Levuka.  The Government of Japan has provided aid in kind 
<br/>assistance to the Levuka Town Council to support essential services provided by the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of Japan has assisted the Council in providing the Council’s fleet, such as 
<br/>garbage truck, lawn mower, tipper truck, excavator and a seven tonne truck, which also assists the 
<br/>Council in earning extra revenue by giving it on hire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government of Japan further assisted the Council in building seawalls in Levuka Town 
<br/>in 2015, which was destroyed by the Tropical Cyclone in 2018 and, again, they helped rebuild the 
<br/>seawall in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  UN  Women  has  also  assisted  with  the  construction  of  the  Levuka 
<br/>Market, providing a sum of $400,000.  The market is near its completion. It is waiting for the special 
<br/>interest for the furniture before the actual commissioning of the opening of the new Levuka Market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  also,  some  key  areas  that  the  Ministry  has  done  to  actually  assist  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>overcome the poor services to the people of Levuka -   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has collaborated with agencies like the National Fire Authority for the repair 
<br/>and upgrade of the Fire Station. I think this is very important for Levuka because with the 
<br/>old heritage buildings that we have, it is always important that we have a very vibrant and 
<br/>a very effective fire station in Levuka.  So, the work has started in March 2024 and should 
<br/>be completed by May 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>We have also identified the need to have more housing provision in Levuka Town and also 
<br/>in certain areas of Levuka. The Public Rental Board has also identified a 28 acre land in 
<br/>Waitovu, Levuka, to assist in the development of housing to assist Civil Servants and those 
<br/>who work in Levuka Town in the provision of accommodation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before Parliament, and I thank you for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity to present this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion before 
<br/>us.  First and foremost, I would like to thank the Standing Committee on Social Affairs for the Review 
<br/>Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish  to  highlight  some of the achievements of Levuka Town Council, 
<br/>Committees  findings  and  issues  that  have  been  highlighted  in  the  Report.    The  first  one  on  the 
<br/>achievements of Levuka Town Council is as follows - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The improvement of the drainage system that was done in 2014 and 2015. 
<br/>The construction of much needed retaining wall for Nasova and Batiniwai Creek. 
<br/>The upgrade of the public convenience in Levuka Town. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These very important developments were done in 2014 and 2015.  Huge amount of money 
<br/></span><span>was invested, and it is very important for the current custodians to ensure that maintenance is carried 
<br/>out as and when needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is a very old port, but there are many more developments which took 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place after 2015 and one development which stands out is the new Levuka Market. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="43">Page 43</a></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>363 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- This modern Levuka Market has given Levuka Town a facelift and this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will benefit the people of Lomaiviti and those who will visit Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government has been supporting the improvement and renovations of the historical sites 
<br/>in Levuka since 2013 after the listing of Levuka as a World Heritage Site.  The improvements have 
<br/>been going on for a number of years now, thanks to the FijiFirst Government, former Ministers, the 
<br/>CEOs, the Special Administrator and the Executives of the Levuka Town Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have noted from the Committee’s Report that one of the key findings of 
<br/>the Committee is the CEO position which has not been confirmed till to date.  The Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government should give priority to this and fill the position at the earliest, but it should be done using 
<br/>the  due  process.    This  should  be  in  accordance  with  the  Open  Merit  Recruitment  and  Selection 
<br/>(OMRS)  Guidelines  and  not  in  an  </span><span>ad  hoc</span><span>  manner,  not  like  the  appointment  of  the  Special 
<br/>Administrators which was done late last year. Appointment should be based on merit and not  on 
<br/>political recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  terms  of  issues,  the  road  conditions  in  Levuka  is  in  very  bad 
<br/>condition - pathetic.  Week before last, I was in Levuka and I have noticed </span><span>lovo </span><span>sized potholes, as 
<br/>soon as I entered Levuka Town.  We were told that the road condition in the town area has been very 
<br/>bad for the last few months.  Whose responsibility is it to ensure that the road is well maintained, is 
<br/>it PWD, FRA or Levuka Town Council? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> One  concerned  ratepayer  told  me  that  the  Coalition  Government  does  not  care  about  the 
<br/>people of Levuka.  That is why the road in the heart of Levuka Town is worse than the gravelled 
<br/>road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Levuka is of great significance to Fiji.  Levuka is the first historical port 
<br/>town,  first  capital  and  the  first  UNESCO  World  Heritage  Site  of  Fiji.  Government  should  give 
<br/>importance to Levuka and address the issues without delay. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is my very short contribution.  I hope that the other side was listening 
<br/>to the issues that I had highlighted, and the Government will make lives better for those people living 
<br/>in Levuka as promised during the election campaign. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  stand  to  contribute  to  the  motion  before  Parliament.  
<br/>Also, I would like to thank the Committee on Social Affairs for the Review Report that they have 
<br/>provided to this august Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we know, in the last sitting of last year, one oral question was raised with regards to the 
<br/>concerns of the business community in Levuka and I have addressed Parliament in regards to what 
<br/>the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs,  Culture  and  Heritage  have  been  trying  to  do  with  regards  to  the 
<br/>improvement  of  the  Levuka  Town  Council,  especially  on  the  heritage  site.    The  Heritage  Bill,  I 
<br/>understand  that  it  is  with  the  Committee  which  hopefully  that  will  help  Levuka  Town  when  the 
<br/></span><span>Heritage Bill is passed that we can solve most of the heritage issues that is being there for so long. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have visited Levuka Town  early this year  in regard to some of the concerns that  was 
<br/>raised and we have formed a Committee to try and work with other stakeholders in regards to how 
<br/>we can improve Levuka Town, especially on the heritage site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="44">Page 44</a></div>
<div><span>364 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consolidated Review Report – Levuka Town Council 
<br/>2014 and 2015 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>15</span><span>th</span><span> April, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, an initiative that my Ministry is working on and, hopefully, will roll out 
<br/>soon with the Levuka authorities and the Department of Town and Country Planning is to explain 
<br/>about the process stipulated in the Levuka Town Scheme statements and provide simple explanations 
<br/>in visual form on how they can develop the town, while keeping in mind preservation principle of 
<br/>heritage.  A simple case is the Westpac Office in Levuka.  For those of you who have never seen this, 
<br/>I strongly recommend that you visit Levuka and see the Westpac Office which has been renovated 
<br/>to date.  Through the Levuka Town Council and Department of Town and Country Planning, we 
<br/>hope to streamline the process and standard, including provisions of quick turnaround time for the 
<br/>development requests in the heritage town.  Another key factor is the capacity building of Levuka 
<br/>Town Council’s staff and other stakeholders, including the Department of Culture, Heritage and Arts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sadly,  a  high  staff  turnover  of  institutions  involved  had  slowed  the  work  on  the  heritage 
<br/>preservation.  A study of similar towns in Asia, Australia and New Zealand is critical and this is an 
<br/>area  my  Ministry  would  like  to  focus  on,  as  well  as  in  the  coming  months  so  that  implementors 
<br/>themselves are able to accurately interpret heritage in Levuka and help the people of the town.  Given 
<br/>the lack of the heritage field expertise in Fiji, we hope to bring international experts in the area of 
<br/>heritage buildings and infrastructure and conservation to do a thorough study of restoration needs 
<br/></span><span>which was to have happened in years immediately after </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> that hit the island of Ovalau.  
<br/></span><span>This, we envisage to roll out in August and September this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly,  through  the  Department  of  Culture,  Heritage  and  Arts,  there  has  been  numerous 
<br/>assistances rendered to the Levuka Town Council to assist in the upkeep of the heritage town. This 
<br/>engagement  is  important  since  the  Town  Council  remains  the  sole  authority  of  the  municipal 
<br/>boundary. Other departments and organisations are merely providing assistance to the Levuka Town 
<br/>Council in the fulfilment of their municipal councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A most recent project which will begin soon is the restoration of the Deed of Cession site in 
<br/>Levuka.  This iconic landmark is a symbolic of our history and the move to nationhood. We hope in 
<br/>the upcoming Budget process, Government will assist us and double our efforts in the preservation 
<br/>of  Levuka  World  Heritage  site,  including  the  much-needed  assistance  to  the  Town,  residents, 
<br/>business owners and the village of Levuka as a whole.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  must  thank  our  development  partners  and  the  Government  Departments,  such  as  the 
<br/>Ministry of Local Government, Department of Town and Country Planning, Department of Tourism, 
<br/>Fiji Ports Authority and others, who have boldly stepped up to assist us, as well as the Levuka Town 
<br/>Council in sustaining the historical feature of Levuka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in regard to the road in Levuka, as we have experienced the adverse weather 
<br/>in  regard  to  climate  change,  it  happens  throughout  Fiji  and  the  Government  is  trying  its  best  to 
<br/>improve the roads out there in the rural areas.  One area that I want to state here is that in Levuka, 
<br/>we can only allow a three-tonne truck to go into the wharf.  If we need to go quickly into repairing 
<br/>the roads, we need heavy trucks and machineries to help in the construction of the roads in Levuka, 
<br/>or else we will have to go all the way to Buresala which is quite an expensive exercise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  regard  to  civil  servants,  they  have  been  struggling  with  regard  to  the  lack  of 
<br/></span><span>accommodation.  We need more civil servants out there to make sure they perform the duties that are 
<br/></span><span>required of them in the Town of Levuka.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to thank all the honourable Members 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>who have contributed to the motion before Parliament.  I have no further comments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote to note the content of the Report.
