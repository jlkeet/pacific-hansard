<div><span>Newly Elected Chairperson - Standing Committee on Natural Resources 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of honourable Members, the newly elected Chairperson of the Standing 
<br/>Committee  on  Natural  Resources  is  the  honourable  Tomasi  T.  Tunabuna  and  the  newly  elected 
<br/>Deputy  Chairperson  is  the  honourable  Jone  Usamate.    I  congratulate  the  two  Members  for  the 
<br/>duration of their tenure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Resolutions - Business Committee 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, at the Business Committee meeting held on Thursday, 11</span><span>th </span><span>April, 2024, 
<br/>there  were  deliberations  on  the  existing  workload  of  the  Standing  Committees  and  further 
<br/>deliberations focused on the Chairmanship and Deputy of the Standing Committees.  At this juncture, 
<br/>please, be informed that the honourable Prime Minister has agreed to the review of the Chairmanship 
<br/>and Deputy, and should there be any changes, this will be announced accordingly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From today through to Thursday, we will have debates on the pending Committee Reports, 
<br/>and to ensure that parliamentary time is utilised well, I am putting the Whips on notice to coordinate 
<br/>on their number of speakers, as well as the allocated speaking times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, as I had announced in the March Sitting, Parliament is now fully equipped to continue 
<br/>with the broadcasting of the vernacular translations.  You would have noted the timers on the wall.  
<br/>That will be programmed accordingly to the speaking times that are provided on your tables.  So, 
<br/>when you notice a signal  coming from  the clocks on the wall, that is  your time to  round off and 
<br/>resume your seat. The Speaker will be making a ruling from the Chair.   
<br/></span></div>
