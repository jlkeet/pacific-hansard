<br/>No. 16/2024).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>9.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Consequential Bills –  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)   must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(b)   must not be referred to a Standing Committee or other Committees of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)   must be debated and voted upon by Parliament immediately after the vote on the 2024-
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2025 Appropriation Bill 2024; and 
<br/>that the time for the debate be limited to ensure that these Consequential Bills tabled 
<br/>today are debated and voted upon in the sitting of Parliament beginning on Monday, 8</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>July, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hereby second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  Are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>there any speakers on the motion?    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As no Member wishes to speak on the motion, I now call on the Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister of Finance and Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very brief because the Bill has just 
<br/>been presented and I am sure the honourable Members of the Opposition will have more than enough 
<br/>time before we debate this Bill after next week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very briefly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the intention of the Tax Administration (Budget Amendment) 
<br/></span><span>Bill 2004 is to increase the time for FRCS to detain a good, instead of disposing a good after 10 years 
<br/></span><span>and at the moment, it is administratively cumbersome.  So, essentially, this amendment to the Bill is 
<br/>to – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improve on that;  
<br/>allow any outstanding  tax debt  or penalty to  be  offset  by  forfeited funds, except for 
<br/>water  resource  tax  and  airport  departure  tax,  given  their  separate  methodologies  for 
<br/>collection; and  
<br/>allow the CEO to request for bulk information and reinstatement of penalty for evasion 
<br/></span><span>of debt. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Income Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the intention here 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>is to – 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(b)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>improve the administration of the tax provision;   
<br/>the continued rate of export income deduction for tax year 2025; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="37">Page 37</a></div>
<div><span>998 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024-2025 Budget Consequential Bills 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(c)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(d)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>removal of the deduction for pandemic reserves; 
<br/>revision of evaluation amount for fringe benefit tax on motor vehicles; 
<br/>revision of rules for the payment of advanced taxes; and reversion of withholding tax 
<br/>as final tax.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said,  Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I will explain  more when we move the motion  after the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budget debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on Value Added Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the Act is intended to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be amended as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Requires  individuals  importing  goods  for  personal  use  to  pay  VAT,  ensuring  a  fair 
<br/>application of VAT; 
<br/>Exempt items under concession code 201C from VAT; and 
<br/>Removes the requirement for the filing of tax returns on an annual basis, while returning 
<br/>the  monthly  or  the  quarterly  filing  framework  to  streamline  VAT  collection  and  aid 
<br/>business financial management.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, the Customs (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, the intention here is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>refine the definition of concepts such as ‘produce’, ‘producer’ and ‘manufacturer’; 
<br/>allow local producers to receive the same kind of concessionary benefits as others; 
<br/>create fairness and level the playing field for the local producers and providing them 
<br/>with  the  same  opportunities  and  advantages  as  others,  fostering  a  more  equitable 
<br/>economic environment; and 
<br/>allow FRCS to remove the time to pay arrangement for the payment of duty for yacht 
<br/>imports  above  $2  million  to  ensure  uniformity  and  prompt  revenue  collection  upon 
<br/>importation, and also increasing the penalty rates. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Customs Tariff (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, as I stated in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Budget, is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remove the 3 percent export duty on sugar. This was never applied, it is on the books 
<br/>so it is a very simple amendment.  
<br/>increase an excise duty on alcohol and tobacco, as pointed out.  
<br/>increase fiscal duty on ships, boats and floating structures.  
<br/>reduce fiscal duty on prefabricated buildings.  
<br/>exempt hospital beds from fiscal duty and VAT.  There are individuals who are also 
<br/>importing hospital beds and we want to remove fiscal duty and VAT from that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Excise (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, the intention here is to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>provide  for  a  longer  duty  accounting  period  for  manufacturers  of  certain  excisable 
<br/>products which were issued a licence on or after 1</span><span>st</span><span> January, 2024; and 
<br/>to impose a fine for the late penalty of excise duty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Airport Departure Tax (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had pointed 
<br/>out, we are increasing the Departure Tax from $140 to $170 effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August, 2024, and a 
<br/>subsequent increase from $170 to $200.  So, to give effect to that provision, this airport Departure 
<br/>Tax amendment needs to be made. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="38">Page 38</a></div>
<div><span>28</span><span>th</span><span> June, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Adjournment 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>999 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Fiji National Provident Fund (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, as I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>have stated already, the Act is amended to: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>allow the members of the FNPF Board to change and, that is, to have an employer and 
<br/>a worker representative.   
<br/>allow children to become FNPF members from birth, instead of a certain age and this 
<br/>should be done through regulations.   
<br/>streamline a timeline for employers to submit remittances and statements to the FNPF 
<br/>Board. 
<br/>adjust the penalty for non-payment of employee contributions from $100 for the balance 
<br/>unpaid each month, to 10 percent of the balance of unpaid contributions for an employee 
<br/>each month. 
<br/>allow FNPF members to transfer as gifts some of their entitlements or all, to another 
<br/>FNPF member within the provisions.  So, I will explain after next week, Sir, that there 
<br/>are good reasons for doing that and it will help a lot of people to plan how they  are 
<br/>going to use their savings and retirement funds in a much better way. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On Tertiary Scholarships and Loans Service (Budget Amendment) Bill 2024, again, as I have 
<br/>pointed out, the changes we are making is to ensure that those who are bonded where the Government 
<br/>is spending a lot of money, that they are able to serve the country as well.  If they do not, if they want 
<br/>to live for greener pastures to other countries, then obviously they are required to pay the bond and 
<br/>the penalty.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Government is spending a lot of money as you have heard already, the volume of funds 
<br/>that goes there and the number of people who actually benefit from the new scheme, and we want to 
<br/>make sure that the Government, taxpayers and the country also gets the benefit.  So, to affect those 
<br/>provisions, this Bill is introduced. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is now open for debate, honourable Members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since there is none, the floor is given to the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his reply, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>if any. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have nothing more to add.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
