<div><span>REVIEW REPORT - FIJI FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE UNIT 2023 ANNUAL REPORT 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Review Report on the Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Annual Report for 2023, which was tabled on 2nd October 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know this is the last report that we debating on this 
<br/>afternoon, but this is the most recent up to-date report.  This is the 2023 Report from the Fiji Financial

<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2297 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Intelligence Unit (FIU) and we thank them for being very timely with their annual report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FIU was established under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004.  In 2005, the 
<br/>responsibility of the line Minister, then the line Minister was the Minister for Justice, was delegated 
<br/>to the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji. The Unit is fully funded by the Reserve Bank of Fiji 
<br/>(RBF)  and  it  is  also  co-located  with  the  RBF.  The  Unit  has  a  total  permanent  staff  of  nine 
<br/>hardworking staff, and they basically perform two roles: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>An  intelligence  role,  where  FIU  is  required  to  refer  financial  intelligence  to  its  law 
<br/>enforcement partners for investigation and prosecution of serious financial crimes and this 
<br/>includes  proactive  dissemination  as  well  as  dissemination  based  on  requests  from  law 
<br/>enforcement partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Regulatory Role, where they ensure that the financial institutions in Fiji have strong internal 
<br/>systems and controls to mitigate the risks of their services and products being misused by 
<br/>criminals and their associates for money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious 
<br/>financial crimes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are two recommendations that we have in the Report that I hope the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>line Ministry and the RBF will look into:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>That the delegated responsibility from the Minister of Justice then, I think now he is under 
<br/>the  Attorney-General,  but  that  responsibility  was  delegated  way  back  in  2005,  to  the 
<br/>Governor of the RBF. The Unit is fully funded by the RBF and our recommendation is for 
<br/>the line Ministry to look at the delegated authority and to assure themselves that it still 
<br/>works, perhaps bring it up and do it where it is now current instead of, it is so many years 
<br/>old since 2005.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The recommendation for the Financial Transactions Reporting Act 2004 to be reviewed. In 
<br/>our discussions with the staff at FIU, they mentioned that when the Act was written in 2004, 
<br/>it was really shaped and flavoured by the best international practices then when it comes to 
<br/>anti-money laundering.  They mentioned that there is a lot of progress in that area now, a 
<br/>lot of development and there is a need for the Act to be reviewed so that we can factor in 
<br/>the new best practices when it comes to anti-money laundering that happens. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are some things that we found out when we were scheming through the Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Section 23(2), I think, it says that the remuneration for the Director is set by the Minister 
<br/>responsible for Finance. This was an amendment made in 2016, and I think it is worth looking at also 
<br/>whether  that  is  okay,  whether  it  is  ensures  transparency  and  accountability,  if  you  like,  the 
<br/>independence of this unit, it needs to be independent and perhaps in the review of the Act, that issue 
<br/>also can be looked at.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I would just like to congratulate our 
<br/>sevens team for their victory and I have also been following the Autumn Nations Series for our 15s 
<br/></span><span>team.  Their match with Ireland was controversial and questionable with the calls from the referee, 
<br/></span><span>but the Fiji team is only getting better and better in winning the World Cup in time to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once found in isolation due to geographical barriers, miles away from its 
<br/>Exclusive  Economic  Zone,  the  Pacific  nations  are  now  subject  to  exploitation  with  the  growing 
<br/>influence  of  transnational  crimes  that  transcends  borders,  cultures  and  social  structure,  imposing 
<br/>substantial health and economic costs, especially for our younger generation.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  FIU  works  closely  with  various  financial  institutions  including  banks,  insurance 
<br/>companies,  money  remitters,  real  estate  agents  in  compliance  with  the  Financial  Transactions 
<br/>Reporting Act.  The implications of illicit financial flow are severe from small to low income nations.  
<br/>The FIU is a member of the Egmont Group, with a network of 177 other FIUs and they securely 
<br/>exchange expertise and financial intelligence to combat money laundering and tourist financing.  As 
<br/>at 2023, FIU had 30 million financial transaction reports and the key recipients are the Fiji Police 
<br/>Force, FRCS and FICAC. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  related  crimes  associated  with  money  laundering  are 
<br/>cybercrimes, funding terrorism, exploitation of children, child pornography and human trafficking.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let us break down these crimes and let us focus on them one by one. I will 
<br/>not be able to cover all of them but a few that are worth listening to.  Sir, 1,700 cases were reported 
<br/>by  citizens  being  impacted  by  deceptive  pyramid  scheme  known  as  the  eBAY  Shop  Online 
<br/>Recruitment.  The Fiji Police M-PAiSA Taskforce has been on the go and people are being charged 
<br/>and a caution to the general public, Mr. Speaker, Sir, not to share their OTP code, passwords and 
<br/>PINs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently there were consignments containing apparatuses that were seized 
<br/>that could be used for possible Palestine laboratories, which is the manufacturer of illicit drugs, but 
<br/>as stated in the Illicit Drugs Control Act 2004, Schedule 3(2) and I quote: “Controlled equipment 
<br/>such as encapsulating machines,  rotary evaporators, laboratory equipment  with  capacity for large 
<br/>production are all controlled items.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speaking of medications, Mr. Speaker, Sir, cases of pseudoephedrine, needles and syringe 
<br/>abuse has been reported.  I would just like to remind the honourable Minister for Finance that the 
<br/>hospitals are running short of medications.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  faces  a  silent  drug  epidemic  tobacco,  alcohol,  methamphetamine, 
<br/>cocaine, cannabis has penetrated into the DNA of our society.  This is further exacerbated by limited 
<br/>access to mental health services, expertise, resources and facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently I was one of the panellists at the Speaker’s Debate and a question 
<br/>came by, “Oh, nothing was done in the last 16 years.”  I never had the chance to respond to this 
<br/>particular person but to note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, large quantities of cannabis and cocaine were seized 
<br/>in 2018 and large quantities of methamphetamine in 2020.  But as for 2023 and 2024, the number of 
<br/></span><span>drug related cases has tripled - 132 arrests, 4.8 tonnes of methamphetamine were seized.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few more recent data, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the National Substance Abuse Advisory Council 
<br/>noted  that  there  were  over  3,000-plus  drug  related  cases  involving  our  school  children  and  we 
<br/>question the trainings, counselling and protection programmes, if they were effective by this Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recently, just yesterday in the news, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a 14-year-old girl was found walking 
<br/>along the road in school uniform with visible needle marks and when officers questioned her, she 
<br/>revealed that she went  to  a party,  ended up in  a place where some boys sexually abused her and 
<br/></span><span>injected her with methamphetamine.  Sir, 39 percent of 90,000 students dropped out between years 
<br/></span><span>8 and 12 and the school dropouts have reached over 5,000.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just like to remind the honourable Minister for Finance when he 
<br/>spoke about the education aspect, yes teacher resignation is high, delay in disbursement of grants to 
<br/>schools and schools focusing on fundraising, the Ministry is not providing teacher replacements, RSL 
<br/>drivers are not paid and bus services are not provided in certain areas like Vuda, Saweni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="85">Page 85</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2299 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, certain businesses and investments needs to be invested who exploit the 
<br/>loopholes in our laws, legislations and policies and meet millions of black money and converted into 
<br/>white.  A multifaceted approach, co-operation, awareness and capacity building needs to be adopted 
<br/>in society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to turn my attention to the Exclusive Economic Zones that we 
<br/>have.    As  a  reason,  we  need  to  foster  international  co-operation  with  ongoing  monitoring  and 
<br/>adaptation  strategies  across  the  region.    Treaty  participation  among  Pacific  Island  nations  will 
<br/>strengthen  our  approach  to  combat  drugs,  drug  trafficking,  money  laundering  in  our  Exclusive 
<br/>Economic Zones and areas beyond our national jurisdiction.  I would like to mention that the BBNJ 
<br/>Treaty and the goal is to sustainably managed 100 percent of our Exclusive Economic Zone by 2030 
<br/>and our protected areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Then we have the Budapest Convention as well.   It shows Fiji’s commitment to ensure that 
<br/>people and communities are safe online and that our law enforcement and prosecution authorities 
<br/>have  the  necessary  tools  and  networks  to  rapidly  investigate  and  successfully  prosecute  cyber 
<br/>criminals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  need  to  look  at  data  protection  and  safe  browsing.  We  need  to 
<br/>monitor, restrict networks and ban some of the applications, and people giving threats to each over 
<br/>social media need to be taken in and charged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  need  to  strengthen  governance  and  rule  of  law,  implementation  of 
<br/>effective legal frameworks, and harsh sentencing for anyone who gets into these matters. We need to 
<br/>equip  our  law  enforcement,  healthcare  and  rehabilitation  centres  with  resources  and  necessary 
<br/>expertise. We need to conduct trainings with the authorities who are dealing with such matters, and 
<br/>police safety remains paramount. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on that note, I support the findings of the Standing Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Naupoto  for  the 
<br/>motion and the points he raised. It makes a lot of sense and If I can go straight onto that, the delegated 
<br/>responsibility from the Minister for Justice to the Governor of the RBF which has been in place since 
<br/>2005,  in  my  view  should  be  reassessed  and  honourable  Naupoto  made  a  point  which  is  entirely 
<br/>correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Financial  Transactions  Reporting  (FTR)  Act  should  be  reviewed  also  and  updated  to 
<br/></span><span>ensure  that  it  is  aligned  with  the  current  international  standards  of  Anti-Money  Laundering.    All 
<br/>entities Mr. Speaker, Sir, must co-operate with FIU and provide feedback in a timely manner and 
<br/>appointment of a substantive Director of FIU in a timely manner will be important.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to look at some of the 2023 highlights, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The FIU received a total of 
<br/>$5,242,280 financial transactions and other reports which were used to develop intelligence products. 
<br/>They analysed 367 suspicious transactions reports. For a small country like ours, these numbers are 
<br/>big, they issued about 429 intelligence reports to law enforcement agencies and conducted credibility 
<br/></span><span>checks on 141 individuals and 70 entities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is still on the EU blacklist, we are working very hard on that. We are 
<br/>also  part  of  a  regional  project  on  correspondence  banking  relationship  and  Fiji  has  contributed 
<br/>towards that project. It is the first regional project funded by the World Bank which was approved 
<br/>within a year and is now being implemented by the Forum Secretariat. Part of the consensus with 
<br/>respect  to  correspondence  banking  relationship  is  also  with  respect  to  putting  in  processes  and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mechanisms  to  deal  with  AML  issues  and  I  know  that  FIU  engaged  with  180  AML  compliance 
<br/>offices of financial institutions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They are also providing training and awareness to 31 employees of financial institutions and 
<br/>FIU also manages a database containing around 30 million financial transactions, but, as honourable 
<br/>Naupoto stated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, very clearly, there is a need to review the Act and look at how we 
<br/>can work with different agencies to improve and combat some of those undesirable transactions and 
<br/>money laundering that happens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are also going to announce very soon steps taken by FRCS in terms of how we can work 
<br/>with different agencies, and we will be announcing certain steps, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of FRCS 
<br/>activities and mechanisms that they will put in place and work with different agencies to also support, 
<br/>not only tax compliance but also provide a linkage with different institutions. Sometimes, they may 
<br/>be looking at $3 million or $4 million transactions but what is the value of looking at all those, how 
<br/>is  it analysed,  in  what  sort of timeline is  it done, what  is  the communication processes,  and how 
<br/>effective the use of that data can be made in real time to deal with some of these issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think this is an important institution, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the FIU has an intelligent function 
<br/>and also a regulatory function, so it goes together. The important part is the intelligence, but linked 
<br/>to it is also the regulatory part and when both work together or when both are efficient, both are 
<br/>communicated, both those functions are talking to each other, as well as talking to other institutions, 
<br/>then we will be able to deal with some of the, at the moment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we think that looking 
<br/>at the Act or looking at the mechanisms, and how it can also work with other institutions is something 
<br/>that is important and we will do that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all let me just thank the Chairperson and the 
<br/>Standing Committee members for this particular Report. I think it is actually quite an important one, 
<br/>although it is the last one in the day that we are actually doing, but within the recommendation I think 
<br/>pretty much everything has been covered by the earlier speakers. But there is one particular one that 
<br/>stands  out  most  of  all,  it  is  something  that  is  really  the  crux  of  the  whole  of  FIU  and  that  is  the 
<br/>Financial  Transaction  Reporting  Act  which  the  report  says,  needs  to  be  reviewed  and  updated  to 
<br/>ensure that it aligns with current international standards. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Act came into force in 2004, so we are looking at some 20 years ago. 
<br/>The  digital  landscape  around  the  world  has  actually  changed,  so  I  would  urge  the  honourable 
<br/>Attorney-General to look at this post haste Sir, and make sure that we align ourselves properly and 
<br/></span><span>there are many things that are attached to institutions like FIU and FICAC, et cetera,  agreements that 
<br/></span><span>we have signed and the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Prasad actually just mentioned something 
<br/>about Europe and us being blacklisted, that is something that we have been fighting for, for the last 
<br/>twelve years to get off that black list.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the reasons why they do it is because they consider us a non-compliant tax jurisdiction 
<br/>amongst all these other things.  It is something that Fiji has to fight for and what it does, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, it affects our trade with these particular regions, it affects our investment from that particular 
<br/>region.  I will give you a classic example, if we were to tender out somebody to do our roads and a 
<br/></span><span>French company wanted to do it, they would not come because we are considered a non-compliant 
<br/></span><span>tax jurisdiction, and these are things that need to be right.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As you would know better than anyone else, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the law is the machinery that 
<br/>actually will allow the FIU to be at the top of its game. I am not saying they have done a bad job, I 
<br/>know there are tremendous amounts of transactions that they actually go through, they store about 
<br/>50 million bits of information, and if you look at it, there are only nine staff there. Now, that also 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2301 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>needs to be looked at to say, “do we have enough sufficient staff within FIU to be able to deal with 
<br/>all that they do?”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the main crux of what the Report actually said. But we also need to 
<br/>be mindful that we are compliant, and I think it is really good that Fiji is actually a member of Egmont 
<br/>Group of FIUs where we get guidance from this and it is a network of about 177 FIUs and actually 
<br/>provides a platform for secure information sharing with respect to financial intelligence. These are 
<br/>the tools that are needed, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know from the details given in the Report, that 30 million financial reports are actually held 
<br/>by FIU, and they receive about five million reports as they say from its reporting entities.  If you look 
<br/>at  the reporting  entities  you got  a whole host of entities that report back to  FIU, but  there is  one 
<br/>glaring omission and a last one on it, it said “iTLTB is one of the agency that the MOU is actually 
<br/>signed here” but of the iTLTB is there why is the Ministry of Lands there not there? They are also a 
<br/>custodian of land. These are things that we need to look at quickly to find out where they are glaring 
<br/>omissions, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, we also need to be mindful that this Act came about in 2004 and then we have the 
<br/>Constitution and within the Constitution, Section 24, with rights to privacy and rights to confidential 
<br/>information being sharing, so it would be as a matter of urgency that the honourable Attorney-General 
<br/>would need to  look  at  the review of this.  I know that the honourable Deputy  Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for External Trade, Cooperatives, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications has 
<br/>been actively working on this digital space et cetera. This is an Act that needs to be aligned with what 
<br/>he is doing at the moment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If we are getting into the right digital space, we must make sure we have the right laws, it also 
<br/>helps the Courts in dealing with what may end up as crime. We must remember, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>that financial crimes do not have borders, if we do not have the right material for these institutions to 
<br/>be able to prosecute or do what it is they have to do, we are failing badly, and we will be looked at 
<br/>because of our commitments made with agreements et cetera that we signed overseas in a different 
<br/>fashion.  So, in order to be up there with the best, the only thing I can say, I commend the Standing 
<br/>Committee for the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I will be very short, Sir, and I urge the honourable Attorney-General to look at the Act and 
<br/>see if it can be done, swiftly so that we are online with the rest of the world. I know that Australia 
<br/>and you would know this also, Sir, that Australia has just recently repealed its financial transactions 
<br/></span><span>reporting and come up with the new one. So, there are development partners that could assist with 
<br/></span><span>all of these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is all I have to contribute, I know it is late in the day, but 
<br/>I commend the Standing Committee for the Report and I acknowledge all the work that they have 
<br/>done, and I hope that the honourable Attorney-General is actually listening too, so that something 
<br/>can be done about it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU J.B. NIUDAMU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Review Report on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Financial Intelligence Unit Annual Report 2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture I commend the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
<br/>Defence for the very comprehensive Report. I acknowledge that FIU has voluntary submitted the 
<br/>Annual Report which is highly encouraging.  I would also like to commend the FIU, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, for the work carried out during the year 2023 and as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>Minister for Finance, Strategic Planning, National Development and Statistics had indicated that five 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div>
<div><span>2302 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>million reports were received from each reporting entities.  So, in fact, we can see the work, we can 
<br/>see  the  result  and  we  can  see  how  important  the  work  that  FIU  has  carried  out  in  our  financial 
<br/>institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  been  supporting  a  number  of  agencies,  government  agencies.  They  have  been 
<br/>supporting banks. They have been supporting individual consumers whenever they have faced these 
<br/>kinds of problems, and it is this agency who is able to come forward with the Report and facilitate 
<br/>the action that needs to be undertaken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they also work hand in hand with the Anti-Money Laundering 
<br/>Unit Council which consists of the Solicitor General, the Office of the DPP, FICAC and also, FRCS. 
<br/>Therefore, I would encourage that this particular institution to be given very important recognition 
<br/>in terms of the findings and the recommendations made by the Standing Committee particularly on 
<br/>the need that has already been elaborated by honourable Koya and honourable Deputy Prime Minister 
<br/>Professor  Prasad,  there  is  a  need  to  review  a  particular  law  which  is  the  Financial  Transactions 
<br/>Reporting Act and I would encourage the Government to seriously look into this  recommendation 
<br/>for the review of this particular Act.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under  the Financial Transaction Reporting Act  a number of institutions, 
<br/>organisations  and  professions  actually  got  caught  under  that.  So,  things  like  real  estate  agents, 
<br/>lawyers, accountants and various other professionals actually had to have their accounts audited and 
<br/>indeed submit an account to ensure that they comply with the law. That is really a genius of that and 
<br/>it propelled in fact and enter segment within their financial system to ensure or trace the money that 
<br/>comes into the country and indeed went out of our country. Also to ensure collaboration between the 
<br/>different countries to stop terrorism financing and of course the net enlarge also to stop things like 
<br/>cleaning of money, or what we called money laundering. I understand that all of us have known the 
<br/>importance of what I have stated this evening.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also a warning to the members of the public, not forgetting the Members of Parliament 
<br/>as well, the importance of reporting our financial transactions to the relevant stakeholders if it is a 
<br/>need to be reported, Sir, otherwise it will be an unexplained wealth, and we are all accountable for 
<br/>that.  So, what has actually happened over the past number of years in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have 
<br/>seen that the type of intelligence too have changed. These people who are dealing with this kind of 
<br/>offenders are getting smarter day by day.  Even online and other sectors of our economy, people are 
<br/>trapped  in  this  kind  of  crimes  and  there  is  really  a  need  for  the  laws  to  be  changed  to  suit  the 
<br/>circumstances that we are in.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, again, I commend the work of the Committee, and I support the Bill before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am honoured to contribute very briefly 
<br/>to the Report on the FIU for the year 2023. At the risk of repeating a lot of what has been said before, 
<br/>I will just keep my comments very brief. But essentially the FIU as we all know is a fundamental 
<br/>agency when it comes to the credibility  and integrity of our financial system.  A dysfunctional  or 
<br/>under resourced FIU, places a lot of risk on the economy’s integrity. One of the first  things, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir, when I looked at the Report, was for 5 million transactions there is only 18 eyeballs 
<br/></span><span>looking at those transactions which seems quite woefully inadequate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank all the Members in this Chamber who contributed in this Report, we 
<br/>support the need to perhaps relook at the resourcing and ensure that the FIU is adequately resourced 
<br/>to do its functions.

<div><span>Review Report – FIU 2023 Annual Report  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2303 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing, Sir, that struck me was, there was a question posed by the Committee to the 
<br/>FIU saying whether there was a correlation between detected illegal activity and the drug fines.  The 
<br/>answer was no.  I find that a bit hard to actually believe,  because it just does not gel.  Given the 
<br/>substantial  level  of  drugs  that  we  are  aware  of  that  is  happening  in  the  country,  you  would  have 
<br/>thought that that would have been picked up in some of the unusual reports.  Perhaps just something 
<br/>to think about and when the Act is being reviewed that we look at supporting this very important 
<br/>Unit.  As  I  mentioned,  the  whole  credibility  of  our  financial  system  hangs  on  how  this  agency 
<br/>performs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  final  comments,  I  just  thought  I  would  like  to  make  is,  one,  the  honourable  Rinesh 
<br/>Sharma mentioned the advent of scams and how that is impacting a lot of them.  I can say proudly 
<br/>that the Government has been actively involved in trying to address the scams and manage it better.  
<br/>One of the first things that we all realised was, virtually all the legislations of all the agencies are 
<br/>outdated, whether it be the Online Service Commission, whether it be all the agencies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, a lot of the legislation really do not have teeth.  To give you an example, when a 
<br/>scam is identified, no agency can do anything until someone goes and reports it to the police.  At the 
<br/>moment, as part of the taskforce on scams, there is an active process going on now to review all the 
<br/>relevant legislations and try and amend all of them to fall in line with the international best practice 
<br/>so that going forward, the legislation can have teeth and we can be more punitive in terms of how we 
<br/>deal with scams and even money laundering, if required.  I do also support the revision of the Act 
<br/>because it is very important, as I said, one of the most important agencies of Government in terms of 
<br/>holding us together in terms of financial integrity, it is important that we bring the Act up to-date and 
<br/>ensure that it does follow best practice as mentioned by all contributors to this debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, in terms of the Ministry of Trade, we have been working closely as well with the FIU 
<br/>under  the  Indo-Pacific  Economic  Framework  for  Prosperity  (IPEF),  in  terms  of  trying  to  prevent 
<br/>money laundering, improving transparency and promoting cooperation amongst the IPEF partners.  
<br/>We view that it is important that we try and engage with FIU because it ensures that the economy 
<br/>maintains a high level of integrity and we try and encourage and foster a corrupt-free environment 
<br/>that benefits all sectors.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with those few comments, I again congratulate the Committee on the Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and fully support the findings that have been made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  I  can  just  add  two  points.    First,  during  the 
<br/></span><span>reporting period, the first Director, Mr. Razim Buksh, retired.  He held that position since its inception 
<br/></span><span>in 2006, retired in 2023 and we thank him for his services and dedication in helping shape the Unit 
<br/>as it is today, and we wish him well in his retirement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite the need for the review as we mentioned, the FIU has demonstrated resilience and 
<br/>adaptability  in  the  phase  of  evolving  financial  crime  trends  and  increased  demands  for  financial 
<br/>intelligence and we thank them for that.  They are continuing to enhance their capabilities in ensuring 
<br/>a robust monitoring and reporting and as mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, yes, 
<br/>they certainly are ensuring the integrity of the financial system, and we wish them well in their work.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words Sir, I commend this motion to the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will vote to note the content of the Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, that brings us to the end of today’s sitting.  It has been a long day for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>me as an alien in this environment.  Today was baptism by fire.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before we adjourn for the day, I wish to convey to all the honourable Members my deepest 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>As  I  have  said  in  my  speech  on  12</span><span>th</span><span>  November  and  reminded  by  honourable  Koya  this 
<br/>morning, the position is laden with deep responsibilities, but at the end, it ensures that this Parliament 
<br/>will remain or be a model for democracy in action. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am encouraged by the assurances of everyone that you will work with me in ensuring that 
<br/>this Parliament remains a bastion for order, justice, civility and need I remind you, decorum during 
<br/>the term of my Speaker of this Parliament.  I thank you all for your contributions, rest well tonight.
