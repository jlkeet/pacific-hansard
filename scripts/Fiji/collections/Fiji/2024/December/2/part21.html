<h3>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF HEALTHAND MEDICAL SERVICES 2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS</h3>
<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT – MINISTRY OF HEALTH 
<br/>AND MEDICAL SERVICES 2016-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament debates the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry of Health and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports which was tabled on 2</span><span>nd</span><span> October, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Consolidated Review Report on the Ministry 
<br/>of Health and Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports, the Ministry’s role to emanate from its 
<br/>core responsibility of delivering quality, preventative, creative and rehabilitative centre services to 
<br/>the  population  through  its  hospitals,  health  centres,  nursing  stations  throughout  the  country, 
<br/>consistently within the demand from the public. There is a significant focus to maintain a continuum 
<br/>of  care  from  community  level  to  primary  healthcare  service,  to  tertiary  level  care  at  Divisional 
<br/></span><span>Hospitals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to support a broad range of relevant policies, standards and protocols 
<br/>to ensure safe and high-quality service are delivered at the health sector assistance level from nursing 
<br/>stations, health centres in Sub-Divisional Hospitals to Divisional Hospitals.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee, in its deliberation, identified areas that the Ministry encountered: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Strengthening the public private partnership can lead to a more innovative solution that will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>help improve infrastructure and better service delivery. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  geographical  isolation  of  Fiji’s  maritime  and  remote  areas  presents  formidable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenges for effectively delivering healthcare services here in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  pandemic  highlighted  gaps  in  Fiji’s  health  system,  particularly  in  the  capacity, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>infrastructure and its workforce.  The COVID pandemic’s profound impact in Fiji’s Ministry of

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Health  and  Medical  Service,  leading  to  significant  changes  in  its  policies  and  operations.  The 
<br/>Ministry of Health and Medical Services has evolved and landmarks from COVID pandemic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Standing  Committee  looks  forward  to  its  improvement  service  delivery  of  the  best 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>healthcare to the people of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The floor is open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, just a small comment, before I contribute to the 
<br/>motion towards the debate, I would like to say that natural justice prevailed whereby Mr. Daniel Kim 
<br/>of Grace Road was granted bail after being  unlawfully detained for more than 400 days. Finally, 
<br/>justice has prevailed, and I wish him all the best for his case about the Judicial and Constitutional 
<br/>Review on Monday next week. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coming back to the Report, I would like to thank the Standing Committee for the deliberation 
<br/>that they have actually done with regards to the Ministry of Health.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, no one wants 
<br/>to lose our loved ones, especially knowing that disease or condition was treatable, but treatment was 
<br/></span><span>not available in our public hospital. It becomes a very sad situation when we tend to lose our family 
<br/></span><span>members just because medicine consumables or regents to perform tests are not available. This is 
<br/>why we need to have a hundred percent effective, efficient and reliable health care system.  We need 
<br/>to reform the health care sector to change the policies and institutions to improve its performance 
<br/>and the health of the population. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to have the political will to revolve the health system.  We need to 
<br/>ensure that health care is accessible to everyone, unfortunately this Government has criticised the 
<br/>Bainimarama Government’s policies about health system in Fiji at every stage.  We used to ensure 
<br/>that people get quality and efficient treatment through the PPP programme, but unfortunately this 
<br/>Government has diminished or basically crippled this policy as they do not have the money to pay 
<br/>private doctors.  Because of this reason, they cannot include more doctors and dentists in the PPP 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fijians must go and sit in lines at public hospital for hours to get treated.  This is ridiculous, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker.  All this government can do is blame, blame and blame.  They should go and ask the 
<br/>people in the Western Division about the level and quality of treatment they get from Aspen Medical, 
<br/>a policy decision made by the previous Government, and on the other hand, look at the Nadi Hospital 
<br/>managed by the current government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The service is pathetic at government-owned hospitals and medical centres.  It is two years 
<br/>now and what have they done?  Basically, nothing!  When Keiyasi Hospital was built, the decision 
<br/>was criticised but now that it is done, the Government cannot maintain and operate it properly.  We 
<br/>need  to  build  new  hospitals  in  deprived  areas  to  make  healthcare  available  to  the  un-deserved 
<br/>population.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us see if we can come up with any more new hospitals in this term of Parliament. We 
<br/>have just been hearing about the 100 Bed Super Speciality Cardiology Hospital that is to be built by 
<br/>the Indian Government.  What we recently heard is that the Government is not even able to provide 
<br/>land to build this hospital. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I do not know how far this is correct but the honourable Minister, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2287 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in his response, can elaborate on this particular matter.  Healthcare organisations can play a pivotal 
<br/>role in increasing the health literacy of affected groups by the expanding educational programme.  
<br/>We need to improve the efficiency of the health sector. How can we do this when the Ministry cannot 
<br/>even retain the experienced medical staff to bring efficiency into the system?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Medical professionals are leaving, not just because of greener pastures but the Government 
<br/>is failing to provide a conducive working environment.  Staff are made to work overtime even when 
<br/>they are not rostered.  While workers are giving a hundred percent towards their work, the support 
<br/>needed is not provided by the Government.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Patient experience needs to be improved and that is what we were doing through the PPP 
<br/>programme.  Fijians had options to visit GPs early in the morning and then end up at work rather 
<br/>than waiting for hours at public health facilities and returning home with a sick sheet. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  patient’s  record  is  still  kept  in  files  while  we  have  the  Patient  Information  Systems 
<br/>(PATIS). Why are we not  implementing whereby records are entered in  PATIS?  We should use 
<br/>technology to improve efficiency and patient-care quality.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it takes months to get a medical report at any public hospital and that too at 
<br/>a hefty fee.  This Government cannot provide medical care on time therefore I am requesting at least 
<br/>provide medical reports on time.  We need to improve coordination between departments as treating 
<br/>patients is a holistic approach. It would not be possible to give the best treatment if departments do 
<br/>not coordinate and provide adequate support to the specialist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We need to ensure that we prioritise patients and their safety, reduce clinical errors that leads 
<br/>to deadly consequences as we had with one such case in Nadi and are still waiting for an outcome of 
<br/>the inquiry that was taken by the Ministry for a patient named Ashika; the family is still patiently 
<br/>waiting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Improving the quality of health care should be paramount. To improve the quality, we need 
<br/>human  resources,  equipment,  infrastructure,  medicine  and  consumables.  Quality  can  only  be 
<br/>improved  when  the  doctor  is  surrounded  by  qualified  people  providing  support  towards  the 
<br/>management of the patient. We need to put patients at the centre of health care delivery. The patient 
<br/>needs access to right care, at the right time to get the best results.  The staff at health centres and 
<br/>hospitals needs to provide customers a friendly environment, and they need to realise that they are 
<br/>there for the patients and need to give them such care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the waiting room areas are not pleasant.  Most of the health centres do not 
<br/>have adequate sitting in the waiting area leading to overcrowding. Some of the health centres do not 
<br/>even have awaiting area, let alone chairs to sit.  The deteriorating infrastructure of the medical facility 
<br/>is  really  worrying  everyone.    Looking  at  the  condition  of  toilets  in  some  of  the  facilities  is  very 
<br/>worrying.  Toilets that do not even have toilet pans to sit, taps are running without water and no toilet 
<br/>paper for sanitation. The stench coming from washrooms is unbearable, imagine a patient suffering 
<br/>from diarrhoea visiting those toilets when the Government cannot even provide toilet papers.  For 
<br/>some of us, it may be a laughing matter, but the general public are suffering. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I must mention  that we need to change the membership of the National 
<br/>Medicine and Therapeutic Committee while on one side we are trying to bring in TGA, FDA and EU 
<br/>standard medication, on the other hand, the medication we are using are very old.  It is becoming 
<br/>difficult  to  even  source  this  medication  under  the  new  standard.    While  new,  effective  and  more 
<br/>economical medicines are available, our essential drug list that is reviewed by the National Medicine 
<br/>and Therapeutic Committee are still  using medications that are now part  of archive in developed 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nations.  We should have the private sector and other stakeholders’ representation in the National 
<br/>Medicine and Therapeutic Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  people  deserve  better  and  newer  treatment.  We  need  to  ensure  that  the  health  care  is 
<br/>financed sustainably.  When the previous government started giving a certain percentage from FNU 
<br/>levy towards improving the health care sector, this Government overturned it.  This Government has 
<br/>underutilised  CAPEX,  all  they  are  doing  is  increasing  the  OPEX,  reduce  the  expenditure,  stop 
<br/>overseas trips, save money and put it for the good use of the health sector. Stop using the civil service 
<br/>to employ failed candidates and supporters.  We need good people to do good job.  Medical field, 
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  human  resources  is  very  specialised.    We  need  specialists  and  that  comes  with 
<br/>experience and cost.  We need to fork out more money to pay better salaries across the sector to stop 
<br/>our health workers from migrating. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  medical  system  cannot  function  if  equipment  in  hospitals  are  not 
<br/>operational.  We need to ensure that our biomedical staff are well trained to maintain these equipment.  
<br/>Most of the time, people are complaining that equipment are down, and we do not have biomedical 
<br/>staff to fix the machines.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  90  percent  of  the  health  centres  do  not  have  pharmacists  to  dispatch  or 
<br/>control the inventory.  We cannot expect a staff nurse or pharmacy attendant to control inventory 
<br/>thus leading to medicine shortage and wastage of medicine all over the nation.  This leads to poor 
<br/>patient management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a lot needs to be changed to improve the healthcare system, and I hope that 
<br/>the honourable Minister will take the considerations of the Committee and implement them as soon 
<br/>as possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also would like to congratulate 
<br/>you on your appointment as Speaker of this august House, and I wish you well.  I must thank the 
<br/>Committee for their deliberations and work on the Consolidated Annual Reports from 2016 right up 
<br/>to 2021.  It is the report that I hold here, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I fully agree with my colleague on the issues that he has raised.  It is something that I believe 
<br/>that  did  not  start  all  of  a  sudden  last  year.    It  is  something  that  has  progressively  been  there  and 
<br/>likewise this Government is doing something about it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would just like to again thank the Committee for their work, and I do note 
<br/></span><span>that in their Report, they had raised key findings and recommendations.  There are about 12 finding 
<br/>and 11 recommendations.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As per the previous two Reports that had been debated, the Annual Reports for the 2016-2021 
<br/>Consolidated  Report  are  mostly  outdated,  and  the  findings  together  with  the  recommendations  is 
<br/>something that the Ministry, not only this Government, the previous Government, has rectified some 
<br/>of the issues: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation One:   
<br/>The Ministry should submit its Annual Reports on time.   
<br/>Since  taking  office  last  year,  that  was  one  of  the  first  initiatives  that  I  had  requested  the 
<br/>Ministry to report all relevant Annual Reports.  I am glad to say that this was done last year 
<br/>and likewise I can say for certain that 2021-2022 Report has been done as well and now with 
<br/>the Vetting Team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="75">Page 75</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2289 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Two: 
<br/>In  terms  of  the  review  of  the  regulations  and  policies  to  ensure  medical  professionals  are 
<br/>adequately equipped to deal with similar unprecedented situations as similar to COVID-19. 
<br/>Yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has commanded a number of reviews, especially on the 
<br/>legislation part, endorsed by Cabinet, some are in the review stages and some will be tabled 
<br/>in Cabinet for endorsement.  Therefore, in the consequent period next year, we will be tabling 
<br/>Bills for review and also planning the feedback that we get and then we have amendments to 
<br/>each. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Three: 
<br/>The  Ministry  to  work  with  relevant  stakeholders  to  address  challenges  pertaining  to 
<br/>infrastructure development and related crucial areas such as the current staff accommodation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Again, this is one of the areas that I had mentioned, it is not something new.  It has been there 
<br/>for quite some time and through the Ministry and some of its new initiatives, we are seeing 
<br/>changes  in  repairing,  renovation  of  certain  facilities,  not  only  within the  Government,  but 
<br/>starting last year, we have opened up the assistance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  recognise  that  we,  as  Government,  cannot  work  alone.    Therefore,  we  have  asked  for 
<br/>assistance from the private sector, especially from the Board of Visitors for certain facilities 
<br/>and they have come on board.  They have stepped in and assisted the Ministry in terms of 
<br/>partnering in infrastructure development and also not to forget the development partners who 
<br/>have stepped up and assisted us, especially DFAT and MFAT.  This partnership has shown 
<br/>an impact on the ground especially with the renovations and improvement of certain facilities 
<br/>within the Suva and Nausori corridor, and now going up to the West and hopefully before 
<br/>Christmas, we will commission the new Momi Nursing Station facility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Four:   
<br/> The Ministry should review the current staff retention policy to address the staff migration 
<br/>challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is one of the initiatives that I am proud to say that this Government is 
<br/>doing  and  through  the  ongoing  dialogue  between  the  Ministry,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Civil 
<br/>Service, we have come up with plans and there have been improvements in remuneration of 
<br/>nurses, other cadres are also being included in the review, and based on the review, we will 
<br/>peg them to their appropriate remuneration going forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Five: 
<br/> The Ministry should work closely with international organisations and donor partners.  Since 
<br/>coming into office, we had started a donor co-ordination, partnership with the relevant donor 
<br/>partners and through one of those donor partners, they are assisting us and likewise, learning 
<br/>from them as well.  One of those partners is the World Bank, through an initiative have come 
<br/>up with a Health Sector Review of 2024. It is a good report, worth reading and it will highlight 
<br/>what the honourable Alvick Maharaj has said, of course, is mainly here.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Six: 
<br/>The Ministry should increase awareness on social media platforms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, that is being done through our media team, not only in terms of putting out notices but 
<br/>also trying to be ahead or be proactive against misinformation as well.  The Ministry should 
<br/>address the challenges faced by the medical profession on accessing transport to the rural and 
<br/>maritime areas. Sir, this is something that the Ministry is also improving on, especially in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>2290 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>maritime areas, we have through the budgetary allocation of last year and this year provided 
<br/>outboard  motor boats to those living and serving in the maritime areas with facilities in the 
<br/>Lau Group, Central Division, Beqa and even Naililili in Rewa and up to the North, Visoqo 
<br/>Nursing Station and other areas, Lagi,  Rabi and Kioa as well.  Together with the outboard 
<br/>boat, also the Ministry is providing backup vehicles for certain areas and for hard-to-reach 
<br/>places in the interior of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Eight: 
<br/>The  Ministry  to  ensure  that  healthcare  workers  go  through  proper  training  in  handling 
<br/>biomedical equipment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As raised by honourable Maharaj, this is a cadre that we intend to support because going into 
<br/>the future, we see that they are used to be of great importance. As medicine progresses, there 
<br/>will be a need for them, and this is why the Ministry is investing in this cadre as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Nine:  
<br/>The  Ministry  to  do  a  comprehensive  analysis  to  determine  the  factors  contributing  to  the 
<br/></span><span>extended  waiting  time  as  raised  by  honourable  Maharaj,  this  is  not  something  new.  The 
<br/></span><span>Ministry in its current form is transforming Primary Health Care Project, something that we 
<br/>will  do  and  again  this  will  be  part  of  the  World  Bank  Health  Sector  Transformation  and 
<br/>Scaling.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Recommendation Eleven:  
<br/>The Ministry should ensure that the services provided by Ba Aspen Hospital and Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital under the PPP should continue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  will  let  the  honourable  Minister  for  Finance  elaborate  more  on  that  but  nevertheless  the 
<br/>Ministry, through dialogue with relevant partners in the partnership, have come up with an agreement 
<br/>to see that this can be done properly.  In its initial setup, the Ministry of Health was not consulted. 
<br/>So, in this new partnership agreement that we will be moving forward, all parties will be consulted 
<br/>and therefore it is an agreement, I believe, that will reach new heights in terms of services in the PPP 
<br/>for our people in the West.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is my contribution on what the Ministry is doing and again, I would like to thank the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Committee and wish them well on their future deliberations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  contribution  to  this  motion  is  not  just  as  a 
<br/></span><span>Member of Parliament but as a voice for every Fijian who wants a health care system that works, one 
<br/>that is accessible and effective.  Let us look at the reality, Mr. Speaker, Sir. A reality where election 
<br/>promises are broken, budgets are underutilised, and people’s lives are hanging by a thread.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the period under review, Fiji faced 14 cyclones, two of which were Category 5 and 
<br/>the once in a century COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these enormous challenges, the Bainimarama 
<br/>Government  stayed  focussed  on  improving  Fiji’s  healthcare.    We  implemented  forward  thinking 
<br/>policies  that  made  healthcare  more  accessible  with  the  new  and  upgraded  infrastructure  and 
<br/>prioritised  staff  training  and  retention.  Nursing  stations  like  Dawasamu,  Namara,  Nabou,  Cuvu, 
<br/>Nawaicoba and Tau were upgraded to health centres with doctors and nurse practitioners in charge. 
<br/>That is progress, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, during their term,  I was informed by the residents of Nawaicoba that there 
<br/>were days that this health centre was under lock and key, not even a single nurse or the doctor was 
<br/>there. I hope that matter has been sorted.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="77">Page 77</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2291 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bainimarama  Government  also  offered  incentives  and  embraced  a  Public-Private 
<br/>Partnership model to improve health care delivery. Initiatives like the GP subsidy scheme, private 
<br/>dentist  subsidy,  laboratory  test  subsidy  and  the  free  medicine  programme  helped  Fijians  access 
<br/>quality  health  care.  Let  us  not  forget  the  establishment  of  state-of-the-art  facilities  like  Heart 
<br/>International  Aspen  Medical,  Pacific  Specialist  Health  Care,  and  Nasese  Private  Hospital,  which 
<br/>brought specialised treatments, like open heart surgeries, stenting within the reach of many Fijians. 
<br/>That was through the various incentives that were provided.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After  </span><span>TC  Winston,</span><span>  we  rebuilt  and  upgraded  critical  facilities  like  Ba  Hospital,  Nakasi 
<br/>Hospital, Navosa Hospital, Sawakasa Health Centre, and the Makoi Maternity Hospital.  These are 
<br/>the facts, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Our Government knew that investing in health care professional was 
<br/>essential. Salaries were increased; some technical staffs stared at $28,000; and specialists earned over 
<br/>$140,000 annually; scholarships and overseas training opportunities were also expanded to ensure 
<br/>we trained out talents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, let us fast forward to today.  Despite a bigger health budget, the system is collapsing.  
<br/>Nurses who graduated in December had to wait six months for employment, while those already in 
<br/></span><span>the system were overworked. Where is the strategy, Mr. Speaker, Sir? We hear that there are only 
<br/></span><span>200 midwives for 300,000 childbearing women, and last year alone, 500 midwives migrated. We 
<br/>produce  50  midwives  annually,  sponsored  by  the  Australian  Government  but  they  are  not  even 
<br/>bonded. This is poor planning having a huge impact on women’s health.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  underutilised  2023-2024  Budget  is  another  glaring  failure.  Of  the 
<br/>$1million  allocated  for  staff  quarters,  $800,000  was  not  used.  Labasa  Hospital  had  $5million  for 
<br/>upgrades and less than $1million was spent. We were given reasons like electricity was not there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another $5 million for special maintenance and not a single cent was used.  For urban hospital 
<br/>equipment,  only  half of  the $4 million  allocation was spent.  Out of $12.3 million  for biomedical 
<br/>supplies, $7.4 million was unspent. Dental equipment, $1.2 million allocated but only $37,000 was 
<br/>used, and this Government claims to prioritise healthcare.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mental health is in crisis, but the budget for St. Giles Hospital was slashed.  When questioned 
<br/>during the Budget Committee of Supplies discussion, the honourable Minister said it was sufficient.  
<br/>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  health  care  workers  tell  a  very  different  story.  The  outsourcing  budget  for 
<br/>emergency clinical services was cut by $1 million. Yet the honourable Minister claims the capacity 
<br/>has improved. Really? Meanwhile, CWM Hospital cannot even conduct basic blood tests because 
<br/></span><span>there are no regents. Patients and health care workers alike are suffering.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me paint a heart wrenching picture of reality that many Fijian families 
<br/>go through.  A father, overwhelmed with fear and helplessness, watched his critical ill son clinging 
<br/>to life in the ICU.  It is a Sunday, a day when hope should flourish, but instead this father is forced 
<br/>to spend $500 on urgent medicine because the hospital shelves are empty.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine the anguish of that father as he walks into a pharmacy knowing every dollar spent is 
<br/>a desperate bid to save his child, but the pain does not end there.  Nurses driven by desperation by 
<br/>the lack of resources pleaded with him to share the life-saving medicine with other patients of other 
<br/>families who simply cannot afford them.  And if you are wondering who this father is, let me tell you 
<br/>that this father is no one else but honourable Aliki Bia. He shared his story with me, and I was deeply 
<br/>touched with the pain and suffering he went through, and his child is still in ICU.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not just a story of one family, it is a stark and devastating reflection 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of this Government that has failed its people. The sorrow of that father echoes the anguish of

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>countless Fijians who are left to fend for themselves when they are most vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while hospitals are in crisis, the Government sends a 56-member delegation, 
<br/>including nine Ministers, to COP29. Fijians are asking, why is this Government prioritising junket 
<br/>trips,  as  termed  by  honourable  Minister  for  Multi-Ethnic  Affairs  and  Sugar  Industry,  over  their 
<br/>health? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government promised to improve healthcare but instead, it 
<br/>has deteriorated. Many Fijians now look back and say, thank God COVID-19 happened during the 
<br/>Bainimarama  Government.    Health  care  is  not  just  a  line  in  the  budget,  it  is  a  lifeline.  This 
<br/>Government must stop fooling the people who trusted them with the election promises. Thank you, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I also would like to thank the Standing Committee for their very comprehensive 
<br/>Report, and I hope this Government will pay attention towards improving the health services in this 
<br/>country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  know  they  are  very  busy  producing  reports,  consultations,  reports  and  consultations  and 
<br/>only in today’s paper I read that NCD’s is definitely a crisis in this country, but one has to ask why, 
<br/></span><span>NCD’s is a crisis in this country?  Look at the cost of living, can people afford food? These are some 
<br/></span><span>realities on the ground. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  will  rule  out  of  order.  You  are  completely  out  from  the  topic  we  are 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>discussing.  It is about the Annual Report. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The Annual Report also mentions NCDs, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  So, this is 
<br/>a real reality on the ground, and I am urging the Government to look at the cost of living so that 
<br/>people can afford decent food. They are suffering because they cannot buy food, they struggle when 
<br/>they go to the supermarket and see the cost of proteins, cost of milk, that is the reality on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I know you do not want to hear this, but  I am speaking from the public who have related 
<br/>stories to me, and I am speaking from my very personal experience when you go and shop in the 
<br/>supermarket.  So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  you  for  giving  me  this  opportunity  and  I  hope  the 
<br/>honourable Minister will take heed of this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to contribute to the debate on the 
<br/>Consolidated Review Annual Report for the Ministry of Health and Medical Services 2016 to 2021. 
<br/>I will only focus on the Standing Committee’s recommendation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, I commend the call for the timely submission of the Annual Reports. This procedural, 
<br/>yet critical aspect provides a wealth of information that enables us in this Parliament to understand 
<br/>proposed plans and improve in a timely manner to benefit the people we represent in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  falls  in  the  uncertain  and  unchartered  time  when  Tropical 
<br/>Cyclone Winston a category 5 cyclone swept through the southern hemisphere taking away 44 lives 
<br/>and devastated more than 60 percent of our population.  Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic where 
<br/>more than 800 lives were lost due to COVID.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  during  these  two  turbulent  times  it  has  exposed  cracks  in  our  health  system.  The 
<br/>recommendation by the Committee on 6.2 addresses this by urging the Ministry to learn from this 
<br/>crisis and to ensure that our medical professionals, the equipment, the healthcare infrastructure are 
<br/>well equipped to deal with such situations in the future. Although infrastructure development and 
<br/>personnel  accommodation for staff are normally not  debated in  the health sector’s report, but  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="79">Page 79</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2293 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>impact on boosting the staff morale and the service level quality is undeniable, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>therefore the Standing Committee recommendation for the review is essential. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Standing Committee’s attention to  staff migration is  also  concerning. Our health care 
<br/>sector is losing talented health professionals overseas and we must tackle this through an attractive 
<br/>staff  retention  policy  with  regards  to  their  salary,  wages,  resilient  work  environment  and  welfare 
<br/>support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, our partnership with the international bodies is essential in 
<br/>building healthcare facilities and counteracting the ill-effects of climate change. As I noted a surge 
<br/>in drug abuse, NCDs, HIV/AIDS which cannot be ignored, and the Ministry should deploy massive 
<br/>outreach potential at least on all social media platforms to create awareness for our population Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is imperative to consider our established local settings, the structure to be consulted and be 
<br/>involved in fighting for NCD’s and drug abuse. The ecumenical faith-based organisations, the </span><span>vanua</span><span>, 
<br/>the community set-up are critical in addressing this national crises through awareness, preaching, 
<br/></span><span>teaching and through </span><span>talanoa</span><span>. Already alluded to by the honourable Minister, transport is another 
<br/></span><span>integral  enabling  tool  for  medical  professionals  to  reach  the  hard-to-reach  places  in  our  rural 
<br/>communities. We need good vehicles, and also for the maritime and the coastal areas, we need good 
<br/>boats that are safe for the transfer of staff and also patients.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To improve the service in  health care centres, a reduction in  waiting  time is  essential. To 
<br/>ensure  that  healthcare  workers  are  properly  trained  in  handling  biomedical  equipment  and  also 
<br/>capacity  building  and  support  for  our  biomedical  engineers  and  biomedical  technicians.  I  fully 
<br/>support the Private, Public Partnership oriented health care services at the Ba Aspen and Lautoka 
<br/>Hospital, and we look forward to seeing the Ministry continue its efforts towards achieving the SDG 
<br/>targets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I resume my seat Mr. Speaker, Sir, I ask all honourable Members to support the many 
<br/>initiatives that has been mooted by the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services recently, 
<br/>which include the Fiji Health Adaptation Plan 2024-2030, it was announced in COP29 in Baku last 
<br/>month. Also, the initiative of the National HIV Surge Strategy to counter the rise of HIV/AIDS cases 
<br/>by  intensifying  and  testing  capacity,  increasing  community  awareness  for  HIV/AIDS.  The 
<br/>commencement of the third steps for NCD conducted through collaboration with the World Health 
<br/>Organisation  (WHO)  also  is  the  intention  to  strengthen  primary  health  care  and  to  resource  the 
<br/></span><span>primary health care initiatives.      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the outcome and the recommendation out of the health audit by the 
<br/>World Bank, in the allocation of 3.5 percent of our national GDP towards health service is not worthy 
<br/>and also we can challenge ourselves to go forward from there.  It will serve a strong basis for our 
<br/>health care development moving forward. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  all  this,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  urge  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  the  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister, Minister for Finance to look for necessary funding to enable the honourable Minister to be 
<br/>able to deliver this health sector initiative effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, I fully agree with the Standing Committee’s recommendation and urge my honourable 
<br/>colleagues to offer their support to this motion for the health benefit of all Fijians. I thank you Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to this debate.  </span><span>Vinaka.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Health 
<br/>and Medical Services for very clearly laying out exactly what the Government and what the Ministry 
<br/>of Health has been doing over the last two years. I also want to thank honourable Ravunawa for a 
<br/>very sensible contribution, unlike the hypocrisy that came from honourable Maharaj and honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these two honourable Members, when we were in Opposition, twice we 
<br/>moved  a  motion  to  have  inquiry  into  the  health  system  and  they  were  sitting  here,  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament and they opposed it. The result of that, Sir, and the fact that we are discussing 2016-2021 
<br/>Annual Reports is a demonstration of the failure that happened in the health system delivery under 
<br/>the FijiFirst Government and their leader. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, they should listen. Thank you, Sir, because 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was listening to them very carefully.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me point out, then I will tell you a little story as soon as we got into Government, very 
<br/>early I went to Dreketi and I went to Wainikoro, when we entered Dreketi Health Centre and I entered 
<br/>the doctor’s consultation room, there was dust, there were tiles falling apart, the two nurses on the 
<br/>other side were in tears, saying “Sir, this is the condition in which we work.” We fixed that health 
<br/>centre Mr. Speaker, Sir, in about six months in 2023. When I saw the quarters of the doctor and it 
<br/>was falling apart, and she was still committed and serving almost 15,000 people in that area.  From 
<br/>there, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we moved to Wainikoro, we got there and I asked the X-ray person, how is 
<br/>your X-ray department?  She said “Sir, I have been coming to work, punching then filing and going 
<br/>back because the X-ray machine has not worked for four months.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  built  Nausori  Health  Centre  in  one  year,  we  got  the  New  Zealand 
<br/>Government to support building the health centre and the honourable Minister and the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister went and opened, That health centre Mr. Speaker, Sir, was falling apart, people did 
<br/>not want to go to that health centre, they were serving 70,000 people and today you go to that health 
<br/>centre people have told me in Nausori, Mr. Speaker Sir, “thank you, we now feel like going to the 
<br/>Nausori Health Centre.” This is the level at which the health facilities were left.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Maharaj, if you had listened he was not here and if he was here 
<br/></span><span>he would have listened to the honourable Minister for Health, all the things that he is doing. He talked 
<br/>about the PPP, I gave a detailed explanation in the 2024-2025 Budget Address, how that agreement 
<br/>was done. It was almost unlawful what was done. Government is paying every single cent.... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBER.- Take them to Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government is now sorting that out.  We 
<br/>like  Public  Private  Partnership.  The  abuse  that  was  happening  in  the  previous  system,  we  have 
<br/>plugged  that  hole,  we  are  now  working  out  how  it  should  be  done,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.  Yes,  not 
<br/>everywhere,  not  every  health  centre  has  been  fixed  in  two  years.  Not  every  pharmacy,  not  every 
<br/>instant things happen, and we have to understand why people complain, they complain to me as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, for honourable Kumar and honourable Maharaj to come here and pontificate and 
<br/>forget completely what they had left, be a bit honest.  I know it will take time for you to get used to 
<br/>being in Opposition. You probably need two terms in Opposition before you come into Government 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2295 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to  be  able  to  understand  the  frustration  that  one  has,  because  when  you  are  in  Government  or  in 
<br/>Opposition, you get the same kind of complaints from people.  We do not mind honourable Members 
<br/>from  the  Opposition  coming  and  talking  about  it,  I  used  to  do  that,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir.    I  know, 
<br/>honourable Maharaj learnt it from me, he is experienced enough. But you also admit that when you 
<br/>are in Government what went wrong. I think that will be honest, that will be more helpful and that 
<br/>will be appreciated by people on this side.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me talk about the budget. Honourable Kumar, out of her 10-minute contribution, there is 
<br/>only one thing that she said that made sense out of so many that she said, and that was about budget 
<br/>utilization.  Yes, there is an issue.  Our budget now is about 4 percent of GDP. The WHO’s standard 
<br/>is about 4.5. We have moved away from the low budget that we had before to about percent of GDP, 
<br/>0.5 short of the WHO international requirement of 4.5 percent which comes to about $580 million 
<br/>and includes the payment that the Government makes to the PPP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Government has been very honest. We have not denied any time that 
<br/>there are problems and that is why this Government called for a review of the total health sector.  
<br/>What  the Report shows, they should read the Report. What  it shows very clearly that  in  the last, 
<br/></span><span>almost  15 years to  20 years, our health outcomes of an upper  middle-income  country, our health 
<br/></span><span>outcomes is equivalent to a low income country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Richard Naidu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- In the 1970s and 1980s, the Report says very clearly that our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>public health outcomes, the incidents of NCDs  were much lower than what we have now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, as a Government, Mr. Speaker, Sir, also introduced policies.  I know, honourable Kumar 
<br/>was opposing that. We put tax on sugary products and she was talking about why we are not doing 
<br/>anything too. She is talking about cost of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at the last Budget, all our policies apart from the budget in 2022, 
<br/>2023 and 2024 where we increased funding for social welfare for other sectors, in the last budget we 
<br/>addressed the income side directly, we increased the salaries of civil servants, we raised the minimum 
<br/>wages rate from $4.50 to $5 from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April, 2009. We have seen the impact of that. You look at the 
<br/>consumption. You look at the economic activity. You look at the confidence now in the economy,  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is up there and the outcome of that is what the honourable Minister for 
<br/></span><span>Health just said about some of the things, “things are happening, there are problems, and we admit 
<br/></span><span>that. But it will be fixed, it is being fixed and I would suggest to people like honourable Maharaj who 
<br/>is a health sector man to appreciate these things better.   When you come to Parliament, give some 
<br/>constructive suggestion instead of playing politics. We still have 18 months before we get into the 
<br/>election mode. So, I will ask them to wait for another year before they get into an election mode and 
<br/>start talking like this.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Just speak the truth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is completely on board. We 
<br/>have got this Report; the World Bank is with us, the partners are with us, the $650 million project. 
<br/>Phases 1 and 2 will deal with the incidents of NCDs, Primary Health Care and that will reduce, in 
<br/>economic terms, it is a no brainer because if we spend more money in the public health sector, we 
<br/>stop more people from coming up, ending up in hospitals.  Economically, it makes sense, health wise 
<br/>it makes sense, it improves productivity, it makes things better for everyone, not in terms of only 
<br/>health outcomes, but for the economy.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
