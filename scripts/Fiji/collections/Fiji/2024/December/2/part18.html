<div><span>the Right of Reply given to me as the Member moving this motion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, you are aware ,this Bill was moved by First Reading 
<br/>on 3</span><span>rd</span><span> October, 2024.  However, Standing Order 51(3) permits Bills to be fast-tracked at any stage.  
<br/>In that respect, this motion is in order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move that the Fiji 
<br/>Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 (Bill No. 19/2024) be now debated in this session 
<br/>of Parliament.  This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, needs to be put to debate now as there has been sufficient 
<br/>awareness  and  consultations  undertaken,  encompassing  a  broad  cross-section  of  our  society.    I 
<br/>commend all those who have been participating in this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On 10</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, Sir, this august House approved a motion to establish a Truth and 
<br/>Reconciliation Commission.  Cabinet subsequently appointed a Steering Committee to consult and 
<br/>develop the legislative framework for consideration by this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In drafting the Bill, the Committee conducted consultations with both victims/survivors and 
<br/>perpetrators of various political events.  Consultations were also held with civil society, faith-based 
<br/>groups, human rights activists and advocates, media organisations, political parties, communities in 
<br/>the Northern, Western and Central Divisions. The Committee also engaged with youth groups as well 
<br/>as our diaspora community through digital platforms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  basic  elements  of  the  Bill  are  drawn  from  the  Commission  of  Inquiry  Act.    The 
<br/>Committee also learned from global experiences.  Over the years around the world more than 50 
<br/>countries  at  some  point,  established  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commissions.  One  of  the  major 
<br/>purposes of these initiatives was to resolve historic injustices and abuses through public hearings, 
<br/>truth-telling  and  reconciliation  between  victims/survivors  and  perpetrators,  as  a  way  of  moving 
<br/>beyond the painful past towards a peaceful future.  It is hoped that many who have suffered gross 
<br/>human rights violations, and their families and communities will find healing and closure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  those  who  were  in  the  Business  Committee  in  the  previous  House  will 
<br/>remember that I tried to move this motion with the Business Committee at that time, but it was not 
<br/>allowed. Now, I move that this Bill now progress further to debate pursuant to Standing Order 51.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the motion has been tabled in the House and I think 
<br/>for all of us in this country, given the history that we have been through and all the tumultuous things 
<br/></span><span>that we have had in the past, we know the impact that it has had.  It is not only having an impact on 
<br/></span><span>us, it has had an impact on those who come before us and it will happen again, it will have an impact 
<br/>on those who come after us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am not only talking about the events of </span><span>coups</span><span>, but I am also talking about all the things that 
<br/>ever happened in this country that have shaken this country to its very core. It is important that we 
<br/>do this. I think in all of our teachings, we talk about reconciliation and truth; that is true. I agree with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2265 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>all of that. I agree with all the tenets that we have that these things need to take place, but what are 
<br/>the concerns that we have?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Prime Minister has talked at length and very eloquently about the fact that 
<br/>this is based on a lot of work done by Committees and the research that they have undertaken. But I 
<br/>think this critical Bill that we have here which people in this  country have different views about, 
<br/>while it has gone through the lens of public opinion and the Committees that have done their work, I 
<br/>do not know the bureaucrats or the Civil Service that they have done it, it has not gone to the fine 
<br/>lens of the representatives of the people. It has not gone to the lens of their scrutiny and they are 
<br/>seeking their own opinions on this particular Bill because one of the things that we are talking about 
<br/>in truth and reconciliation, there are two aspects of this.  There is the aspect of reconciliation and the 
<br/>aspect of truth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we tend to do a lot when we are talking about truth and reconciliation, we focus a lot 
<br/>on the reconciliation without the truth. True reconciliation happens when the truth comes out. It is 
<br/>important that we address and talk about these things because what we intend to do, we only talk 
<br/>about it to people in our own little niche and people that think like us. We need to talk about it openly.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very important that this Bill, rather than being fast-tracked or 
<br/>going to Standing Order 51 for us to debate it immediately, it should go through the full parliamentary 
<br/>scrutiny. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. OPPOSITION MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- We should allow the representatives of the voters of this country, their  
<br/>representatives who sit in Committees to have the opportunity to look into the Bill itself, to look into 
<br/>the  Truth  and  Reconciliation  Commission.  I  believe,  ultimately,  in  my  heart  and  mind  that  it  is 
<br/>absolutely necessary that this Bill should go to Committees. Let us consult with people. Let us, the 
<br/>representatives of voters, let the House of democracy also consult the people of this country.  It is on 
<br/>that basis, Sir, that I do not agree with this motion to take it quickly for us to vote on it this week. I 
<br/>prefer to see that it goes through the Parliamentary Committees system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Usamate, I had allowed you just a bit more freedom to speak 
<br/>on the motion, but if you had continued, I would rule you out of order because this is specifically on 
<br/>a technical nature.  The motion is relevant only in so far as a process of how this Bill is going to come 
<br/>through the system and at a later stage in the arguments, my understanding is that you will indulge 
<br/></span><span>yourself in what you talked about on the merits or otherwise of the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I was trying to say that the motion calls for it 
<br/>to be debated upon immediately.  What I am against is that the idea of technical aspect to this nature 
<br/>for us to vote on it immediately this week.  I am against that and I am, therefore, putting it to the 
<br/>Committee. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I accept that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wanted to make a very brief comment 
<br/></span><span>on this, and perhaps in response to honourable Usamate’s concern, this Bill was already tabled in 
<br/>Parliament.    It  is  there  and  honourable  Members  have  had  a  lot  of  time  to  look  through  it.    The 
<br/>consultation that has been done throughout the country is quite extensive, and so the timing is also 
<br/>very important, as the honourable Prime Minister said.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I think we should be really grateful that the honourable Prime Minister, under his leadership, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="52">Page 52</a></div>
<div><span>2266 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has  taken  the  step  to  do  this  process  through  reconciliation  in  this  country.    The  term  of  this 
<br/>Parliament is another two years.  It is urgent, it is appropriate, and there has been enough consultation 
<br/>and discussion.  Honourable Usamate has already seen the Bill, he knows the consultation is taking 
<br/>place, therefore, I think it is reasonable for the honourable Prime Minister to move this Bill under 
<br/>Standing Order 51 and have this debated on Wednesday.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe we are actually debating on the motion 
<br/>itself of actually bringing this particular Bill under Standing Order 51, and I tend to totally disagree 
<br/>that we should expedite this particular Bill.  When it actually came two months ago, we could have 
<br/>gone through it under Standing Order 51 and send the Bill to the Committee.  They would have had 
<br/>two months to review and bring back the report.  We were actually given the Audit Bill 2024, we are 
<br/>reporting back on this Bill in this Sitting.  I do not see as to why we are actually rushing through this 
<br/>Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> It has taken us long, it has been more than 30 years that all these things started and now, 
<br/>when we are just on the verge of going out for public consultations, doing it in the right and proper 
<br/>way.  Parliamentary procedures are there for a purpose.  We should not bypass the system.  It was 
<br/>placed in Parliament for the first reading, and this was supposed to be the second reading, and the 
<br/>Bill was supposed to go to the Committee.  Now, we are amending the procedures, using the Standing 
<br/>Order, to convert a normal process into Standing Order 51.  If this is about truth and reconciliation, 
<br/>what do we actually have to hide?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is not about me and you, it is about the general public. It is not about reconciliation between 
<br/>Government and Opposition.  Let us take this particular Bill to the people who are affected.   the Bill 
<br/>needs to go to the general public to have their opinions heard, and that is why we have parliamentary 
<br/>Committees to do that.  There is a process in place.  Why are we trying to bypass the process?  What 
<br/>is the need to actually rush this Bill through under Standing Order 51 to get it passed in this particular 
<br/>sitting?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If it is all about the general public, it is all about the people who have actually committed 
<br/>something,  and  it  is  about  the  victims  as  well,  let  the  parliamentary  Committee  go  and  have  a 
<br/>discussion with these people, bring a report back and then we can contribute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is all about the process, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I personally do not agree on this particular 
<br/>motion to amend to actually expedite this particular Bill, I still urge the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>to stick to his initial motion of sending this Bill under Second Reading to the Committee for public 
<br/></span><span>consultation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  go  along  with  my  colleagues  regarding  this 
<br/>particular Bill.  This is a government that talks about ‘people listening government’, ‘government 
<br/>that consults’, but they are not listening to the people.  What is the role of the legislators? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  role  of  the  legislators  is  to  scrutinise  the  Bill,  and  the  Committee  is  not  given  an 
<br/>opportunity to scrutinise the Bill.   Why should we be relying on civil servants to go and consult, 
<br/>bring the Bill here, and we should be stamping it.  It is the work of the Committee to take the Bill 
<br/></span><span>into the community, get their feedback, bring it here and then we can go through the Bill and, finally, 
<br/></span><span>make our decision.  But, unfortunately, the very listening government today decided not to listen to 
<br/>the people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are talking about democracy, you were talking about change. Is this the change people 
<br/>wanted?  You criticised a lot about Standing Order 51.  What happened today?  Now, you are moving 
<br/>away from the real issue. Where is consultation?  It is all about hypocrisy.  Hypocrisy is the word 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="53">Page 53</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2267 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that describes your behaviour today, and I am extremely disappointed that the very government who 
<br/>said, “We will bring about the change”, what are you doing now?  Is this the change people expected?  
<br/>Shame on you! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, when I am listening to the Opposition, they 
<br/>might become the government, that is why I said the Opposition, it is possible.  So, be positive, do 
<br/>not look at things negatively.  But when I listened to the very individuals who are raising this issue, 
<br/>when we were in the Opposition, they were utilising the Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can you take your seat, please, honourable Minister?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, I would like some decorum in this Chambers.  Please, pay respect to 
<br/>the speaker while he is delivering his intervention.  You have every right to respond, if necessary, 
<br/>and I will allow you that opportunity, if need be.  But allow the speaker to proceed without as much 
<br/>disturbance.  It does, in fact, affect his train of thoughts and I wish you Members to, please, respect 
<br/>the speaker who is addressing the House.  Can you please proceed, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Just  to  continue,  Mr.  Speaker,  out  of  the  Bills  that  were 
<br/>brought up by the very individuals who are raising their voices today, about 90 percent came through  
<br/>this Standing Order.  And when you compare it with this Government, a very small percentage of 
<br/>what we are bringing up goes through Standing Order 51.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It does not mean that we are a lenient government, that we are a friendly government, that we 
<br/>cater for everyone that we will not use Standing Order 51, of course, we have to use it for a specific 
<br/>reason which the honourable Prime Minister has alluded to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  when  we  look  at  that,  you  have  to  really  take  into  account  the  environment.    The 
<br/>environment  right  now  is  for  reconciliation,  and  if  you  look  at  the  Commander,  I  thank  the 
<br/>Commander of the Fiji Military Forces for the work that he has done.  I commend him, and in line 
<br/>with that, it must go hand in hand with what the Government is doing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of the concerns you have raised regarding what the people might bring up, it will be 
<br/></span><span>catered for in this process, as we move forward, and there have been wide consultations.  We have 
<br/></span><span>seen it in the media and also with the work of those moving around other countries regarding the 
<br/>issue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Standing Order 60 on Relevance, we are talking about the technicality.  
<br/></span><span>The honourable Member is going on a trip of looking backwards.  He needs to focus on the issue at 
<br/></span><span>hand and talk about it, not talk about what happened in the past.  He always does this.  What he is 
<br/>talking about, Sir, is completely irrelevant to what we are talking about here. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Just to conclude, everything is in order.  When you look at 
<br/>Standing Order 51(3), the motion to proceed without delay in relation to a Bill may be moved at any 
<br/>stage of the progression of the Bill through Parliament.  We are a law-abiding Government, that is

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>why we are doing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think we have had enough interventions on this motion. I will now invite 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Prime Minister to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I respect all the views expressed by the honourable 
<br/>Members of the Opposition and I just draw our attention to the essence of this motion to have this 
<br/>Bill processed through Standing Order 51 and I took a great risk moving this motion today because 
<br/>I know that we have, on the Government side, a minority in the vote.  It is your vote, you allow us to 
<br/>go through and debate this on the date mentioned - Wednesday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> December, for its adoption.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the motion before Parliament, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote.
