<h3>POINT OF ORDER</h3>
<div><span>POINT OF ORDER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Misconduct â€“ Hon. C.J. Singh 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a Point of Order under Standing Order 7, whereby a 
<br/>Member takes an oath, but Mr. Speaker allow me, before I talk on the Point of Order, I would like to 
<br/>welcome you Sir to this august House and congratulate you on your appointment as the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, this honourable Member concerned, took an oath that he would be faithful and 
<br/>would bear true allegiance to the Republic of Fiji.  He also promised that he will defend the rights of 
<br/>the people and will act with integrity, and diligently carry out his responsibility. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, honourable Charan Jeath Singh has shown in this august House that he is not 
<br/>practising the oath he has taken.  He has also shown that he is not worthy at national level and his 
<br/>recent  actions  and  </span><span>Facebook  </span><span>post  has  brought  great  humiliation  to  the  nation  and  towards  our 
<br/>hardworking civil servants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  Mr.  Speaker,  while  our  civil  servants  were  working  tirelessly 
<br/>without adequate sleep,  honourable Charan Jeath Singh  might  have been in  a drunk state posting 
<br/>rubbish on his </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page from his luxury hotel room because we were reliably informed Mr. 
<br/>Speaker  that  99  percent  of  the  time,  he  was  missing  from  meeting  venues.    The  highest  level  of 
<br/>hypocrisy was when honourable Charan J. Singh himself was missing from most of the meeting and 
<br/>blaming others on his </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I urge the honourable Prime Minister to suspend him from all future overseas travel because 
<br/>he is not only bringing shame to himself, but to the nation at large.  His integrity is in question, he is 
<br/>not  working  diligently  and  removing  his  </span><span>Facebook  </span><span>posts  testifies  that  his  action  was  wrong  and 
<br/>unwarranted. Therefore, we demand honourable Charan Jeath Singh to seek both verbal and written 
<br/></span><span>public apology in this august House to all hardworking civil servants and the nation. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>we should also consider stripping him from his ministerial portfolio. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, I wish to respond to the Point of Order that is being 
<br/>raised by the honourable Member.  Firstly, Mr. Speaker, the honourable Member being discussed is 
<br/>not  in  the  House  today  and  the  honourable  Member  should  know  better  so  that  he  can  have  an 
<br/>opportunity  to  respond.  I  ask  the  honourable  Member  to  withdraw  his  Point  of  Order  so  that 
<br/>honourable Charan Jeath Singh is present in the House to be able to respond and that would be fair.  
<br/>The honourable Member should know better. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, he has also made allegations that are offensive and that is against Standing Order 
<br/>62(4).  He has made allegations that have not been substantiated and without the opportunity of the 
<br/>honourable Member to respond in the House.  I ask him to work with his Whip and Caucus to ensure 
<br/>that the honourable Member is in the House to be able to respond.

<div><span>Presentation of Papers &amp; Certain Documents 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Natural  justice  demands  that  the  honourable  Member  who  has  been 
<br/>identified is here to respond to the allegations and accusations that have been made.  He is not present 
<br/>in  here  and  I  will  rule  that  this  question  or  Point  of  Order  is  out  of  order,  until  such  time  as  the 
<br/>honourable Member is here, you may then raise the issue that you have raised this morning.
