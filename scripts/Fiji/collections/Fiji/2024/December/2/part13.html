<h3>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The following honourable Ministers have given notice to make Ministerial 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Statements under Standing Order 40: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Micro,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Launch of the Hydrogen Dual-Fuel Generator Demonstration Project 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Members of Parliament, 
<br/>ladies and gentlemen, </span><span>bula vinaka</span><span> and a very good morning to you all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>May I take this moment to extend my warmest congratulations to you, Sir, on your election 
<br/>as Speaker of the House. Your appointment to this significant role marks a new chapter in fostering 
<br/>robust and constructive debate within this esteemed chamber.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In reflecting on the principles of parliamentary democracy we are reminded of the timeless 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>words spoken by Speaker William Lenthall in 1642, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  words  encapsulate,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  essence  of  the  partiality  and  dedication  that 
<br/>defines  the  role  of  the  Speaker;  serving  as  a  guardian  of  fairness,  balance  and  the  dignity  of  this 
<br/>august Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We look forward to your guidance and leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we work together to 
<br/></span><span>uphold these principles, ensuring meaningful and respectful dialogue that benefits our nation. Once 
<br/>again, congratulations on this well-deserved appointment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I also  would like to  add to  your congratulations,  my  congratulations to  our victorious  Fiji 
<br/>Sevens team to the coach Osea Kolinisau, captain Jerry Matana, and the members of the team.  We 
<br/>congratulate them on this win in Dubai 7s after a period of about 22 months. The drought has truly 
<br/>broken, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I rise today to share a groundbreaking and transformative milestone in Fiji's journey towards 
<br/></span><span>sustainable  energy  and  decarbonisation.    On  26</span><span>th</span><span>  November,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  Fiji  gas,  in 
<br/>collaboration and partnership with the Obayashi Corporation of Japan and Halcyon Power of New 
<br/>Zealand, hosted the groundbreaking demonstration of a hydro dual fuel generator at their Lautoka 
<br/>depot.   This project represents a significant leap in our efforts to transition towards cleaner energy 
<br/>sources and reduce dependency on imported fossil fuels.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, simply put, this project is about testing how Fiji can use a cleaner fuel, in 
<br/>this case, hydrogen, to produce electricity.  Hydrogen fuel is created using renewable energy such as 
<br/>geothermal  power,  which  comes  from  heat  inside  the  earth.  Unlike  our  traditional  diesel,  which 
<br/>produces harmful emissions, hydrogen is cleaner and releases only water when used.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This generator at the Lautoka depot is trial run, helping us learn what works and what needs 
<br/>to  improve  before  we  adopt  this  technology  on  a  larger  scale.    More  importantly,  it  will  help  us 
<br/>understand the infrastructure and policies we need to support hydrogen use, making it easier for us 
<br/>to adopt this clean energy technology on a larger scale.  Hydrogen, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is seen as a 
<br/>game changer.   It can replace fossil fuels in many areas from powering generators to fuelling vehicles 
<br/>and vessels.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this achievement traces back to the New Zealand Trade Mission in 2023, 
<br/>which I headed.  During the mission, we reinforced the strong relationship between Fiji and New 
<br/>Zealand  under  the  Duavata  Partnership.    This  partnership  underscores  our  shared  commitment  to 
<br/>mutual economic progress, climate action and sustainability. As part of the Mission, we engaged in 
<br/>productive discussions with the New Zealand Government, which has laid the foundation for what 
<br/>has now become this remarkable hydrogen project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>During the mission, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also had the privilege of visiting the Tuaropaki Trust 
<br/>Hydrogen Production Plant and witnessing the process of how green hydrogen energy is produced.  
<br/>The power plant harnesses geothermal energy to produce green hydrogen.  Through the Tuaropaki 
<br/>Trust, Halcyon Power Ltd oversees the production of green hydrogen and facilitates its transportation 
<br/>from New Zealand to Fiji, where it is utilised for the hydrogen dual fuel generator installed by Fiji 
<br/>Gas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is, of course, a pilot project but is part of a broader initiative supported 
<br/>by the Joint Crediting Financing Support Programme administered by the Ministry of Environment 
<br/>of  Japan.  Through  the  Joint  Crediting  Mechanism  (JCM),  Financing  Support  Programme,  the 
<br/>Japanese  Government  has  played  a  pivotal  role  in  making  this  project  a  reality.  This  partnership 
<br/>reflects  more  than  just  financial  support.  It  symbolises  a  transfer  of  knowledge,  technology  and 
<br/>vision.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Japan represented by Obayashi Corporation has contributed technical expertise and financial 
<br/>backing, while New Zealand, a global leader in renewable energy, has supplied the green energy and 
<br/>has shared its vast experience in developing hydrogen powered solutions. Together these partnerships 
<br/></span><span>exemplify  the  power  of  international  cooperation  in  driving  innovation  and  sustainability.  I  also 
<br/></span><span>commend Fiji Gas for their vision and commitment to this initiative.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  project  sets  the  stage  for  Fiji  to  lead  by  example  in  the  Pacific, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>demonstrating how renewable energy solutions can create a greener, most resilient future for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  will  now  call  upon  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F. S. KOYA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, let me take this opportunity to congratulate you. Much 
<br/></span><span>has been said already, but on a lighter note, you fill a seat that has been filled by many experienced 
<br/>people, and a lot that happened. So historically, there is a very hot chair that you sit on, in and amongst 
<br/>some very hot–headed politicians, but welcome to the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also want to take this time to congratulate our Fiji Team on their win, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>seeing that I only have five minutes, I’ll get right to the point.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2223 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this particular project is actually good, is great for Fiji. It is a major step 
<br/>also for us in terms of looking towards sustainable energy solutions and it is also something that we 
<br/>have been doing for many-a-year, but it is in line with all of our commitments that we have actually 
<br/>made in terms of green energy and energy solutions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most important things that we must remember, Sir, and this has to do with the use 
<br/>of hydrogen. This particular hydrogen that arrives in our country has also been sourced in a green 
<br/>fashion out of New Zealand. So, the supply chain itself is green before it actually gets here. And in 
<br/>light of what is happening around the world and many other larger countries not doing as much as 
<br/>they can in terms of climate change and addressing the issues with respect to climate change, any 
<br/>little bit that we do as Fiji, or any little bit that we do as a little company or even a large company, 
<br/>makes a difference. So, congratulations to Fiji Gas and also many thanks to the Japanese Government 
<br/>and to the New Zealand Government also that have been involved in this. Special congratulations to 
<br/>Fiji Gas for getting this done, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I have said, one of the most important things is 
<br/>the supply chain that currently exists. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must all do what we can with respect to reducing our greenhouse gas 
<br/>emissions. We can see from around the world, in the news, every day, what is actually happening to 
<br/>all our different countries, with all the different floods etc. With us approaching our hurricane season, 
<br/>we should always learn to expect the worst and do the most that we can to reduce greenhouse gas 
<br/>emissions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  in  short,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  congratulations  to  Fiji  Gas  and  commend  the  honourable 
<br/>minister for bringing this to the house and letting us all know about it. On a final note, Sir, I hope 
<br/>and pray that Energy Fiji Limited (EFL) is taking note of the amount of projects that are actually 
<br/>trying to come online with respect to supplying energy and they seriously look at how viable it is and 
<br/>making it more viable for us to be able to invest in it, whether it is solar energy or hydrogen energy 
<br/>or  dual-powered  generators  etc.  Because  from  what  I  understand,  I  think  that  EFL  has  not  really 
<br/>being playing ball in terms of people wanting to invest in the renewable energy sector, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Koya, I take on board your advice to the Office of the Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before  I call on the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate, I welcome in  the 
<br/>gallery, the High Commissioner of Australia to Fiji, His Excellency, Mr. Ewen McDonald. Welcome, 
<br/>Your Excellency to our proceedings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in congratulating you on your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>appointment as the Speaker of this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement.  It is great to hear and witness how the Government is taking action on Fiji’s ongoing 
<br/>journey towards sustainable energy and decarbonisation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was part of the Fiji delegation that recently returned from  COP29 and this 
<br/></span><span>topic  on  sustainable  energy  and  decarbonisation,  once  again,  was  discussed  at  the  various  levels 
<br/>during the COP, as this was part of the Paris Agreement. I learned that the whole idea of having this 
<br/>decarbonization and also the drive towards sustainable energy, which is the overarching goal, is to 
<br/>hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees celsius above the pre-
<br/>industrial level and pursue effort to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above the 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pre-industrial level.  So, by supporting the hydrogen dual-fuel generator, Fiji is on the right track, 
<br/>and I thank the Government for honouring its commitment towards the Paris Agreement.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, I congratulate the Government and also acknowledge the partnership between 
<br/>Fiji Gas and Obayashi Corporation and Halcyon Power Ltd, in bringing this project to our shores.  
<br/>We, the Group of 9, would like to see more of this clean energy project and it appears from what has 
<br/>been  said  by  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  that  the  partnership  appears  to  be  the  way 
<br/>forward for Fiji.  So, once again, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for his Ministerial 
<br/>Statement on this subject. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Research on the Utilisation of Senile Coconut Stems 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, honourable Assistant Ministers, honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and all those tuning in live on Parliament’s </span><span>Facebook</span><span>
<br/>channel - </span><span>ni sa yadra vinaka</span><span>. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  firstly  my  warmest  congratulations  on  your  appointment  as  Speaker  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I rise to deliver a statement on the progress of the Ministry of Forestry’s research 
<br/>work  on  the  utilisation  of  senile  coconut  stems  under  the  project  Coconut  and  Other  Traditional 
<br/>Forest Resources for the manufacturer of engineered wood products.  At the outset, I would like to 
<br/>acknowledge  the  support  and  assistance  of  the  Australian  Centre  for  International  Agriculture 
<br/>Research (ACIAR), Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (QDAF) and the Pacific 
<br/>Community (SPC) for the opportunity provided to the Ministry of Forestry, to participate in the five-
<br/>year  project  on  the  coconut  and  other  non-traditional  forest  resources  for  the  manufacturer  of 
<br/>engineered wood products which began in February 2021. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to acknowledge the support and assistance of the 
<br/>Ministry of iTaukei Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Rural Development.  The 
<br/>current project on coconut and other non-traditional wood and forest products follow the previous 
<br/>ACIAR funded research project in 2009, which installed new research equipment in the Ministry of 
<br/>Forestry facility in Nasinu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  this  resulted  in  the  successful  demonstration  of  the  technical  feasibility  of 
<br/></span><span>peeling  logs  from  senile  coconut  stems  using  spindle-less  lathe  technology  to  produce  suitable 
<br/></span><span>veneers  for  the  manufacturer  of  coconut-based  engineered  wood  products.    Mr.    Speaker,  the 
<br/>Coalition Government endorsed the project to the agreement in early 2023 and is providing the much-
<br/>needed  assistance  through  the  provision  of  a  very  experienced  team  with  skills  and  a  range  of 
<br/>disciplines to support the adoption of a coconut wood product value chain, here in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  the  project  is  working  on  delivering  and  validating  wood  processing 
<br/>technologies  to  transform  coconut  and  other  currently  low-value  forest  resources  into  high-value 
<br/>engineered wood products suitable for the local and international markets.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by enabling new resources, such as senile coconut palms to be used in high-
<br/>value  wood  products,  there  are  many  benefits  that  can  be  expected.  Importantly,  our  farming 
<br/>communities are able to clear this significant  number of unproductive  coconut  palms and use the 
<br/>payments received from selling the logs to clear their land.  This, in turn, enables them to replant 
<br/>their land with new palms or other valuable crops in mixing cropping systems which may be  
<br/> profitable and more resilient to the impacts of climate change. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2225 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our timber industry can produce new innovative products which can be used 
<br/>locally  in  speciality  joinery  and  furniture  manufacture,  along  with  pursuing  high  value  export 
<br/>opportunities. Employment opportunities are expected along the new value chain.  All projects have 
<br/>their own share of challenges, and this project is no exception.  The real challenge lies in our forest 
<br/>industry that can quickly take up this opportunity and make the necessary investments and adopt the 
<br/>technology. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are talking about an industry that is so used to processing conventional 
<br/>timber species and will, therefore, need a lot of convincing to adopt the new technology and process 
<br/>senile coconut logs.  But this is not insurmountable, as the project is vigorously pursuing a number 
<br/>of strategies which will be able to yield the necessary outcomes in this respect.  This include the 
<br/>direct participation of the private sector in Vanua Levu through the Hyoulin Sawmill (Fiji) Limited, 
<br/>a  subsidiary  of  Long  Investments  Limited.    This  company  is  willing  to  work  with  the  project  to 
<br/>achieve its goals. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, the Ministry of Forestry, through the project, has supported 
<br/>the sawmill with the construction of a steam box which was commissioned last month.  This will 
<br/>enable the heat conditioning of coconut and other non-traditional forest resources in preparation for 
<br/>veneer processing before they are manufactured into engineered wood products.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Preliminary testing was successfully completed, paving the way for the project team to further 
<br/>investigate the integration of senile coconut stem processing into commercial production. This also 
<br/>offers opportunities to enhance yields and to improve veneer grade of other log types through more 
<br/>optimised processing pathways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  addition,  the  project  is  also  undertaking  research  on  utilising  the 
<br/>mahogany Grades 4 and 5 from Fiji Hardwood Corporation Limited (FHCL) as a core species.  The 
<br/>FHCL is having issues in selling Grades 4 and 5 logs due to their poor quality, and the project has 
<br/>provided an opportunity for utilising these low-quality mahogany logs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Further, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project team has also completed the development of a financial 
<br/>modelling tool that will provide valuable guidance to those who are interested in participating in the 
<br/>value  chain,  and  will  have  immediate  benefits  to  the  plywood  producers,  especially  in  defining 
<br/>profitability pathways. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, most segments of the model have been tested and proven valuable for FHCL 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>in assessing their mill-delivered log costs and costing structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Valebasoga Tropik Boards Limited, another plywood processor in Vanua 
<br/>Levu  and  a  collaborator  in  the  previous  project  recently  expressed  its  interest  with  a  strong 
<br/>willingness to participate and to  ensure the success of the project. This  project will have positive 
<br/>socio-economic and environmental impacts, including the source of income for farmers, as well as 
<br/>ticking the boxes for suitable forestry by using senile coconut trees. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reply to the Statement. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.T.  KOROILAVESAU.-  May  I  join  other  honourable  Members  who  have 
<br/>congratulated two sons  of Kabara  - you, Sir,  as  Speaker,  and Kolinisau  as coach for the national 
<br/>sevens team.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the honourable Minister for bringing up the subject on the utilisation of aged coconuts 
<br/>and other non-traditional forestry.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the subject  is current, and I have found that 
<br/>during  our  cyclone  seasons,  most  of  these  trees  come  across  with  a  lot  of  damage.    During  </span><span>TC 
<br/>Winston, </span><span>I had visited around the islands in Lau, Lomaiviti including Taveuni where there were a lot 
<br/>of  coconut  trees  that  had  been  damaged  by  the  cyclone  and  basically  were  lying  there,  ripe  and 
<br/>matured coconut trees.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Vanuabalavu, I remember that I organised the coconut trees to be cut and the logs to be put 
<br/>together. Unfortunately, the transportation for the trees to be transported to Viti Levu was a barrier 
<br/>due to cost. Although the furniture company, Pacific Green in Sigatoka had agreed to purchase these 
<br/>for the benefit of the landowners and the coconut trees on the islands both in Lomaiviti and Lau, 
<br/>transportation could not be met.  I had asked the New Zealand Navy, but unfortunately, they were 
<br/>not in a position to transport because they participated in the rehabilitation in these islands, but they 
<br/>did not have the facility to transport it on their ships to be brought back to Viti Levu. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember very well during the cyclones also, the huge number of pine plantations that were 
<br/>damaged and standing that could not be harvested.  These includes Tailevu North and also the coast 
<br/>of  Ra  including  Kadavu  and  Lomaiviti  where  pine  trees  were  damaged  but  remained  standing.  I 
<br/>would urge the honourable Minister as we are now into cyclone season (October to March) if she 
<br/>could look at that situation. If the cyclones come and simply make these valuable resources available, 
<br/>if transport could be arranged for these to be transported to the mainland and be utilised for the benefit 
<br/>of the landowners.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Leader of the Group of Nine or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NAUPOTO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  join  my  colleagues  in  expressing  our 
<br/>congratulations to your appointment to the position of Speaker and also congratulations to the sevens 
<br/>team; a long time coming win this morning.  I thank the honourable Minister for her statement. Palm 
<br/>wood or coconut wood, I think part of the furniture in this Parliament is made out of coconut and 
<br/>they turn out to be beautiful, very tough furniture, for those that buy furniture also from Pacific Green. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I certainly agree with honourable Koroilavesau.  I am sure you know in Kabara and Vatoa, 
<br/>there are a lot of coconut trees on the outer islands.  It used to be used for the framing for the Fijian 
<br/></span><span>vale</span><span> </span><span>vaka Viti</span><span> in the Lau Group because they curve well because of the round structures of the houses 
<br/>in Lau.  Now, all the houses are concrete block and wooden frames.  And those coconut trees are also 
<br/>available and as mentioned by honourable Koroilavesau, yes, it is the cost of transporting them to the 
<br/></span><span>mainland to where the sawmills are, is the main issue.  I hope that we can keep looking for solutions 
<br/></span><span>to  get  those  coconut  trees  over.    And  as  she  mentioned,  it  will  also  encourage  the  re-planting  of 
<br/>coconut trees that will be more fruitful in a sense. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Minister talked about non-traditional forest products.  I mention the African 
<br/>tulip  for  one,  it  is  all  over  the  place  and  everyone  wants  to  cut  it  down.  They  are  huge  and  big. 
<br/>Perhaps, a bit of research into the African tulip and see what can be done to those trees. I know a few 
<br/>years back, there were some research done into it; is to pulp African tulip because it is very wet, there 
<br/>is a lot of fluid in it. Dry it out, turn into pallets and then use it to fire up the boilers that boil the water 
<br/></span><span>for the generators that generate the electricity like the bio-electrical factory that is sitting in Nabou.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  encourage  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  to  continue  their  research  into  the  non-traditional 
<br/>products in our forestry especially because of the fact that we cannot keep cutting out the traditional 
<br/>woods that we have. We need them to protect our water sources so that we continue to have our clean 
<br/>drinking water that we so very much enjoy here in Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fact that Fiji is a small island and the connectivity from the ridge to the reef is there, and 
<br/>if you mess up with the biodiversity up the hill, it goes right down and even goes right down to our 
<br/>reefs. It is a worthwhile project to look at the non-traditional forest products and see how best we can 
<br/>turn  them  into  products  that  can  be  economical,  with  high  value  and  helps  improve  the  living

<div><span>Fiji Year 8 Examination Provisional Results for 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.M.  RADRODRO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen; I would like to take this time to congratulate you on 
<br/>your appointment as Speaker of this Parliament. I wish to convey my best wishes to you, Sir, during 
<br/>your  tenure  in  Parliament.  Also,  I  would  like  to  join  the  other  Members  of  this  Parliament  in 
<br/>congratulating the Fiji Team for winning the Dubai Sevens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise today to brief this august House on the recently announced Fiji Year 
<br/>8 Examination provisional results for 2024.  All Year 8 students are given 30 days to apply for recount 
<br/>and remarking of scripts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a nation committed to the advancement of our education, the overall pass rate of 69 percent 
<br/>is a significant indicator of the progress we are making, as well as the challenges that lie ahead of us.  
<br/>First and foremost, I would like to take this time to extend my congratulations to the students who 
<br/>worked diligently throughout the year to achieve these results.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recently, there has been a lot of criticisms, exaggeration and blame game 
<br/>with  reference  to  the  2024  Fiji  Year  8  Examination  provisional  results  pass  rate  and  the  failing 
<br/>numbers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, at this point I wish to emphasise on a quote by Carl Sagan, an American astronomer, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“One  of  the  criteria  for  national  leadership  should  therefore  be  a  talent  for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>understanding, encouraging, and making constructive use of vigorous criticism.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministerial  Statement  will  provide  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the 
<br/>provisional results for 2024, and it will also highlight a few trends and insights as this information 
<br/>will  be  useful  to  students,  parents,  stakeholders,  teachers  and  policymakers,  in  making  informed 
<br/></span><span>decisions and planning for the future. But before I move on, Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight 
<br/></span><span>in this Parliament some of the initiatives that the Coalition Government undertook when it came into 
<br/>office.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We started off with the re-engagement of retirees. We reviewed the Retirement Age Policy 
<br/>from 55 to 60, to allow teachers to continue their teaching programmes. We removed the ‘No Jab No 
<br/>Job’  Policy.  We  conducted  the  Fiji  National  Education  Summit.  We  also  established  the  new 
<br/>Education Commission. We also undertook visitations to schools in the rural and maritime areas and 
<br/>took  the  opportunity  to  listen  to  their  queries  and  concerns  that  had  been  raised  by  teachers  and 
<br/></span><span>stakeholders and try, to the best of our ability, to accommodate the concerns that they raised.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also restructured the Curriculum Department within the Ministry of Education by putting 
<br/>in the right resources and the exact number of personnel to ensure that the heartbeat of the Ministry 
<br/>of Education, which is the Curriculum Development Unit plays a very important role and they be 
<br/>resourced accordingly.  Also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we introduced the school chaplaincy and the school 
<br/>Board of Governors.  All of these were undertaken to try and improve the education system.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2229 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to take this time to reiterate that the national pass rate for the 
<br/>last eight years from 2015 to 2024, has shown fluctuation over the years, with a notable decline in 
<br/>2022  and  a  significant  increase  in  2024.    The  highest  national  pass  rate  for  Fiji  Eighth  Year 
<br/>Examination was achieved in 2024, which is 69 percent.  The lowest point was observed in 2022 
<br/>with the national pass rate of 62 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  with  the  limited  information  that  is  within  the  Ministry,  we  could  only 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>gather information from 2018 in the number of enrolled students in Year 8 and are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>2018 – 16,954 students enrolled, and the pass rate was around 59 percent; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>2019 – 17,396 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 69 percent; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>2022 – 17,924 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 62 percent; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>2023 – 19,554 students enrolled, and the pass rate was 67 percent; and  
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>2024 – 19,396 students enrolled, with the pass rate of 69 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you compare the rural and urban, the number who sat in the rural areas 
<br/>was 7,914 and the pass rate was around 66 percent.  In the urban areas, 11,054 sat, with the pass rate 
<br/>of  71  percent.    The  trend  for  results  in  rural  areas  compared  to  urban  centres  depicts  that  more 
<br/>students are not performing well at schools located in rural areas. For instance, in 2017, the pass rate 
<br/>in rural areas was 61 percent and in urban areas was 73 percent.  In 2018, 51 percent in rural areas 
<br/>and 65 percent in urban areas.  In 2019, 64 percent in rural areas and 73 percent in urban areas.  In 
<br/>2022, 57 percent in rural areas and 66 percent in urban areas.  In 2023, 63 percent in rural areas and 
<br/>70 percent in urban areas.  In 2024, 66 percent (increased from 2023) in rural areas and 71 percent in 
<br/>urban areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to also share the ethnicity breakdown of students enrolled and sat in the Year 8 
<br/>Exam.  For </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, the number of students who sat was 13,714 with the pass rate of 67 percent.  For 
<br/>Indian students, 4,449 sat and number of pass is 73 percent.  For Rotumans, 648 sat and the pass rate 
<br/>is 76 percent.  Other students, 157 sat and pass rate is 78 percent.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  reason  for  the  fluctuation  of  results  in  the  2024  provisional  Year  8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>examinations for the last eight years includes but not limited to the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Curriculum  Changes  -  the  curriculum  was  not  aligned  well  with  the  student  needs  and 
<br/>interest and local context.  We take heed of the call by the honourable Prime Minister that 
<br/>there is a need to review the curriculum of the Ministry of Education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  high  student  to  teacher  ratio,  the  overcrowded  classrooms  and  reduced  individual 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>attention and support for students.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Poor school management, weak leadership, lack of planning and inadequate monitoring of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>academic performance.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Student-related factors include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Low academic preparedness.  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Students  attending  Year  8  classes  with  weak  foundation  skills  in  key  subjects  such  as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mathematics and literacy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of motivation and disinterest in learning or lack of understanding about the importance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Behavioural  issues,  disruptions  in  class  or  lack  of  discipline  among  students  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stakeholders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Attendance problems, irregular school attendance due to illness, family responsibilities, or 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lack of interest.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(6)</span><span> </span><span>Parental and family factors, limited engagements of parents in their children’s education 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>such as not monitoring homework or attending school meetings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Parents are also noted to not be supervising and monitoring their students’ schoolwork at 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>home or homework. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>There seems to be a need to improve on educational issues regarding curriculum reviews, 
<br/>curriculum  changes  to  accommodate  the  changing  needs  or  the  inadequate  teacher 
<br/>recruitment  and  retention  strategies.    Over-emphasis  on  rote  learning  and  exam  results 
<br/>rather than conceptual understanding. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community factors include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issues on violence, substance abuse, lack of access to support services, lack of access to 
<br/>digital learning, as evidenced in school visits to the rural and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Lack of accessibility, particularly during periods of remote learning.  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Unclear or overly difficult exam questions that do not reflect the curriculum that has been 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>taught.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Weak systems of monitoring in addressing individuals or group learning deficits.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, this is not only limited to this list, but there are 
<br/>other  contributing  factors  as  well  and  addressing  these  factors  require  a  collaborative  approach 
<br/>among schools, among families, among policymakers and among communities, to create a supportive 
<br/>learning environment and an effective education system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is always a general question that has been raised on catering for students who have 
<br/>failed.  Sir, as a way forward, the Ministry of Education is looking at introducing technical vocational 
<br/>education training at a lower level from Year 8 or Year 9. And we also have to review the so-called 
<br/>no repeat policy, to allow students to go through this process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The automatic progression is something that we have not explored to see how many of those 
<br/>students, over the past years that I have mentioned, have automatically progressed into Year 9.  Sir, 
<br/>we found that there is lack of monitoring tools, but we have noted that in 2023-2024, there has been 
<br/>a steady increase in those that enrol in Year 9 and, perhaps, we can contribute that to the $200 Back 
<br/>to School assistance that was issued for those students who are enrolled in the education system. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  current  practice  is  that  all  students  who  have  completed  Year  8  or 
<br/>primary school level, are supposed to be enrolled in Year 9 at secondary school. This is something 
<br/></span><span>that we are trying to review and monitor.  And I also wish to inform this august House that all students 
<br/></span><span>completing Year 8 Examination and for Year 9 in 2025, we will have to review the recruitment policy 
<br/>accordingly.  On the same note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, any parent or guardian who still faces difficulty in 
<br/>enrolling their children into Year 9 will have to contact our District Offices so they can be assisted 
<br/>accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, English has an average national percentage pass rate of 57 percent in the 
<br/>last three years.  Mathematics, however, has been low for the last three years, achieving 41 percent 
<br/>national pass rate, and we are working on reviewing the teaching contents and also the mathematics 
<br/></span><span>paper accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  I  wish  to  assure  this  august  House  that  the  teams  from  the  Ministry of  Education  are 
<br/>collaboratively working to improve the Year 8 results.  An ongoing review of the curriculum will be 
<br/>conducted to ensure it is relevant, aligned with the needs of the 21</span><span>st</span><span> century, fostering critical thinking 
<br/>and problem-solving skills among our students.  We have also set ourselves to have strict monitoring

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of head of schools, whose schools fall under the Hope school category for the last three consecutive 
<br/>years and a circular to this has been sent targeting such schools. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  also  reviewing  the  automatic  progression  of  students  and  school  visits  will  be 
<br/>undertaken targeting individual Hope schools and Follow-Up schools. We are also working on trying 
<br/>to increase the outreach to maritime and remote rural schools.  I have a list of strategies that is here, 
<br/>but I think I am compressed for time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This year’s results serve as a reminder, Sir, that education is a shared responsibility, and it 
<br/>takes the collective effort of the student, teachers, parents, </span><span>vanua, lotu </span><span>and the Government to ensure 
<br/>that our children receive quality education.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I encourage all stakeholders to take inspiration from the 
<br/>achievements of our students and to work collaboratively towards enhancing our education system, 
<br/>because together, we can ensure that Fiji remains a place where every child has the opportunity to 
<br/>not only learn, but also to grow and succeed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call upon the honourable Leader of the Opposition or his designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I would like to congratulate you, 
<br/>Sir, on your appointment as the Speaker of the House. Secondly, I would like to congratulate the Fiji 
<br/>Sevens Team for winning the Dubai Sevens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to congratulate all Year 8 students for completing eight years 
<br/>of primary education and wish them well for their secondary education.  I would like to also thank 
<br/>the teachers for their hard work and effort.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji Year 8 Examination is very important for Year 8 students. Examination plays a crucial 
<br/>role  in  a  student’s  career.    The  purpose  of  examinations  is  to  measure  the  knowledge  and 
<br/>understanding, promote discipline and time management, prepares one for real world challenges and 
<br/>provides fair and objective assessment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was listening very carefully to the honourable Minister for Education and 
<br/>if I heard it right, he mentioned that 41 percent of students passed Year 8 Mathematics.  That is quite 
<br/>alarming.  The other thing that he has mentioned is 56 percent of students who are studying in remote 
<br/>rural areas have successfully completed Year 8, compared to 71 percent who are schooling in urban 
<br/></span><span>areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Analysing examination results is important because it can help improve teaching and learning.  
<br/>Using exam results data effectively is key to improving both, school and student performance.  While 
<br/>basic scores  are useful, the real  value comes from  deeper analysis of examination data. By using 
<br/>advance and thorough analysis methods, the Ministry of Education can find important trends and 
<br/>patterns to guide their decisions and help students and teachers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that the analysis of the Fiji Eighth Year Examination includes the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>How did the students in rural remote areas do in their examination, compared to urban 
<br/>area students?  If this can be done thoroughly subject by subject and school by school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Why did students not do well in second subjects in certain schools? 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is it because of lack of resources or  
<br/></span><span>is it facilities or is it because of

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>not meeting teaching learning hours?  In here, monitoring comes in. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the results in remote maritime schools, it is only 56 percent compared to urban 
<br/>which is 71 percent.  So, my question is – was proper monitoring done by the Education Officers in 
<br/>respective Districts?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- After the analysis of the examination results, the Ministry should come 
<br/>up with plans so that students can be assisted in areas where they are weak.  The Ministry should also 
<br/>plan and provide support, guidance and training to teachers in areas where they need training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>About 14,000 students have met the benchmark and 31 percent, that is around 6,000 students 
<br/>did not do very well in Year 8 examination.  So, what are the plans?  What will the Ministry do? How 
<br/>will the Ministry assist these 6,000 students who did not do very well in the Year 8 Examination?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call upon the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A. BIA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to reply to the Statement by the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Education in regards to the Analysis of the Fiji Eighth Year Examination.  At the outset, Sir, I 
<br/>would  also  like  to  join  my  fellow  colleagues  who  have  already  congratulated  you  on  your 
<br/>appointment as the Speaker of this august House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is one of the much-talked-about issue recently around the country, as 
<br/>well as on social media.  I thank the honourable Minister for the thorough statement and the analysis 
<br/>that he has given, highlighting some of the initiatives and also the work he is currently doing in terms 
<br/>of the review of the Education system. He also mentioned about the pass rate that has improved, but 
<br/>I believe that a major concern at the moment is also what the honourable Member has just alluded 
<br/>to, that over 6,000 students could not make it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, still on the Fiji Eighth Year Examination, I would also like to question the 
<br/>validity or the significant of sitting the Year 8 Examination.  In speaking of this, if you look at all the 
<br/>secondary schools in Fiji, at the moment, in terms of their intake to Year 10, majority of the schools 
<br/>are selecting students after getting the marks from their annual exam or third term examination.  Not 
<br/>all  the  schools  are  using  the  Year  8  exam  to  intake  students  into  schools.  So,  I  agree  with  the 
<br/>honourable Minister in terms of the review and how significant the Year 8 Examination is, because 
<br/>a lot of schools are selecting students to secondary schools from the 3</span><span>rd</span><span> Term Exams. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly,  this  is  an  issue  which  we  should  not  play  a  blame  game  to.  As  shared  by  the 
<br/>honourable Minister, it is a shared responsibility. What has happened, has happened, and the onus is 
<br/>on Government  and all  of us sitting in  this august  Parliament to  work together  with  the Minister 
<br/>responsible as to how we can improve from here. There is a lot of doubts and areas that we need to 
<br/>connect to try and improve, despite the improvement of the passing rate. We need to focus on those 
<br/></span><span>that could not make it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now,  some  of  the  very  foundations  of  the  areas  that  we  need  to  look  into  is  the  family. 
<br/>Speaking of families, parents are most important in terms of the upbringing of every child that goes 
<br/>to school and speaking of parents, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you look around the country at the moment, 
<br/>there are a lot of young parents. My questions, and I raised these issues a lot:

<div><span>(1) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Is  enough  awareness  or  counselling  created  to  these  young  parents  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>upbringing of a small child into the education system? 
<br/>Is  the  curriculum  still  relevant  to  the  current  situation  we  are  in,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>evolving world? Things do evolve and change?  
<br/>Is our curriculum still relevant to the changes that we are currently undertaking?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, just focussing on the different levels of our education system, first 
<br/>is the Early Childhood Education (ECE).  I believe that there needs to be more focus on ECE, which 
<br/>is the very foundation of the upbringing of any school kid around Fiji.  It has also been raised last 
<br/>year about the level of the education system that is there to cater for the ECE because of the number 
<br/>of students, non-readers that are there in our school systems.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know time has caught up on me, so I thank the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for the thorough analysis on the Year 8 Examination Results. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beijing Platform for Action +30 Regional Review 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Good  morning,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir  and  honourable  Members  of 
<br/>Parliament. I wish to join my colleagues to congratulate you in your election as Speaker of Parliament 
<br/>and wish you the very best as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on the recent Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference 
<br/>on the Beijing Platform for Action +30 Regional Review which is held in Thailand earlier last month. 
<br/>The  significant  event  brought  together  over  1,200  delegates  including  Ministers,  senior  officials, 
<br/>women  rights  organisations,  civil  society  and  development  partners  from  across  the  Asia  Pacific 
<br/>Region to assess our progress and challenges in implementing the Beijing Declaration and Platform 
<br/>for Action over the past 30 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Every five years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this review is conducted, and it will remain as one of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>most comprehensive frameworks for advancing gender equality across the globe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Next year, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will celebrate the 30</span><span>th</span><span> year of the Beijing Platform for Action, 
<br/>so as part of the build up to this celebration next year, each country is to present its Review Report 
<br/>on the Status of Gender Equality. For Fiji, we had successfully compiled our report and earlier this 
<br/>year, Cabinet endorsed our Review Report.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the Conference, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji reaffirmed its dedication to the 12 critical areas of 
<br/></span><span>concern outlined in the platform. Notably, Sir, this Beijing Platform for Action is adopted under the 
<br/>leadership of our current Prime Minister and the areas of concern include, to name a few: women’s 
<br/>health, women’s education, women’s economic participation, women’s political empowerment and, 
<br/>of course, the elimination of violence against women and children.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As such, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with alignments to the critical areas of concern, Fiji was able to 
<br/>participate in emerging issues which were not there 30 years ago but is certainly a rising trend and 
<br/>an area of concern in the review of the Beijing Platform for Action and that is the issue of technology 
<br/></span><span>facilitated gender-based violence or online violence.  For Fiji, we shared the data, which was given 
<br/></span><span>by Fiji’s Online Safety Commission, where it indicated that 62 percent of women are experiencing 
<br/>online violence compared to 38 percent of men.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  context,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  shared  how  Fiji  is  making  progress  as  well  in 
<br/>implementing our National Action to Prevent Violence Against All Women and Girls or Fiji NAP, 
<br/>as well as the forthcoming Women's Economic Empowerment National Action Plan and the work

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are currently doing to gender mainstream across Government Ministries and agencies in terms of 
<br/>institutional  capacity  development,  as  we  may  commonly  refer  to,  specifically  gender  responsive 
<br/>budgeting across the Ministries and agencies.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to just briefly share some of the key activities and milestones 
<br/>shared at the Conference that Fiji has been able to achieve, especially as we are currently in the 16 
<br/>Days of Activism period to end violence against women and girls. The first, Sir, is the engagement 
<br/>with the Great Council of Chiefs (GCC).   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  wish  to  acknowledge  and  commend  the  GCC,  especially  the  Chairman,  Ratu  Viliame 
<br/>Seruvakula for prioritising violence against women and children.  It is truly significant that they have 
<br/>prioritised this and put this on their agenda because the traditional setting, is a key setting to look at 
<br/>the  root  causes  of  violence  against  women  and  children,  especially  emphasising  on  building 
<br/>respectful relationships between girls and boys. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  appreciate  the  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  and  the  iTaukei 
<br/>Affairs Board in reinforcing the efforts to create safe spaces across our villages and our settlements.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am even more grateful for the commitment of Government with the very recent 
<br/>amendment to the iTaukei Affairs (Great Council of Chiefs) Regulations, which spells out the Great 
<br/>Council  of  Chiefs  mandate.  Just  this  week,  the  amendment  has  been  made  to  Regulation  14(e) 
<br/>specifically, which states that the Great Council of Chiefs is to advocate and set strategic directions 
<br/>to address violence against women and girls.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the faith-based setting. We have already started working with 
<br/>faith leaders and faith-based organisations on a communication campaign which they have launched 
<br/>during  the  16  Days  of  Activism.    This  campaign  aims  to  foster  awareness  and  drive  behavioural 
<br/>change within our faith settings.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I wish to commend the House of Sarah Coordinator, Reverend Sereima Lomaloma, and her 
<br/>team for their impactful video titled, </span><span>My Faith Says No to Rape.</span><span> This collaboration with faith leaders 
<br/>and the Ministry, as well as SPC, Pacific Women Lead and Australian Aid, highlights the power of 
<br/>collective advocacy to end violence against women and girls in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have conducted a gender analysis of the Fiji Online Safety Act. 
<br/>The Ministry, together with the United Nations Populations Fund (UNFPA), undertook this gender 
<br/>analysis to address technology facilitated gender-based violence, which is a growing concern in Fiji. 
<br/></span><span>This analysis has identified gaps in prevention, protection and reporting mechanisms for women and 
<br/></span><span>children,  and  provides  actionable  recommendations.    The  findings  will  be  presented  during  our 
<br/>Members of Parliament retreat and will form future legislative review and actions. Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>I am very grateful to UNFPA for this partnership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be convening a forum for young women aged 18 years to 
<br/>25 years old to coincide with the 16 Days of Activism, which is on 5th December. This is to gather 
<br/>insights from our young women on how gender-based violence or how violence online affects their 
<br/>lives. This forum will provide a platform where they can share their experiences, in particular, on 
<br/></span><span>their  online  challenges,  seeking  their  perspectives  on  necessary  protections  and  responses.  The 
<br/></span><span>outcomes of these discussions will be documented as well and will be presented at our Members of 
<br/>Parliament  retreat  this  month,  and  it  will  be  presented  by  one  of  their  own  peers.  This  direct 
<br/>engagement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensures that we are capturing the voices of our young people,  
<br/>especially our young women who are suffering greatly from online violence.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The fifth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is what is called a National Community Attitude Survey. Starting 
<br/>in January, with the technical support from UNICEF, we will roll out a national survey to examine 
<br/>society’s attitude towards women and children, and the need to be able to create key messages for an 
<br/>aggressive communications campaign to target those attitudes that are causing violence and to be 
<br/>able to help in change of behaviour of these attitudes. This survey will not just be talking to women 
<br/>and girls, as is being done conventionally to date, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but will also include talking to 
<br/>our men and boys.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sixth, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is enhancing responses to victims of and survivors of violence when 
<br/>they present themselves to our Fiji Police Force (FPF). As we know, Sir, through the Fiji NAP, we 
<br/>are trying to look at the prevention of violence before it starts and not just response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we have done as part of the 16 Days of Activism is that the Ministry has partnered with 
<br/>the  Fiji  Women’s  Crisis  Centre  (FWCC)  where  we  have  been  conducting  awareness  sessions  or 
<br/>refresher courses with the FPF in terms of strengthening the implementation of services they provide 
<br/>to victims who present, as well as survivors of violence. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is what the Fiji NAP represents, collective effort by all players and I 
<br/>wish to acknowledge the continued support and technical expertise by the Fiji NAP Secretariat, as 
<br/>well as the FPF and the criminal justice system. I also wish to thank the Government of Australia for 
<br/>their generous financial support and technical support of the NAP Gender-Based Violence (GBV).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am excited and committed to forging this partnership in 
<br/>making  2025,  hopefully,  a  transformative  year,  particularly,  in  violence  prevention  and  response. 
<br/>This  will  mean,  of  course,  continuing  to  collaborate  with  our  partners  and  stakeholders  and  will 
<br/>involve strengthening partnerships with other organisations such as UNFPA, UNICEF, UNSCAF, 
<br/>UN Women at Women Deliver.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  at  the  Conference  in  Bangkok,  Fiji  had  the  opportunity  to  chair  the 
<br/>Conference on the final day, culminating the adoption of the report on the Asia Pacific Ministerial 
<br/>Conference on the Beijing +30 review, as well as the closing ceremony.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, five years ago, my predecessor, Ms. Mere Rakuita, chaired the very same 
<br/>Conference.  The selection of Fiji to chair these regional conferences shows Fiji’s leadership in the 
<br/>Pacific,  in  Asia  and  to  the  world,  and  underscores  our  commitment  in  empowering  women 
<br/>throughout our region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Asia  Pacific  Ministerial  Conference  on  the  review  of 
<br/>Beijing  Platform  for  Action  has  provided  a  renewed  momentum  and  a  renewed  commitment  in 
<br/>reinforcing our commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment. Our active participation 
<br/>in the Conference and discussions have been significant and beneficial. I would like to extend my 
<br/>gratitude to the honourable Prime Minister for his leadership and also to Cabinet and to Government 
<br/>and, of course, Parliament for your continued support, as well as encouraging the implementation of 
<br/>the NAP GBV since it certainly is a bipartisan effort as it had begun from the previous Government 
<br/>in developing the NAP GBV, as well as now our turn to implement it effectively.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is only together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we can protect, advance the rights and well-being of 
<br/>all  members  of  society,  not  just  women  and  girls,  our  boys  as  well,  our  men,  our  persons  with 
<br/>disabilities and other vulnerable groups that we are charged with. Hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we 
<br/>continue to carry on striving for a more just and equitable Fiji.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.  –  I  will  now  call  on  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  or  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>designate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  LAL.  –Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  go  on  to  my  reply,  I  would  like  to  take  this 
<br/>opportunity  to,  once again,  congratulate you, Sir.  I wish you all the best and looking forward to 
<br/>working with you.  Similar to my other colleagues, I also would like to congratulate the Fiji Sevens 
<br/>Team and Coach for the win.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the Ministerial Statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for Women, 
<br/>Children and Social Protection for her Statement on Fiji’s participation in the Beijing Platform for 
<br/>Action, +30 regional review. While I acknowledge the efforts made by the honourable  Minister and 
<br/>her team, it is imperative to critically examine the outcomes and the actual progress on the ground.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Beijing  Platform  for  Action  +30  regional  review  was,  indeed,  a 
<br/>significant event, providing a platform for assessing our progress in gender equality and women’s 
<br/>empowerment.  However, the Minister’s Statement, while highlighting some advancement, fails to 
<br/>address several critical areas where our efforts have fallen short.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly,  the  honourable  Minister  spoke  about  the  implementation  of  gender  responsive 
<br/>policies and programmes.  While these initiatives are commendable in Chile, the reality is that many 
<br/>of these programmes  lack adequate funding and effective implementation. Women entrepreneurs, 
<br/>particularly in rural areas, continue to face significant barriers in accessing financial resources and 
<br/>support.  The Government’s effort must go beyond mere policy announcements, and ensure tangible 
<br/>support reaches those who need it most.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the promotion of Science Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education 
<br/>for girls, the data shows that gender disparities in education persists, particularly in higher education 
<br/>and vocational training. The Government must take more robust measures to ensure that girls not 
<br/>only  have access  to  education but  are also  encouraged  and supported to  pursue  careers in  STEM 
<br/>fields. This requires a comprehensive approach, including mentorship programmes, scholarships and 
<br/>addressing societal attitudes that discourage girls from these fields.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  honourable  Minister  also  mentioned  our  commitment  to  addressing  gender-based 
<br/>violence. While awareness campaigns and legal frameworks are essential, the reality on the ground 
<br/>tells a different story.  Reports of gender-based violence remains alarmingly high and many survivors 
<br/>still lack access to adequate support services. The Government must prioritise that establishment of 
<br/></span><span>more shelters, council services and legal aid for survivors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  there  needs  to  be  a  stronger  focus  on  prevention,  including  education  and 
<br/>community engagement, to change harmful attitudes and behaviours. Furthermore, the honourable 
<br/>Minister’s Statement did not adequately address the issue of intersectionality. Women and girls from 
<br/>marginalised  communities,  including  those  with  disabilities,  businesswomen  and  LGBTQ+ 
<br/>individuals face compounded discrimination and barriers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government’s  policies  must  be  inclusive  and  address  the  unique  challenges  faced  by 
<br/></span><span>these groups to ensure that no one is left behind. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action 
<br/></span><span>and Beijing +30 Regional Review has provided us with valuable insights and best practices from 
<br/>across the region. However, it is clear that our government needs to do more to translate these insights 
<br/>into concrete actions. We must hold ourselves accountable and ensure that our commitments are not 
<br/>just words on paper but are reflected in the experiences of women and girls in Fiji.

<div><span>2237 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, while I appreciate the Minister's efforts and the progress made, it is crucial that 
<br/>we  critically  evaluate  our  shortcomings  and  take  decisive  actions  to  address  them.  Let  us  work 
<br/>together to ensure that the principles of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action are fully 
<br/>realised, and that gender equality becomes a reality for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now invite the honourable Leader of the G9 Bloc or his designate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RATU  J.B.  NIUDAMU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  join  my  colleagues  in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulating you on your appointment as the Speaker of the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, across the Pacific, accelerated action is needed to meet the ambitions of the 
<br/>Beijing  Declaration  and  Platform  for  Action  in  the  2030  Agenda  on  Sustainable  Development, 
<br/>including  SDG5  on  Gender  Equality  and  all  other  SDGs.    Despite  significant  strides  in  women's 
<br/>education and health and some progress made in women's political representation in the past three 
<br/>decades, progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of women appears to be stagnating 
<br/>and even regressing in some areas, such as labour force participation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, women and girls in the region continue to face discriminatory social norms 
<br/>and  gender  stereotypes  -  high  levels  of  gender-based  violence,  disproportionate  unpaid  care  and 
<br/>domestic work burden, among other challenges. The level of political will to address these issues 
<br/>remain inadequate.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, moreover women and girls have been more disproportionately 
<br/>affected by multiple and interrelated crisis that are expected to continue or worsen in the absence of 
<br/>accelerated action.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, women play a very crucial role in Fiji’s economy where their contribution 
<br/>are often unrecognised.  There is far more work to be done in Fiji, but we have made important gains 
<br/>over  the  past  25  years  in  education,  maternal  mortality,  access  to  health  services,  women's 
<br/>representation in leadership positions and participation in Parliament and increased public awareness 
<br/>and recognition of women's rights.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have enacted progressive legislation and regulatory framework. A good 
<br/>example  which  is  stated  by  the  honourable  Minister  for  Social  Protection  in  relation  to  the 
<br/>amendment of the iTaukei Affairs (Great Council of Chiefs) (Amendment) Regulations 2024.  It is a 
<br/>good move, Sir. The Government, in particular, has led a relentless effort to end violence against 
<br/>women by changing the laws governing sexual assault to make it easier and safer for a woman to 
<br/>come  forward  and  feel  secure  under  the  law  and  confident  that  justice  will  be  delivered,  and  by 
<br/></span><span>speaking out at every opportunity to shame the very notion of violence directed against women and 
<br/></span><span>girls. As you are most aware, Mr, Speaker, Sir the removal of the law which is discriminatory to 
<br/>sexual victims and now the law corroboration has come into play where there is no corroboration 
<br/>needed under our Fiji laws. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  Government,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  for  its  policies  and  programmes  that  enables 
<br/>women  to  pursue  enhanced  opportunities  and  excel  in  all  aspects  of  their  development,  be  it  in 
<br/>education, leadership, career development, empowering them to reach their highest potential in life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, all children in Fiji attend primary school with 92 percent of girls completing secondary 
<br/></span><span>school. Female students make up 57 percent of the graduates of tertiary institutions.  Women hold 
<br/>five of 55 seats in our Parliament and half of those female parliamentarians are here today serving as 
<br/>Ministers or Assistant Minister in the current Government. Almost 30 percent of leadership positions 
<br/>in the Civil Service are women.  Sir, under the 2018 Employment Relations (Budget Amendment) 
<br/>Act, it has been amended to increase the level of maternity leave and introduce paternity leave so that 
<br/>women can have assistance with childbearing in the home. The 2018 amendment to the Succession,

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Probate  and  Administration  Act  now  guarantees  inheritance  rights  to  women  living  in  de-facto 
<br/>relationships.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we cannot take pride in certain achievements. We cannot rest. 
<br/>We expect steady transformation as more girls in Fijian classrooms and universities translate into 
<br/>more women participation in the formal economy having greater access to financial resources and 
<br/>serving  as  government  and  business  leaders,  engineers,  entrepreneurs,  scientists,  doctors  and 
<br/>financiers.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  determined  to  have  an  inclusive  and  equal  Fiji,  and  I  ask  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government that we must not stop until we get there.
