<div><span>QUESTIONS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, we are at the tail end of the Oral Questions for today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my other colleagues in welcoming 
<br/>you to Parliament and congratulating you on your appointment and also congratulate our Fiji Sevens 
<br/>Team for their achievements after a long droughts time. I hope both will bring us the much relief 
<br/>which we desperately need.

<div><span>Naduruloulou Research Station 
<br/>(Question No. 267/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  progress  in  converting  the  Naduruloulou  Research  Station  to  solely  focus  on 
<br/>research and development of organic agriculture in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, organic farming contributes to the protection 
<br/>of the environment and mitigates the impacts of climate change. It improves the long-term fertility 
<br/>of  the  soil,  increases  levels  of  biodiversity  and  reduces  pollution  on  the  environment  while 
<br/>maintaining high and more welfare standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Nand  for  the  question  as  it  provides  an  opportunity  to  inform  this 
<br/>august Parliament and the nation about the plans behind converting Naduruloulou Research Station 
<br/>for organic research work. This will be the first amongst the Small Island Developing States (SIDS) 
<br/>of the Pacific region.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Naduruloulou Research Station, a pivotal agricultural research facility 
<br/>has been undergoing a transformative process to evolve into an organic station that will be crucial in 
<br/>the research and development of organic products in Fiji and the Pacific. This initiative is in line with 
<br/>national commitments under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) towards 
<br/>achieving sustainable agricultural systems and meeting the increasing demands for safe food.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the transition of the Naduruloulou Research Station to an organic station 
<br/></span><span>began in 2022. Since then, no synthetic fertilisers or chemicals were allowed into the station. The 
<br/>management of the fields has been through mechanical and manual means. The Research Officers at 
<br/>the Naduruloulou and Koronivia Research Stations have been working in partnership with the Pacific 
<br/>Community, Pacific Organic and Ethical Trade Community (POETCom) to facilitate the transition 
<br/>of  the  station  towards  obtaining  organic  certification  under  the  Pacific  Guarantee  System  with 
<br/>aspiration of ultimately achieving the global standard of third party certification.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, upgrading and improving the infrastructure in the station is key to support 
<br/></span><span>this transition. The Ministry is currently engaging in discussions with the neighbouring village  of 
<br/></span><span>Kasavu and nearby settlements regarding the plans for the station and these are primarily to reduce 
<br/>the risk of cross-contamination of synthetic materials and non-organic agricultural activities around 
<br/>the periphery of the station. This transition cannot be achieved in isolation and requires collaboration 
<br/>with local, regional and international organisations.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2259 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the progress achieved at Naduruloulou Research Station in its shift towards 
<br/>becoming an organic facility is  commendable. The ongoing  assistance from  the Government  will 
<br/>facilitate the establishment of a certified organic agriculture station.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of organic agriculture into Fiji’s production system is an 
<br/>option  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  our  natural  resources.  The  Fiji  Organic  Association  was 
<br/>established in 2006 and the Ministry of Agriculture has been collaborating closely with them in the 
<br/>development of the organic farming sector in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in conclusion, the Ministry has developed a bacterium culture to restore soil 
<br/>microbial populations and build soil fertility in cultivating areas. This culture was launched on 10</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>June, 2020 and so far been distributed free of charge Fiji-wide from almost all agriculture stations.  
<br/>It has been developed to target compost which were also launched as organic fertilisers in 2022.  The 
<br/>continued production and supply of organic fertilisers for free to farmers, more than 300 tonnes have 
<br/>been supplied to assist farmers who cannot afford chemical fertilisers and may one day transition to 
<br/>becoming full time organic farmers. The National Organic Policy is in its finalising stage and this 
<br/>will guide the organic sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conversion of Naduruloulou Research Station into a centre of excellence 
<br/>for organic agriculture research is a strategic move that aligns with Government’s broader agriculture 
<br/>and environmental policies.  It demonstrates our commitment to fostering a sustainable agriculture 
<br/>future  for  Fiji,  enhancing  public  health,  support sustainable  tourism  and creating  a  more  resilient 
<br/>agriculture sector. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the honourable Minister update Parliament on what 
<br/>crops or species are being propagated in Naduruloulou Station, and is this knowledge or species being 
<br/>disseminated to the to the farmers, and in particular what crops are these?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, Naduruloulou Research Station  is  mainly  a 
<br/>tree crops station. Most of the tree cops that are grown locally are propagated from Naduruloulou 
<br/>Research Station. We also have cocoa and coffee as part of our tree crops propagated there. Apart 
<br/>from that, we have indigenous fruit trees also, in addition to lime because of the demand from the 
<br/>public. These are being propagated and distributed sometimes according to orders from interested 
<br/>farmers. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Telecom Fiji &amp; Kordia Group - Boosting Fiji’s Digital Connectivity 
<br/></span><span>(Question No. 268/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. K.V. RAVU asked the Government, upon notice. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Cooperatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on how 
<br/>Telecom Fiji, in partnership with New Zealand’s Kordia, is progressing in boosting Fiji’s 
<br/>digital connectivity? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/></span><span>member for the question on the ICT development in Fiji, particularly with regards to the North. But 
<br/>I  guess  before  I  do  that,  in  way  of  context,  perhaps  in  the  last  two  years  of  the  current  People’s 
<br/>Coalition Government under the leadership of the honourable Prime Minister, you would been seeing 
<br/>the transition that is happening in the ICT space that we are trying to rapidly evolve to capture the 
<br/>advancements in digital technology and also as a result, enhance connectivity services to our people, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just this past Saturday, the honourable Prime Minister did the groundbreaking ceremony, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, for one of the biggest ICT developments and in my view, Sir, probably one of the most 
<br/>significant historical events in Fiji in the recent past, when he performed the groundbreaking of the 
<br/>Google Data Centre. Google is in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and with this, it signals a new dawn, in terms 
<br/>of how the ICT industry will be conducted in Fiji. It also signals to the rest of the world that one of 
<br/>the largest tech companies in the world has come to our shores. It will certainly attract with it, some 
<br/>investment as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regards to the developments and certainly now, with regards to the 
<br/>Northern developments as it were, Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) had actually forged a partnership with 
<br/>Kordia, which is a New Zealand state-owned enterprise. It is a major provider of television, radio 
<br/>broadcasting  facilities  and  communication  networks.  The  partnership  is  aimed  at  implementing 
<br/>Telecom Fiji’s Northern fibre connectivity project.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It aims to extend the connectivity between Labasa onward to Seaqaqa, and then onward to 
<br/>Savusavu to the submarine cable landing station. It is scheduled for completion in January 2025 or 
<br/>at least the first quarter of 2025. It is about 75 percent complete according to Telecom, so it is tracking 
<br/>well Mr. Speaker, Sir. Under the partnership, Kordia is supplying transmission equipment, that will 
<br/>be used to deliver high-capacity fibre links between Savusavu and Labasa. These high-capacity fibre 
<br/>links will reduce dependency on microwave links between Savusavu and Labasa which are of course 
<br/>limited in capacity and susceptible to disruptions during adverse weather.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a key feature of this project is its integration with Fiji’s domestic subsea 
<br/>cable which connects Vanua Levu to Viti Levu via the Tui Samoa cable.  This will further strengthen 
<br/>the national digital backbone of our country and create seamless network across the two main islands. 
<br/>And  if  you  have  been  hearing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  explanations  by  the  learned  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Minister for Tourism and Civil  Aviation, Honourable Viliame Gavoka,  about the initiative in  the 
<br/>North, what is being done through Telecom, will set up Vanua Levu well in the years to come.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is, of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a game changer for Vanua Levu and for Telecom and it 
<br/>allows them to leverage  technology  into the North and it will  not be too long  when we will start 
<br/>seeing  business  process  outsourcings  (BPOs)  opens  up  in  the  North,  I  suspect,  and  other  ICT 
<br/>industries  a  lot  closer  to  the  Northern  Division.  In  my  view  Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  that  is  a  welcome 
<br/>development and as most of us believe on this side of the Parliament, Vanua Levu will be the next 
<br/>economic frontier for Fiji.
