<div><span>To Mr. Osea Kolinisau and your team we, the honourable Members of Parliament and its staff 
<br/>congratulate you warmly for a win that has been long time coming.  We, from the small island of 
<br/>Kabara in Southern Lau, are extremely proud of Osea, an outstanding son of Kabara, for his successes 
<br/>both,  as  Sevens  Captain  and  a  player,  and  now  a  winning  Coach.    May  this  be  the  beginning  of 
<br/>another memorable chapter in the nation’s sevens rugby history.
