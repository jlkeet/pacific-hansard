<br/>EDUCATION, HERITAGE AND ARTS 2018-2021ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Education,  Heritage  and  Arts  2018-2019,  2019-2020  and  2020-2021  Annual  Reports, 
<br/>which was tabled on 1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  is  for  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Education is a Government Ministry, responsible for providing the education 
<br/>that is holistic, innovative, responsive, inclusive and empowering.  This education system enables 
<br/>our children to realise and appreciate their inheritance and potential contribution to a peaceful and 
<br/>sustainable Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, in its deliberation, highlighted significant key findings, to name a few: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>The Denarau Declaration 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Denarau Policy Framework contains the strategic way forward for the Education 
<br/>Sector  for  the  next  10  years.  It  is  important  to  acknowledge  the  policy  and  the 
<br/>implementations of the Declaration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Review of the Education Act  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  review  of  the  Education  Act  needs  to  be  expedited  to  align  with  current  best 
<br/>practices, societal changes and educational priorities.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Issue on drugs  
<br/>Currently, drugs have a significant impact on the lives of our children. The Ministry is 
<br/>working with relevant stakeholders to address this very important issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  conclusion,  the  Ministry  of  Education  is  very  critical.    The  Ministry 
<br/>requires urgent action in response to a challenge of the environment that our children are currently 
<br/>encountering. On that note, Sir, I thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  A 
<br/>list has been provided to me for those who would be speaking. There are three from the Opposition 
<br/>and two from Government.  I will first invite honourable Pillay to address Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first,  I join my colleagues in congratulating you on 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>your appointment as Speaker of our Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the Consolidated Review Report of the 
<br/>Ministry of Education, Heritage and Arts for the years 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021.  This 
<br/></span><span>comprehensive review highlights the significant  strides made by the Ministry in various areas, as 
<br/></span><span>well as the challenges that remained.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Strategic Plan by the Ministry for 2018-2021, and the new framework 
<br/>for 2023 to 2033, as stated in the Denarau Declaration, are commendable. But, most importantly, we 
<br/>must say that the establishment of the Education Commission to review the curriculum is a critical 
<br/>move. But we have to ask ourselves, how are these changes going to be implemented, to ensure that 
<br/>the system remains relevant and effective?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The registration of 24 new ECE Centres, eight primary schools and four secondary schools 
<br/>between 2018 and 2021 is a good indication of the Ministry’s efforts towards increasing access.  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, while this is a positive development, we must consider the sustainability of these new 
<br/>institutions.  Are we providing adequate resources and support to ensure their long-term success?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Report highlights the Ministry’s efforts in trying to address drug and 
<br/>substance  abuse  among  students.  Collaboration  with  parents,  police  and  other  stakeholders  is 
<br/>important.  However, we must question the effectiveness of these measures. Are we seeing a tangible 
<br/>reduction in drug related incidents in our schools? But more can be done to support our students and 
<br/>prevent substance abuse.  Hiring full time counsellors in Divisions and Districts will provide much 
<br/></span><span>needed support to our students. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must ensure that these counsellors are well trained and ready to handle 
<br/>various  challenges  our  students  face.  How  will  we  measure  the  impact  on  student  wellbeing  and 
<br/>academic performance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, addressing truancy is another critical issue. Community engagement and 
<br/>support services from part of the Ministry’s policies and strategies in the right direction but we must 
<br/>ask ourselves, are these measures enough to keep our children in school? What more can we do to 
<br/>support families so that education remains a priority?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Digitisation of examination records is a major task that was preserved our education history 
<br/>had  improved  administrative  efficiency.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  to  ensure  that  this  work  is 
<br/>completed without delay and adequate budgetary provisions are made to maintain this digital records.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education,  
<br/>Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  progress  of  the  Ministry  in  the  achievement  of  SDG4  on  ensuring 
<br/>inclusive and equitable, quality education is commendable though there is much to be done in terms 
<br/>of  leadership  changes,  high  staff  turnover  and  budgetary  constraints.  How  can  we  ensure  a  more 
<br/>stable and enabling environment for our educators and students to thrive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Ministry’s  advocacy  for  a  government  mandate  to  build  schools  and hospitals  during 
<br/>each term is a forward-thinking approach. Mr. Speaker, Sir, we must support this initiative to ensure 
<br/>that our infrastructure gives space with our growing population and educational needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while much remains to be done, I am on the view that this Report is a step 
<br/>in  the right direction. It  provides a clear roadmap for the future of  education in  our country with 
<br/>continued  commitment  and  collaboration  we  can  overcome  the  challenges  and  build  a  robust 
<br/>education system that serves all our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, I fully support the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.M. RADRODRO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in  support of the motion before Parliament. 
<br/></span><span>First of all, I would like to thank the Standing Committee Members for compiling this Report. I know 
<br/></span><span>it is a little bit outdated report from 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021. It is very important that 
<br/>the Report needs to be provided on time, as timeliness of this Report will be able to allow the Ministry 
<br/>to provide proper strategic direction, decision- making in terms of the operations of the Ministry. The 
<br/>Ministry of Education is working very hard to provide its Annual Report on time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In commenting on the Standing Committee’s recommendation regarding the Education Act 
<br/>review, we take note of the comments. It has been recommended by the Committee and the Ministry 
<br/>of  Education  has  also  taken  steps  by  obtaining  the  necessary  Cabinet  approval  to  commence  the 
<br/>discussion on the review of the Education Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the 1978 Act and the 1966 Education Act has been shared with the Fiji Law Reform 
<br/>Unit to assist the Ministry of Education in the review process which is anticipated to be finalised by 
<br/>mid of next year, June 2025.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  some  of  the  key  features  that  the  Ministry  would  like  to  ensure  to  be 
<br/>included in the Act. One is to have its own regulation, the areas that need to be scrutinised in terms 
<br/>of the compulsory education in current age on Year 1 to Year 12 to be in line with Section 31 of the 
<br/>2013 Constitution, the right to education.  The second part is the inclusion of ECE as part of the lower 
<br/></span><span>primary education aiming to reduce the entry age from the current year five to year three or below.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  TVET  subjects  to  be  offered  in  the  mainstream  education 
<br/>programme for Year 9. Just on the Denarau Declaration, it is the result of the Education Summit 
<br/>which was done in 2023. We intend to have the 10-year sector plan to be completed and drawn up 
<br/>by early next year, 2025, the first quarter, so that will cover the entire seven thematic areas that have 
<br/>been identified in the Denarau Declaration document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The review of the Act will also include the inclusion of extracurricular activities; the school 
<br/>fundraising  activities;  the  curriculum  review  and  benchmarking  and  scaling  of  marks  at  external 
<br/>exams  in  both  primary  and  secondary  schools;  benchmarking  of  external  examinations  and  the 
<br/>quality assurance process of setting of marking of examination papers; the financial management of 
<br/>school funds or free education grants; the school enrolment age is also needed to be reviewed; and 
<br/>the automatic progress or retention of students in the education system, also to be reviewed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the issue that has been identified by the Standing Committee on the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education,  
<br/>Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2271 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Education  Commission,  the  Ministry  of  Education  has  commenced  the  groundwork  on  the 
<br/>appointment  of  the  Education  Commissioners,  which  will  be  partially  funded  by  the  Global 
<br/>Partnership  for  Education  (GPE).  As  of  today,  six  commissioners  have  been  identified  and  their 
<br/>appointment letters will be issued before the end of the week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  recommendations  that  has  been  addressed  by  the  Standing  Committee  are  the 
<br/>collaboration with other stakeholders, the appointment of officers and counsellors, and the retentions 
<br/>or alternative learning methods for dropout students. Over the past so many years, there has been no 
<br/>tracking system to identify the whereabouts of students who have dropped out of the school system. 
<br/>At the moment, the Ministry of Education is closely working with UNESCO in upgrading the FEMIS 
<br/>database to capture information on the number and details of school dropouts. We are also trying to 
<br/>explore whether these FEMIS numbers that are being given to students, whether they can also take 
<br/>it up with them when they enter higher education or in the job market.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the measures that have contributed to improve retention of students within 
<br/>the school system. The $200 Back to School financial assistance to assist parents with the combined 
<br/>annual  income  of  $50,000  or  less.  The  Ministry’s  e-learning  programme  and  the  introduction  of 
<br/></span><span>Learning Management System (LMS), where teaching will be conducted online to assist students 
<br/></span><span>and make learning more exciting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  reintroduction  of  the  Matua  Programme  in  2003  at  the  Nabua  Secondary  School  has 
<br/>positively assisted in the school dropouts through the readmission of students back into the education 
<br/>system. The Ministry also plans to expand the Matua Programme to other divisions. In terms of the 
<br/>vocational technology, this would be introduced as a mainstream subject in 2025 at Year 9 as one of 
<br/>the strategies to retain students in the education system.  This will be piloted in 15 selected secondary 
<br/>schools prior to the full implementation of the programme.  These initiatives, Mr. Speaker, Sir, will 
<br/>provide alternative pathways to students who are not academically inclined.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the drug issues, that has been identified by the Standing Committee, this is a major issue 
<br/>in the country which has infiltrated our school system, as students have been used to either peddle or 
<br/>use it to drown their problems.  The Ministry is undertaking the following actions to address drug-
<br/>related issues through the Substance Abuse Advisory Council (SAAC). They have the existing policy 
<br/>to train teachers on how to handle drug related issues in schools.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Due to the increase in drug related reported cases among youths, SAAC has discussed and 
<br/>approved, revising its awareness package and programmes to target at risk schools and strengthen 
<br/></span><span>parental  and  community  engagement.  The  International  Day  against  Drug  Abuse  and  Illicit 
<br/></span><span>Trafficking programmes conducted on an annual basis in schools will be evaluated to ascertain the 
<br/>effectiveness of its purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Counsellors in schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Education has already established 
<br/>divisional counsellors in four counselling hubs in the respective education divisions and the Ministry 
<br/>will propose establishing school counsel petitions in its 2025-2026 budget submission. There are 35 
<br/>teacher counsellors within the education districts who are mobilised to attend to cases when the need 
<br/>arises from  each district. The Ministry is  also  working  together with  other NGOs, which provide 
<br/>counselling to intervene into the lives of the students who use drugs.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Regarding the building of more schools, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry in consultation with 
<br/>DFAT, will be conducting the infrastructure reviews in schools. This is supposed to be due at the end 
<br/>of the month of November.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the school enrolment policy which is currently being drafted by the Ministry

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of Education is anticipated to minimise rural-urban migration of students which is one of the reasons 
<br/>for overcrowding of classrooms in urban areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the sustainable development goals, the actualisation of the ten targets and 
<br/>eleven indicators in the SDG4 is reflected in the ten-year Ministry of Education sector plan and 2023 
<br/>Denarau Declaration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  terms  of  the  budget  for  transport,  total  funding  of  FJ$37  million  was  allocated  for  the 
<br/>transport assistance scheme of which 40 percent is allocated for RSL and 60 percent for e-ticketing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There  are  currently  discussions  for  reviewing  the  rate  from  $1.12  to  $1.64,  an  additional 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>amount of $2.8 million will be needed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister for Education. There are three more in the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>batting line up for this motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to contribute on the 
<br/></span><span>motion.  Firstly,  I  would  like  thank  the  Standing  Committee  for  the  comprehensive  Report.  The 
<br/></span><span>Standing  Committee  have  come  up  with  some  very  good  findings  and  recommendations.  I  have 
<br/>picked two findings of the Standing Committee, and I will be talking on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, firstly, I will talk on retention and school dropouts. According to the data 
<br/>provided by the Ministry of Education, a high number of students drop out of school every year. Last 
<br/>year, that is 2023, 1,162 students dropped out of school before completing primary education and 
<br/>this is an increase of 34 percent compared to 2022, where the number was 755.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the last five years, the highest number of students dropped out of school 
<br/>in 2023 before completing year eight, that is more than 1,000 students which is a huge increase in 
<br/>school dropouts. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I see this school dropout issue as something of great concern to 
<br/>everyone in Fiji. The Free Education Grant and Transport Assistance were two great initiatives of 
<br/>the former Prime Minister Bainimarama, and it had a great impact on reducing student dropouts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the inception of the Free Education Grant 10 years ago, Government 
<br/>has  invested  around  $650  million  dollars  through  the  free  Education  Grant  to  738  primary,  176 
<br/>secondary and more than 870 ECE (Early Childhood Education) centres. The Free Education Grant 
<br/>eased the financial burden on parents, students, teachers and the school management committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One reason why students are irregular to school apart from the many other reasons, it is poor 
<br/>bus service. I have raised this in Parliament before and I am raising it again, many people from the 
<br/>interior, from the remote areas they have raised concern. I want to highlight some of the areas. I have 
<br/>received  concerns  from  people  of  Viseisei  back  road,  Wairabetia,  Vuda  back  road,  Vaivai  and 
<br/>Raviravi. They have raised concerns regarding bus services not provided to students in those areas 
<br/>and they have to hire taxis, they have to pay huge amounts of money every week.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, I have raised this issue previously in this Parliament, but nothing has been 
<br/>done. Children are the world’s most valuable resources and is the best hope for the future.  Children 
<br/>are the future of our country, and we want to see all of them educated. We do not want to leave any 
<br/>child behind.  If the Coalition Government fails to address the school dropout issue, then we will see 
<br/>an increase in youths on the streets committing crimes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We can already see teenagers who should be in school, sitting on the streets asking people for 
<br/>money, when other children their age are in school. And then, we have the drug problem, which is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="59">Page 59</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education,  
<br/>Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2273 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  probably,  the  greatest  concern  right  now.  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  drug  cases  in  schools  increased  to 
<br/>around 3,500 in 2023. The Ministry of Education must come up with innovative initiatives and work 
<br/>closely  with  parents,  school  heads,  teachers,  school  management,  faith-based  organisations,  non-
<br/>government organisations and other government ministries, to minimise issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the other findings of the Standing Committee is teacher shortages. This is 
<br/>due to mass migration of teachers. Fiji has lost thousands of teachers in the last two years, the main 
<br/>reason is attractive salaries offered to teachers in countries like New Zealand, Australia and Canada 
<br/>and many more. The number may increase because most of the teachers have received only seven to 
<br/>ten percent increase in salary which is not enough compared to the huge increase in the cost of living, 
<br/>VAT and corporate tax. Teachers play a crucial role in setting our children’s future. They deserve 
<br/>better pay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, each month, more teachers are leaving the profession and who can blame 
<br/>them. Their dedication is not being rewarded and this is affecting our children’s education. If the 
<br/>Coalition Government’s approach does not change, we risk losing more talented teachers to countries 
<br/>that value their contribution.  Our teachers are stretched thin, as teacher resignation has created a 
<br/></span><span>vacuum and is directly affecting the quality of our children’s education. I support the motion, thank 
<br/></span><span>you Mr. Speaker, Sir for the opportunity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make a short contribution on the motion 
<br/>moved by the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs on the Consolidated Review 
<br/>Report of the Ministry of Education, Heritage &amp; Arts Annual Reports for 2018-2019, 2019-2020 and 
<br/>2020-2021.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the Chairman and Members of the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Social Affairs in performing their mandated duties and compiling the Consolidated Review Report 
<br/>of the years in review which highlights the Standing Committees key findings and recommendations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  noted  that  the  Standing  Committee  has  come  up  with  eleven 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>recommendations and I will be focussing on three of these recommendations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with recommendation 4.5, the Standing Committee recommends that the 
<br/>Ministry introduce different learning programs to address the increasing number of student dropouts. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to an article published in the </span><span>Fiji Times</span><span> on 19</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2024, about 
<br/>4,589 students dropped out of the formal education system before completing primary education and 
<br/></span><span>5,726  left  before  completing  Year  10  between  2019  and  2023.    Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  is,  indeed, 
<br/></span><span>worrying and needs the attention of all the stakeholders involved in the education of our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation put forward by the Committee is in line with the 2023 
<br/>Denarau  Declaration  on  thematic  area  1A  which  focuses  on  the  curriculum  and  sustainable 
<br/>development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Committee’s  recommendation  4.6  states  that  the  Ministry  in 
<br/>collaboration with other key stakeholders undertake collective measures to combat the issues of drugs 
<br/>in  school,  and  further  on  recommended  on  4.7  that  the  Ministry  appoint  more  professional 
<br/>counsellors  in  schools  to  effectively  address  students  who  are  affected  by  drugs  and  other  social 
<br/>issues.    These  three  recommendations  by  the  Committee  can  be  termed  as  a  band-aid  solution,  a 
<br/>temporary fix that does not address the root cause of the problem.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I strongly believe that the root cause of all these problems lies on the parents 
<br/>neglecting their roles and responsibilities. The parents should always be involved in the nurturing of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>their children.  If the home has a solid foundation, which is found in Christ alone, then these children 
<br/>would be able to withstand any social issues and challenges that they face in life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as Ellen G. White clearly states in her book “Education” on page 284, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I quote:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“In the formation of character, no other influences count so much as the influence 
<br/>of the home. The teacher’s work should supplement that of the parents but is not to take 
<br/>its place. In all that concerns the wellbeing of the child, it should be the effort of parents 
<br/>and teachers to co-operate.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can utilise all the resources we have, involve stakeholders and undertake 
<br/>measures  to  combat  these  social  issues  and  if  parents  continue  to  neglect  their  roles  and 
<br/>responsibilities in educating their children then all our efforts will be in vain.

<div><span>A collective approach which involves the </span><span>vanu</span><span>a, religious bodies and stakeholders will only 
<br/>be effective if parents and guidance take the leading role in character development.  Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span><span>Sir, thank you for this opportunity and I support the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  the  Committee  for  the 
<br/>Report.  I also want to thank the honourable Minister for Education for providing a detailed response 
<br/>on the Report highlighting some of the achievements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is significant that we are actually debating 2018 and 2019, 2019 and 2020 
<br/>Report because when we came into Government, we realised the mess that was existing within the 
<br/>education system.  It was purely the result of haphazard, ill-conceived, out of touch policies that were 
<br/>introduced over so many years.  I will give you an example and honourable Hem Chand, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, he has got a habit of generalising.  He was talking about mass-migration of teachers, teachers 
<br/>leaving because of their salaries. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C. PRASAD.-  Let  me  give  you real  statistics,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  from  the 
<br/>Ministry of Finance and the funding that we provide. We are currently funding 13,325 teachers, up 
<br/></span><span>from 12,793 at the end of 2022. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Net increase of 532 teachers.  In fact, we are hiring more than 
<br/>the rate of resignation.  We recruited 1,600 teachers and only 1,000 had retired or resigned, this is 
<br/>the statistics.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me point out few other things that honourable Hem Chand was talking about, some are 
<br/>real  issues, and the honourable Minister for Education talked about  it. First,  Mr. Speaker, Sir, he 
<br/>talked about drop out, people leaving the system, students not being able to make it; that is correct.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  what  is  the  reason,  what  are  some  of  the  factors?    Education 
<br/>policies, when it is considered, must be considered by experts.  It must be considered in a carefully  
<br/>carefully calibrated manner based on data and evidence, and nothing of that sort was done when they 
<br/>were reforming the education system.  It was all haphazard.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Education,  
<br/>Heritage &amp; Arts 2018-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2275 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We, Mr. Speaker, Sir, were in Opposition for eight years called for the appointment of an 
<br/>Education Commission.  It is this Government under this Prime Minister that we have appointed an 
<br/>Education Commission.  We also took actions head-on immediately when we came into Government.  
<br/>Within few months of Government, the honourable Prime Minister announced this package; the new 
<br/>initiative  of  providing  $200  per  child  from  Pre-School  to  Form  Seven  and  we  provided  227,000 
<br/>students in 2023 that $200 which helped them to get back to school. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2024, Mr. Speaker, Sir, again more than 200,000 and again in 2025, we are providing more 
<br/>than $40 million for more than 200,000 students to get that $200.  I want to say to the parents, “the 
<br/>applications are still open, it is going to close on 5</span><span>th</span><span> December and if parents and students have not 
<br/>applied, we encourage them to do so.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other point about infrastructure that honourable Hem Chand mentioned and he is right, 
<br/>infrastructure Mr. Speaker, Sir, is absolutely important.  But what has happened over the last 10 years 
<br/>or 12 years, rural-urban migration has continued.  Schools in the rural areas have faced depopulation 
<br/>in terms of enrolment but Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the urban areas, if you look at Suva and Nausori areas 
<br/>in the last 10 years, hardly any single classroom has been built, hardly any new school has been built.  
<br/></span><span>As  the  honourable  Minister  for  Education  said,  it  is  this  Government  that  got  the  Australian 
<br/></span><span>Government to do an audit of 80 schools between Suva and Nausori areas and we are now embarking 
<br/>on building additional rooms and classrooms.  We have also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two years 
<br/>completed the renovation, the building of new schools in many parts of this country including Vanua 
<br/>Levu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had in the last two years done so many things that is now addressing the mess that existed 
<br/>in the education system. We have also, and I want to point this out, the TELS Loan Scheme was 
<br/>another disaster that they presided on. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- So, when we came into Government, we replaced the Loan 
<br/>Scheme with scholarships based on merit - $650 million was written off and I will tell you the result 
<br/>of that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Thank you Mr. Speaker.  The result of that scheme, we wrote 
<br/>off that loan, we provided in place of that a merit-based scholarship.  We are putting in $150 million 
<br/>for new scholarships and with the new scheme, we are actually giving more scholarships than all the 
<br/>students that studied under the TELS Loan and Scholarships.  In fact, the statistics is this, we are 
<br/>supporting 9,940 continuing students, but we are actually giving scholarships to new 10,830 students.  
<br/>That is the difference, that is the kind of good thinking and good policy that we have implemented 
<br/>as part of this Government’s policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let me point out, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have two minutes, a few other things with respect to 
<br/>infrastructure and the policies that support our students.  I know honourable Hem Chand talked about 
<br/>bus services, in fact, part of the reason why the bus industry in the state of disrepair is because of the 
<br/>policies that was put in place.  For many years, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they did not get a bus fare increase, 
<br/>they were artificially kept down...

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … and a lot of the bus industry players could not run rural 
<br/>services because of what was there.  What we have done in the last budget is to ensure that the bus 
<br/>operators get a reasonable return on their investment.  We are now subsiding, we are now paying 100 
<br/>percent of school fares for the students and we have put in ... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- … additional $16 million to $17 million.  That is the kind of 
<br/>good  policy  that  we  are  putting  in  the  education  system,  and  the  people  of  this  country  are  now 
<br/>appreciating, they can see the difference. They can see the truth from the lies that they were told in 
<br/>the past.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to thank the Committee, I think their recommendations 
<br/></span><span>are very important and the Education Commission that this Government has appointed, the Denarau 
<br/></span><span>Declaration is going to fit in and make sure that any policy going forward will be based on data, 
<br/>based on evidence and based on that, we will get good policies for education that will work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, let me assure you that some of these interruptions I 
<br/>see are on the verge of disorderly conduct under certain rules of the Standing Orders. I will tell you 
<br/>that I had in my other life been a referee in rugby. So, I will have no hesitation whatsoever to issue a 
<br/>yellow  card  to  anyone  who  misbehaves  in  this  Chamber.    Just  bear  that  in  mind,  honourable 
<br/>Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.S.  VANAWALU.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  upon  the  deliberations  that  were  done  this 
<br/>afternoon,  we  thank  the  honourable  Members  for  the  positive  contributions  in  regards  to  these 
<br/>Reports.  Upon our deliberations on the review of Annual Reports, the Committee recommends the 
<br/>following, that the:
