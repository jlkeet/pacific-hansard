<div><span>Reply to Written Question No. 269/2024 tabled by the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and 
<br/>for  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Minister

<div><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Reply to Question No. 269/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Universal  Service  Obligation  (USO),  as  provided  under  the  Telecommunications  Act  2008, 
<br/>mandates the provision of telecommunications services to all Fijians, including those in rural and 
<br/>remote areas, ensuring equitable access to connectivity across the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>240  communities  have  been  identified  and  gazetted  for  the  purposes  of  section  49  of  the 
<br/></span><span>Telecommunications Act 2008, as having poor or no connectivity.  The breakdown of these villages 
<br/>by province is as follows:

<br/></span><span>240 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  comprehensive  list  of  the  240  villages  can  be  found  in  the  Legal  Notice  No.  88  of  2022.  
<br/>http://www.law.sqov.fj/Acts/DisplayAct/2930# 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additional  areas  that  lack  meaningful  connectivity  are  being  identified  by  Telecommunications 
<br/>Authority of Fiji and will soon be gazetted as Universal Service Areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  line  with  this  obligation,  the  Telecommunications  Authority  of  Fiji  (TAF)  has  undertaken 
<br/>extensive assessments and consultations to address connectivity challenges in underserved regions.  
<br/>TAF has evaluated proposals from various industry players for deploying infrastructure and services 
<br/>to  these  remote  areas.    However,  the  assessments  highlighted  that  deploying  traditional  heavy 
<br/>infrastructure such as towers and supporting tower systems is not economically sustainable due to 
<br/>the high costs associated with construction and maintenance in these challenging terrains.  High level 
<br/>assessment showed that current universal service funds would not be able to support the construction 
<br/>of infrastructure to cover all 240 identified sites.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>ii. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the introduction of rapidly deployable and affordable high-capacity satellite backhaul solutions, 
<br/>a more practical and cost-effective alternative is being identified.  This approach will align with the 
<br/>USO’s objectives and ensures that even the most geographically isolated communities can benefit 
<br/>from reliable digital connectivity.  This satellite-based connectivity will empower these communities 
<br/>to  access  vital  digital  services  that  can  significantly  enhance  education,  healthcare,  business 
<br/>opportunities and overall quality of life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since  this  solution  does  not  involve  the  construction  of  heavy  infrastructure,  it  is  considered  a 
<br/>transitory  solution.    The  idea  behind  this  approach  is  to  provide  immediate  connectivity  to  these 
<br/>underserved  communities  while  gathering  valuable  data  on  usage  and  demand.    This  will  allow 
<br/>telecommunications  operators  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  future  investments  in  more  extensive 
<br/>infrastructure such as tower-based solutions, based on actual usage statistics and community needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence, this initiative will offer a flexible, sustainable and scalable solution for rural connectivity, 
<br/>enabling communities to benefit from digital services now, while also paving the way for potential 
<br/>future upgrades as demand and usage grow.  In fact, over 90 percent of the rollout will be future 
<br/>proof if the backbone technology needs to change down the line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reliability is a critical factor in this initiative, especially given these communities do not access to a 
<br/>consistent power supply.  To address this challenge, the system deployed will need to be equipped 
<br/>with  solar  power  backup,  providing  up  to  two  days  of  power  autonomy.    The  solar  backup  will 
<br/>enhance the resilience and sustainability of the system, enabling these communities to benefit from 
<br/>reliable connectivity, despite their lack of conventional power sources.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because it is a managed system, telecommunications operators will have the capability to remotely 
<br/>monitor system health, ensure availability, and address issues proactively.  The managed approach 
<br/>includes regular system health checks, enabling service providers to maintain high performance and 
<br/>reliability without frequent on-site interventions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally, basic training will be provided to villagers to help them manage and perform minor 
<br/>maintenance  tasks  on  the  system.    This  community-driven  approach  reduces  unnecessary 
<br/>mobilisation of technical terms from telecommunications providers, except in cases major repairs or 
<br/>upgrades.  This model not only enhances operational efficiency but also empowers communities to 
<br/>take ownership of the system, ensuring its sustainability in the long term.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As the procurement of the power systems may take approximately 8 to 10 weeks, the initial rollout 
<br/></span><span>will focus on the 37 communities based in the Central and Western Divisions that already have access 
<br/></span><span>to the EFL grid supply.  This will allow for faster deployment and quicker access to connectivity for 
<br/>these communities, while the rest will receive solar-powered solutions as the process progresses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  rollout  of  the  managed  solution  will  involve  assigning  operators  exclusive  rights  to  serve 
<br/>designated geographic clusters.  This exclusive allocation creates an environment that encourages 
<br/>operators to invest in these areas, as they are assured of a dedicated market for their services. By 
<br/>having exclusive rights, operators will be incentivized to innovate and develop tailored solutions that 
<br/>meet the specific needs of each community, ensuring that the services provided are both relevant and 
<br/></span><span>effective.  This approach fosters competition among operators, drives investment in infrastructure 
<br/></span><span>and ensures that the connectivity solutions are customized to address the unique challenges faced by 
<br/>each region.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, this initiative will be a significant step towards bridging the digital divide in Fiji’s 
<br/>rural  and  remote  communities.    By  leveraging  cost-effective  and  sustainable  satellite  technology, 
<br/>alongside  managed  solutions  and  solar  power  backup,  the  project  aims  to  provide  reliable 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>connectivity and essential digital services to underserved areas.  The phased rollout and monitoring 
<br/>process will ensure that the system meets the needs of the communities, while also gathering valuable 
<br/>data to inform future infrastructure investments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  collaboration  between  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  Co-operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium 
<br/>Enterprises  and  Communications,  Telecommunications  Authority  of  Fiji,  Telecommunications 
<br/>providers and local communities will reflect a commitment to enhancing access to digital services, 
<br/>fostering economic opportunities and improving the quality of life for Fijians in remote regions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon completion of preparatory work, more detailed information on the initiative will be provided 
<br/>to Parliament.
