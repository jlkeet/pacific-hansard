<div><span>ANNEXURE II 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Reply to Written Question No. 271/2024 tabled by the honourable Minister for Housing and 
<br/>Local Government (Ref. Page 2261)  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
<br/>(Hon. M.K. Nalumisa) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<br/>Reply to Question No. 271/2024 is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to respond to the question that by virtue of the Local Government Act 1972, 
<br/>the  Special  Administrators  were  appointed  in  December  2023  to  implement  the  much-needed 
<br/>constructive reforms in local government.  The appointments were purely based on merit through a 
<br/>due diligence process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Locals with an understanding of community needs were chosen as Special Administrators.  Under 
<br/></span><span>the  direction  of  the  Special  Administrators,  the  Municipal  Councils  have  been  functioning 
<br/></span><span>autonomously.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The salary and entitlements of Special Administrators as per the Higher Salaries Commission Act 
<br/>2023,  is  determined  by  the  Higher  Salaries  Commission.    The  Special  Administrators  salaries 
<br/>determination is based on the size of the Councils, which is small, medium and large.  In addition, 
<br/>the salary of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and acting CEO is also determined by the Higher 
<br/>Salaries Commission. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part A 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Municipal Councils currently have Special Administrators who are acting as Chief Executive 
<br/>Officers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Councils where a Special Administrator is acting at CEO are: Suva City Council, Nasinu Town 
<br/>Council  and  Tavua  Town  Council.    There  are  no  Executive  Chairs,  as  noted  in  the  honourable 
<br/>Member’s  questions,  as  the  Ministry  do  not  consent  to  the  creation  of  a  new  position  within  the 
<br/>Council Structure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the dates and salary level to the Acting CEO are as follows: This salary is calculated 
<br/>similar to the civil service acting, that is, 95 percent of the difference of the salary of the Special 
<br/>Administrator and the CEO is added to the base salary of the Special Administrator.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>1.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Suva City Council 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Acting CEO: Mr. Tevita Boseiwaqa 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Date of Appointment: 4 July 2024 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary as approved by the Higher Salaries Commission: annual remuneration of $159,386 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nasinu Town Council 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Acting CEO: Mr. Felix Magnus 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Date of Appointment: 4 July 2024 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary Level: Annual remuneration of $79,549.80 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>3.</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tavua Town Council 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Acting CEO: Mr. Sireli Korovulavula 
<br/></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><a name="95">Page 95</a></div>
<div><span>v. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Date of Appointment: 22 October 2024 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Salary Level: Acting Salary for Acting CEO is not yet implemented as approval from Higher Salaries 
<br/>Commission is still pending.  He is only paid the SA Allowance of $12,000/annum until the approval 
<br/>from the Higher Salaries Commission 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  rationale  for  appointing  the  Acting  CEOs  for  the  Councils  was  essential  to 
<br/>ensure the streamlining of municipal services, improving infrastructure development, strengthening 
<br/>the  revenue  streams,  bringing  about  financial  stability,  preparation  of  annual  accounts  and 
<br/>publication of Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to the appointment of the Acting CEOs, the Ministry had sought legal advice 
<br/>from the Office of the Solicitor-General on the legal implications of the same.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  decision  to  appoint  Acting  Chief  Executive  Officers  for  the  three  Councils  is  an  interim 
<br/>arrangement only.  The appointment will end as soon as the Councils are able to recruit a qualified 
<br/>and suitable CEOs to lead the respective organisations.  The Ministry of Local Government and the 
<br/>Municipal Councils understand the need to fill the substantial positions in a timely manner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as such, the Municipal Councils have engaged the services of KPMG Advisory 
<br/>(Fiji) Pte Limited as the Recruiting Agency to support the Councils in the recruitment of the Chief 
<br/>Executive Officers.  The service of the local executive recruitment firm is to assist the Municipal 
<br/>Councils in the end-to-end selection and recruitment process  for the positions of Chief Executive 
<br/>Officers.  This independent and transparent process is to enable the Councils to recruit personnel who 
<br/>have the skills and experience required for the position.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recruitment process is planned to start this month and is anticipated to be concluded by early 
<br/>2025.  The Ministry is hopeful that the Municipal Councils will be able to recruit visionary applicants 
<br/>who can contribute towards the reforms and success of the Councils amongst other priority areas of 
<br/>the Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Part B 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Special Administrators are entitled to allowances which are paid monthly.  The 
<br/>allowances are based on the size of the Municipal Councils.  The Special Administrators are also 
<br/>entitled to meal and travel allowance for out of town or city expenses for any meetings such as local 
<br/>government forums, payable by the Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is worth nothing that the large and medium councils pay the allowances from the Council funds 
<br/>whilst the Ministry pays for the Special Administrators of the Small Councils.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  total  expenditure  for  Special  Administrators  and  Acting  Chief  Executive 
<br/>Officers for the 13 Municipal Councils from January to November 2024 amounts to $944,670.68. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The table below provides the total allowances paid to the Special Administrators from January to 
<br/>November 2024 by the Ministry.
