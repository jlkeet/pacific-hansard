<div><span>Evaluation of Erosion – Rewa Riverbanks 
<br/>(Question No. 259/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Agriculture and Waterways inform Parliament 
<br/>on  the  current  evaluation  of  the  erosion  issue  along  the  Rewa  riverbanks,  specifically 
<br/>between the central Nausori Town boundary towards Lakena Point? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, foremost let me offer my congratulations to 
<br/>His  Excellency  the  </span><span>Turaga  na  Tui  Cakau,</span><span>  Ratu  Naiqama  Tawakecolati  Lalabalavu  on  his 
<br/>appointment as our new President of the Republic of the Fiji Islands. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to congratulate you on your new appointment as a Speaker 
<br/>of the House.  This is a momentous occasion and your election to this distinguished position reflects 
<br/>the trust and confidence placed in your leadership, integrity and dedication to serving the people of 
<br/>Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  response  to  the  honourable  Member’s  question,  I  rise  to  address  the 
<br/>concerns raised regarding the ongoing erosion issue along the Rewa riverbank, particularly between 
<br/></span><span>the central Nausori Town boundary and Lakena Point.  This area is of great significance both in terms 
<br/></span><span>of its natural environment and the communities that depend on it for their livelihoods. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the soil erosion index, the country is losing over 50 tonnes of 
<br/>soil per hectare  each year through run off which  is  four times the average in  tropical  areas.  The 
<br/>consequences  of  the  expansion  of  agriculture  and  the  increase  logging  activities  of  rainforest  on 
<br/>erosion have been significant.  The effects of erosion include degradation of land, reduction in soil 
<br/>carbon, decrease productivity and sediment accumulation in rivers leading to an increase in flooding 
<br/>and harm to coral reef by transport of sand sediments.  Erosion also poses a direct threat to critical 
<br/></span><span>infrastructure including nearby roads, residential properties and community facilities. Communities 
<br/></span><span>have expressed concerns about the safety of their homes, access to transportation routes, potential 
<br/>loss  of  arable  land  and  biodiversity  loss  in  preparing  zones  with  destabilised  riverbank  habitats 
<br/>impacting the ecosystem. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Waterways,  through  the  Waterways 
<br/>Division is actively addressing this critical issue.  The ongoing assessments indicate that this stretch

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2239 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of  the  riverbank  is  significantly  impacted  by  erosion  is  significantly  impacted  by  erosion  due  to 
<br/>several  contributing  factors,  including  high  river  flow  velocities  during  peak  rainfall  seasons, 
<br/>increased sediment load from riverbanks upstream activities such as agriculture and land clearing, 
<br/>insufficient recurring vegetation leaving the susceptible to erosion, encroachment and unregulated 
<br/>developments near the riverbanks and uncontrolled sand extraction works close to the river. Multiple 
<br/>site visits and technical surveys have identified critical erosion hotspots, particularly where the river 
<br/>meanders sharply, creating areas of heightened flow velocity and stress on the banks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the potential threats posed by this issue, the engineers from the 
<br/>Ministry of Waterways Division are examining and analysing flow patterns and sedimental transport 
<br/>to determine the root cause and develop effective interventions.  Meeting with stakeholders including 
<br/>residents, businesses and local government representatives are also being conducted to incorporate 
<br/>their input and ensure solutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These  entities,  each  with  legal  jurisdiction  within  their  area,  are  essential  partners  in 
<br/>formulating an effective  solution  to address  the erosion challenges along  the section of the Rewa 
<br/>River. Currently, the Waterways Division is collaborating with key stakeholders, including the Japan 
<br/>International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and the National Disaster Management Office to develop 
<br/>a National  Waterways  Strategy and incorporate inputs into Disaster Risk Reduction Plans for the 
<br/>Rewa  catchment.  These  consultations  aim  to  develop  comprehensive,  sustainable  strategies  for 
<br/>addressing erosion  and other water related hazards in  the region.   Additionally, the engineers  are 
<br/>leveraging drone-based mapping to monitor changes in riverbank profiles, providing real time data 
<br/>to guide decision making and project implementation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  is  also  considering  these  additional  strategies  aimed  at 
<br/>mitigating erosion and reinforcing the stability of the riverbanks. The planting of vetiver grass and 
<br/>native  vegetation,  as  a  nature-based  solution  to  naturally  stabilise  the  banks  shall  reduce  erosion, 
<br/>improve structural interventions by installing boulder revetment at critical locations for immediate 
<br/>protection and constructing groynes to redirect river flow and alleviate pressure on vulnerable areas. 
<br/>Silt removed from the river is deposited along the riverbanks as part of the riverbank protection works 
<br/>and this have started at Vunimono, Toga and Nasilai are portions of the Rewa Riverbank.  Enhancing 
<br/>awareness and regulation through developing and introducing Riverbank Management Guidelines to 
<br/>minimise encroachment and regulate activities along the riverbanks.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is committed to a balanced approach, combining short term 
<br/>stabilisation  measures  with  long-term  riverbank  management  practices.  A  comprehensive  project 
<br/></span><span>proposal  will  be  submitted  through  the  Ministry’s  budget  submission  to  secure  the  necessary 
<br/></span><span>resources for implementation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  acknowledges  the  critical  need  to  address 
<br/>erosion along the Rewa riverbank to safeguard lives, infrastructure and environment. The Ministry's 
<br/>prioritising the completion of technical assessments and will commence remedial works as soon as 
<br/>possible.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, while some people  would just see this as soil 
<br/></span><span>erosion, I see that the resources of the </span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners are washed away.  Is the Ministry considering 
<br/></span><span>some kind  of compensation  to  the  </span><span>i  qoliqoli</span><span>  owners for the washing  away of their resources into 
<br/>Rewa River? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you wish to comment?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, right now there is no talk of compensation, but 
<br/>I  am glad that question is being asked from that side of the House because they did nothing during 
<br/>their time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his explanation, 
<br/>I think a very  in-depth  explanation of the factors that are affecting the erosion. By the way,  Sir, 
<br/>congratulations on your appointment and congratulations for the son of Kabara who also got, after  
<br/>22 tournaments they did not win anything.  It had to take a boy from Kabara to take Dubai back after 
<br/>nine years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to thank the honourable Minister for his long, very good and in-depth explanation of 
<br/>the various factors and I understand that they are still continuing the investigations while they decide 
<br/>what to do. Part of the things that he talked about was the lack of vegetation on the sides of the river 
<br/>and at the same time, maybe the impacts of the extraction of gravel and sand from the river. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noticed the day I drove past last week that the dredgers are right on the side of the river. If 
<br/>I understand, these dredgers are supposed to be in the middle of the river. So, in the interim while his 
<br/>awaiting that, is he also considering liaising with these dredgers to move to the middle of the river, 
<br/>and at the same time whether there is any approach to get those who own the farms there to actually 
<br/>plant trees and plants along the edge of the river to protect ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Do you need to answer that, honourable Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.T.T.K. RAYALU.- The dredge owners have been told exactly that, to move into the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>middle of the river.

<div><span>Status of Fiji’s National Carbon Strategy Roadmap 
<br/>(Question No. 260/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change,  Environment,  Civil  Service,  Information,  Public  Enterprises,  Information, 
<br/>Immigration and Fiji Police Force update Parliament on the status of Fiji’s National Carbon 
<br/></span><span>Strategy Roadmap? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish I could just show him this and ask him to go 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and read it because that was adopted in COP29.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also add my words of congratulations to His Excellency the President and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>our gratitude to the immediate past President. Also, my congratulations to the sevens rugby team.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  welcome  the  question  from  the  honourable  Tunabuna.    The  Coalition 
<br/></span><span>Government, I believe, have made significant strides in developing Fiji’s National Carbon Strategy 
<br/></span><span>Roadmap and there is the copy. It was embraced by COP29.  A lot of work had gone into that, and I 
<br/>would like to also thank the Australian Government for seconding an official from the Australian 
<br/>Government to the Prime Minister's Office to help out in climate change matters, who was with us 
<br/>for one year and has gone back. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2241 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In essence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the strategic roadmap has been developed to support the process 
<br/>required for Fiji to safely and effectively engage with international carbon markets. The  roadmap 
<br/>provides  information  on  Fiji’s  context,  our  objectives  and  priorities,  and  provides  the  basis  for 
<br/>developing  the  necessary  regulatory  environment  to  support  interested  parties  to  collaborate,  to 
<br/>support our efforts to reduce emissions and build resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Fiji faces unique challenges related to climate 
<br/>change, such as the rising sea levels and climate change excavated natural disasters.  Keeping global 
<br/>emissions below 1.5 degrees Celsius is critical for our future and there are opportunities to attract 
<br/>investment to help us meet our emissions reduction targets in ways that support our local economy 
<br/>and our resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, Micro, Small 
<br/>and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications’  Ministerial  Statement  this  morning  elaborated  on 
<br/>such efforts to reduce our emissions and contribute to global warming. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, 55 percent of our energy supply is currently from non-fossil fuel - 50 percent 
<br/>from hydropower and 5 percent from biomass and wind generators. We are well on our way in our 
<br/></span><span>contributions to reducing carbon emissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s National Carbon Market Strategy Roadmap provides an initial framework to help the 
<br/>nation  leverage  international  carbon  markets  in  alignment  with  our  ambitious  climate  goal.  The 
<br/>roadmap offers pathways and options that can help  a range of stakeholders to  use  carbon market 
<br/>instruments to scale resilience and unlock sustainable development opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  National  Carbon  Market  Strategy  Roadmap  outlines  specific  actions 
<br/>needed to ensure that carbon market engagement supports Fiji’s Nationally Determined Contribution 
<br/>(NDC) and advanced high integrity carbon projects that uphold environmental integrity and social 
<br/>safeguards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Roadmap is centred on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and I assume everyone knows 
<br/>that,  and  the  focus  is  on  the  use  of  co-operative  approaches  between  parties  and  stakeholders  to 
<br/>address climate change through market and non-market approaches that enable Fiji to engage both, 
<br/>market  based  and  non-market-based  carbon  mitigation  mechanisms,  emphasising  high  integrity 
<br/>practices, equitable benefit sharing and sustainable development. This initiative, Mr. Speaker,  Sir, 
<br/>leverages international  carbon markets  to  mobilise investments  for decarbonisation and resilience 
<br/>building projects, while safeguarding the interests of local communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Roadmap identified five pillars of actions which have been sequenced 
<br/>across short, medium and long term categories to facilitate a staged approach to the implementation 
<br/>of the Roadmap Action Plan in Fiji. They include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Pillar 1 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Enhancing market readiness through strategic actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Pillar 2 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening legal frameworks and governance structures. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Pillar 3 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Safeguarding  community  benefits  and  landowner  rights.  A  lot  of  our  landowners  are 
<br/>coming up with their own suggestions in that area. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Pillar 4 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Increasing public awareness, participation and ownership and capacity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Pillar 5 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developing effective partnerships and scaling finance.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji’s  vulnerability to  climate change, compounded by limited resources 
<br/>and competing development priorities, underscores the importance of innovative financial solutions. 
<br/>The reality is that, through carbon markets, we can attract additional financial flows, in exchange 
<br/>with partial share in the emissions reduction we facilitate with those investments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is significant international interest to provide funding to Fiji in ways that support both, 
<br/>our  adaptation  and  resilience  building  objectives,  as  well  as  our  effort  to  reduce  emissions.  This 
<br/>Roadmap is important both, for domestic stakeholders, as well as for international parties interested 
<br/>to engage with us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An example, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji has signed an initial agreement with the Government of 
<br/>Singapore  which,  in  the  future,  could  enable  companies  in  Singapore  to  invest  in  low  carbon 
<br/>technology in Fiji, whether it be transport infrastructure or renewable energy systems.  This would 
<br/>help to offset the cost of these new types of technology in exchange for a share in emissions reduction 
<br/>outcomes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>International actors are in a position to invest in countries, like Fiji, with the cost of reducing 
<br/>emissions potentially cheaper than it would be in their domestic setting. The benefit for us is that 
<br/>those  investments  can  help  give  us  access  to  infrastructure  and  technology  that  we  would  not 
<br/>otherwise have been able to afford.  The Roadmap, Mr. Speaker, Sir, provides details of our priorities 
<br/>and actions which we will take to ensure these tools are brought about in an effective way.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Roadmap was co-designed through an 18-month process that included multi-
<br/>stakeholder engagement through workshops and webinars that involved representatives from 14 key 
<br/>government ministries, community groups, private sector participants and international experts. This 
<br/>collaborative process has, overall, created awareness on carbon markets through the dissemination 
<br/>of information and generally facilitated ownership of the process and outcome.  The roadmap is not 
<br/>a final strategy or policy, but a guide to how progress further efforts and consultations. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, technical support for his work was funded by the Australian Government, as I had mentioned, 
<br/>and delivered through the Carbon Market Institute.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Carbon Market Strategy Roadmap that I had shown this august House 
<br/>was endorsed in Cabinet on 13</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024, and was also launched at the margins of COP 29 
<br/>in Baku, Azerbaijan, by the honourable Attorney-General. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Government  of  Singapore  and  Conservation  International  have  expressed  interest  in 
<br/></span><span>supporting the Government of Fiji’s implementation efforts.  A range of bilateral and multilateral 
<br/>engagements are actively being pursued to ensure comprehensive support for project development 
<br/>and market engagement in response to the launch of this key document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to provide legal institutional support for the implementation, the regulations 
<br/>under  Part  10  of  the  Climate  Change  Act  2021  will  be  expedited  to  operationalise  our  ability  to 
<br/>regulate and engage with the carbon market mechanisms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to  welcome you to  our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is in terms of carbon capture, sequestration and the Strategic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Roadmap as mentioned by the honourable Prime Minister.  Honourable Prime Minister, there is an 
<br/>issue at hand on our ground where excessive vehicle emission in terms of carbon monoxide, nitrogen 
<br/>oxide particulate matter, volatile organic matter, is getting quite high.  What we get to see honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2243 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Prime Minister is that vehicles that are not serviced or should not be on the roads are on our roads 
<br/>and polluting the air with excessive carbon and all these gases.  So, what is the line Ministry doing 
<br/>to reduce this carbon footprint in going forward? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure there are regulations, and the honourable 
<br/>Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport is aware that during the renewal 
<br/>of  licences,  there  are  systems  to  check  the  emission  from  each  vehicle  before  the  licences  are 
<br/>renewed. There are no spot checks on the road at the moment, but they can be re-introduced. Thank 
<br/>you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Prime Minister, this may or may not have international trade 
<br/>implications in terms of our exports and I am not sure if it applies to imports, but will this strategy 
<br/>properly address those issues that may arise?   I understand that Europe may put on a carbon levy, so 
<br/>some of the stuff that we actually export out to them may be subject to carbon levy. Is that going to 
<br/>be addressed by us in terms of our own economy?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question. 
<br/>All these are contained in this Carbon Market Strategy.  It is a strategy.  There are various actions 
<br/>that we have to carry out - those that reduce our own emissions and those that encourage investors to 
<br/>contribute to those industries that will further contribute to the global effort to maintain the global 
<br/>warming target of 1.5 degrees Celsius by the target date. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, a supplementary question;  are we still on the roadmap 
<br/>to 2050 to have Fiji as a zero emitter of carbon in the globe?   Secondly, does this framework actually 
<br/>provide any kind of imitative to all those landowners who already have their stock, to upgrade their 
<br/>stock to do carbon trading? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  simple  answer  to  that  is  yes.    We  are 
<br/>encouraging  landowners  and  forest  owners  to  continue  to  put  forward  their  suggestions  for  the 
<br/>inclusion of their forest areas under this Roadmap.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to join my colleagues to congratulate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>you for taking the post of the Speaker of the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Prime  Minister,  strategies  and  roadmaps  are  beautiful  documents  with  good 
<br/>intentions. My question to you is on capacity building. Are there any plans to build the capacity so 
<br/></span><span>that this Roadmap can be delivered effectively?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question. 
<br/>Yes, they are all part of it and all we have to do is collectively contribute to our strategies and policies 
<br/>that we have here, to contribute towards our national effort, in contributing to the world effort towards 
<br/>our fight against climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, at this point, we will break for lunch. Therefore, this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proceeding is suspended.  The Parliament will resume proceedings at 2.30 this afternoon.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Plans to Reinstate Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa Island Councils 
<br/>(Question No. 261/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.N. TUICOLO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my Oral Question, I would like to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>congratulate you on your calling.  I pray that God will continue to guide you in your leadership role.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Climate Change, 
<br/>Environment,  Civil Service,  Information,  Public Enterprises  Information, Immigration and 
<br/>Fiji Police Force update Parliament on plans to reinstate the Rotuma, Rabi and Kioa Island 
<br/>Councils? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for his question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With regards to the plan in reinstating the Rotuma Island Council, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Rotuma 
<br/>is administratively incorporated into Fiji as dependency with some measures of autonomy given to 
<br/>Local Government in the current Rotuma Act where the Rotuma Island Council can make regulations 
<br/>for the island.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In line with the Government’s obligation under the ILO Convention No. 169 on the Rights of 
<br/>Indigenous and Tribal Peoples and United Nations Declaration for the Rights of Indigenous People 
<br/>(UNDRIP), I have an office under my portfolio that is responsible for looking after Rotuman affairs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The UNDRIP ILO No. 169, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognises that indigenous peoples have the 
<br/>right to free, prior and inform consent, or nothing about us without us.  This means that their consent 
<br/>must be sought and freely  given to  changes that  affect  their institutions, their resources  and their 
<br/>traditional decision-making processes, for example, the appointment of their chiefs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Coalition Government is adamant that the people of Rotuma should decide for themselves 
<br/></span><span>their future and to be governed by law and systems that are in line with their culture and traditions.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to delve into history. The 1970 Constitution recognised the 
<br/>Council of Rotuma as a local authority. The Great Council of Chiefs would permit the Rotuma Island 
<br/>Council delegates to make decisions on all issues pertaining to Rotumans, which the Chief would

<div><span>The  cession  of  Rotuma  in  1879  was  also  acknowledged  in  the  1997  Constitution  and 
<br/>according  to  that  Constitution,  the  iTaukei  and  Rotuma  indigenous  people  have  the  right  to 
<br/></span><span>governance  through  their  separate  administrative  systems  and  the  rights  of  all  individuals, 
<br/></span><span>communities and groups are respected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rotuma Lands Act, the Rotuma Act, the Native Land Trust Act, the Native Lands Act, 
<br/>the Fijian Affairs Act and the Banaban Act were all included and protected under Section 185 of the 
<br/>1997 Constitution.  Those provisions, unfortunately, were not included in the 2013 Constitution.  So,

<div><span>majority in the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Now, that the Great Council of Chiefs has been reinstated, I urge the Chiefs and residents of 
<br/>Rotuma  to  participate  in  the  determination  of  matters  pertaining  to  their  functions,  including  the 
<br/>revision of legislations, that include meaningful consultations and dialogues through free prior and 
<br/>informed consensus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Chapter 122 of the Rotuma Act created the Council of Rotuma, a statutory authority.  The 
<br/>seven elected representatives from each of the seven districts and the seven district leaders, make up 
<br/>that Council. As stated, each of Rotuma’s seven districts elects one representative of the Council and 
<br/>the traditional chief of each district is also a Council member. The seven Chiefs are chosen according 
<br/>to traditional custom; the election is usually for life.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  seven  elected  representatives  are  elected  for  three-year  terms  by  resident  Rotuma 
<br/>islanders, aged 21 years and over. Candidacy is restricted to persons who are eligible to vote. The 
<br/>full members of the Council elect a chairman from among themselves.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the honourable Members information, the Rotuma Island Council was not dissolved but 
<br/>the subvention fund was suspended for two consecutive financial years due to non-compliance to 
<br/>financial regulations by the Council. The matter has now been rectified by the Council and the annual 
<br/>subvention funds have been released.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On elections, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Rotuma Island Council held its election on 24</span><span>th</span><span> August, 
<br/>2023, where the current chairman was re-elected for another three year term.  It is critical to note that 
<br/>elections are held every three years and the current electoral procedure, as outlined in the current 
<br/>Rotuma Act, is still being followed.  This is another critical area of interest that will be subject for 
<br/>consultation and thorough discussion once the review of the Act commences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Council  now  looks  after  the  overall  development  on  the  island.  The  Council  is  now 
<br/>allocated budgetary grant and the Rotuma’s Subvention Fund that is administered by the Office to 
<br/>support its daily operational needs and to provide development assistance to communities in Rotuma.  
<br/>Just because I plan to intend to reinstate the Rabi Island Council, I would like to read our relative 
<br/>inquiry, </span><span>Kam na Mauri</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Rabi Island Council of Leaders was established under the Banaban Settlement Act 1970, 
<br/>Cap 123.  The last election of the Council members was held in 2011.  As the Prime Minister and 
<br/></span><span>Minister in  charge of  Rabi  Island matters,  I have appointed  an administrator for the Rabi  Island 
<br/></span><span>Council of Leaders to oversee the Council’s operations and restore the annual Rabi Subvention Fund 
<br/>as one of the Coalition Government’s top priorities for the people of Rabi, who had been left behind 
<br/>in social and economic advancements over the years when the subvention fund was withheld by the 
<br/>Office.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Council was dissolved in 2013 due to the mismanagement of funds and pending court 
<br/>cases for some of its members. Legal advice was sought, noting that the dissolution was due to the 
<br/>failure to meet financial standards and requirements within specified timeframes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>General  elections  for  the  Council  were  first  held  in  November  1996  in  accordance  with 
<br/>Regulation  1951(2)(1)  of  the  Banaban  Settlement  Act.  Elections  are  scheduled  to  take  place  in 
<br/>January of the following four years - 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020. Therefore, the next 
<br/>General Election should have been held in January 2024, in accordance with Article 2(1).

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the  Office  is  currently  consulting  with  and  reviewing  portions  of  the  Banaban  Settlement  Act  in 
<br/>collaboration with the interim Rabi Administrator.  This will ensure that the Act takes into account 
<br/>current and emerging development trends.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A major change to be expected from the review was for the election process to be aligned to 
<br/>that of the Fijian Elections Office in terms of voting age and the criteria for those wishing to contest 
<br/>the elections and selection process. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Banaban Settlement Act’s existing voting 
<br/>age is 21, that must also be changed to 18 in order to comply with the Fijian Elections Regulations.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are there any supplementary questions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- I thank the honourable Prime Minister for a very detailed response on 
<br/>Rotuma, but my question is related to Rabi Island.  I understand the Faith Candidate of The People’s 
<br/>Alliance Party (PAP), Mr. Jacob Korotake, was appointed as the Administrator, and he had come up 
<br/>with a policy that anyone who is a non-Banaban who wants to enter Rabi Island, it has been reported 
<br/>in  the  media,  that  one  has  to  get  police  clearance  to  enter  Rabi  Island.  Is  the  honourable  Prime 
<br/>Minister aware of it? And if, yes, has any action been taken against this member? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware of that and I will follow it up with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the police.

<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask my question, I would like to also join the 
<br/>other honourable Members of Parliament who have spoken before me to congratulate you and thank 
<br/>you for being appointed as the Speaker of this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  current  status  of  the  Vanua  Levu  Tourism 
<br/>Development Programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also wish to join my colleagues in congratulating 
<br/></span><span>you, Mr. Speaker, on your appointment to be our Speaker.  I know that we are in good hands and 
<br/>there will be many wonderful years ahead with your leadership.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, to the favourite son of Kabara, Osea Kolinisau, who brought so much joy to our nation 
<br/>early this morning - the victory in Dubai. I am sure, like most of you, the quarter final with the French, 
<br/>that last try, I am not a good loser, I left and went to my room, and my family was still cheering and 
<br/>apparently, someone from Nadroga picked up the ball and went to score that try. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vocea for his question. I know that this is a programme 
<br/>that not only the honourable Members in this Parliament hold dear, but our people across the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the benefit of those listening online, in June last year, the World Bank

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>approach to tourism development in Vanua Levu. This is on a highly concessional terms through the 
<br/>International Development Association.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have shared in this august Parliament, the US$100 million dollars, while earmarked for 
<br/>the tourism programme, will greatly benefit other sectors. The crux of this programme is to mobilise 
<br/>investments  in  resilient  infrastructure  and  essential  services,  create  a  more  enabling  business 
<br/>environment  and  to  enhance  institutional  coordination.  It  is  known  as  </span><span>Na  Vualiku  Project</span><span>,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are in phase one of </span><span>Na Vualiku Project</span><span> valued at US$61.5 million, it runs from year one 
<br/>to year six. This phase will set the foundations for sustainable tourism in Vanua Levu and is where 
<br/>we are starting. In September of this year, the honourable Prime Minister officially launched the Na 
<br/>Vualiku Project in Savusavu and he also officially opened our office there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2024-2025 financial year, the project has been allocated an estimated 
<br/>$13.6 million. Of this, the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation has provided $7.69 million, Fiji 
<br/>Roads Authority - $2.4 million and Fiji Airports - $3.4 million.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>From the Ministry’s side, considerable work has begun. We are first undertaking a Strategic 
<br/>Environmental  Social  Assessment  (SESA)  to  look  at  all  the  environmental  and  social  risks  and 
<br/>impacts that could be expected with the implementation of the integrated tourism master plan, a firm 
<br/>has been engaged.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In parallel with SESA, we are now in the process of preparing an integrated tourism master 
<br/>plan which will be an important framework that will give us a 25-year forecast for tourism growth to 
<br/>Vanua Levu and Taveuni. It will also include baseline, and a scenario forecast that can tell us the 
<br/>investments  and  finances  needed  to  cater  for  future  demand.  This  work  will  commence  by  April 
<br/>2025. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By January 2025, we will commence working on a Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>(MSME) pilot programme. Here we will map out tourism MSMEs, community-based tourism and 
<br/>women cultural enterprises, understand their specific needs, then design a pilot programme. Together 
<br/>with the National Trust of Fiji, we are progressing work on the design of the Waisali Forest Reserve 
<br/>Visitor Centre and Tracks, et cetera. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  working  with  our  partners  on  the  design  and  feasibility  study  of  the  solar  panel 
<br/></span><span>installations. The Savusavu Town Council have identified a few locations where the panels could be 
<br/></span><span>installed.  There  are,  of  course,  a  number  of  large  infrastructural  activities  that  will  require  more 
<br/>coordination, for example, solid waste management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have established a waste management committee to support the project in terms of land 
<br/>identification and acquisition. The Fiji Roads Authority have also commenced work on the design 
<br/>phase of the Labasa – Savusavu Link Scenic Road before civil works begin.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With respect to airports for Vanua Levu, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we need to start landing ATR 72 
<br/></span><span>to make a difference in carrying the passengers to Vanua Levu. Right now, only Labasa can take the 
<br/></span><span>ATR 72, and the plan is to extend Matei to also cater for ATR 72.  There is a site that I visited on 
<br/>Friday, very much in the news in Vunilagi which can take ATR 72 and possibly smaller jets.  Vunilagi 
<br/>is very well situated and is located about 40 minutes’ drive from Savusavu, very picturesque, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Na Vualiku Project is progressing very well and I might just add, I was there on Thursday 
<br/>and Friday, in Labasa and Savusavu, the boom in those two economies is very evident and I think 
<br/>there are great years ahead for Vanua Levu.  And for this programme to work, we need the buy-in, 
<br/>not just from other government ministries but other government organisations, civil society, private 
<br/>sector, development partners and communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  K.K.  LAL.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  join  honourable  Members  in  welcoming  and  also 
<br/>congratulating you on your election, and I hope you will be very lenient with the Opposition MPs.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister for the project and looking after our 
<br/>Vanua Levu people. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As much as we promote the Northern Development Programme or the Vanua Levu Tourism 
<br/>Development Programme, one of the major issues is our hospital. Are there funds allocated or priority 
<br/>allocations  for  our  hospital  in  Savusavu?  There  will  be  more  tourists,  there  will  be  more 
<br/>developments  going  on  in  infrastructure,  but  our  hospital  is  in  a  bad  state.  Will  you,  honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister, look into improving our hospital in Savusavu?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- I understand the question is on the hospital, I missed that one.  It is 
<br/>very  much  in  the  plan  with  the  honourable  Minster  for  Health,  but  let  me  assure  the  learned 
<br/>gentlemen, Savusavu today is booming in a manner that I have not seen for many years and thank 
<br/>the Coalition Government.  It is all set to….

<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- There are many wonderful years ahead for Savusavu, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Can we have the question from honourable Bala? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- May I also take this time to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, of this 
<br/>august  Parliament.  Can  the  honourable  Minister  clarify  whether  the  construction  of  the  Labasa 
<br/>Airport is part of the Tourism Development Programme?  If yes, when is the completion time? On 
<br/>what basis was the contractor awarded the contract?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, work on Labasa has started. The terminal building 
<br/></span><span>is being enlarged right now. It is a matter of acquiring the land necessary for that, Mr. Speaker Sir. 
<br/>The process is in place, and we are in the hands of very professional people, people from the World 
<br/>Bank who are managing this and based in Savusavu, as I have indicated.  So, you can be assured that 
<br/>the quality of the work is going to be of the highest standard, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I also join my colleagues in congratulating you 
<br/>for your appointment as Speaker of the House.  We are indeed proud of the achievements of Kabara.  
<br/>May I also say that for that reason, we from Verata are very elated as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  question  to  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  you  have  been  talking  about 
<br/>development of airport facilities, but my question is related to seaports.  The honourable Tikoduadua 
<br/>would be aware that few years back he visited with the team concerning the development of seaports 
<br/>in Vanua Levu, particularly in Savusavu, the move to get the roll-on, roll-off facility from where it 
<br/>is now to Balaga so that tourism can be facilitated in the current port facility where dolphins and

<div><span>others are installed.  So, my question to the honourable Minister is, are there considerations as well 
<br/>for the development of port facilities in Savusavu particularly? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just want to comment, what the Opposition side 
<br/>enjoy now was something that we were denied over the last eight years.  You have been very kind to 
<br/>them,  there  are  more  than  three  questions  per  question.    It  is  something  that  we  welcome  in  this 
<br/>House.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is dialogue on that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a need that has been articulated for 
<br/>a seaport. What we have here, Mr. Speaker, Sir, $200 million is in three phases.  Its first phase will 
<br/>be the learning phase.  What we learned from this one will determine the second phase and third 
<br/>phase. We want to do it carefully and properly.  It is very much in the dialogue, honourable Leader 
<br/>of the Opposition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad to see that the Government is picking up on all the action 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>work that was done by the government before it; put that land in place, the Look North Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I am glad to see that you did not chuck everything out the door, in 
<br/>particular,  I  am  interested  in  the  cross-island  road  linking  Labasa  to  Savusavu.    We  have  the 
<br/>Lomolomo Slip up there.  I noticed that you said that you wanted to make it more scenic.  I do know 
<br/>what it is that is going to make it more scenic than the way it is right now.  How, in particular, are 
<br/>you going to make this road more scenic especially the Lomolomo Slip that keeps dropping?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the drive from Labasa to Savusavu these days is 
<br/>about one and half hours or more to two hours.  We are trying to shorten the drive to make it easier 
<br/>for tourists to arrive through Labasa.  For the reason, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that only Labasa Acan take 
<br/>the bigger aircraft – ATR 72.  Savusavu cannot even accept the full load of the Badeirante and the 
<br/>other smaller aircrafts.  So, Labasa is the entry point right now and by developing the road, you are 
<br/>going to make it quicker to commute between Labasa and Savusavu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On a scenic basis, there will be rest points along the way.  We are aiming to make it pleasant 
<br/>for our tourists driving between Labasa and Savusavu, given that some of them would have travelled 
<br/></span><span>quite some distance to come into Nadi and then Nadi into Labasa and then Labasa to Savusavu.  So, 
<br/></span><span>the aim is to make the drive pleasant. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We now move on to the next Oral Question.  I am made aware that the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar Industry is not present with us today. In such 
<br/>cases, the former Speaker and my predecessor, would rule that the Question be deferred to a later 
<br/>date  when  the  honourable  Minister  is  present.    I  will  abide  by  that  precedent  and,  therefore, 
<br/>honourable Members, Oral Question 263/2024 is deferred to a later sitting date.

<div><span>Questions

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Public Works, Meteorological Services and Transport 
<br/>update Parliament on some of the developments and plans related to Fiji’s membership on the 
<br/>International Solar Alliance? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members, I rise to take 
<br/>this opportunity to speak today about the significant role of the International Solar Alliance (ISA).  I 
<br/>join my colleagues in congratulating you, Sir, in your appointment as the Speaker of the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The ISA has been vigorously working with Fiji to leverage solar energy as a critical pathway 
<br/>for energy transformation and sustainable development, recognising the significant potential of solar 
<br/>power to diversify energy generation, improve energy access and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji formally joined the ISA by ratifying the framework agreement on 25</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2017.  
<br/>The  Ministry,  as  the  focal  Ministry  for  ISA,  has  been  making  substantial  strides  in  solar  energy 
<br/>implementation and capacity development in the last few years.  One of the notable achievements 
<br/>has been the successful commissioning of solar projects in the healthcare sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  ISA  provided  technical  and  financial  support  to  develop  demonstration  solar  projects 
<br/>resulting in the solarisation of health centres, each equipped with eight KWP solar installations.  This 
<br/>initiative not only demonstrates the practical application of solar technology but also highlights the 
<br/>potential for improving energy infrastructure in critical public services such as health.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Capacity  building  has  also  been  a  cornerstone  for  ISA’s  engagement  with  Fiji.    Through 
<br/>comprehensive training programmes, the ISA supported human resource development across various 
<br/>domains.  To-date, the country has benefitted from targeted training initiatives including participants 
<br/>in  Masters  level  training,  Degree  and  also  training  in  solar  rooftop  technology  and  solar  SMEs 
<br/>banker’s training.  These programmes are designed to build local expertise and create a sustainable 
<br/>ecosystem for solar and energy development and deployment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  current  engagement  between  ISA  and  Fiji’s  multi-faceted  and  forward  looking,  a 
<br/>significant  progress  has  been  a  letter  of  co-operation  between  ISA  and  the  Ministry,  focusing  on 
<br/>scaling  solar  rooftop  projects  in  various  facilities  including  schools,  health  centres  as  well  as 
<br/>developing solar mini grid projects for rural communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the country has also expressed keen interest in expanding solar applications particularly 
<br/></span><span>in  agriculture,  with  the  proposal  for  27  solar  pumps  under  the  Scaling  Solar  Application  for 
<br/>Agriculture  Use  (SSAAU)  Programme  and  in  the  Water-Energy  Nexus  to  ensure  that  all  Fijians 
<br/>including those residing in the rural and maritime areas have access to clean and safe drinking water.  
<br/>There are numerous diesel-powered pumps and boreholes around the country, and we are working 
<br/>with ISA to solarise this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, several  promising initiatives, as  I had  already mentioned, including  potential sites for 
<br/>solar mini grids, rooftop projects, floating solar projects, solar powered ferries or boats.  Discussions 
<br/></span><span>are  ongoing  for  implementing  a  solar  grid  at  the  Public  Rental  Board  (PRB)  with  a  tripartite 
<br/></span><span>agreement already shared for signing.  The ISA is also providing policy and regulatory support to 
<br/>create an enabling environment for the private sector investment for solar energy development and 
<br/>deployment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Looking ahead, the ISA is planning to support Fiji in implementing innovative solar solutions 
<br/>including solar cold storage facilities for the solarisation of health centres under ISA and Ministry of

<div><span>External Affairs (MEA) Quad Climate Initiatives.  We are currently discussing feasibility of hybrid 
<br/>boats with solar power and expanding solarised streetlights for our roads and community areas. These 
<br/>efforts align with Fiji’s broad goals of improving energy security, reducing carbon emissions and 
<br/>promoting sustainable development. All key areas were discussed at the recent COP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, as Fiji continues to embrace solar energy, the partnership with ISA represents a promising 
<br/>pathway to address energy challenges, support economic resilience and contribute to global climate 
<br/>action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I would just 
<br/>like to ask the honourable Minister, there has been continuous resistance from EFL in the private 
<br/>sector to contribute in the provision of solar power to their grid.  In your own experience, Sir, do you 
<br/>feel that the resistance is hampering the provision of solar energy to provide power into the main 
<br/>grid?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  That  is  a  very  good  question  which  fundamentally  is  the 
<br/>problem in Fiji relating to energy.  In relation to ISA, we are not collaborating in terms of the current 
<br/>diagnostic study, but it is with International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).  So, the study is 
<br/>currently in progress in terms of analysing or assessing what would be the best fit in terms of the 
<br/>generation,  transmission  and  distribution  of  power  which  is  currently  being  handled  by  EFL  in 
<br/>addition to the regulatory functions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, it boils down to the current regulatory and legislative setup which we have now.  
<br/>As you may note from the last Government Minister’s note which could be hindering the progress 
<br/>towards  renewable  energy,  which  is  why  that  study  is  being  conducted.    From  that,  further 
<br/>discussions  are  being  held  with  all  stakeholders,  we  would  determine  what  would  be  the  right 
<br/>legislative  and  regulatory  framework  and  structure  to,  not  only  enable  renewable  energy  but  to 
<br/>enhance or provide the impetus to move it forward.  That study should be concluded towards the end 
<br/>of  this  year  and  further  discussions  with  stakeholders  in  how  we  could  move  that  forward  as  a 
<br/>Government, especially in the legislative and regulatory part to enhance or increase investments in 
<br/>renewable energy to achieve our target of 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  Honourable Minister, in terms of the capacity 
<br/>building, I understand that ISA will have some capacity building, but it is actually tailored.  Are we 
<br/>talking  about  capacity  building  from  a  Government’s  perspective  or  is  it  Government,  EFL  and 
<br/>private sector in terms of capacity building? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- At the moment, that covers ISA and Government but with the 
<br/>initiative to establish a Solar Training Centre in Fiji, which is currently in discussion, that will also 
<br/>cover the non-government including small businesses that might come into the maintenance of solar 
<br/>equipment, et cetera, especially if it is located out in the villages and communities.  Those need to be 
<br/>localised in terms of the capacity to repair their own, in the village setting, for example.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, while the commitment remains to have a carbon 
<br/>neutral  environment  in  the  Pacific  region,  the  question  to  the  honourable  Minister  is,  what  is  the 
<br/></span><span>current percentage of renewable energy or clean energy produced by EFL? Is there or will there be a 
<br/></span><span>measure of carbon footprint in terms of mining the materials for solar projects and its disposal?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you wish to answer? It is rather hypothetical, in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>my view.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Definitely, we are moving towards the target  which is 100 
<br/>percent renewable energy by 2030. It sounds ambitious but it can be achieved because right now, 
<br/>renewable energy is around 60 percent. If we include those renewable energy proposals (there are 
<br/>quite a few of them here) then we could lessen the carbon footprint.

<div><span>Safety of Troops – UNIFIL &amp; Other Peacekeeping Missions 
<br/>(Question No. 265/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With rising tensions in the Middle East, particularly Israel’s recent attack on Lebanon, 
<br/>can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Defence  and  Veteran  Affairs  inform  Parliament  on  what 
<br/>measures  are  being  taken  to  ensure  the  safety  of  our  troops  serving  in  UNIFIL  and  other 
<br/>Peacekeeping Missions? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank the honourable Koroilavesau for raising this 
<br/>critical  issue  concerning  the  safety  of  our  troops  serving  in  the  Middle  East  amidst  the  ongoing 
<br/>tensions in the region. However, before I continue with the answer to that question, Sir, first of all, I 
<br/>join my colleagues to congratulate you on your ascend to the Speaker’s Chair of this august House.  
<br/>May I wish you success during your term as Speaker of the Fijian Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the same token, I would also like to congratulate coach Kolinisau, captain and the boys of 
<br/>the Fiji Team for delivering a sweet victory to Fiji this morning. I am sure it made all of us happy.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To continue answering the honourable Koroilavesau’s question, I would just like to clarify 
<br/>that at the moment there is only one Fijian Officer deployed to UNIFIL, Lebanon and additionally, 
<br/>under the Fijian Service with United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our contingents  in  the United Nations Disengagement Observer  Force (UNDOF), they all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>remain unaffected by the recent escalations in the region. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, ensuring the safety and the wellbeing of our peacekeepers is a top priority 
<br/>for the Coalition Government.  The situation in the Middle East presents significant risks and we are 
<br/>closely monitoring the developments. Our troops are well prepared, they are safe, strictly adhere to 
<br/>Standard  Operating  Procedures  and  are  supported  by  robust  contingency  plans  for  potential 
<br/>evacuation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry is  in  regular contact  with  their headquarters of the Republic of  Fiji  Military 
<br/>Forces. The joint taskforce commander at Blackrock looks after our peacekeeping troops that are 
<br/>deployed out in the Middle East and throughout the world.  Also, with the United Nations Department 
<br/>of Peacekeeping Operations in New York (DPKO) to ensure effective coordination and support for 
<br/>our peacekeepers at this time. We are also consulting with some governments including the United 
<br/>Arab Emirates on temporarily stationing RFMF troops and equipment in their territory which would 
<br/>enhance our readiness.  Additionally, we are working with development partners to explore options 
<br/>for strategic air support, if needed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Coalition  Government  remains  committed  to  safeguarding  our 
<br/>peacekeepers and Fijians residing in the Middle East.  We are receiving situation reports daily and 
<br/>we keep our stakeholders informed.  We are prepared to respond swiftly to any emerging challenges.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would just like to also inform, Mr. Speaker, that the honourable Prime Minister recently had 
<br/>given directions to Government that the Fijian Government will work with the United Nations in as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2253 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>far as the safety of our troops is concerned.  So, we align ourselves to the UN and then we work with 
<br/>them in looking after the safety of our troops.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As part of this commitment also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are expecting Government delegations 
<br/>to  visit  the  Middle  East  in  the  early  2025,  and  this  will  allow  us  to  assess  their  conditions, 
<br/>reinforcement, contingency measures and personally convey the appreciation in support of the Fijian 
<br/>people for the work that they are doing for us. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  have  a  supplementary  question  for  the 
<br/>honourable Minister.  When it comes to safety, are you satisfied with the equipment that the troops 
<br/>are issued with, particularly, protection vehicles?  We know that the bushmaster is aging, so are there 
<br/>plans to get in additional protection vehicles as well, because this is so important for the safety or our 
<br/>troops? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.  TIKODUADUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  is 
<br/>absolutely right.  I would like to assure you, again, and this august House and the Fijian people, that 
<br/>the safety of our troops remains our top priority.  Every soldier or officer whom we deploy in the 
<br/>Middle East or any part of the world, we would like to see them come back.  So, post protection 
<br/>measures are an important and integral part of the RFMF, and the Government would like to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, last year, the honourable Prime Minister took receipt of 14 bushmasters 
<br/>that are now in Nadi.  We are working on plans to send, at least, seven of those to the mission area, 
<br/>to UNDOF in particular.  However, we are hindered at the moment because there is only a limited 
<br/>number of vehicles that the UN will allow, a number that is allowable by both, the Syrian side and 
<br/>Israeli side in the demarcated area.  So, that is something we are working on.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ultimately, at the end of the day, that is the ideal thing to do.  I know we had bushmasters 
<br/>because we were trying to get hold of the Force Mobile Reserve for UNDOF.  Unfortunately, that 
<br/>has slipped through, so these bushmasters are primarily there for the protection of our troops, and for 
<br/>supporting our Fijian troops within the locations that they are deployed.  Hopefully, at some point, 
<br/>we will be able to have all of our troops on peacekeeping out there, or the numbered personal carriers 
<br/>or some kind of armoured protection.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Building Permit Applications System 
<br/>(Question No. 266/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. TUIWAILEVU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the work undertaken by the Ministry on the Building Permit Application System and 
<br/>how it will contribute to order and efficiency of the building development process in Fiji? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to response to the question raised by the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Member and I thank him for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I table my response this afternoon, I also would like to join you to 
<br/></span><span>also congratulate our winnings Sevens Team that won in Dubai this morning.  I also stand proud in 
<br/>this august Parliament to share that the first player who scored the try hails from my Province of 
<br/>Namosi and is also named as player of the final. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the building and construction sector serves as a vital pillar of our economy, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reflecting the level of investments, job creation and economic activity.  The vibrant and dynamic 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>construction industry is a clear indicator of our nation’s path of growth and development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from January 2023 to November 2024, the Ministry has received a total of 
<br/>2,186 building permit applications valued collectively at $1.16 billion.  Notably, 25 percent of these 
<br/>applications are for commercial, industrial and tourism-related projects. These are sectors that play a 
<br/>transformative role in Fiji’s economic diversification and resilience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This upward trajectory is a testament to the growing accommodation in Fiji’s economy. Also 
<br/>underscored is the need for the Government to deliver efficient and effective services to ensure that 
<br/>these investments translate into real outcomes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Coalition Government recognises that innovation terminology are key 
<br/>to  meeting  the  evolving  needs  of  our  citizens  and  investors.    By  leveraging  modern  systems  and 
<br/>streamlining our processes, we aim to create a building permit application system that is not only 
<br/>more efficient but also fosters greater transparency and accountability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to inform this august Parliament that the Ministry of Local 
<br/>Government, in line with the Government’s digital transformation agenda, is working very closely 
<br/>with  the  Ministry  of  Trade,  Cooperatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and 
<br/>Communications through the consultations to develop the Building Permit Approval System (BPAS). 
<br/>This  system  is  a  crucial  component  of  the  project  business  now  in  Fiji,  aligning  with  its  goal  of 
<br/>streamlining business processes and fostering economic growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  BPAS’s  portal  aims  to  revolutionize  the  building  permit  approvals 
<br/>process in Fiji. By digitising the entire workflow, we aim to reduce bureaucratic delays associated 
<br/>with manual processing, increase transparency and compliance and, most of all, enhance efficiency 
<br/>in our service delivery by significantly reducing turnaround processing times. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, significant progress has been made in the development of the BPAS portal. 
<br/>From  requirements  approval  and  referral  agencies  to  work  on  the  process  of  harmonising  all 
<br/>requirements of key agencies into one checklist.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Currently, the Ministry is piloting a very important component of the BPAS portal whereby 
<br/>all  building  applications  that  had  been  lodged  at  all  Municipal  Councils  are  being  tracked 
<br/>electronically  with  real  time  updates  being  shared  between  the  Municipal  Councils  and  the 
<br/>Department of Town and Country Planning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  effective  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  September,  2024,  all  Municipal  Councils  adopted  a 
<br/>unified tracking system, accompanied by an Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for assessing and 
<br/>processing building applications.  Additionally, a standardised checklist for receiving applications 
<br/>was implemented across all Councils to ensure consistency and transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the process for building permit applications follows a structured approach.  
<br/>Applications are first vetted by all Municipal Councils to ensure compliance with local zonings and 
<br/>other planning regulations. Once overall requirements are met, applications are then forwarded to the 
<br/></span><span>Department of Town &amp; Country Planning for compliance search with National Planning Standards 
<br/></span><span>and  Building  Codes.    The  two  applications  are  then  returned  to  Councils  which  then  release  the 
<br/>building applications back to the applicants.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this tracking system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning 
<br/>and Municipal Councils can now provide regular updates to consultants and applicants on the status 
<br/>of their building applications, enhancing communication and accountability.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="41">Page 41</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2255 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the approved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) provide clear timelines 
<br/>for processing building permit applications.  As of now, with the normal processes, Councils must 
<br/>process  applications within 14 days and submit to  the Department  of Town &amp;  Country Planning, 
<br/>where the Department of Town &amp; Country Planning then processes applications within 20 working 
<br/>days from the date of lodgement and, that is, provided all requirements are met. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Rezoning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, takes 45 working days to complete processing of applications, 
<br/>whereas  a  subdivision  takes  approximately  30  working  days.    This  timeline  reflects  significant 
<br/>improvements  in  efficiency  given  by  the  streamlining  of  processes  and  introduction  of  the 
<br/>standardised procedure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the thorough checks conducted at both levels, that is, the Council as well as 
<br/>Department of Town &amp; Country Planning, are very important to ensure that proposed developments 
<br/>comply  with  legal  and  technical  standards.    This  includes,  as  alluded  earlier,  on  the  checking  of 
<br/>zoning, plot boundary setbacks and alignment with municipal regulations by the Municipal Councils, 
<br/>while the notification of compliance with national planning frameworks, compliance with the Town 
<br/>Planning  Act  and  general  provisions,  and  environmental  consideration  is  done  by  the  Town  &amp; 
<br/>Country Planning Team. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the introduction of a digitised tracking system, along with the SOPs and 
<br/>standardisation,  has  resulted  in  measurable  improvements  in  application  processing  times.    For 
<br/>instance, the building and development control applications are now processed within one month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The proportion of subdivision applications processed within one month has increased from 
<br/>22  percent  in  2022  to  31.4  percent  in  2024.    Collectively,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  67.3  percent  of 
<br/>subdivision applications were processed within three months in 2024, compared to 62.7 percent in 
<br/>2023,  and  rezoning  applications  processed  within  one  month  also  increased  from  63.4  percent  in 
<br/>2023 to 64.4 percent in 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  incremental  improvements  in  the  manual  processes  lay  a  strong 
<br/>foundation  for  even  greater  efficiency  and  transformative  change  once  the  online  system  is  fully 
<br/>operationalised.  We also anticipate the timeline between Councils and Town &amp; Country Planning to 
<br/>reduce to 21 days.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a need to amend the legislative requirements, the amendments 
<br/>of the Town &amp; Country Planning Act to align with the evolving landscape of digital technology and 
<br/></span><span>streamline processes required under this new system.  The Ministry is also going to review some of 
<br/></span><span>the schedules, as well as to ensure that when the system comes into effect, it is going to work for 
<br/>both, Municipal as well as the Town &amp; Country Planning Team.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  my  Ministry  remains  steadfast  in  its  commitment  to 
<br/>modernise the building permit approval process.  The development of the new system will aim to 
<br/>streamline procedures, reduce delays in the processing of the applications and enhance transparency. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, through you, honourable Minister, I understand this will go 
<br/></span><span>online shortly.  In terms of the necessary infrastructure with all the Councils that require this to fulfil 
<br/></span><span>what you are actually trying to do in terms of digitisation, is the Ministry itself digitised enough and 
<br/>together with the authorities that are tied into it, will they be fully digitised by the time this actually 
<br/>goes online? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is a very important question because with any new system that we are going to use, we must make

<div><span>Suspension of Standing Orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sure  that  we  have  the  necessary  infrastructure  to  support  the  system.  It  is  something  we  are  also 
<br/>working with the Ministry of Trade, through their consultants, to assist us in identifying some of the 
<br/>key areas, especially when there is a need to review and amend the infrastructure that are required to 
<br/>support the system.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is something that we are also going to take into account and that will also be discussed 
<br/>at all levels, that is, the Municipal levels, as well as within the Ministry itself or the Government 
<br/>itself, to ensure that when the system is taken on board, it is going to work for the purpose that it is 
<br/>being created for.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.–  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  just  quickly,  honourable  Minister,  in  terms  of  the 
<br/>legality of it, will you also be required to change some of the regulations and laws to facilitate all of 
<br/>these and how fast will that be done, or is that already with the Office of the Attorney-General? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have also mentioned in my response that some 
<br/>legislations and other aspects of the legislative requirements for the Town Planning Act needs to be 
<br/>amended and that is something that the team is closely working on right now.  We should review to 
<br/>ensure that before we actually have the system on board, the legislation is there to support this new 
<br/>system. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B. SERUIRATU.- A quick question to the honourable Minister and this is based on 
<br/>observations as former Minister for Disaster. We have very good systems and processes, but there 
<br/>are still those that do work behind  the regulations that are  set, and this is particularly  concerning 
<br/>municipalities outside Suva. There were a lot of projects undertaken without meeting the minimum 
<br/>standards.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You have talked about thorough checking and monitoring.  How is capacity in the smaller 
<br/>Councils and what is the Ministry going to do to address such issues, particularly in the absence of 
<br/>monitoring such projects, whether its Clerk of Works, because this is an issue, honourable Minister, 
<br/>and I wish to bring it to your attention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question raised by the honourable Leader of 
<br/>the  Opposition  is  really  a  very  good  one  because  it  is  something  that  is  also  experienced  at  the 
<br/>municipal level in terms of monitoring some of the developments and some of the projects that are 
<br/>happening at the local government level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For some of the Councils, they have also Town Planners and Engineers that do go around and 
<br/></span><span>monitor the projects that they have at the local government level. We are also going to improve our 
<br/>monitoring  system  whereby  we  are  also  going  to  have  officers  stationed  in  places  and  assist  the 
<br/>various municipalities in some of the projects that they monitor.  Projects are also being monitored 
<br/>at our level as well as those that are at the municipality level.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Now, we are at the situation whereby for the purpose of complying with 
<br/>the  Standing  Orders  with  respect  to  sitting  times,  I  now    call  upon  the  Leader  of  Government  in 
<br/>Parliament to move a suspension motion.
