<div><span>CONSOLIDATED REVIEW REPORT - MINISTRY OF WOMEN,  
<br/>CHILDREN AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION 2019-2021 ANNUAL REPORTS  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That  Parliament  debates  the  Consolidated  Review  Report  on  the  Ministry  of 
<br/>Women,  Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  2019-2020  and  2020-2021  Annual  Reports 
<br/>which was tabled on 1</span><span>st</span><span> October, 2024.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty 
<br/>Alleviation is a Government Ministry in Fiji responsible for overseeing the well-being of women, 
<br/>children, elderly  and the disabled in  Fiji.    For the period under review, the Ministry encountered 
<br/>significant  challenges  confronted  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  it  maintained  the  services 
<br/>provided to older people and those vulnerable were met during the pandemic.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee, in its deliberations, identified other important matters:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the increasing number of street kids and the Ministry’s challenges in combating the issue 
<br/>due to budget constraints and lack of rehabilitation centres; 
<br/>some existing policies were outdated and required updates to meet the changing needs of 
<br/>recipients; and 
<br/>the  REACH  Programme  was  found  to  be  valuable  as  multi-stakeholders  can  take  their 
<br/>services to the underprivileged in most remote and maritime areas. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Sir,  the  Committee  recommends  that  the  Ministry,  in  its  effort,  during  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>pandemic ensured that the vulnerable were well cared for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/>have a list that had been agreed to by the Whips and reminding that each speaker is accorded with  
<br/>10 minutes only in their intervention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a number of issues have been raised in this Report and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>commend the Committee for coming up with some very realistic recommendations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, one such issue is the increasing number of street kids and the challenges faced by the 
<br/>Ministry in combating this.  In 2023, data on child neglect, physical and sexual abuse was released 
<br/>last  month.  According  to  the  honourable  Minister  for  Women,  Children  and  Social  Protection,50 
<br/>percent of child neglect, physical and sexual abuses were immediate family members and 73 percent 
<br/>of the perpetrators of child neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse in 2023 were known to the child 
<br/>victims.  This  is  very  shocking.    Our  young  generation  must  be  provided  with  a  safe  and  secure 
<br/>environment for the well-being and healthy growth.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women,  
<br/>Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In all these, education is very important and must be pursued with vigour.  Family values, 
<br/>systems to be enhanced through spirituality and religious classes in schools and counselling services 
<br/>to be re-introduced in all schools for pronged action. We have huge challenges ahead of us and our 
<br/>concerted effort is needed, if we are to save our children from the unfolding chaos.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, more Fijian children are being caught in criminal activities. In the past five 
<br/>years, Police recorded an alarming 503 cases where juveniles were sexual offenders and out of the 
<br/>503  cases,  206  were  rapes.    The  Fiji  Police  Force  is  concerned  over  the  shifting  of  age  criminal 
<br/>responsibility  from  10  to  14  years.  While  the  shift  in  criminal  age  group  has  been  happening 
<br/>internationally, it has implications on the Fiji Police Force and the safety of the people of Fiji. While 
<br/>advocates also shift to the need for a more human approach to juvenile justice, it colludes the potential 
<br/>and adverse effect on policy, on operation and investigation of prosecutions, community safety and 
<br/>juvenile accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  would  an  increased  risk  of  serious  offences,  resulting  in  a  lack  of 
<br/>accountability for children from the ages of 10 years to 13 years, allowing them to engage in serious 
<br/>offences without facing immediate legal consequences, allowing them to be more fearless.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of public safety, a constructive deterrent is essential to prevent ongoing criminality 
<br/>among young Fijian offenders.  By raising the age of criminal responsibility, we risk disempowering 
<br/>families and communities that play vital roles in rearing children towards fair choices and fostering 
<br/>positive  behaviour.    Collaboration  between  families,  the  </span><span>vanua</span><span>,  Government  and  stakeholders  is 
<br/>needed to safeguard Fijian children.  Any change must have accountability and rehabilitation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another issue raised in the Report is the relocation of the Lautoka Golden 
<br/>Age Home due to structural concerns, with a new site identified for the residents while their current 
<br/>home is being rebuilt.  The Committee noted that the site identified is not suitable for the relocation 
<br/>of our elderly citizens as it is too close to the road.  I request the Ministry to take this recommendation 
<br/>seriously and consider the relocation of senior citizens from Natabua Golden Age Home as a matter 
<br/>of urgency, to ensure the residents are in a safer and more conducive environment.  With those words, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to note that these Annual Reports 
<br/>are about five years to six years old, from 2019 to 2021, so in going through the recommendations 
<br/>by the Committee, I will briefly address what the Ministry is doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are two recommendations that relate to street kids that have been raised by honourable 
<br/></span><span>Virendra Lal.  One is to do with working with stakeholders to help assist our street kids, as well as 
<br/>setting up of rehabilitation centres for street kids.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have a question to respond to on Wednesday on the very same issue, so I 
<br/>will  elaborate  more  there.    But  just  for  today,  suffice  to  say  that  in  working  with  Civil  Society 
<br/>Organisations in groups that are interested in rehabilitating street children, we have Inspire Pacific 
<br/>that is working with the Ministry and have just completed a four-week camp with 15 street boys.  
<br/>They are currently undergoing assessment in terms of where to be placed next.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are 13 year olds and 14 year olds, who appropriately would return to school and because 
<br/>some fear of returning home, they are exploring boarding schools instead.  For those who are older, 
<br/>they have income generating courses available to them, like TVET as well as Polytech.  We work 
<br/>with Inspire Pacific as well as the Salvation Army.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="65">Page 65</a></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women,  
<br/>Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2279 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  commend  the  Salvation  Army  for  opening  up  a  centre  for  street  children  in 
<br/>Samabula.  They are working with the Ministry in terms of providing support, as well as the technical 
<br/>support and advice from UNICEF in terms of ensuring that these children receive holistic care so 
<br/>they can be reintegrated back, not just into schools, as well as their own families.  So, the families 
<br/>have been attending these camps as well.  I am talking about fathers, mothers and caregivers, who 
<br/>have an opportunity to reconcile with these boys.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There have been very emotional moments as father and son reunite after the child has left 
<br/>home for various reasons.  Parents are actually also given necessary support to be better parents, and 
<br/>to be able to bring their child who has left the home for some time to return home.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, very quickly on the Child Justice Bill 2024 and Child Care Protection Bill 
<br/>2024 which was recommended to be expedited and tabled in Parliament, yes, it has been 12 years in 
<br/>the making.  Sir, 12 years is too long, so I have been given the assurance by the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Justice Law and Human Rights that these Bills will be tabled this week for debate and, hopefully, 
<br/>passed.  There was unanimous support in the House for these Bills, and we appreciate your support 
<br/>on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Lal has brought up the issue about raising the age of criminal responsibility.  This 
<br/>is in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child but really, the sole or main purpose of it is 
<br/>to divert our children away from the criminal justice system and to be rehabilitated because statistics 
<br/>prove that children who enter the system as juveniles in the criminal justice system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>they return as repeat offenders.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in order to avoid that, we need to intervene when they are younger and know between the 
<br/>ages of 10 years and 13 years, it does not mean that they are excused of the crime, this means that 
<br/>there is a better way to process these children or to handle these children away from the criminal 
<br/>justice system. You will still have some element of retribution, as well as deterrence to other children, 
<br/>so it is not completely absolving them of responsibility, it is just the programme that will help them 
<br/>to understand their choices as well as to rehabilitate not to reoffend in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue about budgetary allocation for the Ministry to be increased for Social Protection 
<br/>Programmes, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance will address that, so I 
<br/>will leave that to him.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, on the relocation of the senior citizens to Golden Age Home in Lautoka and I know 
<br/></span><span>this has been an issue raised over and over again in Parliament.  As I had mentioned earlier about the 
<br/></span><span>falling out or the fact that the agreement with the Methodist Church of Fiji have been reneged on 
<br/>because they would like to use it for other purposes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, we have identified Matanakilagi House with Ba Provincial Holdings.  Now, we have had 
<br/>a  scoping  done  by  Divisional  Engineer  Western  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $350,000  and  that  was 
<br/>allocated in the current budget. However, they have come back to us after the scoping, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>and have stated that increased salaries as well as rise in goods and services, that this will increase 
<br/>exponentially by 70 percent by really a big amount. So, it is closer to $580,000 which is not budgeted 
<br/>for.  So, we went back to the drawing board and negotiated with Ba Provincial Holdings, who have 
<br/>come back to us and are willing to do the renovations themselves at the cost of $254,000 which is 
<br/>within our budget. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment, we have just submitted our waiver to the Ministry of Finance in terms of the 
<br/>application of those funds.  So, hopefully, we will get that approval so we can commence the work 
<br/>from January next year.

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have signed a rental agreement with Ba Holdings from May and they 
<br/>have also agreed to waive the rental from May till we are able to move in.  Once we move in, then 
<br/>they will start charging the rent. So, I want to thank Ba Holdings for their assistance in prioritising 
<br/>our aged citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just wish to end in terms of the REACH Project.  As you 
<br/>know, it was funded by UNDP for the first three years, so UNDP has ended their funding.  So, it is 
<br/>upon Government to fund this project as you know it is the REACH project that usually involves 
<br/>Ministries.  So,  Ministries  would  send  out  their  teams  under  the  REACH  Project  to  reach  the 
<br/>unreachable and take out government services and information on it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because  we  are  a  bit  tight  on  funds  within  the  Ministry,  we  cannot  be  funding  the  entire 
<br/>REACH project, so we are just kindly asking our Ministries who wish to participate, our staff would 
<br/>do the logistics and arrangements but if Ministries could, please, fund your own staff who joined us 
<br/>on the REACH projects so you can take your services out too, to this very effective project that  has 
<br/>reached out to many, many parts of Fiji that are unreachable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the Report of the Committee, and I thank them 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for their hard work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first and foremost, I am congratulating you on your 
<br/>appointment as the Speaker of this august Chambers.  May Lord continue to guide your intellect in 
<br/>presiding over the legislative matters of the State. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  today,  I  rise  to  elaborate  on  the  Review  Report  of  Ministry  of  Women, 
<br/>Children  and  Poverty  Alleviation  for  the  years  2019–2020  and  2020–2021.    This  review  was 
<br/>undertaken  by  the  Standing  Committee  on  Social  Affairs  into  the  efforts  and  challenges  of  the 
<br/>Ministry during those years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the COVID-19 pandemic brought with it unpresented challenges that largely 
<br/>impacted  the  operations  of  this  Ministry.   In  spite  of  these  challenges,  the  Ministry  proved  to  be 
<br/>resilient  in  its  own  operations  by  adapting  its  services  to  assist  people  in  lockdown  areas.    This 
<br/>adaptability is testimony to the Ministry’s commitment towards the service of our most vulnerable 
<br/>citizens.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Among the gripping  concerns which have been reported is the issue about street  children.  
<br/></span><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increasing  number of street  children is  alarming.  The Ministry has  tried to 
<br/></span><span>reintegrate these children into their families, but most of them resist going back home because they 
<br/>are not loved and supported at home.  This situation calls for a comprehensive approach to address 
<br/>the root causes of homelessness amongst children.  We must explore strategies that provide these 
<br/>children with the necessary care and support. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Budgetary  constraints  have,  over  the  years,  been  a  major  challenge  to  the  Ministry  in  the 
<br/>provision of essential services and rehabilitation centres.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recommendation by 
<br/>the Committee to  increase the budgetary allocation to  Social Protection is  quite important.   With 
<br/>more money, the Ministry can do more in rehabilitation and care for the vulnerable group.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Report also highlights the under-utilisation of grant-in-aid allocation to institutions and 
<br/>NGOs dealing with the disabilities.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, this calls for deeper understanding as to why 
<br/>the resources are not being fully utilised and developing ways on how these grants are allocated and 
<br/>used effectively.  Our Social Protection Programmes depend greatly on effective utilisation of such 
<br/>grants. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Women,  
<br/>Children &amp; Poverty Alleviation 2019-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2281 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, another critical issue is the shifting of the Lautoka Golden Age Home for 
<br/>structural reasons.  The safety of the proposed new site for the elderly has been questioned because 
<br/>of its proximity to the road.  Again, careful planning and community consultation provide the key to 
<br/>identifying suitable sites for such facilities.  How can we ensure our facility planning is designed to 
<br/>first protect our elderly citizens?  The Ministry’s partnership with stakeholders, such as the Methodist 
<br/>Church and the Salvation Army, in providing centre for street children is very commendable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, collaboration with various stakeholders is necessary to pull resources and 
<br/>expertise in the quest to address social issues.  In fact, our stakeholders have been very instrumental 
<br/>in the successful implementation of our social programmes. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  REACH  Programme  which  is  involved  in  the  delivery  of  services  to  rural  and  urban 
<br/>communities, has been quite a success.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Committee strongly recommends the 
<br/>continuation of this programme, that is, because sustainability is one of the key areas where such 
<br/>programs assure the same service provision to people for a long period of time.  On what basis can 
<br/>we be sure of the success of the REACH Programme for further replication? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry’s  effort  to  address  discrepancies  in  the  Social  Protection 
<br/></span><span>Programme and improved financial management are steps in the right direction.  The engagement 
<br/>with DFAT to update existing policies and SOPs will further enhance the Ministry’s capacity to serve 
<br/>our communities effectively. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, while there are many areas that need to be addressed, I believe this report 
<br/>is a step in the right direction.  The recommendations provided by the community, part of which is 
<br/>now being implemented, will significantly improve the Ministry’s ability to support vulnerable co-
<br/>operations and address pressing issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I fully support this Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  N.T.  TUINACEVA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly,  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Standing Committee on Social Affairs, Mr. Chairman and his Team, for the Report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand before you today with a deep sense of concern and urgency regarding 
<br/>a matter that should weigh heavily on all of us, our children.  The 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 Annual 
<br/>Reports from the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation paint a troubling picture of 
<br/>the increasing number of children living in dire circumstances, particularly those living on the streets 
<br/></span><span>of our capital city - Suva. This is a crisis that we cannot ignore, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Children as we all know are the future of this nation, but they are also its most vulnerable 
<br/>members.  As a society, we are entrusted with this protection and well-being, and the fact that so 
<br/>many  children  are  now  living  on  the  streets,  exposed  to  harsh  elements  and  are  vulnerable  to 
<br/>exploitation, is a clear indicator of our failure to uphold that responsibility.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some have suggested that these children choose to live on the streets.  This 
<br/>claim,  however,  is  not  only  over  simplified  but  dangerously  dismissive  of  the  true  nature  of  the 
<br/>circumstances. How can we, as a nation, justify such a careless view?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Children, some as young as 10 years old, do not have the maturity or urgency to make the 
<br/>decision to live in such extreme conditions.  Reality is that these children are on the streets because 
<br/>they have no other option.  They are there because the system  designed to  protect  them or Child 
<br/>Welfare Programme, our social safety nets are failing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="68">Page 68</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us be clear, Mr. Speaker, Sir, no child willingly choose a life of hardship and suffering.  
<br/>These children are there because they are escaping neglect, abuse or the overwhelming poverty of 
<br/>their  homes.    They  are  seeking  survival  not  freedom.  The  question  we  must  ask  ourselves  is  not 
<br/>whether these children have chosen this life but why are they in this position at all?  Why are so many 
<br/>children in our country forced to live on the streets?  Is it poverty? Is it family breakdown? Is it abuse 
<br/>or neglect? Perhaps, it is  all  these factors combined. Whatever the reasons, the truth is  that these 
<br/>children  should  have  never  been  allowed  to  fall  through  the  cracks  in  the  first  place.  This  is  a 
<br/>collective failure, one that demands for an immediate action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is not enough to merely acknowledge this crisis. We must take action, and 
<br/>we must ask ourselves, what can we do to support these children and restore them a sense of safety, 
<br/>dignity and hope for a better future?  In my view, the system is reactive not proactive. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While the Ministry is working hard to address these issues, there is a lack of coordinated, 
<br/>comprehensive efforts to address the root cause of why children are ending up on the streets in the 
<br/>first place.  We must move beyond temporary fixtures and build long-term solutions. The question 
<br/>that we must now ask is not just what are we doing for these children but what more can we do?  
<br/></span><span>Have we explored all the possible avenues to protect and support these children?  Are there alternative 
<br/></span><span>systems, structures and programmes we can create to intervene before these children are forced to 
<br/>flee their homes and take to the streets? Can we strengthen our child protection mechanism to ensure 
<br/>that no child is left behind, regardless of their family circumstances? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are not just theoretical questions, they are a call to action. We must 
<br/>do more,  we must do it  now. Some may say that  the solution  is  simple, that we should  focus on 
<br/>reuniting these children with their families. However, you must acknowledge that this is not always 
<br/>a viable or safe solution. Many of these children are escaping environments, where they face violence, 
<br/>neglect or abuse. For some, returning to their families would put them at a greater risk. Therefore, 
<br/>we must explore alternatives options such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Safe home or shelters where children can receive care, education and emotional support 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>while we work to reunite them with their families when it is safe and possible. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>The  Mental  Health  Services  and  Counselling.  These  children  often  dealing  with  deep 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>trauma, anxiety and depression.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Vocational Training Programmes and mentorship that offer children a sense of purpose 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and direction, helping them to build a future beyond the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  we  need  to  strengthen  our  partnership  with  local  communities,  civil  society 
<br/></span><span>organisations and international partners. This is not just a government issue, it is a societal issue. It 
<br/>requires collective effort of all sectors to address and resolve.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we look at the rising number of children living on the streets, we cannot 
<br/>afford to close our eyes to their suffering. We cannot simply blame them for their circumstances. We 
<br/>must  act  now  to  restore  their  sense  of  belonging  and  purpose.  These  children  deserve  more  than 
<br/>survival, they deserve the opportunity to thrive. Until we explore every avenue, solution, option, we 
<br/>carry  a  dark  stain  on  our  national  concerns.  These  children  are  the  adults  of  tomorrow,  and  the 
<br/>question we must ask ourselves is, what kind of future do you want to build for them? Do we want 
<br/>to continue allowing them to suffer or do we want to ensure that they grow into healthy, educated 
<br/>and productive members of society. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the time to act is now. We must come together as a nation to protect our 
<br/>children  and  we  must  show  them  that  they  matter,  they  are  not  forgotten  and  that  we  will  do 
<br/>everything in our power to ensure they have the opportunity to live a life free from suffering. It is my

<div><span>2283 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>prayer that all Members of this august Parliament, as legislators will work together with Government 
<br/>to find solutions to these street dwelling problems involving our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude I was doing some research on this subject and I found out there 
<br/>are  nations  who  have  successfully  addressed  these  children  street  problem  through  their  early 
<br/>detection policies. Perhaps, we can seek assistance and learn from their experience. Fiji’s situation, 
<br/>we  have  a  small  population.  We  have  good  founding  structures,  the  </span><span>vanua,  lotu,  matavuvale, 
<br/>veiwekani</span><span>  and  Government  in  tacking  these  street  dwelling  issues  for  our  children  should  not  be 
<br/>difficult. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with all those being said, I support the motion before Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Members, for their 
<br/>contribution and I also thank the Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection for providing 
<br/>details on the programmes that the Ministry is undertaking.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that we did immediately when we came into Government 
<br/></span><span>was to recognise that in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 coming out of the COVID crises, that people 
<br/></span><span>were still making the transition, that there were losses in income, welfare and many things happened 
<br/>during COVID, movement of people and in some cases things changed permanently for families, 
<br/>those who were part of those families. So, the Government recognised, in the first budget, we actually 
<br/>increased the Department of Social Welfare’s budget by about 24 percent.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also recognised that families, particularly those who were falling through the cracks, those 
<br/>who  were  vulnerable,  we  increased  the  social  welfare  allowances  by  15  to  25  percent  across  the 
<br/>board, 25 percent particularly for those over 70 years.  We recognised that this support was needed, 
<br/>and we have obviously kept that allocation and a little bit more in the current budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I must commend the Department of Social Welfare because there was also a lot of haphazard 
<br/>applications of some of the good polices, therefore, the effectiveness of some of those programmes 
<br/>were  not  as  good  as  they  ought  to  have  been.  So,  rationalisation  of  some  of  those  programmes, 
<br/>particularly social welfare programmes and making sure that people who get out of the trap and are 
<br/>actually moved into more employment. So, the Government has used multi-pronged approach, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, to ensure that families do not fall through those cracks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart  from  increasing  direct  support  in  terms  of  social  welfare,  as  we  said,  we  included 
<br/></span><span>income support in the education sector, in the agriculture sector, and subsidies to farmers beyond the 
<br/></span><span>sugar cane. All these, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the last two years and in the last two budgets was designed 
<br/>to improve the income position for the families, particularly those who were vulnerable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of the recommendations and the observations made, particularly number four, we 
<br/>had allocated in the 2024-2025 Budget, a budget of about $569,900, of which $344,900 caters for the 
<br/>renovation of the temporary Lautoka Age Care Home to ensure that it is suitable to relocate. I know 
<br/>the honourable Minister has already talked about the difficulties that were there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  number  five,  retention  policy  for  staff  and  all  vacant  positions  to  be  filled  as  soon  as 
<br/>possible, again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the 2024-2025 Budget, there is a costed operational plan. The 
<br/>target  to  fill  50  substantive  vacant  positions  in  the  current  2024-2025  financial  year.  I  know  the 
<br/>Ministry has put in place a recruitment plan and that obviously will go a long way to help.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A sum of $9.1 million, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has been allocated in the 2024-2025 Budget to cater 
<br/>for the salaries and wages of the approved 303 established staff and 132 GWE officers. Mr. Speaker,

<div><span> Consolidated Review Report – Ministry of Health and  
<br/>Medical Services 2016-2021 Annual Reports 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, in terms of strengthening the Ministry’s capacity and the ability to deliver on some of the good 
<br/>programmes that have been undertaken, we have obviously provided additional funding.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of support for women NGOs and opening up assistance to other women’s groups 
<br/>and institutions, we have done that. In the 2023-2024 Budget, $500,000 was allocated as a grant to 
<br/>women’s institutions.  A total of four institutions were the recipients of the grant amounting to about 
<br/>$100,000 per recipient. Again, we have allocated funding for 2024-2025 as well, under stakeholders 
<br/>to build rehabilitation. I know honourable Naisa was absolutely correct when he was talking about 
<br/>our kids and the children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I know the honourable Minister has talked about this in the past, for the first 
<br/>time we have a Department of Children now established within the Ministry. That, I think is going 
<br/>to go a long way in terms of providing a focus with the budget to deal with the issue of our street 
<br/>kids and some of the difficulties that we have.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the issue of working with the stakeholders to build a rehabilitation centre for street kids, 
<br/>again, in the 2024-2025 Budget, the Ministry has been allocated funding of $230,000 that is to cater 
<br/></span><span>for the renovation of the Vunirewa facility to establish the rehabilitation centre, and this centre will 
<br/></span><span>allow children and youth who are living on the streets into an institution where they will be given the 
<br/>opportunity to re-socialise and undergo rehabilitation processes.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the last Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, recognising the importance of drug rehabilitation centres, 
<br/>we  have  included  an  incentive  package  which  includes  tax  holidays,  duty  concessions  and  100 
<br/>percent tax deductions for donations to rehabilitation centres. That we hope, and Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>we will obviously look at the success or otherwise of that incentive, and whether that has helped 
<br/>build  more  rehabilitation  centres,  we  will  obviously  be  considering  budgetary  provisions  for  that 
<br/>particular and specific purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government has recognised, and as I have said quite clearly, the 
<br/>transition that happened after COVID and the difficulty that we realised existed. We have not only 
<br/>focussed on the Social Welfare Ministry but there are many other Ministries, many other allocations 
<br/>which  also  support  different  activities,  you  know,  whether  it  has  to  do  with  small  to  medium 
<br/>enterprises, grants from the Ministry of Trade and Commerce, whether it is to increase the minimum 
<br/>wage which we have now done to $4.50 and it will be $5.00 from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April. Those are significant 
<br/>steps, Sir, to support and build income for families and of course, you know, children included as 
<br/>part of those families.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, once again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Standing Committee for recognising and 
<br/>putting out these recommendations and also the Ministry for Women, Children and Social Protection 
<br/>for undertaking some of the policy interventions as provided for in the budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- With that intervention, we have now exhausted our list of speakers and I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>will now call upon the Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Social Affairs to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.S. VANAWALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we would like to thank all honourable Members 
<br/>for  the  constructive  deliberations  on  these  Reports.  As  from  the  Standing  Committee,  upon

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>as possible.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to open up a system to other women institutions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>The Ministry to work closely with stakeholders to build a rehabilitation centre for street 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>kids.
