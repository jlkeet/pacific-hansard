<h3>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the - 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Presidential  Pensions  (Amendment)  Bill  2024  (Bill  No.  20/2024),  be  considered  by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament; 
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  not  be  referred  to  a  Standing  Committee  or  any  other  Committee  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament on Thursday, 5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/>and that one hour be given to debate the Bill with the Right of Reply given to me as the 
<br/>Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.L.  RABUKA.-  Mr.  Speaker  Sir,  pursuant  to  Standing  Order  51,  I  move  that  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 be now debated in this sitting of Parliament.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  This  Bill,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  needs  to  be  put  to  debate  now  as  there  has  been  sufficient 
<br/>discussions  on  the  same  with  other  Ministers.    The  Presidential  Pensions  Act  1994  provides  the 
<br/>legislative framework for the pension of the former Governor Generals and Presidents of Fiji. This 
<br/>law was enacted during the term the SVT-GVP Coalition Government which I led from 1992 to 1999. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The provisions allow for the payment of pension as well as other benefits as follows:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Provision for the installation, connection, maintenance and rental of a telephone in any 
<br/>private  residence  of  his  or  hers,  and  to  meet  all  charges  in  respect  of  local  calls 
<br/>originating from such telephone.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Provision of a Ministerial-type vehicle and a driver, including free-travel on scheduled trips 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of government ships.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Medical treatment, hospitalisation, drugs and all other hospital services locally, provided 
<br/>that where local specialised treatment and medical treatment overseas including the cost of 
<br/>treatment, accommodation and air travel necessary, such expenditure may be incurred 
<br/>at the discretion of the Prime Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The provision of an annual budgetary allocation of an amount of $30,0000 per annum and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>subject  
<br/>to periodic adjustments, to enable the person in receipt of the pension, to hire personal 
<br/>staff as required.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>Provision of security protection at the discretion of the Prime Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To be eligible for additional benefits, Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the current law, as it stands, a 
<br/>President  must  have  completed  five  years  of  service.    This  term  in  Office  in  the  Act  should  be 
<br/>consistent with the provisions of the term of Office in the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Constitutions  prior  to  the  2013  Constitution  provided  for  a  five-year  term  in  office  for 
<br/>President and Head of State.  This was reduced to three years in the 2013 Constitution, but the Act 
<br/>remained unchanged.  In fairness to Presidents who serve only three-year term in office, which is a 
<br/>complete  term,  it  is  important  to  amend  section  8(1)  of  the  Act  to  make  it  consistent  with  the 
<br/>Constitutional provisions and to allow the incumbent to be eligible for all benefits provided for in the 
<br/>Act.

<div><span>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Truth and Reconciliation Commission Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2263 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I accordingly move that this Bill be now progressed further to debate, pursuant to Standing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Order 51. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Honourable  Members,  the  floor  is  now  open  for  debate  on  the  motion, 
<br/>specifically on the provisions that had been cited.  At the end of the debate, we would have the Right 
<br/>of Reply from the mover.  Honourable Members are reminded that you are allowed a time limit of 
<br/>only 20 minutes.    Are there anyone who wishes to intervene? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the motion that is before the 
<br/>House.  I think it is necessary to go through Standing Order 51 given that it has only one amendment, 
<br/>that  is,  section  8  and  it  is  long  overdue.    Given  that  this  should  have  been  done  by  the  previous 
<br/>government when the 2013 Constitution came into being, this particular Act is to be inconsistent with 
<br/>the Constitution. I do not see in any way that this should be taken to the Committee given that this 
<br/>minor amendment can be debated in the substance on Thursday.  I support the motion that it goes 
<br/>through Standing Order 51 because of this amendment, it only brings it to be consistent with the 2013 
<br/>Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, just a small contribution on the Bill.  We also do not 
<br/>have issues with this Bill being brought under Standing Order 51 as it is a minor amendment which 
<br/>is aligned to the Constitution.  What we are doing is, with regards to the appointment of the President 
<br/>having two terms, then it becomes six years, so it is only appropriate to align the law as required by 
<br/>the Constitution itself. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a small question, once we amend this Bill and it becomes an Act whether it is going to 
<br/>be applied retrospectively because we have a President who has vacated office or is going to be from 
<br/>the day it is to  be gazetted and moving forward.   If we gazette it now, the President  has  already 
<br/>resigned so even though he had served for three years, he will not be eligible if it will not go in  a 
<br/>retrospective manner.  Can we get clarity on that before we vote on the motion, Mr. Speaker? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, the obvious answer to that question and suggestion is 
<br/>yes.    It  applies  to  the  immediate  past  President,  and  it  makes  the  provisions  of  the  Constitution 
<br/>compliant with the Act or the Act complying with the Constitution. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Are there anymore interventions?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there being no other response required at this time, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I commend the motion to the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
