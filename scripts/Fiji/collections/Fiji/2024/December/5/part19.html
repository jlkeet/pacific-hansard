<h3>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>CHILD CARE AND PROTECTION BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on 
<br/>Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 (Bill No. 5/2024), be debated, voted upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  honourable  Members,  The  Child  Care  and 
<br/>Protection Bill embodies our commitment to the well-being of children in Fiji. The Bill commits us 
<br/>to protecting and supporting all Fijian children, but especially those deprived of parental care, and 
<br/>those who cannot remain with their families because of abuse or neglect.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill displays our commitment also to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
<br/>we ratified 30 years ago. Our Ministry in partnership with UNICEF produced the latest 2024 report 
<br/>titled  Economic  Costs  of  Violence  Against  Children  in  Fiji,  and  this  survey  conducted  revealed 
<br/></span><span>shocking statistics, 81 percent of our children, aged 1 to 14 years, experience some form of violent 
<br/></span><span>discipline, 65 percent of our children experience psychological aggression, 68 percent of our children 
<br/>experience some form of physical punishment during this period in their lifetime. This survey also 
<br/>revealed a significant problem, which is called poly victimisation. The exposure of a single child to 
<br/>multiple types of abuse.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  study  revealed  that  the  total  economic  cost  of  violence  against  children  in  Fiji,  is 
<br/>estimated about $460 million which is equivalent to about 4 percent of our GDP annually. This Bill 
<br/>represents  the  Coalition  Government's  response  to  the  shocking  statistics  and  the  urgent  need  to 
<br/>protect and care for our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  National  Development  Plan  aims  to  eliminate  violence  against  children  through 
<br/>responsible  policies  and  coordinated  referral  networks.  The  Bill  replaces  the  outdated  Child 
<br/>Protection Philosophy of Rescue and Removal which is over 50 years old.  This outdated philosophy 
<br/>ignores the importance of children's holistic development within their own family and community. 
<br/>Indeed, it ignores the harm of depriving a child of their broader families nurture and the importance 
<br/>of their community. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  under  the  United  Nations  Committee  which  monitors  the  Child  Rights 
<br/>Convention as pointed out, that the number of residential homes and children coming into residential 
<br/>care in Fiji keeps increasing over the years. Most children find themselves in residential care because 
<br/>they have been neglected or abused by family. They spend very long periods of time in residential 
<br/>care with no love of family or their community. We cannot let this continue. That is why the Child 
<br/>Care and Protection Bill prioritises family preservation and family-based forms of care. It explicitly 
<br/>acknowledges and reinforces the key role of parents, families and communities in raising children 
<br/>and protecting them from harm. It also makes the distinction between a child in need of care and 
<br/>protection and a child in conflict with the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly, under the current child protection laws, the Government can only intervene once 
<br/>a child has been abused, and this is too late. Success only comes when we prevent or intervene early, 
<br/>and this Bill encompasses that prevention including early intervention and response services. Options 
<br/>for voluntary care plans can be negotiated with the child's parents or caregivers where court orders 
<br/>are used as a last resort when agreements cannot be reached. The child, parents, extended family and 
<br/>community leaders can be actively involved with care planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Priorities given to kinship and family-based care. Prevention and early intervention has to be 
<br/>the  new  talk  that  we  walk.  That  is  why  this  Bill  is  revolutionary  and  it  is  transformative  change 
<br/>because we do need to prevent and intervene early before it is too late. This will be the key to breaking 
<br/>the cycles of abuse that are being inflicted upon about 80 percent of our children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On that note, Mr. Speaker, I commend the Bill before the House, and I seek the support of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Members.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I have a list of speakers with me, honourable Members.  The floor is now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>open.  There are six speakers with six minutes each.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk on this 
<br/>particular Bill. I think over here in this House, for a long time now, we have been talking about the 
<br/>social ills that impact our country. When we talk about it, at the end of the day, the solution that we 
<br/>always come back to is the family.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the heart of that family is children. That is why this is important. I think if we are able to 
<br/></span><span>do what this Bill wants us to do, is we are to have an impact on all the other problems that we are 
<br/>talking about. If we are talking about drugs and all of those things, it comes back to this, to being 
<br/>able to look after children, to be able to care and protect for them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the title of the Bill, it talks about providing for welfare and providing protection 
<br/>for children. I think this is fundamental. The crux of this Bill is to be able to do these two things. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="76">Page 76</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2561 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One, to provide for that protection, to provide for that welfare.  Secondly, to promote it, to make sure 
<br/>that  it  becomes  instilled  in  the  minds  of  everyone  about  the  importance  of  this.  To  promote  the 
<br/>welfare and to promote the protection of children as something that is important for us.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The way that I see it, children are actually our future. If our children do well in strong families 
<br/>and if they do not have care and protection that allows them to become the kind of people that they 
<br/>are supposed to be, this Bill helps us to get there.  It establishes a department for children that tries 
<br/>to make sure that children get the future that they deserve, and when children get the future that they 
<br/>deserve, that means the future of our country is in better hands. I look at that Bill, this is precisely 
<br/>what it is talking about because the breakdown of the family is the root of most our problems.  When 
<br/>there are problems in families, as we will see, later on we will talk about the responsibility of parents, 
<br/>which is part of Clause 7 of this Bill is very important.  It will be able to address that particular issue.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just looking at some of the Clauses that we have in this Bill, I will just look 
<br/>at some of the big motherhood things that we have in this Bill.  It talks about the objectives of the 
<br/>Bill to promote the wellbeing of children, promote them and protect them.  That is basically what we 
<br/>are talking  about  here. This  Bill  acknowledges that this is  something that cannot  just be done by 
<br/>schools or just the department or just a family or just a church. There is a role for everyone.  I think 
<br/>at the end of the day, one of the messages that has come through this is Part 4 and Part A - the role 
<br/>of  parents,  families,  communities,  children,  government  agencies,  non-government  agencies,  the 
<br/>importance of collaboration with that ultimate aim of making sure we can care and look after the 
<br/>children.    Providing  for  the  care  and  protection  of  children  in  circumstances  where  their  parents, 
<br/>families and communities are unable to do so.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the past, in our communities when children did not have that care and protection, we had 
<br/>extended families that could help. But where we are going through these flux in Fiji where that level 
<br/>of social support has begun to deteriorate, eroded over time.  I think this mechanism is kicking-in at 
<br/>a time as we are going through these flux between extended families to nuclear families, we have 
<br/>this message that comes in, these mechanisms that we have here that allow us to make sure that we 
<br/>can care and protect the children.  Who is this Bill for? It is for all the children that are not getting 
<br/>the care and protection that they need.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under Clause 5, it lists them all; children who are orphaned, abandoned and also where the 
<br/>parents of the children are unable to care for that child and unwilling, the child lives or works on the 
<br/>street in circumstances that expose them to exploitation. This is a major problem.  When you talk to 
<br/>the people at the Department of Children, they talk about parents who are unwilling. I think there is 
<br/>a crisis there in terms of values or the responsibility that we have in this in this country for the children 
<br/>that we have. Children have been displaced or separated from their family, the physical development 
<br/>of the health of the child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Wherever we went around Fiji, you know what people said we need to do?  </span><span>Kana kuita</span><span>!  This 
<br/>is the solution that people think about.  I believe that the problem that that mentality comes from is 
<br/>the failure for us to deliver what we have in Clause 7.  Clause 7 talks about responsibility of parents 
<br/>and this is where the emphasis has to be.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A parent has the primary role of the safeguarding (keeping them safe), and promoting the 
<br/></span><span>well-being of the child, registering the birth of the child. So many people are not even registered.  
<br/>When you are not registered, you are not a legal entity. You do not have access to all the things that 
<br/>you need to get. All of these responsibilities - child's basic needs are met, receives adequate nutrition, 
<br/>children must have enough food. Why do they steal? Maybe because they are not getting food, maybe 
<br/>they are not getting that emotional support.  We have to be able to make sure that the parents can do 
<br/>this.

<div><span> Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child receives appropriate medical care, child’s access to basic education and further study, 
<br/>child  to  participate  in  social  and  cultural  activities.  It  is  important  that  parents  inculcate  social 
<br/>cohesion  and the culture  of the  parents  into the children. A lot of us today, some of our children 
<br/>cannot speak their own languages. They have forgotten about </span><span>tilou</span><span> and all of these things, have gone 
<br/>out of the door.  Instil self-discipline, tolerance and respect. These are the kinds of things, we have 
<br/>talked social cohesion the other day, this is where it starts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have only got only 16 seconds.  I believe that this Bill is very important 
<br/>for  us.  We  need  and  it  requires  a  paradigm  shift  on  how  we  look  at  children.    I  call  upon  the 
<br/>honourable Minister for Finance, there will be a need to do a lot of training; people will need to be 
<br/>trained, the staff in the Ministry, the Police, et cetera.  There will need be resources thrown at this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This thing will not work unless it is operationalised by training, translating the legislation and 
<br/>making sure there is enough resources to make it work. If we do not get the resources behind this 
<br/>Bill, it is not going to happen and I call upon the Government to make sure the resources are put in 
<br/>place over a phase sort of approach to make this happen for the future of our children, for the future 
<br/>of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, I rise to make my contribution to 
<br/>the Bill that is before the House.   I would just like to continue from where honourable Usamate has 
<br/>left off, and that is rightfully so the responsibility of parents, which is highlighted in Clause 7. I, for 
<br/>one, when we were go on consultations.  I usually said during our consultations, this is one of the 
<br/>Bills that Government should not have created in the first place.  This is the negligence of parents 
<br/>that Government has seen that it intends to come and create this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we were at consultations, those were my words.  This is the negligence of parents that 
<br/>government has seen, they are not doing their responsibility, that they are keen to develop this Bill. 
<br/>I am thankful to the previous government for coming up with a Bill and to the current Minister for 
<br/>putting the Bill to Parliament. There are few sections that are in the Bill that I would like to touch on 
<br/>that are very important, especially one responsibility of the parents and this is one, that is the most 
<br/>important in my opinion of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill entails basically what the heading is - Care and Protection. It also introduces new 
<br/>offences, the offences that will intend to amend Crimes Act 2009. There are some new offences that 
<br/>have been created because of changing times and what have children been doing, things like luring 
<br/>sexual communication of children, all these are new offences which intend to amend the Crimes Act.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  lot  of  the  things  that  are  in  this  Bill  are  basically  straightforward  and  the  reporting  of 
<br/>children, mandatory report as highlighted in this Bill are some of the suggestions that came during 
<br/>our  consultation to also have church leaders inside, to also have the </span><span>turaga ni koro. </span><span> Those were 
<br/>some suggestions during our public consultation. But there was also the risk that, if those were the 
<br/>people that would be the mandatory reporters, even they would be the ones who are committing the 
<br/>offences against children. There was a big risk there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, with consultation with the Ministry, we remained with what they have had in what is in 
<br/></span><span>the Bill. The Bill also protects all these mediatory reporters, there is the notion,  especially in our 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span> culture. If there seems to be something that is going on in our village setting, we tend to bury 
<br/>it, we tend to keep it. If we take it up to the </span><span>turaga ni koro, </span><span>he will just say, “let us just solve it there.” 
<br/>What we intend to do with this Bill is that introduce mandatory reporter, in cases of children that all 
<br/>these must need to be reported, given the seriousness of the offences that are coming in with regards 
<br/>to  children,  if  you  can  see  the  proposed  penalties,  these  are  some  of  the  suggestions  that  the 
<br/>Committee proposed – more serious penalties because of the risk of the children.

<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2563 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, my last contributor, I tend to remind everyone again, and to those who 
<br/>are watching, and I urge, the introduction of this Bill is solely based on the negligence of parents. It 
<br/>should not have been coming in as a Bill, but this has something that Government is fully concerned, 
<br/>given the number of children who are wandering our streets who have lost love, who have lost that 
<br/>protection, so  the Government has stepped in.   This is my opinion, Mr. Speaker.  This is a very 
<br/>important and urgent Bill and I thank the honourable Minister for bringing this Bill and I support it.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. RAVUNAWA.- Mr. Speaker,  the esteemed Prime Minister, honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime  Minister,  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  respected  Members  of  this  revered 
<br/>Parliament.  I rise this evening to lend my voice and strong support to the Child Care and Protection 
<br/>Bill 2024.  As we consider this Bill, let us be reminded of two roles that we share in agreement as 
<br/>lawmakers and guardians of our future which is our children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  heart  of  any  nation  lies  in  the  well-being  of  its  children.    In  their  eyes  we  see  hope, 
<br/>ambition and the future of our great country. It is our duty as lawmakers to invest in the safeguard of 
<br/>their  future.  Clause  4  of  the  Bill  stipulates  the  objective  of  this  Bill,  and  its  core  objective 
<br/>acknowledges the absolute right of our children, rights to protection, rights to normal childhood, the 
<br/>sense of being loved, cared for and fundamentally the right to life.  It accentuates the responsibility 
<br/>of families, communities, government agencies, non-government entities to not just protect the right 
<br/>of our children, but to promote their overall well-being, providing them with a nurturing environment 
<br/>for their growth and development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is our ethical  response ability to  ensure that every child is  carefree of 
<br/>violence, free of abuse, neglect and exploitation.  To this point, the Bill outlines clear circumstances 
<br/>in Clause 5, under which a child is considered to be in need of care and protection.  To encompass a 
<br/>breath  of  situation,  be  it  a  child  who  has  been  an  orphan  or  displaced,  who  lives  or  work  under 
<br/>harmful conditions, or who is being neglected or abused or exploited, this Bill ensures that no child 
<br/>is left vulnerable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I request all honourable Members of Parliament to come together and support the Bill with 
<br/>an unfeared voice. These children depend on us and we must not let them down.  We are making a 
<br/>solemn  pledge to  protect our children, confirming our commitment to  shape a brighter, safer and 
<br/>more promising future for our country. This Bill is not just of great importance to our children, but it 
<br/>is also central to the makeup of our society.  It will defend us as a country that nurtures its future 
<br/>generation with kindness, respect and dignity.  Let us remember that every child in need is a call for 
<br/>us to respond, a test of our humanity and a reflection of our values.  We owe them our best effort, 
<br/>our kindness and our care. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As we discuss and debate the details of this Bill, let us remember to put our children first, for 
<br/>they are not just a beneficiary of this Bill, but also the promise of a better tomorrow.  Biblically, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we are reminded of our critical responsibility, drawing from the </span><span>Bible</span><span> thoughts, each 
<br/>child is a divine gift to a family, an arrow in the hands of society.  From Genesis to Revelation in the 
<br/>Bible  underscore  the  irreplaceable  worth  of  children  and  nurturing  their  protection  and  careful 
<br/>development.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 19:14, said and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Let the little children come to me. Do not hinder them for the Kingdom of Heaven 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>belong to such as this.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Christ thoroughly cautioned against action that harm little children and lead them astray.

<div><span> Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Matthew 18:6 states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Anyone causes this little one to stumble, it would be better for them to have a 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In supporting this Bill, we reflect Christ’s advocacy for every child.  Honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament, let us not forget we serve a nation.  A range of individuals and families are depending 
<br/>on us, expecting us to safeguard their precious ones.  Therefore, it is directly upon our shoulders to 
<br/>ensure this Child Care and Protection Bill is more than just words on paper.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The spirit of this critical Bill must become our living reality in every home, every school, 
<br/>every online platform, every province, every </span><span>tikina</span><span>, every village, every settlement and everywhere 
<br/>our children thrive.  The Bill represents a beacon, guiding us to uphold the sanctity of childhood and 
<br/>care and to create a society where no child stands at risk.  The Bill calls to furnish a safe haven where 
<br/>our children's dream bloom, their abilities are nurtured, their potential are fully realised and their 
<br/>innocence fiercely protected. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tonight, we have a golden opportunity to affirm our nation’s ethics and societal values.  By 
<br/>supporting this Bill, we affirm our commitment to comply with the divine mandate of embracing the 
<br/>invaluable worth of our children.  This Bill resonates the </span><span>Bible</span><span> mandate of protecting the innocent 
<br/>and the vulnerable.  It is a testament to our belief, our faith, our culture and our future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I conclude, I want to reiterate, it is our sacred duty to support this Bill tonight. I urge each 
<br/>respected Member of this House, irrespective of your political affiliation, stand by our children and 
<br/>by the future of our nation, let us unite and ensure Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is passed and 
<br/>adequately implemented. Our future depends on our action today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for this opportunity to contribute to the debate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank you for the opportunity to contribute to the 
<br/>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024.  This is an important Bill because it is about children who are 
<br/>the future of our country.  Children are our most valuable resource.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have two Bills this week which are child related. I see these Bills as very 
<br/>important and urgent in nature, since it is dealing with our children. Bills of this nature should be 
<br/>prioritised by Government because children are our topmost priority.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few other Bills which were not that urgent but was passed under 
<br/>Standing Order 51 recently, whereas this very important Bill which relates to children took months 
<br/>to be passed in this House. I am glad that this Bill was scrutinised by the Committee.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the Bill for the following reasons. Firstly, I have carefully looked 
<br/>at  the  content  of  the  Bill  and  I  can  say  that  the  Bill  has  been  well  scrutinised  by  the  Standing 
<br/>Committee, and I thank them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, secondly, our children need protection from abuse, violence and neglect. 
<br/></span><span>Parents,  families  and  communities  play  a  very  important  role  in  protecting  children  and  this  Bill 
<br/>caters for that. Parents have the primary role of safeguarding and promoting the wellbeing of his or 
<br/>her child, to  ensure that  the child's basic needs are met, including  any special needs  relating  to  a 
<br/>disability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other very important responsibility of parents is to protect the child from engaging in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="80">Page 80</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2565 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>activities that are harmful to his or her health, education and moral development.   The  Bill 
<br/>also 
<br/>introduces provisions to improve reporting mechanisms for children in need of care and protection, 
<br/>and the Bill provides civil and criminal protection for people who report abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, children need protection because it can have profound impact on their lives 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>both, in the present and in the future. We have seen so many cases of child abuse. Child abuse can 
<br/>lead to physical injuries, lifelong disabilities, and can impair cognitive and social development. Child 
<br/>protection systems ensure that every child has the right to grow, learn and play safely, and all this is 
<br/>very well covered in the Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  week,  I  have  mentioned  in  the  House  that  the  school  dropout  has  increased  in  2023 
<br/>compared to previous years.  The Child Care and Protection Bill will assist in reducing the numbers. 
<br/>This is a very important Bill. I thank the Committee who have worked on this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity. I support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KIRAN.- Mr Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers, honourable Ministers and Assistant Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament;  I 
<br/>rise in support of the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Child  Care  and  Protection  Bill  2024  is  about  promoting  wellbeing  and  prevention  of 
<br/>abuse. With the rising cases of child abuse and child neglect, the Bill empowers a newly established 
<br/>Department of Children to take necessary action for children in immediate danger, whether in the 
<br/>streets or in their family environment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We find children on the streets suffering neglect, children involved in drug trade, children as 
<br/>victims  and  children  as  perpetrators  of  crime.    The  Bill  provisions  for  care  of  children  who  are 
<br/>orphaned,  abandoned,  as  well  as  those  living  on  the  streets.  Our  Ministry  did  not  have  specific 
<br/>mandate, but this Bill now empowers the Department of Children to look at the issue of children on 
<br/>the streets.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  will  enable  our  Department  of  Children  to  look  out  for  those  in  harm's  way  of 
<br/>physical, sexual and emotional abuse. It also allows a child to be placed in safety if a person convicted 
<br/>of offence against a child is in the same household.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in the year 2023, a total of 1,477 child abuse cases were reported.  That is an 
<br/>average of four cases a day. Of these, 54 percent of the child victims were girls and 46 percent boys.  
<br/>Sir, 68 percent of these cases involve child neglect, physical abuse or sexual abuse and 58 percent of 
<br/>the victims were below the age of 12 - a stark indicator of the vulnerability of younger children to 
<br/>harm.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Disturbingly,  4.4  percent  of  the  victims  were  below  the  age  of  one,  which  points  to  the 
<br/>devastating reality of infants being subjected to abuse. The perpetrators of these crimes were in 72.7 
<br/>percent of  cases known  to  the victim. Among them,  50 percent were immediate family  members 
<br/>which is a heartbreaking reality that underscores the need for vigilant child protection efforts.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Police has released figures for the month of October this year, and crimes against children 
<br/>increased by 39 percent in October, in which 64 percent were sexual, 28 percent were assault-related, 
<br/>while 8 percent included other offences. All the perpetrators of the 13 percent cases of domestic-
<br/>related in crimes against children were male family members and the victims comprised of 90 girls 
<br/>and 78 boys in one month, Mr. Speaker.  It is horrendous to note that five children were being abused 
<br/>today somewhere in Fiji. That is reported. There may be many more unreported cases.

<div><span> Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To improve on reporting on child abuse, the Bill features mandatory reporting, which will 
<br/>now add a few more professionals to have the duty to report a case of child abuse in the hope to see 
<br/>all  children  everywhere  have  someone  looking  out  for  them.  Mandatory  reporter  will  include 
<br/>childcare  services  and  day-care  providers,  hostels,  in  addition  to  health  professionals,  teachers, 
<br/>police, counsellors, et cetera. Mandatory reporter who is aware of a child abuse and fails to report 
<br/>now can be convicted and fined. We hope this provision encourages eyes and ears to look out for 
<br/>safety of our children in all spheres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill also helps the Ministry and our Child Care Department to tighten processes to protect 
<br/>children in the context of their families and communities, as well as those who will need to be under 
<br/>the State care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill will mandate the registration of those agencies who work and intend to work with 
<br/>children  in  Fiji.  The  Bill  acknowledges  the  role  of  families  and  communities  in  promoting  the 
<br/>wellbeing and protection of our children and allows the Ministry to work with all stakeholders to 
<br/>ensure that our children are protected.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  also  allows  a  lot  more  provision  for  collaboration  for  the  protection  of  children 
<br/>between  Government  agencies,  faith-based  community  and  traditional  leaders,  as  we  have  heard.  
<br/>With  the  concerning  number  of  abuse,  it  allows  all  stakeholders  to  work  together  to  arrest  the 
<br/>problem.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>More  in-depth  work  will  be  required  in  the  Bill  for  referrals,  case  conferencing  and 
<br/>collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, family and community, before reaching a decision for 
<br/>the child's welfare plan. At present, our services to children is almost one way where officers decide 
<br/>on most of the intervention made on behalf the child in State care.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Officers do not get significant input from family members on decisions regarding their child. 
<br/>With this Bill, there is expectation to ensure that our practice is more thorough, and family members 
<br/>and community elders have an input on the welfare of our child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the passage of this Bill, we as Parliament and as a nation, are declaring that every child 
<br/>in Fiji deserves a safe nurturing environment regardless of gender, ethnicity and geography, and that 
<br/>means  that  we,  as  leaders  in  our  Government,  together  with  leaders  in  our  community,  must  do 
<br/>everything in our power to ensure that wellbeing, development and protection.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We must each commit to responsibility of bringing this legislation to life, across ministries 
<br/>education, health, social welfare and beyond. Together, we can break cycles of abuse and neglect we 
<br/>see everyday, but this effort cannot rest solely on the shoulders of the Government. We need our 
<br/>communities  to  rise  alongside  us,  community  leaders,  faith  leaders,  parents,  teachers,  elders  and 
<br/>youth, everyone has a role to play.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker look forward to this Bill and I support the motion. Thank, Mr. Speaker.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P. TIKODUADUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to voice my strong support for the Child 
<br/></span><span>Care and Protection Bill 2024, a vital piece of legislation that reflects our shared commitment to the 
<br/></span><span>wellbeing of Fiji’s children. At its core, the Bill reaffirms the truth that we cannot ignore.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The primary responsibility for raising and protecting a child lies with their parents and the 
<br/>communities around them. Parents are the first teachers, the first protectors, and the first role models 
<br/>in their child's life. When parents are present and engaged, children thrive, not just in school but in 
<br/>life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="82">Page 82</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2567 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, this is not a responsibility parents can carry alone. Communities have an equally 
<br/>important role to play. Strong, safe and supporting communities give children a sense of belonging 
<br/>and  security.  They  provide  an  environment  where  children  can  flourish,  shielded  from  harm  and 
<br/>surrounded by positive influences.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill, Mr. Speaker, makes clear what parental and community responsibility looks like. 
<br/>It  lays out  the duty  of parents  to  provide for their children's basic needs,  ensure their education, 
<br/>protect them from harm and guide them to become good citizens. It also recognises that when these 
<br/>responsibilities are neglected or unmet, the State has a duty to intervene, not just a replacement for 
<br/>families, but as a safety net for children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, Mr. Speaker, it is important to stress that State intervention should always be the 
<br/>last resort.  By the time the law steps in, the damage has often already been done. This is why our 
<br/>focus must also be on prevention - ensuring parents and families have the supporting tools they need 
<br/>to succeed long before a situation deteriorates to the point of crisis.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill challenge us as leaders to send the clear message. Parenting is not just a personal 
<br/>choice, it is a social responsibility.  It is time for all of us, parents, community leaders, teachers, faith-
<br/>based organisations and neighbours to step up. If we wait for the Police or the Courts to act, we have 
<br/>already failed  our children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024 is more than a legislation, it is a promise 
<br/>to  the  children  of  Fiji  that  we  will  do  everything  in  our  power  to  give  them  a  safe,  nurturing 
<br/>environment to grow up in. It is a call to parents and communities to take responsibility for their roles 
<br/>in shaping the future of the children 
<br/>of this nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  all  honourable  Members  to  support  this  Bill  and  to  reaffirm  our  commitment  in 
<br/>protecting  and  empowering  Fiji's  children.  Together,  we  can  build  a  stronger,  safer  and  more 
<br/>compassionate Fiji for the  
<br/>generations to come.

<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I thank  the honourable Tikodudua for his contribution.  We have exhausted 
<br/>the list of our speakers for the debate on this important Bill.  I now call upon the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Women, Children and Social Protection to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA.- Mr. Speaker, in my hand, I hold up a hand-held  fan that depicts the 
<br/></span><span>senibua</span><span> or frangipani. Each of the five petals represent the values to guide us in the wellbeing of our 
<br/>children in this country. It reads, “love, respect, care, protection, trust”.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The speakers before me, Mr. Speaker, have very adequately, aptly and aspiringly shared with 
<br/>us  what  our  vision  is  for  the  people’s  house  when  it  comes  to  our  children,  and  we  are  first  and 
<br/>foremost. As we sit here, we are fathers and mothers, and caregivers. So, this is something that we 
<br/>speak from our heart. And we speak with our heart to the people of Fiji, “Please, let us work together 
<br/>for the wellbeing of our children. The Government cannot do it alone. Parliament cannot do it alone.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in  the last week alone, there have  been reported cases of three missing girls 
<br/>under the age of 18 years. One is young as 13 years. We have seen an increasing number of cases by 
<br/>the Fiji Police Force of missing girls. What is happening to our society?  When these girls are returned 
<br/>home, we do not here from them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Bill  makes  us  responsible  to  find  out  where  these  girls  are  and  why  they  are  going 
<br/>missing? If you are listening and watching, if an adult is using our children, especially our girls for 
<br/>illegal means, this is a warning to you. You are committing an offence, and we are coming for you. 
<br/>And for the community, if the neighbour or anyone who knows what is happening to these girls or 
<br/>to our children, please report it, first and foremost for the love of that child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  I  thank  the  speakers  who  have  spoken.  I  thank  you,  honourable  Members.  I 
<br/>thank the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights for their hard work, just like the 
<br/>previous Bill, to bring these Bills to Parliament today. I thank you for your support in passing the 
<br/>Bill today. </span><span>Vinaka vakalevu</span><span>, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will now vote.
