<div><span>Fiji’s Economic Performance and Outlook  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide an update on Fiji’s economic 
<br/>performance and outlook and Government’s fiscal position.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fijian economy 
<br/>has shown great resilience, despite the global uncertainties caused by factors such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>slowing global growth; 
<br/>global inflationary pressures;  
<br/>supply chain disruptions; and 
<br/>escalating geo-political tensions and geo-economic fragmentation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Despite these ongoing challenges, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to state that our economic 
<br/>fundamentals have strengthened over the years, especially over the last two years. The economy is 
<br/>on a much stronger footing now that what we had inherited to years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, following a growth of 7.5 percent in 2023, the Fiji economy is now focussed 
<br/>to grow by 3.8 percent in 2024 higher than the 2.8 percent growth projected earlier on in June this 
<br/>year.    There  were  some  very  strong  reasons  for  these  upward  revisions  by  the  Macroeconomic 
<br/>Committee, an independent committee chaired by the Governor of the Reserve Bank and includes 
<br/>other senior public officials from key agencies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, the tourism industry which has been the key driver of Fiji’s post-pandemic recovery, 
<br/>has  positively  surprised  us  and  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  Gavoka  has  constantly  talked 
<br/>about this.  In the first 10 months – January to October 2024 – visitor arrivals rose by 6.5 percent 
<br/>when compared to the same period last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The strong growth in arrivals, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is largely driven by higher arrivals from our 
<br/>major tourism source markets including Australia, where the growth of 4.9 percent, New Zealand 3.8 
<br/>percent, US 8.6 percent.  These three countries account for 80 percent of our visitors and despite 
<br/>some of the economic challenges in this country, we have not seen any slowdown in numbers.  On 
<br/>the contrary, we have seen stronger growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to highlight that we have recorded new peaks for visitor 
<br/>arrivals in all the months this year and we are going to hit a new record again this year, just slightly 
<br/>below  a  million  tourists.    Sir,  in  light  of  this  strong  performance  in  tourism  arrivals  to  date,  the 
<br/>forecast for visitor arrivals for this year has been revised up to 6 percent from earlier projection of 3 
<br/>percent in 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  2025,  we  are  projecting  visitor  arrivals  to  grow  by  4  percent,  as  we  expect  continuous 
<br/></span><span>growth in tourism demand from traditional source markets, coupled with the introduction of the Nadi-
<br/>Dallas flights from next week which is expected to bring an additional 1,000 visitors on a weekly 
<br/>basis to our shores.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, given the strong linkages of the tourism industry with the rest 
<br/>of the economy, related sectors such as transport and storage accommodation, wholesale and retail 
<br/>are also driving higher growth this year. While positive contributions are also expected, finance and 
<br/>insurance, public administration, information, agriculture, manufacturing, real estate, mining and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2491 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>quarrying and net taxes are also contributing to the overall goal.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to highlight that following the strong public and 
<br/>political support and the business communities support for the recent budget which had sent a very 
<br/>strong  message  on  the  stability,  consistency,  and  the  transparency  and  accountability  of  our 
<br/>economical social policies. This, together with the inclusive style of governance and bipartisanship 
<br/>we have shown Parliament.  I want to thank the G9-Bloc for their bipartisan, I am not too sure about 
<br/>the other group, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has helped a lot with improving investor and overall confidence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thirdly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the increase in public sector salaries in the recent budget, increase 
<br/>in the national minimum wages from $4 to $4.50 and from $5 from 1</span><span>st</span><span> April. The strategic decision 
<br/>to have increase in Government spending in key areas. The high remittance flows to reach $1.3 billion 
<br/>this year. The tourism induced picked up and demand and growth in commercial bank lending has 
<br/>helped consumption spending which has supported business and economic activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  partial  indicators  for  consumption  spending,  including  VAT  collections,  consumption 
<br/>lending  through  the  financial  institutions  and  income  indicators  like  PAYE  collection,  FNPF 
<br/>contribution growth are showing stronger spending activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of investment activity, that current indicators suggest a positive 
<br/>outlook for this year. We have recorded a significant increase in business confidence and investment 
<br/>activity, driven by the commencement of large tourism related projects in the West and also in the 
<br/>North.  Other  major  commercial  projects  across  the  country,  and  the  implementation  of  some  of 
<br/>government capital projects.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A key indicator of construction activity, domestic cement sales have risen by 11.2 percent up 
<br/>to September 2024.  Furthermore, new lending by commercial banks for investment purposes grew 
<br/>by 25 percent  in  the year leading  to  September  2024, primarily due to  an increase in  lending for 
<br/>building and construction sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the recent groundbreaking of some large project such as google and 
<br/>the announcement on the replacement of four critical bridges worth over $300 million, the outlook 
<br/>for  investment  is  very  optimistic.  Similarly,  Sir,  investment  activity  also  continues  to  progress. 
<br/>Investor confidence is currently high, as evident by the new investments and construction happening 
<br/>around the country. I take this opportunity to thank our business and investor community for their 
<br/>very positive engagement attitude and helping Government in building confidence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For 2025, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the growth momentum is expected to continue and as such the 
<br/>growth forecast has now been upgraded to 3.4 percent from an earlier projection of 3 percent. Again, 
<br/>the services sector will be a key driver of growth on the back of strong tourism activity followed by 
<br/>industrial and primary sectors. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In 2026 and 2027, based on the information at hand, we are projecting a baseline growth of 
<br/>2.9  percent  and  2.8  percent.  While  we  may  be  reverting  to  the  long-term  average  growth  rate  of 
<br/>around  3  percent,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  higher  growth  rate  can  be  achieved  easily  if  we  continue 
<br/></span><span>improving  the  business  environment  for  private  sector  investment,  maintain  the  momentum  of 
<br/></span><span>economic reforms, ensure the stability of our economic policies, the transparency of our economic 
<br/>policies and provide confidence through well-crafted coordinated macro-economic policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, while our economy is showing strong sustainable growth, we must 
<br/>acknowledge the challenges posed by rising global inflation. We have seen an increase in the cost of 
<br/>goods, particularly fuel, food and transportation. The Government is acutely aware of the burden this 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>places on Fijian households, and we are taking necessary measures to alleviate the cost of living.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2024-2025 Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had announced numerous income enhancing 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>measures such as: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increase in minimum wages and civil service salaries; 
<br/>we are continuing with higher social welfare payments; 
<br/>restored pensions for FNPF pensioners that were affected by earlier reforms; 
<br/>providing targeted subsidies for electricity and water; 
<br/>provided Back to School support for the 2025 school year; 
<br/>fully absorbing the new higher bus fares for students receiving transport assistance;  
<br/>providing the highest ever sugarcane price of $105 per tonne; 
<br/>writing off $650 million in TELS debt for over 53,000 families, amongst other things that 
<br/>we have talked about often; and apart from these; 
<br/>maintained the zero-rated VAT on 22 items in the Budget.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All these is over a billion dollars in support for our vulnerable and disadvantaged. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am happy to report that the annual headline inflation year-on-year rate has 
<br/>fallen from the fourth consecutive month to 0.8 percent in November 2024.  This inflation outcome 
<br/>in November is significantly lower when compared to 5.8 percent in November last year and is also 
<br/>lower than 3.6 percent recorded in October this year. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>November 2024 inflation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the lowest in 16 months and is driven by lower 
<br/>prices noted in food and non-alcoholic beverages, transport, housing, electricity, water, gas and other 
<br/>fuels and clothing and footwear, and year-end inflation for this year is expected to be much lower 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, than our earlier projection of 3.5 percent, and is expected to remain stable in the 
<br/>medium term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  balance  of  payments  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  maintaining  external  stability  is  critical 
<br/>particularly, in a global economic environment characterised by volatility.  The recent years we have 
<br/>seen  fluctuations  in  global  commodity  prices,  shift  in  trade  patterns  and  changes  in  investor 
<br/>sentiments.  These factors Mr. Speaker, Sir, have had direct implications on our balance of payments.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pleased to report that through prudent macro-economic management 
<br/>policies we have made significant progress in addressing these challenges.  Our efforts to diversify 
<br/>exports, attract  investment  and improve the competitiveness  of our industries have begun to  bear 
<br/>fruits and I must thank all my ministerial colleagues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  There  is  some  difficulty  with  the  sound  system  again.  Is  it  now  better?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Thank you, you may proceed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that our ministerial colleagues in 
<br/>different ministries are all working together as part of our National Development Plan (NDP) strategy 
<br/>and all the sectors are bearing fruits.  We have seen an improvement in our trade balance with export 
<br/></span><span>growth driven by key sectors such as agriculture, mining and manufacturing.  Additionally, it happens 
<br/></span><span>to boost tourism, and remittances have contributed positively to our current account position. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current account deficit is forecast fall to 4 percent to 4.7 percent of GDP 
<br/>in 2024.  From 7.7 percent in 2023 and is expected to remain below 5 percent in the medium term.  
<br/>Moreover, the Government’s commitment to enhancing the external reserves has strengthened our 
<br/>position in managing external shocks and ensuring that we have the necessary resources to meet our 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="8">Page 8</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2493 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>international  obligations.    By  focusing  on  fiscal  discipline,  foreign  exchange  management  and 
<br/>strengthening  bilateral  and  multi-lateral  partnerships,  we  are  building  a  more  resilient  economy 
<br/>capable of withstanding external pressures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign reserves, our monetary policies and financial sector Mr. Speaker, Sir – again I am 
<br/>pleased to report that foreign reserves are comfortable at around $3.8billion at the end of November 
<br/>2024, equivalent to 6.2 months of retained imports, and are projected to remain adequate over the 
<br/>medium term.  The financial sector remains sound and continues to support domestic activity. Private 
<br/>sector credit growth has picked up to 11.2 percent in October 2024, driven by lending to both business 
<br/>entities and households. Banking system liquidity remained high at around $2.3 billion. Modest (I 
<br/>will not say too high) which is also helping keep interest rate at a near historical low and supporting 
<br/>investment growth, compared to interest rate in other countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  our  fiscal  strategy  remains  focussed  on  maintaining  prudent  fiscal 
<br/>management, while addressing key development needs.  Despite the challenges in the aftermath of 
<br/>the  pandemic,  we  have  kept  our  fiscal  deficit  under  control,  with  the  target  to  reduce  the  deficit 
<br/>progressively over the next few years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  now  discuss  about  this  state  of  Government  finances  and  fiscal 
<br/>performance for the 1</span><span>st</span><span> Quarter of 2024-2025, the fiscal deficit for 2023-2024 narrowed significantly 
<br/>to 3.4 percent of GDP compared to 7.2 percent recorded in the 2022-2023 financial year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Government’s  total  revenue  in  2023-2024  stood  at  $3,646.2  million  ($3.6  billion),  28.1 
<br/>percent  of  GDP,  while  total  expenditure  was  31.5  percent  of  GDP.  This  strong  performance  in 
<br/>revenue is underpinned by a stronger economy, as well as the combination of well-crafted revenue 
<br/>reforms and expenditure policy that significantly improve the paths of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal 
<br/>trend  in  the  first  four  months  of  this  fiscal  year  have  been  promising,  as  we  continue  to  surpass 
<br/>taxation targets, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  the  first  three  months  of  this  financial  year,  August  to  October, 
<br/>Government’s total revenue collection stood at $1,087.5 million, while total expenditure amounted 
<br/>to $956.3 million.  This resulted in a net surplus of $131.2 million equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP. 
<br/>This marks a notable improvement compared to the same period last year when a net deficit of $21.5 
<br/>million GDP was recorded.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  on  a  month-to-month  basis,  tax  revenue  collections  have  consistently 
<br/>exceeded the forecast, reaching a total of $885.2 million in the first three months. This positive out-
<br/>turn above by $88.4 million or 11.1 percent was primarily driven by stronger collection in all types 
<br/>of taxes including corporate taxes, PAYE (Pay-As-Your-Earn) and withholding taxes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, our non-tax revenue was also  higher than projected. So, in  terms  of our 
<br/>overall revenue collections for the first three months, it increased by almost $200 million, $196.1 
<br/>million or 22 percent compared to the same period last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  total  expenditure  has  also  been  promising.  The  first  three  months 
<br/></span><span>amounting to $956.3 million representing 21 percent of total budgeted spending level in the financial 
<br/></span><span>year.  This  comprises  $734.9  million  in  operating  expenditure,  and  $211.6  million  in  capital 
<br/>expenditure, with a good expenditure mix of 78:22, compared to the same period last year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  public  debt  while  a  concern  from  any  countries  globally,  remains 
<br/>sustainable and we are taking a measured approach to manage it.  Government debt stood at $10.3 
<br/>billion equivalent to 79.4 percent of GDP at the end of July 2024. Debt is projected to be around 77.8 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="9">Page 9</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>percent  of  GDP  at  the  end  of  this  financial  year.  This  is  a  marked  decline  from  the  high  of  90.7 
<br/>percent of GDP in 2021-2022.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of October 2024, Government’s total debt stood equivalent to 
<br/>75.4  percent  of  GPD,  the  debt  mix  comprise  63.7  percent  in  domestic  debt  and  36.3  percent  in 
<br/>external debt during the review period.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  me  conclude  by  saying  that  as  you  heard,  all  the  macroeconomic 
<br/>indicators;  whether  we  talked  about  debt  management,  whether  we  talk  about  our  revenue 
<br/>management, whether we talk about our investment policies, the mix of the policies that we put in 
<br/>place  in  the  2023-2024  Budget  and  in  the  2024-2025  Budget  is  actually  working  and  showing 
<br/>significant signs of the fact that we have set the economy on a right trajectory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, in summary, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would say that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>our economy is doing much better than earlier anticipated; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>consumption and investment spending have both picked up; 
<br/>tourism industry is on track for a record year; and we expect similar trends in 2025 and 
<br/>2026; 
<br/>inflation has eased to 0.8 percent in November 2024; 
<br/>foreign reserves stood at about $3.8 billion; 
<br/>interest rates remain low; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(6)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(7)</span><span> </span><span>Government revenue collections have surpassed projection for last financial year and for 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the last four consecutive months; and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(8)</span><span> </span><span>debt levels have been reduced to below 80 percent now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  risk  to  growth  is  balanced,  while  natural  disasters,  global  conflict, 
<br/>geopolitics, and slowdown in trading partners pose downside risks. There are upsides with tourism, 
<br/>with the Dallas flight and other new routes. Picked up in investments as confidence levels continue 
<br/>to improve and the easing of the labour market as outward migration and resident departures have 
<br/>also slowed down.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, all these put together, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is good news for the economy. Good news for the 
<br/>country, and as I said earlier, we want to make sure that the result of this good news also flows to the 
<br/>ordinary  people.  And  as  I  said  we  are  spending  almost  a  billion  dollars  in  targeted  expenditures 
<br/>whether it is for agriculture, social welfare, education, health and it put us in a very strong position 
<br/>to now start preparing for the next budget 2025-2026, and there will be more good news in the next 
<br/>budget.  Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.-  I will now call on the Leader of the Opposition or his  designate for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Statement delivered by the honourable Minister 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>for Finance is promising and it paints a picture that Fiji is doing well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, if the economy is doing well, why are our people not feeling it? The Government 
<br/></span><span>proudly announces the growth figures, increased revenues and growing economic projections. They 
<br/>celebrate numbers, but numbers do not put food on the table. Numbers don’t pay rent. Numbers don’t 
<br/>ease the daily struggles of ordinary Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="10">Page 10</a></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2495 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Let me ask this. How many Fijians have felt relief at the supermarket, 
<br/>or when paying utility bills? How many Fijians have seen their hard work translating into a better 
<br/>life for their families with increases in duties, taxes and VAT? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For many Fijians the answer is clear. Life has not improved. Instead, the cost of living has 
<br/>skyrocketed. Essential goods and services are becoming luxuries; even butter has become a luxury 
<br/>now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  P.D.  KUMAR.-  This  Government  has  not  spared  bread  and  butter,  daily  staples. 
<br/>Despite the election promise to reduce the cost of living. And I recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister Prasad during his campaign, he promised the people of this country; we will 
<br/>reduce the price of beer, butter and chops. Did that happen?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the bread price has increased from 71 cents to $1, and 500 grams butter has 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>increased to almost $14, which is the price of a chicken.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Wow! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, even he did not spare 60-year-old citizens of this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>country. When citizens reach 60 years of age, he’s taken away the bus fare from them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Shame! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- And the Bainimarama Government had put that bus fare. Those who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>are turning 60 they cannot get free bus fares.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  families  are  forced  to  make  impossible  choices  between  medicine  and 
<br/>groceries, between rent  and electricity bills,  yet the Government  is  telling Fijians the economy  is 
<br/>strong and is doing well. If that is true, where is the impact? Who is benefitting? Because it certainly 
<br/>is  not  the hardworking farmers struggling with  rising  input cost.  It  is  not the nurses and teachers 
<br/>leaving for better opportunities abroad. It is not the small business owners who can barely keep their 
<br/>doors open.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The truth is that this Government’s economic policies are designed to serve a select few.  We 
<br/>have seen tax-free holidays given to Fiji Water, pay rise for lawyers and others earning about more 
<br/>than $250,000.  All in the name of realignment. They talk about economic growth, but growth for 
<br/>whom? The privilege few, the multinationals, the well-connected elites?  Meanwhile, the majority of 
<br/>our people are left our struggling on the margins.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a government that prioritises statistics over citizen has lost its way.  Our 
<br/>people deserve policies that lift everyone, not just those at the top.  We must invest in our people, 
<br/>lower VAT on essential items to ease the burdens on struggling families, support small businesses 
<br/>that are the backbone of our economy, address the exodus of skilled workers with real opportunities 
<br/></span><span>here at home, prioritise capital works that create jobs and improve infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are not abstract ideas; they are steps we can take now to make life better for everyone.  
<br/>So, today I challenge this Government, if you claim the economy is doing well, let the people feel it 
<br/>in their pockets, in their homes, in their communities.  Let the benefits of growth reach every corner 
<br/>of our nation, not just the boardrooms of Fiji Water and a selected few.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a true measure of success is not found in the graphs and charts and numbers.  
<br/>It is found in the lives of our people, their well-being, their opportunities and their dignity.  Lots of 
<br/>promises were made, but  people know what  this Government  is  trying  to  do.  They are trying to 
<br/>squeeze every cent out of them, either through increase in taxes, VAT and everything else.  People 
<br/>are struggling and poverty is increasing.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I will now call on the Leader of G-9 Bloc or his designate for his response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the G-9 Bloc would like to thank honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister for the update on our economy and the positive outlook it projects, and wishes the 
<br/>Ministry and the Government well. Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Update on the Great Council of Chiefs Meeting 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  the  Opposition,  honourable  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament; first of all, I congratulate you for holding the post of the Speaker of this 
<br/>august House and I wish you all the best in your term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to provide a Ministerial Statement on the Great 
<br/>Council of Chiefs (GCC) Meeting that was convened from 13</span><span>th</span><span> to 14</span><span>th</span><span> November at the Grand Pacific 
<br/>Hotel.  Please, allow me just to address a few of the issues that were raised on Tuesday afternoon 
<br/>regarding the non-renewal of land leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, agriculture is a very important sector for Fiji.  In terms of renewal for land 
<br/>leases. The land lease renewal is hovering around 85 percent to 87 percent, which is quite a good 
<br/>standard for a country like Fiji.  For agriculture, it is allocated roughly about 50,000 hectares of land, 
<br/>and currently only about 50 percent has been utilised.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By law, before any lease expires, five years prior to the expired of the lease the iTLTB staff 
<br/>should be visiting the farmers to conduct consultations before their lease expires.  We have received 
<br/>the request from the farmers that the five years is too short to prepare them if their lease is not going 
<br/>to be renewed, so they need a 10-year consultation period.  So that has been facilitated by the iTLTB 
<br/>at the moment.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Few of the issues that have been the main causes of non-renewal of lease are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Breach of the lease contract.  In some instances, farmers only utilise a small portion of the 
<br/>land that they lease.  The advice from iTLTB is always to utilise the portion that they use, 
<br/>and they surrender the part that they are not using, so that is always one of the main areas 
<br/>of concern to the farmers.  That is also the main reason why most of the leases are delayed 
<br/>in its renewal to make sure that the land is utilised properly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>When lease arrears are there, lease cannot be renewed if there are arrears on the current 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>lease.  So, that is another area which is always a concern.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>When the numbers of the members of the </span><span>mataqali</span><span> or </span><span>yavusa</span><span> increase and they need some 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>land for their food security and also for their development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Always when the landowners have seen the yield level of what they can get from the land, 
<br/></span><span>for example, if they are planting a certain crop and that area is becoming a well-developed 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>area and subdivisions are coming up, they will request iTLTB if that land can be returned 
<br/>to them so that they can rezone it so that they can get better benefits from their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The current Government is fully supportive of the agriculture sector.  Last year, Government 
<br/>provided a grant of $1.2 million to about 218 farmers to renew their leases.  The iTLTB is trying its 
<br/>utmost best to do its consultation properly to help the farmers and also to help the landowners in 
<br/>whatever discussions or whatever needs that they require.  I thank most of the honourable Members 
<br/>who are here who raised the issues. My advice is if you can visit the nearest iTLTB office and take 
<br/>the details of the leases that has been a concern to the farmers so that they can address these.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If that is not addressed there, the CEO is there who you can approach, or else you can raise it 
<br/>with me, and we can try and find the solutions on how to resolve the issues that have been raised by 
<br/>the farmers.  The iTLTB will always try its best to take care of the issues that will be raised by the 
<br/>farmers and also the issues that will be raised by the landowners.  Our main area of concern now is 
<br/>when people visit the farmers and taking their concerns or complaints just from one side. Please get 
<br/>the information  from  both  sides, which we can easily resolve the issues regarding the renewal  of 
<br/>leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the meeting for the GCC was attended by His Excellency the President of Fiji, 
<br/>Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu, the </span><span>Turaga na Tui Cakau</span><span> and the chiefs from the 14 provinces including 
<br/>Rotuma. The chiefs discussed significant issues concerning the good governance and well-being of 
<br/>the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> and pass resolutions to that effect.  On the first day, members of the GCC were presented 
<br/>with  the  outcomes  of  the  review  of  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  Administrations  and  the  establishment  of  the 
<br/>Provincial Economic Units.  The meeting also heard an update on the review of iTaukei Land and 
<br/>Fisheries Commission (iTLFC). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the review of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Administration was undertaken by a six-member team 
<br/>from April to July.  They travelled all over Fiji and submitted 10 recommendations to strengthen the 
<br/></span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  Administration.    This  includes  the  iTaukei  Affairs  Board,  provincial,  </span><span>tikina  </span><span>and  village 
<br/>councils.    The  chiefs  noted  that  the  last  review  was  done  in  2002  by  Price  Waterhouse  Coopers 
<br/>(PWC).  Two  successive reviews tried to  improve the work done by the  PWC and the work was 
<br/>eventually suspended following the events of 2006.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When the new Government came into office in 2022, it prioritised matters concerning the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei, including the review of the legislation affecting them.  They were categorised as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>structural issues; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>legislations; 
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>social issues; and 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>economic issues. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The issues were brought before the GCC meeting in Bau last year, and the chiefs agreed that 
<br/>the review of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Administration be undertaken to assist in addressing these issues. After the 
<br/>adoption of the GCC Review Report last year, attention turned to the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Administration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the chiefs also heard a presentation from the consultant on the feasibility study 
<br/></span><span>of  establishing  provincial  economic  units.  One  of  the  issues  affecting  the  </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>  is  the  need  for 
<br/>economic  empowerment.  The  GCC  meeting  in  Bau  decided  that  it  will  take  on  economic 
<br/>empowerment to address poverty issues. We have the resources, but we lack the means to convert 
<br/>these resources into monetary value.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The chiefs heard presentations from the two review teams on the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Administration and 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>on  the  feasibility  study  to  establish  provincial  economic  units.  After  the  presentation,  the  chiefs 
<br/>separated into their confederacies to  discuss this report. The presentations  after their confederacy 
<br/>meeting, supported the review report and their recommendation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the second day, the Ministry made a presentation on the village profiling survey for the 
<br/>chiefs to see the status of each province, </span><span>tikina, </span><span>and village regarding sanitation, education, business 
<br/>types, health issue to name a few. The chiefs realised that evidence-based policy making was crucial 
<br/>for effective intervention. As a result of the presentation and with the chiefs’ endorsement, we will 
<br/>seek Government’s approval for the creation of a data hub to capture all </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> data, drawing first 
<br/>from </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> institutions, before moving to other Ministries. The GCC also benefits from an update 
<br/>of the review team of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> Lands and Fisheries Commission (TLFC).  The TLFC is currently 
<br/>undertaking a review, and this is expected to be completed this month.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, violence against women and children is an escalating concern.  The Chiefs 
<br/>expressed their dismay,  when the  National  Action Plan to  Prevent  Violence Against Women  and 
<br/>Girls (NAP) was discussed.  Statistics for Fiji in comparison to the rest of the world does not paint a 
<br/>good a picture, and to do not lie particularly in traditional settings.  This is why the chairpersons of 
<br/>the  provincial  councils  are  our  change  agents.  The  chiefs  resolved  that  our  efforts  in  resourcing 
<br/>awareness and intervention must be doubled if we are to be successful in our fight.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, economic empowerment must be prioritised.  We must clear bottlenecks 
<br/>that  hinder  growth,  and  we  must  create  pathways  that  will  generate  business  opportunities.    The 
<br/>poverty statistics is a stark reminder on the conditions in our villages.  But we must turn these into 
<br/>opportunities.  This is why the GCC supported a paper to revitalise the cocoa industry.  Cocoa used 
<br/>to be a thriving industry in the 1980s. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will be discussing this further with the Ministry of Agriculture to see how the GCC paper 
<br/>is aligned to their current programmes.  The GCC is encouraging every small window of opportunity 
<br/>to be exploited by the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> as they contribute towards the fight against poverty. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC also discussed the International Decade of Indigenous Languages 
<br/>(IDIL).  It gave them the opportunity to address the declining use of </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>and Rotuma languages, 
<br/>and how these can be revitalised.  Language is the means of expressing our culture which is rich in 
<br/>its various forms.  The use of our language has been declining for some time and is more noticeable 
<br/>today amongst our young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The village profiling survey that I had touched on earlier also points to this truth and the GCC 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had supported this International Decade of Indigenous Languages. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the GCC also heard from our Rotuman chiefs. It was refreshing to hear their 
<br/>voice and the major issues they face. One of the issues they have highlighted was the </span><span>Rotuma Bill</span><span>; 
<br/>their concerns will be raised through the appropriate channel from the GCC secretariat.  Other issues 
<br/>raised was regarding development and challenges faced by our Rotuman communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC is mindful of the responsibility they must take on going forward. 
<br/></span><span>They must contribute to building a better Fiji. They must be inclusive, and they must be chiefs for 
<br/></span><span>everyone.  Uniting people from the various cultures was a founding legacy of our leaders.  Somehow, 
<br/>this got lost along the way, and the result is that we have a nation that is rebuilding.  The GCC must 
<br/>find its place amongst this changing world and weave a thread that will join our community together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, we have  completed setting  up the  GCC Secretariat  and the Chairman of the 
<br/>GCC  has  been  appointed  and  he  is  leading  the  work,  guided  by  the  thematic  areas  of  good

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, basically in brief, it just displays the jealousy, because of our communal 
<br/>living.  If one starts to rise as an </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>, then the underline current of the communal living undercuts 
<br/>them from the bottom of the line.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  now  call  on  the  leader  of  the  Group  9  bloc  or  his  designate  for  his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firstly  I  would  like  to  thank  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for his update on the GCC.  In doing so, I wish to revisit the review report of the GCC that 
<br/>was done in  2023.  There were  eight recommendations, and two I really wanted to  highlight this 
<br/>morning, because they emphasise the importance of how we progress, the momentum of our progress 
<br/>like we are progressing forward or back.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Recommendation  4  -  GCC  being  proactive  in  advocating,  directing  and  oversight  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>iTaukei</span><span> interests and aspirations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Recommendation  5  –  GCC  maintains  and  strengthens  its  advisory  function  in  nation  -
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>building. </span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the GCC establishment plays a pivotal role at this time.  We have seen the 
<br/>Coalition Government that has now produced many prime guidance documents for Fiji, ranging from 
<br/>NDP, our Foreign Policy White Paper, the review of our security, and a list of other prime documents 
<br/>that are very important to be understood in the context of those two recommendations.  I am happy 
<br/>to  see  the  indications  are  positive  and  good,  and  under  the  leadership  of  the  chair,  Ratu  Viliame 
<br/>Seruvakula, and his secretariat, I think is moving in that particular direction to achieve the intended 
<br/>state of the GCC.   Nation building is very important. To influence, lead and be example in nation 
<br/>abuilding.

<div><span>Secondly, it is about reconciliation.  The GCC is in a very good position to bring about unity. 
<br/></span><span>It  has  a  unifying  effect  on  our  nation.    At  this  time,  it  plays  the  pivotal  role  to  bring  about 
<br/>reconciliation, togetherness and a sense of belonging to the other races that can generate that energy 
<br/>of power to catapult Fiji forward for a better future.  In my simple view and understanding of how 
<br/>the  GCC  works;  I  have  always  called  for  relevancy  of  this  great  body,  its  transparency  and  its 
<br/>accountability.

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We talk of the great plans to propel the organisation forward and that it serves the best interest 
<br/>of the </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  However, I just wanted to say a very simple thing this morning Mr. Speaker, Sir.  I’m 
<br/>looking forward to the productivity of this organisation.  How can we measure our productivity in 
<br/>the areas of agriculture, education, of health, and law and order.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recalled when I was a Commissioner of Corrections, I used to challenge the other provincial 
<br/>leaders to say who is the least represented here?  I always remember Tailevu used to top the least, 
<br/>followed by Lomaiviti and so forth. But my point here Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the ability to measure our 
<br/>productivity and our progress.  It’s very important.  And you talk about economic empowerment, I 
<br/>look forward to innovation ideas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am challenging my colleagues from my Province of Naitasiri; when do we see an economic 
<br/>hub up in the corridors of Naitasiri? When do we see a central market down in the plains of Sawani, 
<br/>down there, which we did during the period of COVID?  If it worked during COVID, why can’t we 
<br/>do it now? I look forward to the day Mr. Speaker, that we will see a Naitasiri restaurant in the central 
<br/>Suva and a Cakaudrove restaurant perhaps in the West, where we can see the various delicacies of 
<br/>our various parts.  Thank you, Sir.
