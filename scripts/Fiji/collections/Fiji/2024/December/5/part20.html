<h3>AQUACULTURE BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>AQUACULTURE BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of 
<br/></span><span>Parliament on Tuesday, 3</span><span>rd</span><span> December, 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That Aquaculture Bill of 2024 be debated, voted upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2569 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable 
<br/>Cabinet  Ministers  and  Assistant  Ministers,  the  honourable  Leader  of  Opposition,  honourable 
<br/>Members of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen and all those tuning in live on Parliament Facebook 
<br/>page. It is with great urgency and optimism that I present the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 before this 
<br/>Parliament today.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill represents not just a piece of legislation, but a pivotal moment for Fiji's economic, 
<br/>environmental  and  social  future.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  it  is  a  strategic  move  that  will  formalise  and 
<br/>regulate our aquaculture sector unlocking its tremendous potential to drive food security, create jobs 
<br/>and contribute to economic growth.  As we know, Fiji's fisheries resources are vital to our people 
<br/>contributing to food security and livelihoods, particularly for our coastal and rural communities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  sector  has  been  operating  without  a  comprehensive  legislative 
<br/>framework  to  govern  the  rapidly  changing  aquaculture  industry.    The  Aquaculture  Bill  of  2016, 
<br/>which was tabled in Parliament in 2016 and was initiated by the former Permanent Secretaries and 
<br/>former Minister for Fisheries, laid the groundwork for this transformative legislation. Unfortunately, 
<br/>that Bill lapsed when Parliament prorogued in 2018. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we certainly cannot afford to let this Bill suffer the same fate. Globally the 
<br/>aquaculture  industry  is  experiencing  unprecedented  growth.  According  to  the  State  of  World 
<br/>Fisheries and Aquaculture Report of 2024, for the first time in history, aquaculture production has 
<br/>surpassed that of wild caught fisheries. This is a turning point for global food production, and Fiji 
<br/>must act now to ensure we are part of this global movement. We are already seeing increasing demand 
<br/>for seafood, with  aquaculture offering a sustainable solution  to  feed a growing population  and to 
<br/>mitigate the strain on wild fisheries.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  provides  a  solid  framework  to  regulate  and  support  Fiji's 
<br/>aquaculture  industry  in  a  way  that  promotes  sustainability,  biosecurity  and  responsible  resource 
<br/>management. The Aquaculture Bill of 2024 outlines the creation of designated aquaculture zones 
<br/>where  both  marine  and  freshwater  aquaculture  activities  can  be  conducted  sustainably  without 
<br/>causing environmental degradation. This approach will protect Fiji's unique marine and freshwater 
<br/>ecosystems, while fostering economic growth in communities across the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Bill  categorises  licences  into  commercial,  semi-commercial  and  subsistence  food 
<br/>security types, ensuring that aquaculture enterprises are registered, monitored and met by security 
<br/>standards.  Through  this  licensing  system,  aquaculture  enterprises  will  gain  legal  recognition, 
<br/>empowering them to access financial support, be it loans or grants, which will fill further growth and 
<br/>innovation in the sector.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  licensing  will  ensure  that  only  those  meeting  proper  standards  will 
<br/>operate, safeguarding our resources and preventing harm to the environment.  It also means that it 
<br/>will  track  and  monitor  aquaculture  activity,  ensuring  compliance  with  environmental  laws  and 
<br/>international best practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the establishment of the Licensing Committee, the Scientific Committee 
<br/></span><span>and Advisory Council, as part of the Bill, is integral to ensuring effective governance of the sector. 
<br/></span><span>These  bodies  will  work  to  oversee  licensing,  guide  the  sustainable  management  of  the  industry, 
<br/>provide scientific advice and recommend policies. Their roles will ensure that decisions are based on 
<br/>scientific  data  and  best  practices,  while  also  promoting  transparency  and  public  trust  in  the 
<br/>aquaculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill empowers land owning units and communities to better utilise their 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill empowers land owning units and communities to better utilise their 
<br/>land for aquaculture, particularly in areas affected by saltwater intrusion, where agricultural activities 
<br/>are no longer viable. This under-utilised land cannot be converted into productive aquaculture zones, 
<br/>for oyster farming, seaweed cultivation and freshwater fisheries, without the risk of environmental 
<br/>degradation.  This  will  create  income  and  food  security  for  rural  and  coastal  communities  and 
<br/>contribute to the overall economic resilience of Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, furthermore, every year the Government  allocates substantial  funding to 
<br/>support  aquaculture  initiatives  such  as  pearl  farming,  seaweed  projects  and  the  development  and 
<br/>maintenance of  aquaculture hatcheries. This  sustained investment  demonstrates the Government's 
<br/>commitment to this sector. However, to truly maximise the potential of these investments, we need 
<br/>a  strong  and  enforceable  legal  framework  that  ensures  sustainability,  biosecurity  and  long  term 
<br/>success.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Aquaculture  Bill  of  2024  will  provide  just  that,  creating  a  foundation  for  growth, 
<br/>innovation and resilience in the sector. Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Aquaculture Bill of 2024, is not just an 
<br/>opportunity. It is a necessity.  It is a comprehensive solution to the challenges facing the aquaculture 
<br/>industry from environmental protection to food security and it will lay the foundation for a prosperous 
<br/>and sustainable future for Fiji. I urge this Parliament to support the passage of the Bill today and to 
<br/>ensure that we do not miss this critical moment to transform Fiji's aquaculture sector for the benefit 
<br/>of our people and future generations. I thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the opportunity to speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you honourable Minister Bainivalu. Honourable Members, before I 
<br/>open the floor for debate, just go back to my initial comment about there being no time limitation on 
<br/>the debate. I have to retract that and in fact, because before me a list of five speakers that are allocated 
<br/>to speak on the debate, there are two from the G16-bloc, two from Government and one from G9-
<br/>bloc. Each speaker therefore will have only 10 minutes to speak on the motion. So I will ask first, the 
<br/>honourable Semi Koroilavesu to deliver his statement.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.T. KOROILAVESAU.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir, for giving me the opportunity 
<br/>to speak on the Aquaculture Bill 2024.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, the discussions in the last two days has 
<br/>been long within our group.  In my effort to convince our group for us to accept and endorse this Bill, 
<br/>and basically, the response that I had was that, they were not happy with the way the Bill was brought 
<br/>in, and  I think the honourable Deputy Prime Minister Gavoka is not here, but the word they said is 
<br/>that “tyranny of the majority.”   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the background to the Aquaculture Bill has been long overdue and I wanted 
<br/>to highlight a few issues because the honourable Minister has indicated what the Bill implies and 
<br/>what it will do to the aquaculture industry within the fisheries sector. The pearl and aquarium clam 
<br/>breeding  has  been  very  difficult,  and  this  Bill  will  maximise  potential  economic  benefits  of 
<br/>supporting pearl and aquarium clams. This has been practised in Laucala and Northern Taveuni by a 
<br/>company called Civa Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Sir, a total of about 5,000 aquarium clams had to be destroyed 
<br/>because the legislation did not give any clear indication, who the authority was, to give the okay for 
<br/></span><span>the export of aquarium clams. So, basically it was a decision between the Ministry of Environment 
<br/></span><span>and  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries.  I  am  glad  that  this  Bill  will  clarify  that  issue.  The  sustainable 
<br/>aquaculture  practices  that  the  clam  and  pearl  breeding  operations  will  ensure  that  they  are 
<br/>environmentally  friendly  and  would  not  harm  our  marine  ecosystems.  We  need  to  support  our 
<br/>investors that come from overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Civa Fiji had spent a huge amount of money with the hotel owners in Laucala and Northern 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="86">Page 86</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2571 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Taveuni,  but  to  see their aquarium clams to  be completely destroyed. The addressing of invasive 
<br/>species,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  think  that  tilapia  is  quite  a  good  species,  it  is  an  invasive  species. 
<br/>Whenever  tilapia  is  introduced,  it  eats  everything  else  that  were  naturally  Fiji  species.  There  is 
<br/>another species that is called barramundi. Investors wanted to bring it into Fiji.  It lives in streams 
<br/>and rivers and it also lives on the reef. We tried very hard to fight against it because it would destroy 
<br/>every other fish in Fiji, but this Bill will be able to regularise and give the system that will stop this 
<br/>from happening in the future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species or CITES. This is an issue that I 
<br/>think for the benefit of our honourable Members such is the Convention on International Trade in 
<br/>Endangered  Species.    Mr,  Speaker,  Sir,  would  know  this  very  well.  What  this  Bill  will  do,  will 
<br/>basically make sure that there is no trade or exchanges that will destroy our ecosystem within our 
<br/>reefs and waters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the conversion of sugar cane land affected by sea-level rise as we 
<br/>convert all this land that have not been cultivated along the coast that has been affected by climate 
<br/>change.  Coastal areas from Nadroga right to Ra, coastal areas in the west coast of Vanua Levu, warm 
<br/>water, beautiful and pure, but we need to develop something so that we can energise this industry, 
<br/>and this Bill will give us that.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the event that the Bill will be passed, my friends 
<br/>from my group have agreed to support the Bill. So, the benefit is quite far and wide and it will benefit 
<br/>Fiji in the long run.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The regulatory framework, the proportion proposed National Aquaculture Bill establishes a 
<br/>clear regulatory framework that governs the industry, ensuring that operations are conducted in a 
<br/>sustainable  and  responsible  manner.  It  promotes  sustainable  practices  by  setting  environmental 
<br/>standards  and  guidelines  for  aquaculture  operations,  helping  to  protect  aquatic  ecosystem  and 
<br/>biodiversity.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By supporting the aquaculture industry, the National Aquaculture Bill can stimulate economic 
<br/>growth trajectory of increased production and export opportunities creating national food security. 
<br/>Aquaculture can significantly enhance food security by providing a reliable source of protein and 
<br/>other  nutrients,  especially  in  regions  where  wild  fish  stocks  are  declining.  A  clear  and  legal 
<br/>framework  can  attract  both  domestic  and  foreign  investment  in  the  aquaculture  sector  leading  to 
<br/>technological advances and improved production methods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Consumer protection includes provision for food safety and quality standards ensuring that 
<br/>aquaculture products are safe for consumption and meet market demands. Community engagement - 
<br/>the  proposed  National  Aquaculture  Bill  can  promote  community  involvement,  support  local 
<br/>aquaculture  initiatives,  foster  social  acceptance  and  participation  in  the  industry.  Disaster 
<br/>preparedness, it includes guidelines for disaster risk management, helping the aquaculture sector to 
<br/>better prepare for and respond to natural disasters or disease outbreaks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coordination  and  collaboration,  the  Bill  will  facilitate  collaboration  among  various 
<br/>stakeholders,  including  Government  agencies,  industry  players,  research  institutions  and  local 
<br/>communities, leading to more effective management and development of the aquaculture sector. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, international compliance, the National  Aquaculture Bill can help 
<br/>align our country’s aquaculture practice with international standards and agreements, enhancing its 
<br/>reputation in global markets. I support the Bill before the Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, the honourable 
<br/>Leader  of  the  Opposition  and  honourable  Members  of  Parliament;  today,  I  rise  to  support  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="87">Page 87</a></div>
<div><span>2572 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024, a piece of legislation that I believe will be transformative and impact Fiji’s 
<br/>economy, food security and environmental sustainability. The Bill addresses the critical area, which 
<br/>has always been focussed here on discussion in this august Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will focus my contribution to specific areas where the Bill will greatly 
<br/>address the needs in those sectors. One is strengthening food security.  As our population grows, the 
<br/>global climate challenges escalates, ensuring food security becomes paramount. This Bill emphasises 
<br/>sustainable practices that protects and enhances our marine ecosystem, while increasing fishing and 
<br/>seafood production for local consumption. By investing in aquaculture, we reduce our reliance on 
<br/>imports, making Fiji more self-reliant and resilient to external shocks. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Second is the economic potential on aquaculture.  Aquaculture represents a growing global 
<br/>industry, and Fiji is uniquely positioned to benefit from this growth. With our pristine waters, diverse 
<br/>biodiversity  and  strategic  location,  we  have  the  resources  to  establish  ourselves  as  a  leader  in 
<br/>sustainable  aquaculture.  This  Bill  creates  a  robust  regulatory  framework,  providing  clarity  and 
<br/>stability for investors both, domestically and internationally.  By fostering innovation and providing 
<br/>support to small scale farmers, it ensures that the benefits of this sector will be widely distributed 
<br/>across our population.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Third,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  environment  stewardship.  We  are  the  custodians  of  our 
<br/>environment,  and  this  Bill  will  underscore  our  commitment  to  sustainable  development.  It  sets 
<br/>stringent standards for waste management, habitat protection and the use of resources, ensuring that 
<br/>aquacultural  activities  do  not  harm  our  marine  ecosystem.  It  promotes  the  use  of  modern, 
<br/>environmentally friendly technologies, balancing economic growth with ecological preservation. The 
<br/>Bill  ensures  that  methods  adopted  are  based  on  best  science  evidence.  It  also  ensures  that 
<br/>precautionary approaches are followed where scientific evidence is not available.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fourth  is  supporting  local  communities.    Aquaculture  offers  immense  opportunity  for  our 
<br/>rural  communities,  providing  capacity  building,  creating  jobs  and  uplifting  livelihood.  Training 
<br/>programmes and access to resources outlined in this Bill will empower our people to participate in 
<br/>the growing sector. Strengthening local communities provides an opportunity to reverse urban drift 
<br/>and promote self-sufficiency and sustainable resource management. Women and youth, in particular, 
<br/>stand to benefit as aquaculture creates inclusive employment opportunities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fifth is global and regional leadership.  By passing this Bill, Fiji sends a clear message that 
<br/>we are ready to lead sustainable aquaculture development in the Pacific. This legislation aligns with 
<br/>our commitments under international agreements such as SDGs and the Climate Action Framework. 
<br/>It positions Fiji as a model for other Pacific nations’ seeking to balance development and environment 
<br/>stewardship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Aquaculture Bill is not just about fish, farms or economic 
<br/>metrics,  it  is  about  securing  a  brighter,  more  sustainable  future  for  Fiji.  It  is  about  creating 
<br/>opportunities,  protecting  our  environment  and  enhancing  the  wellbeing  of  our  people.  I  urge  my 
<br/>fellow  Members  of  Parliament  to  support  this  Bill.    Together,  let  us  unlock  the  vast  potential  of 
<br/>aquaculture and set a new course for the sustainable development of our beloved Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, I wish to thank the Committee and the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry for their 
<br/>hard work.  I also wish to thank honourable Koroilavesau and his team for the initiative and effort 
<br/>throughout the process of this particular Bill. I support the motion before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to lend my support, and I have been instructed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to inform Parliament of the support of the G9 Bloc also to the Bill that is before the House.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="88">Page 88</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2573 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I can just look at the bigger picture of what this Bill will do, in 1940, 
<br/>tilapia was introduced into Fiji and in 1967 grass carp was brought into Fiji to help keep our rivers 
<br/>clear from the </span><span>bekabeka i raga</span><span> and all those weeds that clog our rivers. Now, grass carp thrives as a 
<br/>source of protein. Tilapia from being brought way back in 1940 is now cultured. The species that is 
<br/>now cultured is very much the species that is widely exported from Thailand, the biggest exporter of 
<br/>Tilapia. Way back in 1940 and today, we can culture sand fish (</span><span>dairo</span><span>), I have seen it.  We culture 
<br/>milk fish, there is a farm in Vitawa.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>All  this  time,  Mr.  Speaker,  aquaculture  piggybacks  on  other  legislations  -  piggybacks  on 
<br/>environment  legislation and  piggybacks  a  little  bit  on  fisheries  legislation.    In  Fiji's  fisheries,  the 
<br/>coastal fishery is well-regulated, offshore fishery is well-regulated, aquaculture until today, when we 
<br/>pass this Bill will now be regulated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture  transcends  from  the  marine  aquaculture  to  brackishwater  in  the  middle,  to 
<br/>freshwater aquaculture, hence the danger that has been mentioned tonight in those ecosystems, if it 
<br/>is not managed properly. So, the bigger picture of this Bill, I heard mentioned tonight is the fact that 
<br/>we are creating history and for the first time now, aquaculture as an industry, is a fishery that will 
<br/>now have an Act on its own.  It is now a regulated industry and when it is a regulated industry, it is 
<br/>a catalyst for growth.   Investors will come if they want to  come in  and  invest in  this part of our 
<br/>fisheries in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I thank the Ministry for picking it up and bringing it now to the House.  I thank those who 
<br/>have started the move to get aquaculture fisheries regulated and I fully support the Bill that is before 
<br/>the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,    first,  I  wish  to  thank  the  Natural  Resources 
<br/>Committee on the development of this Bill, particularly the Ministry. Most of what I wanted to say 
<br/>has been shared as well by the speakers before me. I had very limited time in the Ministry from 2012 
<br/>to 2014, and I saw the huge potentials in aquaculture.  That made us join INFOFISH in Malaysia so 
<br/>that  we  can  piggyback  and  gain  from  the  experiences  of,  particularly,  countries  like  Thailand, 
<br/>Malaysia, Philippines and Cambodia, who are well ahead of us in the aquaculture industry, not only 
<br/>in terms of the technology development, but it is about the whole value chain. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  had  the  opportunity  to  visit  India  and  through  the  then  Dean  of  the 
<br/>College of Agriculture and Forestry in Koronivia, we made arrangements if I can visit a farm in India. 
<br/>I have forgotten the name of the place, but it is easy to get there because it is next to the National 
<br/>Dairy Research Institute which is about a one or two hour’s drive from New Delhi. I was privileged 
<br/>to  be  introduced  to  the  largest  fish  farmer  in  India,  a  Nobel  Peace  Prize  earner,  because  of  his 
<br/>contribution to food security.  But unfortunately, the arrangement did not continue because he trains 
<br/>officials from almost every developing country and we were in the process of sending our people and 
<br/>I moved again to another portfolio, Sir.  I am always ready to assist where needed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  had  discussions.  We  decided  to  support  it,  he  initially  opposed  in  which  it  came  in, 
<br/>particularly under Standing Order 51.  I was particularly interested in Standing Order 51 because in 
<br/>the definitions of the terms or the interpretations, it talks about the aquaculture industry.  Although 
<br/></span><span>most of the Bill focuses on production right through to  marketing, I have talked about  the whole 
<br/></span><span>value chain.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Processors and manufacturers of equipment and feed and individuals - I think these are some 
<br/>areas where probably, later on, we can revisit. I know that we attempted to bring in a nutritionist into 
<br/>the Ministry of Fisheries back then to help us develop nutrition for feed for aquaculture, because in 
<br/>Fiji, unfortunately, the feed that we have are produced by livestock feed producers and there is no 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>one doing specialised aquaculture feed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When aquaculture feed is thrown on the water, it must float because the fish, prawns will 
<br/>come up and then have a bite.  Otherwise, it all sinks to the bottom of the sea.  That is one of the 
<br/>reasons why I was interested in this and, of course, as alluded to also by honourable Viliame Naupoto, 
<br/>I saw the definition of “freshwater”.   It means natural water.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Most countries that I visited including China, probably Fiji needs to go into that area as well 
<br/>where they have freshwater laws on how we use freshwater?  There is a law.  In Fiji, we have an 
<br/>abundance of water, we have a shortage of water, and we do not utilise this water well.  Of course, it 
<br/>is  linked  to  the  environment.    That  is  another  story,  but  we  will  look  into  it,  as  we  come  to  the 
<br/>operationalisation of this document.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was also interested, as alluded to by honourable Koroilavesau in Clause 
<br/>40 of this Bill which covers the trade of aquaculture product, and also the issue about Convention on 
<br/>International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).  I have always argued that there is a difference 
<br/>between wild harvest and farmed or cultured production, because CITES is about endangered species 
<br/>and protection, particularly in the export of these commodities in terms of wild harvests.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The clam farm in Taveuni, unfortunately, were not allowed to export clams which would have 
<br/>brought us millions of dollars.  The good thing about that clam farm, he worked closely with the 
<br/></span><span>qoliqoli</span><span> owners.  He supplied the clams (young ones) to the </span><span>qoliqoli </span><span>owners and when it is ready for 
<br/>harvesting, he buys it again from the landowners and then he is the one that does it.   I hope that this, 
<br/>honourable Minister, will be taken care of in this Bill because, unfortunately, back then when it was 
<br/>under the Ministry of Environment, it really made things difficult for the Minister for Fisheries.  We 
<br/>had  long  discussions,  even  in  Cabinet,  but  when  it  comes  to  the  technical  people  on  the  ground, 
<br/>sometimes it is  hard.  That  is  the reality.   This  is something that will bring us a lot of potentials 
<br/>economically.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 42 is on the restrictions on the import or introducing to Fiji a live aquatic organism 
<br/>for  aquaculture  without  the  written  authorisation  of  the  Permanent  Secretary.    When  I  was 
<br/>Commissioner  Northern,  one  of  the  big  challenges  in  the  North  was  the  iguana  in  Qamea  and 
<br/>Taveuni.  I was told that it was just brought in as a pet, and then it was out of control, and it became 
<br/>a nightmare to the local population.  I know at one stage, they requested the RFMF to come and shoot 
<br/>the  iguana  but  then,  all  those  animals  have  rights  as  well,  now  under  international  law.    So,  that 
<br/>became a big issue.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lastly, we will pass this law today.  One thing that I learnt, Sir, from IPU meetings is the role 
<br/>of Parliament.  It is not only about making new legislations, but Parliament has that responsibility to 
<br/>ensure  that  these  laws  be  operationalised,  they  are  given  the  resources  and  Parliament  will  also 
<br/>continue to provide that oversight and scrutiny so that it is implemented.  I hope that this Parliament 
<br/>in the new direction that we are taking, will also take this responsibility in ensuring that honourable 
<br/>Minister for Finance provides the funding, so that the honourable Minister for Fisheries can have 
<br/>extra staff according to the organisation that she is going to come up with, and then we ensure that 
<br/>there is proper capacity development, so that it will bring the benefits that we have.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tunabuna  has  particularly  talked  about  food  security.    Our  triple  burden  of 
<br/>malnutrition in Fiji, when we were developing the body, I was arguing with Fisheries, “please, let us 
<br/>just concentrate on upper Namosi, upper Naitasiri, because we need to replace </span><span>rourou</span><span> and </span><span>ota</span><span> with 
<br/>fish.”   Let us not only look at income but let us look at food security as well.  I support the Bill, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the debate on the

<div><a name="90">Page 90</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2575 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Aquaculture  Bill  2024.    Before  I  do  that,  I  just  thought  I  would  reflect  on  a  couple  of  things.  
<br/>Yesterday, we made history in this House and today again we are making history because we are 
<br/>passing some Bills that have taken a long time to get to fruition.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I was actually going to pick one the other side of the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in terms of the 
<br/>delay of the Bills coming into the House.  I think, on reflection, there is a message to all of us in what 
<br/>we did  today, in  that,  if  we work together, we  can actually  make a big difference in  these years, 
<br/>probably that is left in our service for our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The second thing I thought I just reflect on, in the discussions that we held with the Speaker 
<br/>of  the  Senate  of  Australia,  she  mentioned  that  they  passed  35  Bills  using  the  equivalent  of  our 
<br/>Standing Order 51.  They did so by negotiating between the parties before they got into Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is something that perhaps going forward we can think about because: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>We will increase the number of Bills we bring into the House which is our job. 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>We  will  not  be  using  Standing  Order  51  like  a  weapon  in  terms  of  passing  of  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>legislation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just thought I would share that, Mr. Speaker, just to start off with my contribution today.  
<br/>As a Minister responsible for Trade and MSMEs, this Bill is quite important and is a significant step 
<br/>towards establishing a comprehensive framework for an industry that, we all agree, has significant 
<br/>potential for our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill ensures, Mr. Speaker, that we sustainably develop the aquaculture industry while at 
<br/>same  time  protecting  marine  ecosystems,  promoting  biodiversity  conversion  and  addressing  the 
<br/>challenges of food security and environmental stewardship. The framework provided in this Bill will 
<br/>stimulate  economic  growth  by  encouraging  investment  in  sustainable  aquaculture  practices  and 
<br/>supporting small scale producers which in turn would boost domestic production and exports. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji’s aquaculture apparently began in 1937 with a common carp which was introduced in Fiji 
<br/>from  New  Zealand.  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  87  years  later  we  are  here  in  Parliament  to  discuss  an 
<br/>Aquaculture  Bill,  a  framework  that  will  regulate  this  important  industry  and  safeguard  its  future.  
<br/>Aquaculture is contributing to nation building by creating employment opportunities, encouraging 
<br/>investment in sustainable aquaculture practices and stimulating economic development in coastal and 
<br/>rural  areas.  It  supports  small  scale  farmers,  which  is  quite  exciting,  and  plays  a  critical  role  in 
<br/>addressing the challenges of overfishing and food security, as mentioned and is a healthy source of 
<br/>protein for our people. The current aquaculture production is currently valued at $11 million, with 
<br/>the  right  policy  investment  mechanism  and  resources,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  there  is  potential  and  a 
<br/>suggestion that we can even grow this industry to over a hundred million at least by 2030.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Aquaculture  Bill  introduces  a  comprehensive  framework  to  regulate  and  support  the 
<br/>sustainable  development  of  Fiji’s  aquaculture  industry.    It  establishes  mechanisms  such  as  the 
<br/>Aquaculture  Advisory  Council  and  scientific  committee  ensuring  expert  oversight  and  evidence-
<br/>based  decision  making.  The  Bill  defines  aquaculture  areas,  mandates  environment  impact 
<br/></span><span>assessments and introduces a streamlined licensing process to support compliance while fostering 
<br/></span><span>investment and innovation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Importantly, it safeguards Fiji’s marine ecosystems by prohibiting harmful practices such as 
<br/>the introduction of genetically modified species and enforcing robust biosecurity protocols. These 
<br/>provisions  collectively  empower  small-scale  farmers,  encourage  private  sector  investment,  and 
<br/>ensure that the industry aligns with international standards.  By supporting sustainable practices, the

<div><span> Aquaculture Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill enhances food security, reduces reliance on seafood imports and creates opportunities for rural 
<br/>communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is no secret Mr. Speaker, that the Ministry I have been honoured to lead, is guided by five 
<br/>general objectives; two of which are economic diversification and MSMEs and co-operatives, just 
<br/>pathways  out  of  poverty.    The  Ministry  is  currently  in  discussion  with  several  local  farmers  and 
<br/>financial institutions to develop and expand the aquaculture industry and support local players.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have had the privilege to meet two young, exceptional young men, Mr. Apenisa Maracava 
<br/>and Mr. Laisiasa  Cavakiqali who are rising stars in the aquaculture industry. Mr. Maracava was one 
<br/>of the three recipients of the first ever Pacific Agri-Innovate Competition Fiji at the SIDS Forum in 
<br/>Nadi last month.  This farmer is excelling in his business venture of shrimp farming by combining 
<br/>innovation, science and sheer hard work.  The Ministry has not only provided financial support but 
<br/>is also building capacity to support MSMEs and their business operations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank the Ministry for Fisheries and Forestry in recognising the critical role that cooperatives 
<br/>play  as  a  vehicle  to  change  communities.    Through  the  formation  of  cooperatives,  members  can 
<br/>enhance their skills and develop their resources together, and flourish. We have cooperatives that are 
<br/>engaged in seaweed and </span><span>nama</span><span> farming, creating employment for our women and youth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I recall when our country came to a standstill during the COVID-19 pandemic, all Fijians 
<br/>recognised the need to diversify the economy so that we discontinue the practice of overreliance on 
<br/>one sector.  We, the Coalition Government, made a promise that we would look at developing our 
<br/>primary industries and, Mr. Speaker, the passing of Bill No. 21 of 2024 is one of the many ways we 
<br/>intend to keep that promise.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, before I take my seat, I urge all the honourable Members of this august Chamber 
<br/>to  reflect  on  the  conversations  the  years  to  diversify  our  economy,  create  alternative  sources  of 
<br/>income and empower our local businesses.  Passing the Aquaculture Bill of 2024 is an opportunity 
<br/>to turn those conversations into action. Let us come together to ensure this Bill is passed, so we can 
<br/>lay the groundwork for a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous aquaculture industry that benefits all 
<br/>Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.V.B.C.  BAINIVALU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  would  like  to  thank  all  the  honourable 
<br/>Members with their constructive and supportive contribution on the debate and the motion before the 
<br/>House.  The Aquaculture Bill is one of the two Bills of the Ministry of Fisheries under the 2024 
<br/>legislative agenda.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  would  like  to  thank  the  former  Ministers  for  Fisheries,  Permanent 
<br/>Secretaries for Fisheries, the former Director of Fisheries, former  Fisheries Officers. I also would 
<br/>like to thank the current staff of the Ministry of Fisheries for their hard work and continuing to push 
<br/>for the tabling of this Bill. We did it. </span><span>Vinaka</span><span>, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote.
