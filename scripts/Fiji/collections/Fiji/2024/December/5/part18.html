<h3>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>CHILD JUSTICE BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  pursuant  to  the  resolution  of  Parliament  on 
<br/>Thursday, 23</span><span>rd</span><span> May, 2024,  I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> That the Child Justice Bill 2024 (Bill No. 04/2024), be debated, voted upon and be passed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  L.D.  TABUYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, Cabinet Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament, and to all 
<br/>who are viewing from home on our </span><span>Facebook </span><span>page or on television; today marks a transformative 
<br/>moment in our history.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This new law, Mr. Speaker, Sir, catapults us from old ways of thinking that keep crime 
<br/>rates the same and leave children without rights, to a new safer Fiji, one where children in conflict 
<br/>with the law do not go on to re-offend but instead, go on to become contributing members of 
<br/></span><span>society.  This law also catapults Fiji into the role of leading the Pacific in evidence-based crime 
<br/></span><span>prevention and the recovery of children's lives. We now stand shoulder to shoulder with global 
<br/>leaders in this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As I have said before, this is because the Act finally responds to why children come into 
<br/>contact with the law, based on research and science about what stops children from offending. 
<br/>One of the most significant aspects of this Act is the focus on diversion and the raising of the age 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>of criminal responsibility. We recognise that children are not merely miniature adults, they are 
<br/>developing individuals who require understanding, support and guidance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By prioritising diversion, we shift our approach from punishment to rehabilitation. We 
<br/>shift from entrenching existing problems to creating a pathway out of them. We create a chance 
<br/>for children to grow up as positive contributors to Fijian society.  As we embrace this important 
<br/>step, it is essential to recognise how the Child Justice Bill works hand in hand with Fiji’s Child 
<br/>Care  and  Protection  Bill.    Together,  these  two  pieces  of  legislation  create  a  comprehensive 
<br/>framework designed to protect and nurture our children, ensuring they receive the support and 
<br/>protection they deserve, and that they go on to thrive as adults who will make a difference in our 
<br/>country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Child Care and Protection Bill, of course, sets a foundation for the rights and welfare 
<br/>of children across our nation and we will be discussing that next, but by raising the age of criminal 
<br/>responsibility and focusing on diversion, the Child Justice Bill complements the protection of 
<br/>children by ensuring that children who find themselves in conflict with the law are heard, and 
<br/>the    circumstances  that  led  to  their  offending  in  the  first  place  are  addressed.  These  laws 
<br/>collectively signify our understanding that children are not simply individuals who have made 
<br/>big mistakes, but they are most often children who have survived or suffered neglect or abuse.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Child  Justice  Bill  recognises  that  many  children  enter  the  justice  system  due  to 
<br/>circumstances  beyond  their  control,  and  it  is  our  duty  to  intervene  positively.  To  my  fellow 
<br/>Parliamentarians, this is a call to action. We must champion the integration of these two Bills in our 
<br/>policies and practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  not  enough  to  pass  legislation.  We  must  ensure  that  our  systems  work  together 
<br/>seamlessly. This means collaborating across Ministries, engaging our communities and investing in 
<br/>resources necessary to implement these changes effectively. To my own ministerial colleagues, the 
<br/>success of this legislation hinges on our collective commitment to its implementation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We realise that the passage of this Bill to Act is only the beginning of our work, but each 
<br/>Ministry will have to do their work in bringing the Act to life. Of course, our Ministry will play a 
<br/>key role in supporting our colleagues. We will play a role in diversion and working with children and 
<br/>their families to understand why those children have come into contact with the law in the first place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> As I have said when I introduced the Bill, many children who find themselves in conflict 
<br/>with the law come from backgrounds where they are homeless, broken homes or being neglected or 
<br/>abused. These are the very children we need to protect and support to build attachment with their 
<br/>own communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my Ministerial colleagues, the honourable Prime Minister and honourable  Minister for 
<br/>Justice, I pledge to support your Ministries in the policy and cultural changes demanded by this new 
<br/>law.  For  the  Police,  this  means  officers  need  to  be  confident  and  adept  at  safely  engaging  with 
<br/>children, to properly understand their circumstances and to engage with  my own staff in offering 
<br/>diversion. It means you will need policies, procedures and training to underpin this. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To the honourable Minister for Justice, your role is in training legal professionals and law 
<br/>enforcement  in  the principles  that this  new  Bill is  vital. You must ensure that everyone involved 
<br/>understands the importance of rehabilitation over punishment and is equipped to implement these 
<br/>changes  effectively,  but  this is  not  just an Act  that has implications for the Police or  Ministry of 
<br/>Justice.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2549 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Schools are the optimal place to foster environments where children feel safe, supported and 
<br/>empowered to succeed. Safety will sometimes be the only protective factor for a child where they do 
<br/>not feel this belonging or safety at home. School can be the ultimate circuit breaker to a child coming 
<br/>into conflict with the law, through the very provision of safety and support. I look forward to working 
<br/>with the honourable Minister for Education and his Ministry to bring this to life.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Similarly, I address the honourable Minister for Health and Medical Services.  Your support 
<br/>in addressing the mental and emotional needs of children involved in the justice system is crucial. 
<br/>We need to ensure that appropriate counselling and therapeutic services are accessible, guiding our 
<br/>children towards healing and personal growth.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  success  of  this  legislation  will  not  rest  solely  on  the  shoulders  of  Government.  It  is 
<br/>imperative  that  all  Parliamentarians,  regardless  of  party  affiliation,  recognise  their  obligation  to 
<br/>support and promote the implementation of this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To my colleagues across the aisle, I invite you to join us in championing this cause. Let us 
<br/>work  together,  united  by  the  common  goal  of  creating  a  just  and  compassionate  system  for  our 
<br/>children.  Your  voices  are  essential  in  raising  awareness  and  fostering  a  culture  that  prioritises 
<br/>rehabilitation over retribution.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  need  to  engage  our  communities,  to  inform  them  about  the  benefits  of  the  diversion 
<br/>programme and the significance of raising the age of criminal responsibility. We need to encourage 
<br/>discussions that dispel myths and understanding of our new approach to child justice.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Your role as Opposition is crucial in ensuring that this Bill receives the support and scrutiny 
<br/>it deserves. I know you will hold us accountable for implementing this new law and monitoring its 
<br/>progress,  in  ensuring  that  our  commitment  to  child  welfare  is  reflected  in  tangible  outcomes.  
<br/>Together,  we  can  ensure  that  this  legislation  is  not  merely  a  set  of  words  on  paper,  but  a  living 
<br/>commitment to our future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  that  note,  Mr.  Speaker,  I  commend  the  Bill  to  the  House  and  seek  the  support  of  all 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion. I 
<br/>have a list of five speakers with me. Again, each speaker will be given eight minutes to speak on the 
<br/>Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. LAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise with a deep sense of purpose and hope as I speak in 
<br/>support of the Child Justice Bill 2024.  This Bill is not merely a piece of legislation, it is a beacon of 
<br/>compassion,  justice  and  a  brighter  future  for  our  children.  It  is  a  testament  to  our  unwavering 
<br/>commitment to nurturing and protecting the most vulnerable members of our society.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the core of this Bill is a simple, yet powerful principle - the best interest 
<br/>of our child must always come first. This is not just a legal requirement, it is a moral imperative.  Our 
<br/>children are our future, and it is our sacred duty to ensure that they grow up in an environment that 
<br/></span><span>fosters their wellbeing development and dignity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the most transformative aspects of the Child Justice Bill 2024, Sir, is its emphasis on 
<br/>rehabilitation rather than punishment.  This Bill recognises that children, by their very nature, have 
<br/>an immense capacity for growth and change, instead of subjecting them to punitive measures that 
<br/>can scar them for life.  This Bill promotes rehabilitation and re-integration into society. It embodies 
<br/>the belief that every child deserves a second chance, an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>become productive law-abiding citizens.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is heartening to see that the Child Justice Bill 2024 continues to uphold 
<br/>key protections for children that were previously addressed in the Media Industry Development Act 
<br/>2010.  It  is  good  to  see  that  the  following  provisions  which  were  in  the  repealed  Media  Industry 
<br/>Development Act 2010are now included in this Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Protection of children:  The best interest of the child is prioritised, and children are protected 
<br/>from harm.  This includes ensuring that children in police custody are treated with care and 
<br/>respect, taking into account their age, gender and social needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Content  restrictions:    This  Bill  prohibits  the  publication  of  information  that  identifies 
<br/>children  involved  in  legal  proceedings.  This  crucial  measure  protects  the  privacy  and 
<br/>dignity of our young ones, preventing potential harm from public exposure. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Privacy:    The  confidentiality  of  records  related  to  children  in  conflict  with  the  law  is 
<br/>maintained. These records are kept secure and are only accessible for purposes relating to 
<br/>the administration of justice, safeguarding the privacy of children.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is almost as if we needed a reminder of how essential these protections are. So, thankfully, this Bill 
<br/>ensures they remain intact.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill provides a comprehensive framework that balances accountability 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with compassion. It introduces several key provisions that reflect both, legal and moral ideas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Age determination and criminal responsibility  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill raises the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 10 years to 14 years. This 
<br/>change  acknowledges  that  younger  children  lack  the  maturity  to  fully  understand  the 
<br/>consequences of their actions.  For children between 10 years and 13 years, the prosecution 
<br/>must prove that the child knew the actions were wrong at the time of the offence. This 
<br/>ensures  that  only  those  who  have  the  capacity  to  understand  their  actions  are  held 
<br/>accountable.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Diversion programmes 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill emphasises the use of diversion programmes to handle minor offences outside the 
<br/>formal justice  system.   These programmes include community service, counselling  and 
<br/>educational activities which are designed to address the root causes of offending behaviour 
<br/>and support the child’s rehabilitation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Child Justice Court 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The establishment of specialised child justice courts ensures that cases involving children 
<br/>are handled by trained professionals who understand the unique needs of young offenders. 
<br/>These  courts  will  operate  with  less  formality,  creating  an  environment  that  is  less 
<br/>intimidating and more supportive for children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Custodial measures as a last resort   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill mandates that custodial measures should only be used as a last resort and for the 
<br/>shortest  period  necessary.    This  is  in  line  with  international  standards  and  reflects  our 
<br/>commitment to minimising the negative impact of detention on children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is crucial to address these specific provisions for children under the age 
<br/>of 13 years, who commit crimes. Under the current legal framework, children under the age of 10 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="66">Page 66</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2551 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years cannot be prosecuted for any offence.  For those between 10 years and 13 years, prosecution is 
<br/>only possible if it can be proven that the child knew the actions were wrong at the time of the offence.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This  Bill  reinforces  these  protections  and  ensures  that  children  are  treated  with  the 
<br/>understanding and care they deserve.  Children under 14 years cannot be imprisoned for any offence.  
<br/>Instead, they are placed in approved institutions where they can receive the necessary support and 
<br/>rehabilitation.    This  approach  is  not  only  legally  sound,  but  also  morally  just.    It  recognises  that 
<br/>children, especially those under 13 years, are still developing their understanding of right and wrong, 
<br/>and should be guided, not punished harshly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Child Justice Bill 2024 is a testament  of our commitment to justice, 
<br/>compassion and the future of our nation.  It is a Bill that embodies the moral and legal principles we 
<br/>hold  dear.    By  supporting  this  Bill,  we  are  making  a  powerful  statement  that  we  believe  in  the 
<br/>potential of every child, that we are committed to their rehabilitation and reintegration, and that we 
<br/>will protect their rights and dignity at all costs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Let us pass this Bill with the generous support it deserves.  Let us show our children that we 
<br/>believe in them, that we are here to support them, and that we are committed to building a just and 
<br/>compassionate society for all.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  Deputy  Prime 
<br/>Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; I rise today, in this august House, for a matter of 
<br/>profound importance - the Child Justice Bill 2024.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this legislation is not merely a set of rules, it is a commitment to the future 
<br/>for our children and our society.  It is essential that we teach child offenders differently from adult 
<br/>offenders.  Children are not mature adults.  They lack maturity and understanding that comes with 
<br/>age, therefore, they cannot be held to the same standards as adults.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Frederick Douglass makes a statement that resonates with the intent of the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill, and I quote: “It is easier build strong children than to repair broken men.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Albert Einstein, once said, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“Imagination  is  more  important  than  knowledge.    For  knowledge  is  limited, 
<br/>whereas  imagination  embraces  the  entire  world,  stimulating  progress,  giving  birth  to 
<br/>evolution.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Children are known for their imagination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  research  has  consistently  shown  that  while  teenagers  may  appear  fully 
<br/>grown, they are still in the process of developing physically, socially, cognitively and morally.  The 
<br/>Bill  acknowledges  these  development  stages  by  establishing  guiding  objectives  and  principles  in 
<br/>Clauses  3  and  4,  clearly  signalling  that  those  children  in  conflict  with  the  law  must  be  treated 
<br/>differently from adults.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my eight as a Judicial Officer, I have on occasions from time to time, 
<br/>been reminding the Police and asking, “Where are the parents of this child?”  When this Bill becomes 
<br/>law, it will create an obligation and, of course, with necessary training, that children should be treated 
<br/>separately.  It  is  the  acknowledgment  by  the  State  and  revision  of  this  Bill  of  the  importance  of 
<br/>children, especially so, Sir, in light of the young offenders that we face in these courts. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="67">Page 67</a></div>
<div><span>2552 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few days ago, I visited a home in Nabua that houses young people. The youngest was 12 
<br/>years old.  There are 40 of them, who are drug addicts, delinquents, for one reason or another, and I 
<br/>acknowledge the Tabua Family who lives in Bougainville and who accommodates these 40 children.  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they share their lives, their journey from marijuana to ice, to cocaine - the thefts in 
<br/>Nabua, I was even told that one of them had robbed the former Commander of RFMF.  So, one reason 
<br/>they have been accommodated in this home is because they have found love. They have found peace.  
<br/>I was told that some may have Police cases, but they have lost contact with them.   It just goes to 
<br/>show how we should treat our children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Children are inherently more amenable to rehabilitation than adult offenders.  International 
<br/>studies indicate that the likelihood of positively influencing a child’s behaviour through counselling 
<br/>and support message is significantly higher than for adults.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I am  very grateful in  terms  of  the diversion.   Madam  Minister, you can 
<br/>count on me.  There has been some discussion this year with Australia and New Zealand, and next 
<br/>year the ministry is going to take a tour to New Zealand.  Sir, you are fully aware of how the Maori 
<br/>community  and  the  regional  government  have  treated  this  issue  in  terms  of  the  unique  problems 
<br/>facing the Maoris and how they deal with it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our prisons are full of </span><span>iTaukei</span><span>.  They start off as young offenders - juveniles and migrate to 
<br/>become a common criminal. The problem in our justice system is that we have not created sufficient 
<br/>diversion. We have left out what we have - our culture and tradition, how to change a man and how 
<br/>to  change  a  woman.  And  it  is  about  time,  and  I  think  with  this  Coalition  Government,  we  are 
<br/>committed to do that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>By focussing on rehabilitation rather than punishment, we can help these young individuals 
<br/>to avoid a life of crime but to instead, nurture them into productive law-abiding citizens.  In fact, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, diversion can reduce offending rate by up to 70 percent, depending on the quality of the 
<br/>programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Our  Bill  introduces  provisions  for  diversity,  particularly,  Clause  18,  regarding  Police 
<br/>cautions,  or  based  on  successful  practices  already  implemented  by  the  Juvenile  Bureau  and 
<br/>international best practices.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Community-fare based measures have also greater efficacy than custodial orders, and I also 
<br/>call on faith leaders. It is about time that they should step in. I do so, Mr. Speaker, Sir, because the 
<br/>issue of crime, I see it an issue that really focusses on the iTaukei people. Some of the disconnection 
<br/>that we are faced before Independence, after Independence and, of course, the development phase 
<br/>that we have gone through.  So, it is about time that faith-based religious leaders should stand up and 
<br/>make and account, take real action in terms of the rehabilitation of these young offenders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Child Justice Bill 2024 will replace the outdated sections of the Juvenile Act concerning 
<br/>children in conflict with the law.  It outlines special treatment for children at the various stages of the 
<br/>criminal  justice  process,  from  the  initial  police  contact,  through  to  trial,  rehabilitation  and 
<br/>reintegration.  The Bill defines a child as anyone under the age of 18, alive both juvenile as criminal 
<br/></span><span>responsible is the age of 10.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill is crucial because our current Act is outdated and does not reflect Fiji's advancement 
<br/>in the juvenile justice system. The Child Justice Bill 2024 consolidates best practices for handling 
<br/>children in court with the law, while ensuring compliance with international commitments under the 
<br/>UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  conclusion,  Sir,  let  us  embrace  this  opportunity  to  enact  meaningful  changes  for  our 
<br/>children, transforming lives through understanding, compassion and effective rehabilitation, rather 
<br/>than punishment.  Together, we can build a brighter future for all Fijian children. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse and support the Bill.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 7.35 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I stand to contribute to the Child Justice Bill 2024 before 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, from the onset, the Child Justice Bill 2024 is an essential Bill and a very 
<br/>important one.  It is good to see that this Bill is aiming to improve the treatment of children within 
<br/>the criminal justice system by aligning it with international standards for the rights of children.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill focusses on addressing children in conflict with the law who are under the age of 18 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>years, in a way that prioritizes rehabilitation, education, reintegration rather than punishment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I totally agree that children cannot be pitched similar to an adult in a criminal 
<br/>justice system.   They need special attention and  greater effort  in  education, rehabilitation and re-
<br/>integration.  However, it does not mean, in any way, that a child between a certain age cannot be held 
<br/>criminally responsible for his or her actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, setting the age of criminal responsibility for a child to 14 years may seem 
<br/>like a step towards addressing juvenile crime and aligning it with international standards.  However, 
<br/>it carries a number of potential disadvantages for the criminal justice system and the community at 
<br/>large.  During some of my discussions with the community, the following concerns were raised. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, people believe that it is morally wrong not to hold a person below the age 
<br/>14 responsible for a crime which, in a number of cases, were committed knowingly.  They strongly 
<br/>believe that a child who is over the age of 10 years can commit a crime should be held accountable 
<br/>for his or her action.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Setting  the  age  of  criminal  responsibility  to  14  years  could  mean  that  certain  children, 
<br/>particularly those who commit violent crimes or other serious offences, may not face the criminal 
<br/>justice’s  consequence,  even  though  they  are  capable  of  understanding  the  wrongfulness  of  their 
<br/>behaviour. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these people are quite frustrated with this.  They have expressed that they 
<br/>are  making  the  system  too  lenient  on  young  offenders  who  commit  violent  crimes.  This  gravely 
<br/>undermines the trust in the justice system and will cause people to question the effectiveness of our 
<br/>justice policies. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if a child who is under 14 years of age, commits a crime and he or she is 
<br/>not  held  criminally  accountable  and  gets  away  with  a  knock  in  the  knuckles,  we  will  be  missing 
<br/>opportunities for early interventions. This probably would mean, raising a hardened criminal in the 
<br/>later years.  By delaying accountability until 14, young offenders might not receive the rehabilitation 
<br/>or deterrence opportunities they need at this critical development stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, if our criminal justice system delays responsibility until the child reaches 
<br/>14 years of age, we will be condoning the abnormal and unacceptable behaviours of a child, and this 
<br/></span><span>child may never really understand the consequence of such behaviours.  For children who are repeat 
<br/></span><span>offenders who commit serious violent crimes, setting the criminal responsibility age to 14 years may 
<br/>allow them to avoid appropriate consequence for their action during the time when they could still 
<br/>be rehabilitated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, without early intervention, these children might grow up into adolescence 
<br/>and later, adults, who will continue to engage in criminal activities, perpetuating a vicious cycle of 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2555 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crime.  This  delay  for  these  children  in  facing  the  consequence  of  their  actions  could  lessen  the 
<br/>deterrence effect of our criminal justice system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, children are very smart these days. If they are aware that they will not face 
<br/>the criminal consequence of their action until they reach the age of 14, they may not feel deterred 
<br/>from committing crime.  If they know that there are no immediate legal consequence, they would be 
<br/>more likely to engage in antisocial behaviour, leading to higher crime rates in the long run. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  children  grow,  their  behaviour  becomes  more  complex.  It  could  be 
<br/>harder to intervene effectively with a 14 year old, who has already been committing crime for years. 
<br/>Early intervention is often the most successful in shaping positive behaviours.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, raising the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years may disproportionately 
<br/>affect children from marginalised communities, who are already at a higher risk of criminal behaviour 
<br/>due  to  factors  like  poverty,  neglect  or  family  instability.  If  serious  offenders  who  are  often  from 
<br/>disadvantaged backgrounds are not held accountable at early stage, our community could see a rise 
<br/>in crime rates.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these children who do not face the consequence of their criminal activities, 
<br/>might struggle to reintegrate into our society and thus, continuing a cycle of criminal behaviour that 
<br/>impacts the entire community. This lack of action on offenders could lead to higher crime rates in 
<br/>the community, as these children grow older, negatively affect the public safety and security of the 
<br/>community and, ultimately, having an effect in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, criminal gangs and illicit drug traders will take advantage of the setting up 
<br/>of the criminal responsibility age. Children below the age of 14 will be widely recruited to carry out 
<br/>these  criminal  activities,  knowing  very  well  that  a  child  can  get  away  without  facing  any  dire 
<br/>consequences. By setting the criminal responsibility age to 14, we are openly inviting these gangs to 
<br/>use children in their criminal activities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one does not become a criminal just like that, it probably starts at a young 
<br/>age  -  petty  crimes,  such  as  picking  stuff  from  someone's  compound,  petty  garden  thefts,  picking 
<br/>coconuts  from  trees  that  does  not  belong  to  you  or  without  the  permission  of  people.  If  these 
<br/>behaviours  are  not  reprimanded  earlier,  then  these  small  time  petty  thefts  or  activities  can  get  a 
<br/>snowball effect,  gradually growing  into violent  robberies, like the recent  one in  a supermarket  in 
<br/>Nasinu.    These  are  not  the  people  who  wake  up  one  day  and  decide,  “Let  us  go  and  rob  a 
<br/>supermarket.” These are people who have gone through the mill and come to this stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the public fears that children who commit serious crimes at a young age 
<br/>should face the consequence and should be rehabilitated. Setting the criminal responsibility age of 
<br/>14 can lead to perception of impunity and leniency.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  fear,  Mr.  Speaker,  is  that  if  the  Committee  believes  that  young  criminals  or  young 
<br/>children are escaping the justice system because of age restriction, it could reduce public confidence 
<br/>in the justice system. The public and the victims of crime will view the justice system as ineffective, 
<br/></span><span>and particularly if it allows dangerous offenders to evade responsibility actions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Fiji  Police  Force  is  also  worried  about  setting  up  the  criminal 
<br/>responsibility age at 14. They are worried that crimes will increase, and public safety is at risk. A 
<br/>balanced approach is needed to ensure children are held appropriately accountable for their actions. 
<br/>I hope these necessary amendments will be done to the Bill to muster the public confidence in our 
<br/>criminal justice system, whilst safeguarding our children. With that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will be very short.  I rise in support of the Child 
<br/>Justice Bill 2024 and the point that was raised by honourable Sachida Nand, the next Bill will cater 
<br/>for that which is the Child Care and Protection Bill 2024. Those under 14 years old, if they commit, 
<br/>they will be treated as a child in need for care. That is the second Bill that will cover for that age 
<br/>group and how they will be rehabilitated once they agree if they could be used, given the increase in 
<br/>criminal age to 14 years.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, in response to the immediate statement by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Crime, 
<br/>Mr. Mesake Waqa, who also raised the same issue, that to change the age of criminality could result 
<br/>in increase in juvenile crimes. But if you look at Clause 13 of the Bill that is before us,  which is one 
<br/>of the most important sections in this particular Bill, a child will be considered for diversion. One of 
<br/>the deciding factors there is that a few officers will be empowered to carry out the diversion - Clause 
<br/>13(1)(a), in a case of summary offence.  The officer in charge of the police station, in consultation 
<br/>with the charges officer, will be doing that diversion, or they will be empowered to do diversion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Clause 13(b) in the case of an indictable offence other than murder or attempted murder, it 
<br/>will be done by a prosecutor. So, for murder and attempted murder, they will not be covered in the 
<br/>diversion, but they will have to go through the criminal justice system. Other offences other than 
<br/>murder and attempted murder will be considered for diversion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Clause 13(2), it talks about the requirements and the requirements also for the interest of 
<br/>justice in subclause (d), “… that the matter be resolved through diversion” in determining whether 
<br/>the diversion is in the interest of justice subject to that subclause (b), regard must be made to the 
<br/>following, the: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>nature and seriousness of the offence; and 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>background and circumstances of the child.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, if this child is going through diversion once or twice and keeps reoffending, that will be 
<br/>another  consideration  that  needs  to  be  considered,  whether  this  child  is  taking  advantage  of  this 
<br/>diversion. Also, the views expressed by the victim and the need to ensure there is public safety. If 
<br/>this particular child under 14 or above 14 is committing and turn to endanger public safety, that will 
<br/>be the grounds whether to consider them for diversion or not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Committee sought clarification from the drafters on the view expressed by honourable 
<br/>Sachida Nand and also the Fiji Police Force, and they have assured us that the powers that will be 
<br/>with the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), that is in Clause13(6), “…may issue guidance on the 
<br/>exercise of discretion. So, the DPP will then decide on the seriousness of the offence, the nature of 
<br/>the offence and other things that should qualify this particular child to continue through diversion.  If 
<br/>the child does not learn from the diversion plan and all other rehabilitation, then the DPP will then 
<br/>decide whether this particular child will still go through the normal criminal justice system.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I just wanted to clarify that point, Mr. Speaker, Sir, where diversion will be applied, or the 
<br/></span><span>discretion will be with the DPP to decide on whether the child will go for diversion or not. How the 
<br/></span><span>juvenile court will then decide the orders on what other punishment the child will have to go through, 
<br/>community work, plus other things that are available there to rehabilitate the child.

<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  fellow 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/>I rise in support of the Child Justice Bill 2024 that was moved in the Parliament by the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="72">Page 72</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024

<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2557 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection.  It is after dinner, Sir, and perhaps, a little story 
<br/>to keep us awake in the course of tonight’s proceedings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Four  to  five  years  ago,  I  was  sitting  in  a  court  just  behind  this  Chambers  waiting  for  my 
<br/>client’s case to be called. The juvenile list was being called, and the first three to appear would have 
<br/>been roughly 13 years, perhaps 14 years old. They looked messy, scrawny, punk hair style and whole 
<br/>size in stature. I imagined, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that they did not attend school and were being charged 
<br/>for gang theft to a house, commonly known as aggravated burglary.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Juvenile Magistrate wanted them to be bailed, so she asked for the parents to be available 
<br/>in the afternoon.  In this case, one of the fathers of the young boys comes and says to the Juvenile 
<br/>Magistrate, “I do not want to be responsible for this boy, if he commits another offence or if he does 
<br/>not turn up to court on his next date.”  The Juvenile Magistrate had no choice but to order that the 
<br/>child be kept as a ward of the State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the new Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, those types of heart wrenching moments will be overcomed 
<br/>because  the  new  law  will  provide  for  a  presumption  in  favour  of  the  release  of  the  child.  Fiji’s 
<br/>Juveniles Act will be 51 years old this year. There are features of the Child Justice Bill  2024 that 
<br/>needs to be highlighted in tonight’s deliberation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Firstly, the age of criminal responsibility as has been highlighted by the speakers before me, 
<br/>has now been moved up to 14 years as opposed to 10 years in the previous regime under the Crimes 
<br/>Act 2009.  I am aware, as has been raised by the honourable Nand, that the police had had some 
<br/>reservations on the enlargement of the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 14. But by some 
<br/>benchmark, Mr. Speaker, Sir, New Zealand has a criminal responsibility of 14, Australia is between 
<br/>12 to 14. For the countries between that bracket, such as Australia, 12 to 14, must be proved that the 
<br/>child knows or understands the context of the criminality that he or she has done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Canada, 12 years; in Africa between 10 years to 14 years; in the United States it is quite 
<br/>interesting, 14 is the age of criminal responsibility, but it is reduced in case of intentional homicide 
<br/>and other life-threatening offences to 12 years. However, an adult between the age of 18 years to 21 
<br/>years, can still be sentenced as a juvenile under the juvenile justice system, if it is proved that the 
<br/>person is mentally immature. So, the increase in the age of criminal responsibility to 14 years is of 
<br/>course supported by science.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Science  that  was  not  developed  in  1973,  when  the  Juveniles  Act  came  into  law.  Science 
<br/>informs  this  decision-making  process  and  confirms  that  children  below  14  years  are  still  in 
<br/>developing stage, physically and most importantly, psychologically.  Afterall, the test of criminal 
<br/>responsibility, is understanding of the wrongness of one’s conduct, and not the physical size of the 
<br/>child.  Understanding  or  knowing,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  you  would  understand,  is  a  cognitive 
<br/>assessment and there is no better guide than science. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the statutory diversion process is now permitted under Clause 12 
<br/>and 16 of the Bill. I remember Mr. Speaker, Sir, in 2006, when I was at Legal Aid Commission of 
<br/>Fiji,  there  was  a  Fiji  Australia  Justice  Sector  Programme  that  had  started  just  to  pilot  a  juvenile 
<br/></span><span>diversion programme only for summary offences without the statutory provisions that would allow 
<br/></span><span>it to happen freely. Magistrates in those times, were urged to use the discretion they had in sentencing, 
<br/>to manoeuvre their way in between sentencing harshly, as the law required of them and diversion, as 
<br/>humanity would demand, especially Mr. Speaker, Sir, for youth offenders.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under the Juvenile Act, protection of juvenile was also provided. But in the 
<br/>advent  of  more  definition  of  human  rights,  science  upgrade  of  police  procedure  in  criminal 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="73">Page 73</a></div>
<div><span>2558 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>interrogations, a more defined criminal justice is needed. Now, police conduct in managing child 
<br/>offending is going to be statutorily imposed.  Section 25 provides the guardrails and prescriptions on 
<br/>how police should conduct themselves in investigations.  Any form of physical force can only be 
<br/>minimally used as necessary and must be documented by a Child Justice Officer. So, we can expect 
<br/>the proceedings would be more informative in the Child Justice Court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The new law would ensure that the timeline of the child encountering the police for the first 
<br/>time and production at Child Justice Court is documented, known, accounted for, and presented in 
<br/>evidence if needed.  It prioritises the interests of the child Mr. Speaker, Sir. That is the focus of the 
<br/>new Bill. How do we address child justice? Provide diversion, remove stigma and still be able to 
<br/>create a pathway for a child offender to become somebody better in his or her own life later. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Child Justice Bill will open the opportunity, create intervention and provide the standpost 
<br/>where they can get to know, that their makeup, Mr. Speaker, Sir, has many good thoughts about them. 
<br/>Thoughts, that if they were to be counted, are more than the sense of the sea. It removes the stigma 
<br/>of conviction and sentence from the life of a child. By removing that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the world 
<br/>becomes a yolk of opportunity for the child, albeit with a small interaction with the law.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I have sat in too many courtrooms, both early in the days as a prosecutor and later as a private 
<br/>practice to see young lives being  wasted. Some of their first altercation with the law, handled by 
<br/>adults as and with a system that treats them as adults by default, creates recidivist who go in and out 
<br/>of prison their entire life. Imagine, Mr. Speaker, Sir, if their first appearance, they would have been 
<br/>diverted,  rehabilitated,  followed  up  and  strongly  urged  to  reform.  Their  lives  would  have  been 
<br/>markedly different from the recidivists they are today. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We have an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir, to do right to our future generation, even if they 
<br/>fought.  The Child Justice Bill will ensure that the rights are fully observed. Their treatment is that 
<br/>of  a  child.  The  environment  is  calm  and  homely,  and  every  opportunity  to  create  a  better  life  is 
<br/>provided.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The parent is involved under Clause 21. The role of the Child Justice Officer is well defined 
<br/>and must be respected by police at all costs. Manner of police interview is now going to be regulated 
<br/>by Clause 24, and the police will be required to develop officers within their ranks in special training 
<br/>in handling child justice.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is my contribution to the Child Justice Bill 2024, and I would urge all 
<br/>honourable  Members  of  Parliament  to  support  the  motion  that  is  brought  in  by  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection. Thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I think all the honourable members have contributed to the debate on this 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill.  I now call on the Minister for Women, Children and Social Protection to speak in reply. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.D. TABUYA-Mr. Speaker. Sir, and honourable Members, the passage of this Bill 
<br/>will  not  be  a  standalone  victory  if  it  happens  tonight.  It  is  really  going  to  be  part  of  a  broader 
<br/>commitment to try something new, something that is evidence-based and, yes, there may be differing 
<br/></span><span>opinions, but they are just that - opinions.  They are myths that need to be dispelled and that is where 
<br/></span><span>I seek the assistance of us, as Members of Parliament and as representatives of the people, to dispel 
<br/>those  myths.  When  you  meet  with  your  communities  and  explain  to  them,  I  think  they  will 
<br/>understand.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When we work together with the Child Care Protection Bill 2024, which will come up next, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we really are laying a foundation for a future where each child gets another chance. Talking about

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>second chances, third chances, this is it. It needs to begin from childhood, not when they are older or 
<br/>when they become adults.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to sincerely thank the Standing Committee on Justice, 
<br/>Law and Human Rights, especially in sitting beyond normal hours, and their hard work to bring the 
<br/>Bills in this sitting before the end of this Parliament session. I thank them very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  also  wish  to  thank  our  development  partners,  especially  UNICEF,  for  working  with  the 
<br/>Ministry  to  bring  these  Bills.  These  Bills  have  been  12  years  in  the  making,  and  we  have  had 
<br/>contributions, and I acknowledge the contributions and hard work of my predecessors, the former 
<br/>Ministers for Women. I thank the leadership and the FijiFirst Government for initiating this, and we 
<br/>have continued this work and here it is today.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, this is something for all of us to celebrate and all of us to be proud of. It is historic. It has 
<br/>been a week of history created here, and I think our children will remember us when they become 
<br/>adults, that we have made this change.  I, therefore, seek the support of Parliament to vote in favour 
<br/>of this Bill. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- The Parliament will vote.
