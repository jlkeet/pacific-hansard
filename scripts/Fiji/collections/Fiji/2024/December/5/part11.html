<div><span>Defence hereby submits to Parliament the Consolidated Review Report on Savusavu Town Council 
<br/>2011 to 2013 Annual Reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Municipal Councils in Fiji are legislated under the Local Government Act 1972.  Municipal 
<br/>councils, like Savusavu Town Council, provides overall policy direction to maintain and improve the 
<br/>quality of services and facilities for their ratepayers.  Savusavu Town Council serves an estimated 
<br/>population of 6,000 in the greater Savusavu area and is responsible for the provision and maintenance 
<br/>of a wide range of services to its ratepayers and residents.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Report  captures  the  various  activities  reported  in  the  three  Annual 
<br/>Reports from 2011 to 2013. Given the number of years that have lapsed, about 10 years to 11 years, 
<br/>the Committee made no assessment on the efficiency or otherwise of Savusavu Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Committee  is,  however,  grateful  to  the  Council  for  the  information  and  data  that  are 
<br/>presented in these Annual Reports.  The Committee is of the view that a consistent reporting structure 
<br/>would assist in the fair analysis of the Reports.  The Ministry of Housing and Local Government to 
<br/>work in collaboration with town councils to identify a standard reporting template for use in all its 
<br/>future annual reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to thank the Savusavu Town Council for compiling and submitting its annual reports 
<br/>from 2011 to 2013.  I also thank the Members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
<br/>Defence,  and  of  course  the  hardworking  secretariat  of  the  Committee  for  the  compilation  of  this 
<br/>bipartisan report.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With this Report, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has dealt with all the reports that were referred to it in the last two Parliament sittings.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On behalf of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, I submit this Report 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Report handed to the Secretary-General) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 121(5), I hereby move:
