<h3>FIJI WORLD HERITAGE BILL 2023</h3>
<div><span>FIJI WORLD HERITAGE BILL 2023  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of  Parliament on Friday, 
<br/>15</span><span>th</span><span> September, 2023, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 (Bill No. 25/2023), be debated, voted upon and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 was introduced 
<br/>as a key legislative measure to safeguard Fiji’s natural and cultural heritage, ensuring its alignment 
<br/>with the international obligations under the UNESCO World Heritage Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fiji became a State party to the World Heritage Convention on 21</span><span>st</span><span> November, 1990, joining 
<br/>a global commitment to preserve sites of outstanding universal value. Adopted in the 1972 World 
<br/>Heritage  Conference,  the  Convention  provides  a  framework  for  protecting  cultural  and  natural 
<br/>heritage worldwide.  As a signatory, Fiji pledged to implement legislative administrative measures 
<br/>to uphold its responsibilities under the Convention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In September 2023, the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights was tasked 
<br/>which scrutinising the Heritage Bill with a mandate to review its provisions and report findings to 
<br/>Parliament.  This  process  ensures  that  the  legislation  was  comprehensive  and  reflective  of  Fiji's 
<br/>unique heritage needs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Heritage Bill 2023 seeks to domesticate the principles of World Heritage Convention, 
<br/>providing a framework for recognising, protecting and managing sites with potential and outstanding 
<br/>universal values. The Bill establishes mechanisms such as the Fiji Heritage Council, the Fiji Register, 
<br/>the  Trust  Funds,  along  with  provisions  for  buffer  zones  to  safeguard  surrounding  areas.  These 
<br/>measures aim to preserve Fiji’s heritage for future generations, while fostering a sense of national 
<br/>pride and cultural identity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  the  issues  noted  by  Committee,  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and  Human 
<br/>Rights identified several key issues with the Heritage Bill 2023. Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may just outline 
<br/>here, on two occasions, the draft Bill has lapsed before Parliament and it was initiated again by the 
<br/>Coalition Government.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One  of  the  first  issues  that  was  highlighted  is  the  ‘outstanding  universal  value’  and  its 
<br/></span><span>meaning.  The phrase may undermine the values and rights of indigenous and local communities by 
<br/></span><span>imposing  an  external  perspective  on  heritage  significance.  This  is  one  of  the  issues  that  the 
<br/>Committee had to deal with it here and tried to explain to those who appear before them. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The definition of the word ‘management’. The narrow definition of ‘management’ in the Bill 
<br/>fails  to  adequately  incorporate  indigenous  Fijian  cultural  aspects  that  limit  the  scope  of  heritage 
<br/>preservation. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2538 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another one is the definition of the word ‘nominated property’. The term does not sufficiently 
<br/>link  cultural  heritage  to  indigenous  culture,  potentially  overlooking  indigenous  contributions  to 
<br/>heritage.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The term ‘buffer zones’.  There is a need to specify the size and extent of the protective buffer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>zones around heritage sites to prevent damage from nearby developments. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue is the Council composition.  The Heritage Council should include community 
<br/>representatives  from  areas  with  listed  heritage  sites,  to  ensure  local  and  indigenous  issues  are 
<br/>adequately addressed in Heritage Management decisions.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  is  the  extent  of  the  changes  made  to  the  draft?    The  Standing  Committee  proposed 
<br/>several key amendments to the Heritage Bill 2023, to ensure clarity, precision, and in alignment with 
<br/>Fiji's obligations under the 1972 World Heritage Convention. The key proposed changes include the:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>

<div><span>•</span><span>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bill Title 
<br/>The title is proposed to be amended to ‘Fiji World Heritage Bill’, to clearly reflect its focus 
<br/>on World Heritage Sites and avoid confusion with broader heritage terms.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Short Title Amendment 
<br/>The Bill’s purpose is proposed to be redefined to highlight Fiji's commitment to UNESCO 
<br/>World Heritage Convention, emphasising its obligation and guidelines.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Inclusion of Tentative World Heritage Sites 
<br/>The Fiji Register is proposed to include both sites on the UNESCO Tentative List and 
<br/>the World Heritage Property List, ensuring a comprehensive documentation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Composition of the Council 
<br/>The Fiji World Heritage Council membership is proposed to be reduced from 12 to 8 
<br/>members for efficiency, with key stakeholders retained for relevant experience.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Nomination process 
<br/>Sites would be required to be first nominated to the Fiji Register, before considered for 
<br/>Tentative List or World Heritage List.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Stricter Penalties  
<br/></span><span>The Committee proposed an increase  in  fines and imprisonment term for violations, 
<br/></span><span>impacting heritage sites, with higher penalties for individuals and corporations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I noted that there has  been some slight  increase in fines. Normally,  this  is seen as a 
<br/>deterrence, but as you understand, Mr. Speaker, Sir, these are actually the maximum 
<br/>fines. There was  an issue for the local  communities  whether these fines reflect  their 
<br/>needs, but we will rely, when these matters come before the court because these are the 
<br/>maximum. Normally, fines will be imposed, or the penalties will be commensurate with 
<br/>the extent of the offence.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Buffer Zones 
<br/>The establishment of buffer zones is proposed to apply to the Tentative List and World 
<br/>Heritage Sites, providing additional protection from nearby developments.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What is the Minister's role?  The Minister would be required to formally declare potential 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>World Heritage Sites before nomination, aligning with international process. One of the key issues 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2539 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>too that the Committee dealt with is the deliberation on the funding and management.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The heading for Part 7 was amended to recognition and management heritage places and is 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>proposed to be revised to establish a clear funding and management structure of heritage sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  amendments  made  to  the  Bill  were  extensive,  reflecting  a  thorough 
<br/>review  of  its  provisions.  Clarification  of  terminology,  streamlining  of  council  membership  and 
<br/>enhanced penalty structures are particularly significant in improving the Bill’s practical application. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  emphasis  of  Fiji’s  obligation  under  1972  World  Heritage  Convention,  along  with  the 
<br/>establishment of the clearer process for site nomination management, ensures that Fiji's heritage sites 
<br/>are better protected and managed in line with international standards.  These changes stem from the 
<br/>Bill’s alignment with UNESCO guidelines and reinforces its ability to safeguard Fiji's unique cultural  
<br/>natural heritage for future generations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, a few days ago, there was a reference made by honourable Premila Kumar 
<br/>as to the extent of the changes made.  The changes are significant because once the policy changes, 
<br/>then it will be reflected in the subsequent in terms of the use of terminology.  That probably reflects 
<br/>that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I endorse and commend this Bill to this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate and I have five 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Speakers.  Each speaker will have only eight minutes to speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S.  KOYA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  the  honourable  Minister  for  Justice  for  his 
<br/>presentation of the Bill, but most of all, I want to thank the Chairperson of the Committee and the 
<br/>Committee Members, who have done a lot of hard work to get this Bill into the House as quick as 
<br/>they did.  I sat on the Committee for quite a while, and I understood the nuances behind what had 
<br/>actually transpired.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, I want to take the opportunity to thank the honourable Prime Minister, who referred this 
<br/>back to the Committee because this was originally brought under Standing Order 51.   He saw the 
<br/>light, Sir, and sent it back so that it could be thorough.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, just some background on this particular Bill, the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Justice said that this had gone through previous Parliaments, et cetera, and had a bit of a long life.  
<br/>One of the reasons why this Bill had come through initially, so that we would be compliant in terms 
<br/>of Levuka.  So, it was pretty much, when it was originally done, it was like a Levuka-centric Bill.  
<br/>But opposed to Levuka getting its World Heritage status, it needed to be modified, it needed to be 
<br/>strengthened, it needed to look at how we would deal with other sites once they come up, all the 
<br/>places that required application to go get listed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The list, Mr. Speaker, Sir, on how you get into the World Heritage Listing  is actually not 
<br/>easy.    You  have  to  tick  many  boxes  to  actually  get  there.    I  think  as  has  been  spelt  out  by  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Minister for Justice, the criteria for the assessment of it is that you must be of outstanding 
<br/></span><span>universal value.  Some of the things in there, Sir, the nominated property, and I think there are about 
<br/>10 or 12 of them, are just some examples, and you must represent the masterpiece of human creative 
<br/>genius.  You must exhibit the important interchange of human values over a span of time, and the list 
<br/>goes on, and whether it is on the sea, whether it is on the land, there are many things in Fiji, and this 
<br/>relates to our tourism industry also.  Once you get onto the World Heritage Listing, it becomes a 
<br/>tourism attraction, so this value-adds to our tourism industry.

<div><span> Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said, to get on to it, it is actually not easy.  But along with the list 
<br/>that it has with respect to getting on to the World Heritage Listing, there is a lot of difficulties that 
<br/>we would have faced if it came in its original form.  That is why I take my hat off to the Committee, 
<br/>Sir, for having done such a phenomenal amount of work, purely because there are sensitive issues in 
<br/>this.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the things that was most important and something that everyone needs to know, is that 
<br/>the minute you go and try and get listed on the World Heritage site, you have to have a buffer zone 
<br/>that actually covers that area that you are actually trying to list.  When you have these buffer zones, 
<br/>you are talking about people's land, people's livelihood, et cetera, it may be encroaching upon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are issues that need to be dealt with very sensitively when we actually  do make the 
<br/>application to do this.  I remember, Sir, visiting Sigatoka Sand Dunes and the village nearby and the 
<br/>questions that were raised at the time were very valid.  They said, so if you put the buffer zone around 
<br/>this particular place, we have already used up that particular area. What is going to happen to the 
<br/>people who actually live there?  So, there are genuine questions that came about with all of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Some of you may know that have a particular bat cave in Vanualevu, the name slips my mind 
<br/>at the moment of the area, but that particular bat cave exists and it could be one of the World Heritage 
<br/>Site Listing, it could go on, but there were issues because the actual cave and the bats are looked after 
<br/>by the villages of the surrounding area, but they do not own the land.  It is actually a piece of freehold 
<br/>land that was given to them, I am not sure, maybe the Chairman might be able to correct me, I am 
<br/>not sure if it was given back to the State, but it is actually owned by a particular person. So, these 
<br/>things need to be dealt with, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Maybe, the State needs to step in to ensure that it goes 
<br/>back to the native landowners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all of you have seen a $100 note on which a cockroach like photo exists, 
<br/>that is something that is edible.  It actually exists in Navua, Sir.  It only comes up once every eight 
<br/>years,  and  it  is  a  delicacy.    So,  these  are  the  things  that  we  have  within  our  country  that  we  can 
<br/>actually put in, in terms of listing. We take these things for granted, but it must be done very carefully.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are very sensitive issues that come about with respect to land and whatever is in it and 
<br/>on  it,  and  I  think,  Mr.  Speaker,  the  issues  that  I  have  actually  raised  were  of  genuine  concern.  I 
<br/>remember the first time we actually visited Levuka to try and get some discussions done, they did 
<br/>not turn up because they were angry, because they were not sure, because they were not able to do 
<br/>many things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Once this Bill comes into place, there is a long road ahead to get things right and this particular 
<br/>Bill, I think in the next Budget, honourable Minister for Finance, we might have to sit down and have 
<br/>a look at it and probably get some funding in it on a yearly basis so we can actually take care of these 
<br/>things, so we can actually get some research done, so we can have a good team to work on it so that 
<br/>we protect what we have, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  It is now something that will have to be included in our 
<br/>Budget on a yearly basis so that we get the system right, so that we can put these things on the World 
<br/>Heritage Listing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, once again, I commend the entire Committee that has done a lot of work on 
<br/></span><span>it and I commend the initial people that were actually on it who drafted the Bill.  As a matter of fact, 
<br/>we  faced  a  lot  of  difficulty  because  those  who  initially  drafted  were  no  longer  at  the  Solicitor-
<br/>General's  Office.  So,  it  was  a  very  hard  job  trying  to  even  get  the  Attorney-General's  Office  to 
<br/>actually provide all the necessary information.  I also commend to the former Attorney-General and 
<br/>Minister for Justice, who was very, very approachable when we were trying to get this done.

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I agree with what is in it, I commend what is before us and we agree with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Bill being put forward before the House. I thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to make my contribution 
<br/>to the motion that is before the House, just a continuation with respect to the Fiji World Heritage Bill 
<br/>2023.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023, in its current form that has been amended 
<br/>from the Solicitor-General’s Office, is perfect. I wish to inform this august House that this is the Bill 
<br/>that everyone has been waiting for.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are three issues, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to raise with regards to the Bill that we are 
<br/>speaking about. Firstly, this has been a long overdue Bill and the weight of this long overdue Bill has 
<br/>been carried much about Levuka, given that the introduction of this Bill, as rightly said by honourable 
<br/>Koya when it was tabled in its first instance, was Levuka-centric, the wording in its name itself had 
<br/>highlighted Heritage Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upon further consultation and upon advice from the Department of Heritage, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, we came to find out that it was to be focussed on sites that had World Heritage status.  Hence, if 
<br/>you see the amendment, honourable Members, there is an amendment in the name of the Bill which 
<br/>says that it is only centred on World Heritage status sites in Fiji and it has been long overdue for this 
<br/>and that has touched on the lives of the people of Levuka, given that it has been coming through the 
<br/>Standing Committee on Social Affairs, then it went to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and 
<br/>Human Rights, it has lapsed and has come again in this Parliament term.  We are very fortunate that 
<br/>we are finally here to have this Bill passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Secondly, Mr. Speaker, with regards to the substance of what the Bill has entailed in terms of 
<br/>our  world  heritage  status  in  Fiji,  firstly,  we  are  meeting  our  requirements  as  per  the  UNESCO 
<br/>Convention.  Secondly, if you go to Levuka, you will find out that they have raised a lot of issues 
<br/>with regards to this Heritage Bill.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, after the previous Friday, we finally got the green light from the landowners, and it 
<br/>had been one of the challenging times for us to get them.  They are owners of the buffer zones, as 
<br/>was articulated by the honourable Minister for Justice and honourable Koya.  We did not have time 
<br/>to consult them and that was our last consultation, and for them to give their blessings towards the 
<br/>amended Fiji World Heritage Bill in its passing, it is truly a remarkable achievement with regards to 
<br/>the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support the motion before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to contribute to this 
<br/>particular Bill that is before us.  As very rightfully said by honourable Members who have spoken 
<br/>before me, it has taken quite a time to amend this Bill and bring it in the form that it can be presented 
<br/>into this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to thank the Chairman and the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human 
<br/></span><span>Rights for inviting me to the Committee after I objected to the initial motion that it should not be 
<br/>rushed  through  and  should  be  passed  on  to  the  Committee  for  deliberation.    We  had  a  thorough 
<br/>discussion, and I can see that the name of the Bill has changed to ‘Fiji World Heritage Site’, focussing 
<br/>mostly on Levuka rather than all the other national heritage sites. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="57">Page 57</a></div>
<div><span>2542 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I was going through the Bill and I would like to quickly go over some of the 
<br/>Clauses  that  still  seem  to  be  a  bit  confusing  and  there  were  certain  recommendations  that  were 
<br/>accepted.  The first one is about the Fiji World Heritage Council.  It is good to see that the number 
<br/>has drastically decreased.  It was a very big council at first but now it is eight.  My only concern is, 
<br/>if we are focussing specifically on Levuka, I was told that we can co-opt someone to be part of the 
<br/>council but that person might not have the voting rights as a co-opted person. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the only site, Mr. Speaker, whereby we are dealing with people - Fijians.  In all the 
<br/>other national heritage sites, we are basically dealing with animals or forests.  So, at least, they could 
<br/>be included. In the near future, if we are going to review the Bill, we might have to consider, not just 
<br/>the  ratepayers  of  Levuka,  but  also  the  landowning  unit.    Someone  should  represent  them  in  this 
<br/>council because their views and ideas should be very much incorporated and heard in the council as 
<br/>well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing the honourable Minister might want to clarify is on the function of the council.  
<br/>Now that we are focusing specifically on Levuka as a World Heritage Site, Clause 8(1)(a)(i); “the 
<br/>recognition and management of places in Fiji having potential and actual world heritage values.”  Is 
<br/>it still with the World Heritage Council or is it something that is under National Trust of Fiji now 
<br/>because  there  is  a  National  Trust  Act  as  well  which  manages  all  the  heritage  sites.    So  are  we 
<br/>duplicating or is it something we need to look into? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing is establishing, maintaining and updating a database of Fiji’s heritage sites.  
<br/>Again, this is something that was dealt with by the National Trust of Fiji.  So, if we are just focusing 
<br/>only  for Levuka, these people will have one register and National  Trust  of Fiji  will have another 
<br/>register, so how will they communicate with each other, or is it preferable to have one register rather 
<br/>than having two? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moving on further in the Bill, Mr. Speaker, there is similar concern in Part 4 – Fiji Register, 
<br/>whether Clause 16(a) and (b) should be part of it or as we are saying, this particular Bill is only for 
<br/>the World Heritage Site and whether (a) and (b) is null and void now, a potential world heritage place 
<br/>and on a tentative list. So, who keeps this list, is it the National Trust or is it the World Heritage Site, 
<br/>because this is only dealing with one particular site now?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, there are some changes here and there, and it might be confusing. As I was saying, the 
<br/>initial  Bill  was  overlapping,  the  Fiji  Museum,  the  National  Trust,  Heritage  Department  that  was 
<br/>formerly  previously  with  the Ministry of Education and then the Council. So, there were a lot of 
<br/>overlapping and these are some of the things that we might want to fine tune if we actually opt to 
<br/>review this particular Bill in the near future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the other one I would like to support, is on the increase of penalties. Again, 
<br/>it is very important to protect the sites and there needs to be hefty penalties in place if we want to 
<br/>actually protect our national heritage sites. But very well explained by the Minister that these are the 
<br/>maximum depending on the kind of damage or destruction that is actually done. The Magistrate or 
<br/>the Court might decide what would be the fine that is going to be placed on.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But one of the very important things, Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this and we also found during 
<br/></span><span>our time was, we need a high level of advocacy in Levuka, especially in Levuka because the initial 
<br/>understanding of the people was that they cannot do anything with regards to their building, and that 
<br/>it had deteriorated to such as state, that now some of those buildings cannot be maintained. But it 
<br/>was not the case at that point in time, I believe the advocacy was not there. The face needs to be the 
<br/>same and the interior, that can be changed, but at least the face would actually look the way it is 
<br/>supposed to be, as it was. We cannot actually change it, we can maintain it, but it should remain in 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2543 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the form that it was when it was actually built.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  a  lot  of  advocacy  is  needed,  and  for  that  to  actually  eventuate  and  to  implement  this 
<br/>particular Bill, especially in Levuka, we need to ensure that we have an office based there for town 
<br/>and country planning because the application is coming all the way to Suva, and by the time it goes 
<br/>back, it becomes a very tedious and long process. I urge the Government to set-up a department so 
<br/>that people can be addressed and their processes when they do an application, can be expedited and 
<br/>handled by someone sitting in Levuka, rather than people of Levuka travelling all the way to Suva 
<br/>and trying to get things done over here to renovate the buildings. We have seen that some of the 
<br/>buildings  has  gone  down  and  they  are  more  no  more.  So,  in  order  to  actually  prevent  that  from 
<br/>happening in the future we need to set-up our department of Town and Country Planning and a staff 
<br/>to be based in Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that is very important, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we might want to consider in the 
<br/>future is whether we still want to have the whole of Levuka Town as a World Heritage site or we 
<br/>want to specifically select a couple of buildings, so that other buildings can be brought down and 
<br/>new buildings can be constructed to increase the economic value of Levuka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Majority of the building owners they are very much interested to be part of this particular 
<br/>programme,  but  some  of  them  they  actually  want  to.  So,  while  we  are  protecting  some  of  the 
<br/>properties  as  a  heritage  site,  we  can  allow  some  of  the  building  owners  to  come  up  with  a  new 
<br/>building. So that economic activity also increases because at the moment we do not have enough 
<br/>rooms if we want to take tourists to Levuka to see these heritage sites, and then they have to go a bit 
<br/>further away from the buffer zone to have resorts and and hotels built.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a nutshell, I thank the Committee for bringing this particular Bill and I 
<br/>request if they can consider the recommendation in the further review. Thank you and I support the 
<br/>Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.D. BULITAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Bill that is before Parliament 
<br/>and that is the Fiji World Heritage Bill, 2023. Before I go further, I just like to respond to few issues 
<br/>that were raised by the honourable Maharaj and that is on Clause 6 on the World Heritage Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Heritage Council establishes those that are there in Clause 6(2), it comprises all 
<br/>the Permanent Secretaries and those responsible for the Trust, Fiji Museum plus other representatives 
<br/>from the Town and Country Planning. This Council is for those that will be key decision makers on 
<br/>part of Government that will be overlooking these World Heritage Sites.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For those that are in the management in the World Heritage Site they will form a management 
<br/>committee. This committee will include the residence that are there at that World Heritage Site, like 
<br/>Levuka and it will also  include those landowners that are in  the buffer zone. They will be in  the 
<br/>committees. They will not be part of this Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What  this  Council  will  do,  will  then  work  with  that  Committee,  and  that  Committee  is 
<br/></span><span>provided with funding. If you look at the funding that is there in Clause 30 of the Bill, the Council 
<br/></span><span>will then approve the funding where this Committee will then manage those World Heritage Sites 
<br/>and also include the buffer zones where the landowners too surrounding the UNESCO Levuka World 
<br/>Heritage Site will also benefit and managing that, so they can minimise the impact on the core World 
<br/>Heritage Site.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the register that you have raised, in terms of the register for the National Trust and also 
<br/>the register that is established here. If you go into the definition of register it talks about the Fiji’s 
<br/>register of places established under Section 16.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If  you  go  to  Clause  16,  it  establishes  the  Fiji  Register  for  the  registration  of  any  place 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>dominated to be: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to become a World Heritage Site, and a potential World Heritage place. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Tentative list to meet the requirements. After meeting those requirements with UNESCO 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>then you can be declared or listed and seen to be a World Heritage Site.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, that is why this particular register that honourable Maharaj said, whether there will be 
<br/>two registers, it will be all in one register where you will have in that register those that are potential 
<br/>world heritage places. They will go for nomination, and if they pass, they will be listed as a tentative 
<br/>list under UNESCO. If they go pass that, then they will be declared or listed as a World Heritage 
<br/>Site. So, it will be all in one register so that there is no double system. It will complement each other. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  important  thing  given  one  of  the  key  issue  in  this  particular  Bill  is  the  World 
<br/>Heritage Site needs to have this outstanding universal way, and that is what we are protecting in this 
<br/>particular Bill. And now in Fiji there is only one World Heritage area that is under world list and that 
<br/>is Levuka Town.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We had issues when we went there earlier with the residences of Levuka, given the processes 
<br/>they have to follow in renovating their homes and also in trying to develop other businesses. But the 
<br/>passing of this Bill will then allow a pathway in Clause 29 that will allow the process of how the 
<br/>applications, whoever wants to do any development will go to the Council, be approved through the 
<br/>management plan and also the commencement of the Council will be requested after it goes to the 
<br/>Town Council Planning or the Director of the Town and Country Planning.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were issues raised in Levuka. Opposite of the Mavida Hotel, there is a service station 
<br/>that was built two years or three years ago. The issues were brought up on how that particular service 
<br/>station  or  how  that  businessperson  was  allowed  by  the  Town  and  Country  Planning  to  build  that 
<br/>particular  service  station.  Because  there  was  no  law  available  at  that  time  that  prevented  a  new 
<br/>development to take place in that World Heritage Site.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This particular Bill, when it comes into force, Clause 29 now provides a procedure on how 
<br/>the Director Town and Country Planning will need to adhere to this particular Council on what type 
<br/>of development to be done there so it does not have more destruction on what we call this outstanding 
<br/>universal value in Levuka. I think it was done during that time, it was surprising given probably two 
<br/>years or three years ago, I do not know who was the Minister responsible, I will not name. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That is a concern that was raised in Levuka, given that Levuka was listed as a World Heritage 
<br/>Site back in  2013. In 2013, the Government  then, had the view of protecting Levuka as a World 
<br/>Heritage Site but we do not know what happened later when that development was allowed, given 
<br/>the intention there was to protect Levuka. Those are a few things that I would like raise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other thing that we clarified with the Council and the Department of Heritage was a buffer 
<br/>zone.  It will not affect the rights of the land-owning units. If they want to go and use their plantation 
<br/>or build their houses, that does not affect anything. If only they want to go and lease out their land, 
<br/>then they will have to go through iTLTB that will have to get their consent from the Council on what 
<br/>type of development will happen on the lease, so it does not have an impact on the whole heritage 
<br/>area. So those are a few things, Mr. Speaker, Sir that I would like to comment on, and I fully support  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="60">Page 60</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Child Justice Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2545 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Just to end on a few things that also came up, and it was good that the honourable Koya has 
<br/>raised this,  because of one of these issues is on the historical injustice in Levuka and probably a land 
<br/>claims tribunal to be set up, given these are some of the interests from the people of Lovoni, where 
<br/>the honourable Minister will know, they have some historical claims on the land and also the </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>na Tui Levuka</span><span> if a land claims tribunal can be set up and their interest can be brought forward on 
<br/>those claims with their evidence to prove that there were traditional owners.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Already  it  will  be  a  Heritage  Bill,  if  the  settlement  happens,  the  honourable  Minister  for 
<br/>Lands, and probably this land can go back to native. It did not happen before, it was not allowed in 
<br/>the previous Government, but we hope that under this new Coalition Government that can happen. It 
<br/>will give much freedom and justice to those who need them, especially the landowners in Levuka.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to support the Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023. Some 
<br/>may  argue  that  World  Heritage  is  a  foreign  concept.  The  principle  that  guides  its  successful 
<br/>implementation at the national level, is best left to the State party like Fiji. We need to embrace this 
<br/>and dictates its implementation, ensuring the careful blend of traditional and indigenous values.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill shows our deep commitment that heritage matters. We are sowing 
<br/>a culture of respect and revenge for the legacy that our forefathers have left us.  We need to embrace 
<br/>this, so that our children of tomorrow can celebrate their values. The Bill is a necessity.  Fiji rectified 
<br/>the 1972 World Heritage Convention in 1970.  It is a requirement for State parties to take appropriate 
<br/>legal  measures  necessary  for  the 
<br/>identifications,  protection,  conservations,  presentations, 
<br/>rehabilitations of its heritages. We are a nation that champion discipline and honour at international 
<br/>stage. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  the  same  way,  we  are  committed  to  honouring  our  obligation  under  the  1972  World 
<br/>Heritage  Convention.  This  Bill  is  comprehensive.  Comprehensive  because,  it  has  gone  through  a 
<br/>series of consultation.  Concerns, aspirations of resource owners, our people and our communities 
<br/>collated during these consultations, have been factored into the Bill. The latest of these consultations 
<br/>was with the landowning units, that traditionally own land located within the buffer zone that protects 
<br/>the Levuka nominated property. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  were  never  consulted,  and  I  have  been  reliably  informed  that  the  land-owning  units 
<br/>welcome  the  initiative  and  the  purpose  of  the  Bill  which  was  then  explained  to  them  for  ease  of 
<br/>understanding.  The  bill  paves  the  way  for  the  legal  protections  of  Fiji  Natural  Cultural  Heritage, 
<br/>expressing  our  shared  commitment  to  preserving  a  legacy  for  the  future  generations.  This  is  our 
<br/>moment and the only time we can work collectively to safeguard what’s ours, is for now and in the 
<br/>future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker Sir, the Bill is not impediment to development.  Over the years, especially in 
<br/>Levuka, and on the island of Ovalau, our citizen has been misinformed and ill advised that Heritage 
<br/>halts development.  These benefits  spans from  social infrastructure to  economic returns which are 
<br/>crucial for the management of the site or place.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bill enhances our ability to protect Fiji rich culture, legacy and makes 
<br/>it easier for resource owners to engage with the heritage regulations, the streamlining of regulatory 
<br/>process,  offering  a  more  efficient  and  user-friendly  approach  to  managing  heritage  properties  is 
<br/>expected to benefit Heritage site owners, developers and the nation by providing clear guideline and 
<br/>reducing administrative hurdles.

<div><span> Fiji World Heritage Bill 2023 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Bill promotes sustainable system.  One of the biggest challenges faced by the heritage 
<br/>sector has been the provision of management plan to support site or place managing community given 
<br/>approach to management and the availability of sustainable funding. The Bill now provides for this 
<br/>missing core arrangement to support the successful management of potential world heritage place in 
<br/>Fiji. Fiji tentative and world heritage listed sites, this is also extended to support the demarcations 
<br/>and management of buffer area that supports the core Heritage Protection area. This is the first for 
<br/>Heritage related legislation in the country. Our new Fiji Sustainable Tourism Framework promotes 
<br/>culture and heritage as a key pillar.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourist  based  are  geared  towards  this  interactive  experience.  However,  Fiji  lacks  cultural 
<br/>program, content in our heritage space, such as Levuka Town, Navala Village, Sigatoka Sand Dunes, 
<br/>lack the financial support and incentive to be remain viable. Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am indeed grateful 
<br/>to be Chairman of the Standing Committee on Justice, Law, Human Rights and its esteemed Members 
<br/>from both sides of the House for their invaluable support and careful scrutiny of the elements of the 
<br/>Bill. This has contributed immensely to the finalised amendment Bill we have which I firmly believe 
<br/>is ready to be passed by Parliament. I could never be firm in saying that the Bill is ready for passing 
<br/>to be an Act, fostering recognition and management of heritage place and space, including properties 
<br/>that have the potential to become world heritage sites. Mr. Speaker, I fully support the Bill. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, I would like to thank the  Committee 
<br/>and its Chairman for their hard work, visiting Levuka, of course, Ovalau. As we all know, the old 
<br/>capital of Fiji, there is a lot of history.  Thank you, honourable Bulitavu, for picking out a story about 
<br/>the people from Lovoni.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  have  just  been  handed  a  note  from  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  that  some  </span><span>i  taukei  ni 
<br/>qoliqoli</span><span>  from  Makogai  are  under  the  VKB  with  the  people  of  Navatu.    I  think  the  other  day,  an 
<br/>honourable Member from  the other side was talking  about  Navosa, yes,  indeed. As we deal  with 
<br/>some  of  these  key  issues,  it  resonates  with  the  search  for  the  truth  and,  of  course,  the  Coalition 
<br/>Government is committed to doing that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Imagine, eight years have lapsed, and this Bill has been going round and round.  Honourable 
<br/>Koya mentioned about the role of the honourable Prime Minister.  Yes, we have a Prime Minister 
<br/>who cares and listens, not the Prime Minister who existed in the past Administration. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.D.  TURAGA.-  Yes,  we  concede,  we  go,  we  change,  we  listen  and  we  have  the 
<br/>political will, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  We will do it, just like we did it last year.  Honourable Prasad said 
<br/>that.  If anything, it is the demonstration of who your leader is.  Unfortunately, you cannot say it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Too much hot air.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.D. TURAGA.- Mr. Speaker, why disinformation exists is because people from here 
<br/>do not go to Levuka.  When you carry out planning, you meet with the very people.  If you had done 
<br/>this from the beginning, we would not be here, but we are here, we listen and that is the hallmark of 
<br/></span><span>democracy.  The people of Levuka are so grateful.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is going to help improve the area’s image and pride.  It promotes 
<br/>the community beautification for Levuka.  When you talk about Levuka, you talk about Lomaiviti - 
<br/>the heart of Fiji.  It also builds opportunities and a healthy productive community partnership.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2547 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Bulitavu and honourable Vasu mentioned about the Council.  In 2022 and last 
<br/>year, there were a lot of engagements with the people of Levuka. I have begun to explain to them 
<br/>why.  Why they understood because we just sat and </span><span>talanoa</span><span> with them.   This Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>is the gateway but it is not one size fits all. Yes, we recognise the other things that needs to be done.   
<br/>It will be done, but first get the Bill endorsed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this Bill is under the Ministry for iTaukei Affairs, but at one time, it was 
<br/>with the Ministry of Education.  One of the reasons why it has laboured on is because it has just been 
<br/>moving around.  We are committed that under the steady leadership of the honourable Minister for 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs and, of course, with the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, we need the financial 
<br/>support.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the key issues with the people of Levuka is, what is the point of preserving when they 
<br/>cannot  be  assisted  financially?    As  we  speak,  the  restoration  of  the  Cession  has  not  been  fully 
<br/>completed. We have discussed at length, we are so grateful that we have come to an agreement, and 
<br/>this is the way forward for Fiji - by endorsing this Bill before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I thank everyone for their contribution, I fully endorse this Bill before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.
