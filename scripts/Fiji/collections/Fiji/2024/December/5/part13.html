<div><span>Status of Disaster Preparedness 
<br/>(Question No. 293/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. L.S. QEREQERETABUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  update  Parliament  on  the  Ministry’s  status  of  disaster  preparedness, 
<br/>considering we are into the hurricane season? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  S.R.  DITOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  the  honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition, honourable Ministers and honourable Members of Parliament; </span><span>ni sa bula 
<br/>vinaka</span><span>.    I  rise  in  Parliament  today  to  share  several  ongoing  initiatives;  the  essential  disaster 
<br/>preparedness activities undertaken by the Ministry through the National Disaster Risk Management 
<br/>Office (NDMO).  I wish to begin by highlighting the real impacts of climate change on Small Island 
<br/>Developing States (SIDS).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The recent COP29 that concluded last month, stressed that SIDS were at most risk from the 
<br/>adverse impacts of climate change.  For our small island nation of Fiji, climate change is causing 
<br/>natural hazards to become more severe, happening more often in affected areas.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, by way of background, Fiji is located between two major tectonic plates, 
<br/>the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate.  Due to subduction zone movements of tectonic plates 
<br/>around Fiji, earthquake activities are occurring regularly.  Earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean Rim 
<br/></span><span>including, for instance, South America and Japan, can also generate tsunami wave threats for Fiji.  
<br/></span><span>And  an  island  nation  with  numerous  maritime  islands,  coastal  communities,  coastal  roads  and 
<br/>structures, Fiji is extremely vulnerable to tsunamis</span><span> </span><span>as well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the nation of Fiji, climate security remains as one of our biggest threats.  
<br/>It  has  put  pressure  on  our  systems,  to  respond  with  limited  resources  and  capabilities.  The 
<br/>International Organization for Migration’s explanation is climate security refers to the direct and 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indirect impacts of climate crisis.  On peace and security, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, 
<br/>exacerbating underlining vulnerabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for Fiji, climate security or climate change remains the greatest single threat 
<br/>to livelihoods, security and wellbeing.  Threats to climate security which manifest through variations 
<br/>in weather patterns are placing added stress on our government’s targets, not only on the Sustainable 
<br/>Development Goals, but also our National Development Plan.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Fiji  Government  has  long  recognised  the  serious  threat  climate  change  poses  to  our 
<br/>country. Rising seas continue to erode shorelines and encroach on coastal communities.  Between 
<br/>1980  and  2016,  annual  economic  damage  caused  by  disasters  in  Fiji  has  been  estimated  at  $35 
<br/>million. We recall in 2016, following </span><span>TC Winston,</span><span> the overall economic value of destroyed assets 
<br/>reached  $1.3  billion,  nearly  half  of  which  came  in  the  form  of  damages  in  the  aftermath  of  the 
<br/>disaster, as the national economy struggled to recover. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  part  of  our  efforts  to  implement  measures  on  the  ground  to  adapt  to 
<br/>climate change, we also recognise that some community infrastructures will have to be permanently 
<br/>relocated  as  the  only  way  to  avoid  tragedy,  save  lives,  protect  livelihoods  and  prevent  social 
<br/>disruption.  However, we will only consider relocating people as a last resort after all other feasible 
<br/>adaptation options have been explored.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While Fiji has moved forward in undertaking proactive measures to reduce disaster risks, the 
<br/>impact of national hazards on our communities remain.  Geographically situated within the Pacific 
<br/>Rim of Fire and on the path of tropical cyclones in the South Pacific Ocean, the onslaught of national 
<br/>hazards on our fragile environments and economies are given every year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For our small island nation, the domestic realities of responding to disasters include, but are 
<br/>not limited to pressures on national budgets to cater for the continuous response activities that include 
<br/>activating sustaining emergency operating centres.  Whilst financial provisions are made for bigger 
<br/>declared  events,  it  is  often  the  smaller,  undeclared  events  that  often  result  in  the  reallocation  of 
<br/>ministry and national budgets that undermine our national development plans.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, like our Pacific Island neighbours, we are archipelago of islands spread out 
<br/>and separated by the ocean. Domestic response efforts are often challenged by the tyranny of distance 
<br/>and intermittent connectivity. Ensuring that adequate response and relief efforts reach the last mile, 
<br/>is often a challenge, but met with the assistance of our regional and international partners. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  an  initiative  that  will  greatly  boost  disaster  preparedness  is  the  recent 
<br/>passing of the National Disaster Risk Management Act 2024. The Act takes into consideration critical 
<br/>developments in the disaster risk management and humanitarian space and ensures that Fiji’s disaster 
<br/>legislation is up to date with a future that is increasingly under the threat of climate change.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Act captures future developments, obligations and thematic areas that will become the 
<br/>new normal in the disaster space.  These include considerations aligned with the reviewed National 
<br/>Humanitarian Policy, the National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy, National Tsunami Response Plan, 
<br/></span><span>National Emergency Response Team Mechanism and Government’s future priorities identified in the 
<br/></span><span>National Development Plan.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Furthermore, the Act ensures that Fiji is aligned to evolving global and regional perspectives 
<br/>specifically addressing the requirements of the Framework for Resilient Development in the Pacific, 
<br/>Sustainable Development Agenda 2015-2030, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-
<br/>2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change 2050.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the provisions address the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>human-induced and technological disasters;  
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>whole of society and participatory approaches, inclusion and vulnerable group approaches;  
<br/>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>cluster arrangements for effective response coordination;  
<br/>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>the implications of climate change; 
<br/>(5)</span><span> </span><span>management of disaster-generated waste;

<br/>(12)</span><span> </span><span>authority levels during disasters; 
<br/>(13)</span><span> </span><span>shifting the focus from managing disasters to managing risks; and 
<br/>(14)</span><span> </span><span>whole-of-government approach. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>engagement of the private sector in disaster management efforts; 
<br/>incorporation of regional and international agreements and other pertinent matters; 
<br/>civil military engagement; 
<br/>expedited clearance of aid consignments; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in line with the National Disaster Risk Management Act 2024, the NDRMO 
<br/>continues  to  both,  lead  and  work  together  with  its  regional  and  international  partners  through 
<br/>technical and funding assistance to develop and revise policies and procedures to accommodate the 
<br/>new normals in the disaster space.  Some of these policy initiatives and reviews include the:

<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span><span>•</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>development of the Community Based Disaster Risk Management Policy; 
<br/>development of the Disaster Risk Financing Policy; 
<br/>review of the National Humanitarian Plan; 
<br/>development of the National Emergency Response Team Guidelines; 
<br/>ongoing  review  of  the  National  Emergency  Operation  Centre  Standard  Operating 
<br/>Procedure; and  review and digitising of the Initial Damages Assessment Form. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, disaster preparedness plays a critical role in the work of the NDRMO due 
<br/>to the country’s vulnerability to various natural hazards, such as cyclones, floods and earthquakes. 
<br/>We recognise that being well prepared for disaster is essential to saving lives. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, at this juncture, I would like to acknowledge the New Zealand Government 
<br/>for its investment of $3.2 million towards providing support to improve disaster preparedness and 
<br/>response.  The funding and support comprise a suite of interventions designed to increase the capacity 
<br/>of the NDRMO to manage disaster awareness and response in Fiji.  It involves technical assistance 
<br/>at the NDRMO, upgrade of early warning and flood protection systems, construction of warehouses, 
<br/>upgrade of Divisional Emergency Operation Centres and development of information management 
<br/>system and preparedness, and capacity building through a peer to peer exchange programme with the 
<br/>National Emergency Management Authority of New Zealand of which I was fortunate to be part of. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  through  its  strong  partnership  with  the  Government  of  Japan,  the 
<br/>Government is committed to the extension of the Tsunami Sirens and we have recently concluded 
<br/>site survey of all 42 Emergency Operation Centres across Fiji which includes district, divisional and 
<br/>national emergency operation centres.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stand ready to answer any other further questions, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, one of the most critical components in terms of 
<br/></span><span>disaster readiness for us has always been government shipping services. I know that previously, they 
<br/></span><span>are one of the arms of us being able to reach and get, whether it was fresh water or medical supplies 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="20">Page 20</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2505 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>or whatever, through government shipping services.  Have you continued that or are they in a state 
<br/>of  readiness  with  respect  to  assistance  that  may  need  to  be  rendered,  if  we  do  get  another  nasty 
<br/>cyclone coming through, especially one that affects the outer islands? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- I thank the honourable Member for that question. We have our own 
<br/>arrangements with the line ministry as far as the use of government shipping services is concerned. 
<br/>As soon as there is an emergency, there are certain vessels that they have made available for their 
<br/>use for disaster response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- I thank the honourable Minister for his comprehensive answer.  We know 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that any hurricane will bring lots of rain too. When it rains, the water table on the 
<br/>soil also increases, and we have seen a number of landslides. During our days in Government, we 
<br/>prepared two document  proposal  papers  for landslides. Can the honourable Minister highlight on 
<br/>where are the proposal papers? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you want the question repeated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- Yes, I want the question be repeated, please. Which papers are your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>referring to? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  I  am  referring  to  number  of  landslides,  honourable  Minister.    In  this 
<br/>disaster preparedness, landslides is not embedded. How will we respond to it and which Ministry 
<br/>will  take  over?    I  remember  we  had  started  some  work,  so  in  this  preparedness,  how  will  the 
<br/>complainants or victims be approached? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBER.- What is your question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Minister, do you get the gist of the question? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.R. DITOKA.- It is a bit difficult trying to get the gist of the question. Where landslide 
<br/>is concerned, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are a few Ministries that work together, including the Ministry 
<br/>of Lands, where geotech surveys are conducted.  We work together with the Ministry of Infrastructure 
<br/>and we are only there as a response as far as mitigation is concerned, but other Ministries are involved 
<br/>in that work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will move on to the next question. I now see that the Prime Minister is 
<br/>not here with us for the second Oral Question, so we will come back to that. I do not see any issue 
<br/>with Standing Order 45 that could prevent the Speaker from saying that we will come back to the 
<br/>second Oral Question later on the day.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the third Oral Question for today, I now call on honourable Vanawalu to ask his question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>‘Starting a Business’ Model - NOW FIJI Project 
<br/>(Question No. 296/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I.S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update  Parliament  on  the 
<br/>implementation of the ‘Starting a Business’ under the businessNOW FIJI project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for his 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="21">Page 21</a></div>
<div><span>2506 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. The Starting A Business Subsystem (SABS), is perhaps, the start of Ease of Doing Business 
<br/>Project in Fiji with the desire to fully automate  Government services in Fiji and this was the first 
<br/>system that was automated.  It was actually launched on 26</span><span>th</span><span> September this year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, it worked on the philosophy, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that you only enter your information 
<br/>once and the agencies then take care of the approvals. What that simply means is that now, you can 
<br/>actually apply to start a business or formalise the starting of your business from your home. The days 
<br/>of queuing will be over for this country in the next three to five years and that, Sir, will give back a 
<br/>lot of time to allow people to create more productivity in the country.  We are excited, Sir, because 
<br/>of that potential that exits within this exercise. It was started, of course, by the FijiFirst Government, 
<br/>and we will ensure that we complete that whole exercise because of the transformative nature of this 
<br/>SABS.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  that  helps  MSMEs,  particularly  in  terms  of  smaller  businesses  that  are 
<br/>wandering around, trying to queue up for TIN and FNPF numbers, which is just another layer of 
<br/>inconvenience, so this system allows us to actually automate all that.  The system, once it has been 
<br/>launched, started off with about 10 applications per week. I am now told that it received up to 300 
<br/>applications up to last week on 27</span><span>th</span><span> November, demonstrating the growing adoption of the system, 
<br/>350 accounts have been created. We look forward to a continued traction in the rollout.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of course, just like any system, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there have been some teething issues. To 
<br/>support that, we do have technical online assistance and also a call centre that assists, and there is 
<br/>also a team that is positioned to actually assist if the users of the system have issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is a tool kit that has been developed and issued to 
<br/>the agencies that are actually implementing the system, and the agencies include Occupational Health 
<br/>and Safety Service, Ministry of Health and Medical Services, National Fire Authority, FRCS and 
<br/>FNPF, just to sort of give guidance in terms of how the rollout is being conducted.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What we are saying, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that as a first system of deployment, we are seeing 
<br/>some good signals but, of course, we are continuing to monitor issues, and we will continue to address 
<br/>them. We have now transitioned into the system that the honourable Minister for Housing was talking 
<br/>about which is BPAS and, that is, building permits.  To repeat what the honourable Minister said, 
<br/>building permit approvals is one of the toughest things to do in this country. It is a pain, to be quite 
<br/>honest.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For developers, you have to get application papers that normally reach this high, probably 
<br/>higher. You have to make three copies, distribute them to the agencies and then hope that they all get 
<br/>approved at their own pace. What this system will do, all developers will only enter once and all the 
<br/>agencies have access to the application, and they start processing approvals on the spot with the hope 
<br/>to reduce what is typically a two-year process down to one year or even shorter. If that happens, it 
<br/>will  transform  how  investment  is  conducted  in  Fiji.    So,  these  are  the  initiatives  that  are  being 
<br/>undertaken by the Government. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Beyond that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is National Strategy for Digitisation that I hope to bring 
<br/></span><span>to Parliament early next year.  That will prioritise the automation of the whole of Government and 
<br/></span><span>also give guidance to, particularly, the honourable Minister for Finance in terms of how we fund that 
<br/>exercise. But it positions Fiji well in the years ahead in terms of automation and ensures that as our 
<br/>economy continues to grow, we are positioned to become easier to do business and ensure that in the 
<br/>years to come, Fiji is viewed as a country where business is easy to do.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Minister had given his response, and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2507 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>we are very much aware of that particular project because it started in 2019.  My only question to the 
<br/>honourable Minister would be, the rationale for changing the name from bizFIJI to businessNOW, 
<br/>what  was  the  cost  involved  because  that  means  changing  the  logo  and  other  documentations, 
<br/>including the ICT wherever the logo appears?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- The changing of branding was managed within the Ministry, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>so the cost was internally - just advising on the change.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Why change the name? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we got advice on changing the name.  The 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>name probably is not the key issue, the issue is that we are automating the processes.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Very poor! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Just like you change some names yourself, but that is really 
<br/>not  the  issue,  there  is  really  no  cost  to  the  change  of  name  because  even  the  paraphernalia  was 
<br/>sponsored by the vendor, so there was not any cost to the change of name.  But everyone felt that a 
<br/>different name was required, and that was recommended through the Ministry.  I think leaving aside 
<br/>the name, we can all agree that what is being done is transformative for Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measures for Combatting Yaqona Theft in Taveuni 
<br/>(Question No. 295/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. I. NAIVALURUA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and Fiji 
<br/>Police  Force  inform  Parliament  on  the  effective  measures  that  the  Fiji  Police  Force  is 
<br/>implementing to combat the increasing </span><span>yaqona</span><span> thefts in Taveuni? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, first of all, may I thank you for allowing me to be 
<br/>away for a while.  I thought I would be back in time for the first question and thank you for deferring 
<br/>the question to this time.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I rise to respond to the question by honourable Naivalurua on the theft of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> in Taveuni. 
<br/>There  had  been  some  theft,  and  probably  very  difficult  to  explain,  but  we  know  from  that  song 
<br/>‘</span><span>Taveuni</span><span> </span><span>na  vanua  bulabula.</span><span>’</span><span> </span><span>  No  one  should  be  stealing  anything  that  you  can  plant.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  would  like  to  highlight  some  statistics.    </span><span>Yaqona</span><span>  theft  from  2019  to  October  2024are  as 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>2019 - 71 cases; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>2020 - 115 cases; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>2021 - 111 cases;  
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>2022 - 98 cases;  
<br/></span><span>(5)</span><span> </span><span>2023 - 57 cases; and  
<br/>(6)</span><span> </span><span>January to October this year – 82 cases.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Police had been trying very hard to control the theft, including the </span><span>vanua</span><span>
<br/>approach.   Recently, I believe, there have been cooperation between the Police and the Methodist 
<br/>Church and, perhaps, other Churches too.  They found out that praying about that was not working

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those are, perhaps, some of the things that we have to  do where there is no excuse to  be 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>stealing someone else’s </span><span>yaqona</span><span>.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There was a decreasing trend noted from 2020-2023 but in 2024 alone, an increased number 
<br/>of cases had been recorded from the beginning up to October of this year. But, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the 
<br/>Fiji Police Force has been implementing a number of measures to combat the types of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> in the 
<br/>island which include the following: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Dynamic  community  engagement  and  public  outreach  that  includes  empowerment 
<br/>programmes and awareness activities targeting youth and that includes the programmes of 
<br/>the Methodist Church. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Enhanced community policing initiatives such as visits to known offenders in the island 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and profiling them accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(3)</span><span> </span><span>The Fiji Police has also established a joint awareness and empowerment programme with 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>crime prevention committees in all settlements in Taveuni.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(4)</span><span> </span><span>The Police is also working with the </span><span>Turaga ni Koro</span><span> in identifying whistleblowers on the

<br/>Engagement of the District Officer in the registration of all </span><span>yaqona</span><span> farmers in Taveuni and to assist 
<br/>in the monitoring of sales and purchase of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> in the area.   In the event of theft, the District 
<br/>Officer will assist the Police in verifying farmers’ ID and ascertaining whether they are registered or 
<br/>not. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  measures  that  I  have  highlighted  above  are  for  dry  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>  only. 
<br/>Moreover, there has been an increased cases of green </span><span>yaqona </span><span>theft as well but currently, there is no 
<br/>regulation for the sale and purchase of green </span><span>yaqona</span><span> in place.  I get very worried when I see big 
<br/></span><span>yaqona</span><span> plants presented to me in the </span><span>sevusevu - na veiqaravi vakavanua</span><span>, wondering whether it was 
<br/>uprooted  the  day  before  or  the  night  before.    The  Fiji  Police  Force  is  proposing  that  all  </span><span>yaqona</span><span>
<br/>business licence holders must include those that are buying and selling green </span><span>yaqona</span><span>, as well as its 
<br/>criteria.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the Police restructure that was approved in Cabinet in 2018, the 
<br/>Force will establish a new community police post in Taveuni to assist in resolving that issue.  The 
<br/>Police will work closely in collaboration with key stakeholders such as young farmers, state and non-
<br/>state actors to ensure that </span><span>yaqona</span><span> theft in Taveuni is resolved once and for all.  Let me assure this 
<br/></span><span>august Parliament that Government will continue to support these farmers to ensure they fully reap 
<br/></span><span>economic gains from the sale of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> to support the needs of their families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Those who are involved in the illegal trade are getting very sophisticated, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>because now they are using inter-island shipping, particularly outboard powered boats.  So, if you 
<br/>are watching the Taveuni market, you may not catch them because they are going straight from the 
<br/>farm,  they  are  robbing  the  farmers,  straight  into  the  illegal  traders  who  bring  them  out,  </span><span>qai  la’ki

<br/>more vigilant, and also the </span><span>vanua</span><span> administrators.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. NAIVALURUA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I may, the issue of </span><span>yaqona</span><span> is very serious in 
<br/>Taveuni. I thank the honourable Prime Minister for his response and the effort by Government.   I 
<br/>agree  with  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  that  we  should  nip  it  in  the  bud,  therefore,  as  a 
<br/>supplementary question, may I ask Government to deploy a special investigation or inquiry team, 
<br/>whether internally or externally, to really get down to the roots because this is connected to many 
<br/>other parts, as the honourable Deputy Prime Minister always say, the economy, productivity in the 
<br/>village, leadership in the village, government agencies whether they are working together, et cetera.  
<br/>So, it is connected to many others and at the bottom part of it is the economy of the medium-sized 
<br/>island of Taveuni. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure honourable Naivalurua knows that there 
<br/>has been some time that the people of Taveuni have come to jokingly know the group that is involved 
<br/>from the Police to investigate this  </span><span>Kila Vata </span><span>squad (KVS). The sooner we get the changes in  the 
<br/>manning of those posts, the better it will be for the farmers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.B.  SERUIRATU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  if  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  can  be 
<br/>reminded that the motion in response to the Ministerial Statement by the honourable Minister for 
<br/>iTaukei Affairs has already declared that Naitasiri is now more fertile than Taveuni. My question to 
<br/>the honourable Prime Minister, Sir, you mentioned about  the new police post in  Taveuni,  simply 
<br/>where will that be located? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- On the farm. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- You mean, Navakawau side? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Sir, the strategic plan is with the Police Headquarters and they will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>position that in the most appropriate way.

<div><span>Free Water Assistance – Fiji Water 
<br/>(Question No. 297/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on which 
<br/>communities are being assisted by Fiji Water in their free water assistance programme? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, I thank honourable Nand for his question. Just 
<br/>before I dwell into the substance of the honourable Member’s question, I would like to address some 
<br/>remarks made by honourable Premila Kumar regarding the free tax to Fiji Water. That is absolute 
<br/>nonsense, Mr. Speaker, Sir! That is incorrect.  I have repeatedly, on this side of Parliament, cautioned 
<br/></span><span>the honourable Members not to keep on using this allegation that for some reason we are favouring 
<br/></span><span>Fiji Water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- You are! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, maybe, I will get a calculator and come 
<br/>and explain it better.  As I have explained, with Fiji Water, the fundamental issue is this, in order to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="25">Page 25</a></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>regularise  the  tax  structures  within  the  industry,  all  manufacturers  of  water  got  tax  free  status. 
<br/>However, in the calibration of the water tax, the Fiji water tax was increased.  In other words, in total, 
<br/>there is no loss of revenue to the Fiji Government. That was not confirmed by me, it was confirmed 
<br/>by the Ministry of Finance and Fiji Revenue and Customs Service (FRCS). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we come and make comments in this Parliament, I urge that we be 
<br/>factual and if you have facts to the contrary, bring them and we can debate them.  But I just caution 
<br/>some level of responsibility when we are talking about companies in this Parliament. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, to the question from honourable Nand, the Fiji Water Foundation which actually 
<br/>does the charitable work and is a charitable arm of Fiji Water, is separate from Fiji Water. When I first 
<br/>saw the question from honourable Nand, I was wondering whether he had the Water Authority of Fiji in 
<br/>mind as opposed to Fiji Water because of the separate nature of the two entities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, the Fiji Water Foundation is funded by the Fiji Water Company which has been 
<br/>established  in  2007  and  has  been  focussed  in  improving  the  lives  of  all  Fijians  through  various 
<br/>initiatives  that  they  have  been  doing  since  2007.  So  far,  in  estimation,  it  has  invested  up  to  $3.2 
<br/>million  in  water-related  projects,  which  is  benefiting  over  60,000  Fijians  in  over  30  rural 
<br/>communities throughout Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Foundation,  of  course,  is  dedicated  through  various  initiatives  that  they  have  with 
<br/>community development.  They look at reliable infrastructure, access to clean water, healthcare and 
<br/>education  to  the  rural  communities,  particularly  in  the  Yaqara  area,  who  are  the  traditional 
<br/>landowners  and  where  a  lot  of  employees  reside.  They  also  assist  with  healthcare  services  for 
<br/>underprivileged  communities  and  providing  relief  during  natural  calamities.    Education  such  as 
<br/>classroom grants, is another area that they assist in.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On environmental conservation, they fund a lot of clean water initiatives that are aimed to 
<br/>provide sustainable and hygienic water sources to the rural population.  Finally, of course, some of 
<br/>their  funds  are  directed  at  grant  programmes,  trying  to  assist  with  economic  empowerment,  with 
<br/>particular focus on women empowerment and leadership, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of some of the specifics, as I have said, Fiji Water has been helping communities in 
<br/>the  Yaqara  area,  such  as  Drauniivi,  Naseyani,  Togavere  and  Rabulu,  particularly  with  borehole 
<br/>pumps and reticulation  systems. They are apparently paying  for electricity for those pumps since 
<br/>installation and they have a full-time plumber who is actually supporting the village communities. 
<br/>They  also  have  Village  Water  Community  Committees  who  actually  look  after  or  watch  those 
<br/>systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you also know that Fiji Water has now started to focus on commercial 
<br/>agriculture.    Right  now,  the  focus  is  on  citrus,  papaya  and  honey.  They  are  moving  around  the 
<br/>country, looking at available land, even in Vanua Levu, Sir, so we look forward to Fiji Water assisting 
<br/>in commercialising agriculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Apart from that, they are now looking at constructing a solar plant to support their factory out 
<br/></span><span>in Yaqara.  They are in deep conversation with Energy Fiji Limited in terms of that solar plant, and 
<br/></span><span>most likely they will construct a solar farm that not only supplies their factory but also supplies back 
<br/>to  the  grid,  which  will  be  quite  helpful  as  we  try  to  transition  to  renewable  energy.  I  know  the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition is quite passionate about the transition to renewable energy and 
<br/>let that be music to his ears.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, in a nutshell, I hope that does answer the question by honourable Nand that, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="26">Page 26</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2511 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>indeed, Fiji Water has been a very responsible corporate partner for the country. In fact, what we are 
<br/>saying  is,  they  can  do  more  for  Fiji.  The  advent  into  commercial  agriculture  is  certainly  one 
<br/>opportunity. The second, of course, is the solar project, and the next one that is coming up because 
<br/>they  have  now  quite  a  large  maritime  business,  they  are  going  to  be  making  some  significant 
<br/>investments into FNU to assist with the maritime school there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, those are some of the things that I thought I would just add on as part of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>honourable Nand’s question, and I thank him for the very useful question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, during drought, the schools between Rakiraki and Tavua 
<br/>are seriously low in clean drinking water. I am not only saying between Rakiraki and Tavua, but most 
<br/>of the schools, they run low. Is it possible for the Government to negotiate with Fiji Water so that 
<br/>during  these  critical  times,  these  schools  can  be  provided  with  clean,  safe  drinking  water  for  our 
<br/>children to prosper?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Before  the  Minister  answers  the  question,  I  ask  the  relevance  of  this 
<br/>question  because  Fiji  Water  is  a  private  entity  and  if  Government  has  any  influence  over  the 
<br/>distribution of water, then I think that it is relevant to ask whether the Government is distributing 
<br/>water in a fair way. You are now asking a follow up question that says, should the Government or 
<br/>will the Government help in the distribution of water from the private entity to the sectors in Tavua 
<br/>and Rakiraki, is that correct? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. NAND.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is, can the Government assist the schools by 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>requesting Fiji Water to deliver clean, safe drinking water? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  I  am  sure  the  Water  Foundation  receives 
<br/>requests from a lot of communities and I am certain that they can look at that as well. Perhaps, I can 
<br/>coordinate with honourable Nand in terms of getting the letters to Water Foundation. I am sure, given 
<br/>that it is an area that they are focussed on assisting, education as a key area they are focused on, I am 
<br/>sure they will be very interested.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Implementation of Audit Qualification Issues 
<br/>(Question No. 298/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on the short-term and long-term measures that the Ministry and Municipal Councils have 
<br/>taken to implement the audit qualification issues identified by the Office of the Auditor-
<br/>General? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to the question before this august 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament this afternoon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, some of the common audit queries that were raised by the Office of the 
<br/></span><span>Auditor-General when they conducted audits for Municipal Councils around Fiji are legacy issues 
<br/></span><span>and these issues should have been addressed 10 years ago.  These are issues that mostly have to do 
<br/>with the internal control systems, as well as some of the Government issues that should have been 
<br/>addressed here and then.  Simple internal  control issues, like bank reconciliation,  updating of the 
<br/>fixed register, variances between the general ledger and subsidiary ledgers, as well as VAT, rates, 
<br/>salaries and other things like  errors in the financial statements, misapplication or non-compliance 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="27">Page 27</a></div>
<div><span>2512 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>with  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS).  Those  are  very  pertinent  in  the 
<br/>administration of any Council for that matter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>After looking at all the issues and challenges faced by most of these Municipal Councils, the 
<br/>Ministry  has  come  up  with  some  solutions.    One  solution,  which  is  based  on  one  of  the 
<br/>recommendations  that  was  proposed  to  us  by  the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General,  is  to  have  a 
<br/>monitoring system within the Ministry to audit some of those Municipality reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For this financial year, we have recruited and hired officers who have accounting and auditing 
<br/>backgrounds, to assist the Ministry in monitoring the financial affairs of those respective Councils. 
<br/>It is very interesting to note that most of the Municipal Councils have backlogs in the auditing of 
<br/>their financial reports.  A good example is the one presented by honourable Naupoto this morning on 
<br/>the Savusavu Town Council.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Other Councils have backlogs in auditing their reports, some have been there from 2017, 2018 
<br/>and 2019.  But there is only one Council that is really up to date with the auditing of its financial 
<br/>statements and that is Rakiraki Town Council.  I commend the Special Administrators as well as the 
<br/>CEOs for getting their financial statements in order.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the audit team that I highlighted earlier includes officers who are tasked to 
<br/>conduct a detailed review of all these financials, rectify errors in financial reporting and overseeing 
<br/>and  rectify  all  audit  qualification  issues.  After  recognising  the  lack  of  expertise  in  all  these 
<br/>Municipalities, we have also come to understand that the reason why we have these errors is that 
<br/>most of these Councils, even though they have some finance people but they do not have the right 
<br/>expertise to actually manage their financials.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, we have been organising training programmes for the Councils in collaboration with 
<br/>the  Office  of  the  Auditor-General  to  carry  out  some  of  the  very  important  programmes  that  will 
<br/>transform some of these Councils, ensuring that there are better processes, systems and policies in 
<br/>place in their respective Councils. We also encourage Councils to engage and participate in trainings 
<br/>organised  by  some  of  the  financial  institutions  and  non-government  organisations  based  on  their 
<br/>needs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One of the main objectives of having this internal audit within the Ministry is to ensure that 
<br/>Councils  comply  with  financial  and  operational  guidelines.  The  Ministry  has  also  reached  out  to 
<br/>Municipalities to carry out their audit plan, on how the Ministry is going to coordinate the auditing 
<br/>of all Municipal Councils’ financial reports.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With  respect  to  the  continuation  of  capital  projects,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has 
<br/>developed  a  Project  Management  Policy  and  monitoring  templates  with  specific  milestones  and 
<br/>timelines that the Councils commit to. The Ministry also has a project team that heavily undertakes 
<br/>site-visits. However, there is a need to build on this project team, where the skills are required to 
<br/>monitor the implementation of capital projects and proper utilisation of public funds.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Local  Government  has also  advertised  an Expression of 
<br/></span><span>Interest to engage an experienced trainer to deliver a comprehensive  one-day governance training 
<br/></span><span>programme  for  Special  Administrators  and  CEOs  of  all  the  Municipal  Councils  throughout  the 
<br/>country.  The  purpose  of  this  is  to  ensure  that  the  training  enhances  governance  capabilities, 
<br/>leadership skills and operational effectiveness of Municipal Councils across Fiji. This is scheduled 
<br/>for next year.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has reviewed some of the policies and SOPs that are in place, and we will 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="28">Page 28</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2513 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>continue to review that to ensure that we have all the right features in the policy, to address some of 
<br/>the issues that have already been highlighted by the Office of the Auditor-General.  This includes 
<br/>their Financial Manual, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>One thing that we also aspire to do is to have a standardised accounting system within all 
<br/>Municipalities,  something we are  lacking  in  right  now because when we request  for reports, it is 
<br/>really difficult to obtain them from these Municipalities.  So, when we have this system in place, we 
<br/>will be able have a proper reporting system to check all the various financials activities that are being 
<br/>carried out by all the Municipalities. This has been taken on board with the assistance of the Lautoka 
<br/>City Council.  They have engaged a local consultant to assist the Council and the Ministry in this 
<br/>particular area. They will come up with an accounting system that will be used by all the Councils 
<br/>throughout Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another area is ensuring that all Municipal Councils conduct a Board of Survey.  This is a 
<br/>mandatory requirement that some of them have been lacking in all these years. This Board of Survey 
<br/>has  to  be  done  annually.    So,  by  virtue  of  section  130  of  the  Local  Government  Act  1972,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, we have done the appointment of inspectors to investigate and report upon the manner 
<br/>in which the Councils are excising all or any of their functions under the Act. Those inspectors are 
<br/>going to assist me, as well as the Ministry, in carrying out this work. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have alluded to earlier, it is something that we are trying to fix with all 
<br/>the Municipal Councils throughout the country.  It is significant to note the progress made by the 
<br/>Councils thus far in keeping records of all these irregularities and queries, and we hope to rectify 
<br/>these this year, as well as in the coming financial years. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through the Council’s endeavour to resolve the audit qualification issue raised by the Office 
<br/>of the Auditor-General, our approach combines immediate corrective actions with long term reforms 
<br/>to ensure that the Councils are equipped to meet high standards of governance. I thank you for this 
<br/>opportunity, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. H. CHAND.- Honourable Minister, one of the reasons for the audit issues is high staff 
<br/>turnover and shortage of qualified staff in the finance departments of the Councils and one way to 
<br/>retain staff would be job evaluation exercises. Are there any plans for the job evaluation exercise? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/>When  I  took  over  the  office,  there  were  some  outstanding  industrial  matters  in  some  of  the 
<br/>Municipalities regarding staff welfare and salary increases, and I am glad to inform the Parliament 
<br/>that there are some Municipalities that have taken steps to address some of those issues.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Another issue that we have right now is the issue of not having the right personnel within the 
<br/>Ministry, especially the finance people. That is the reason why we are having a lot of audit queries 
<br/>and that is something that we all should address within the Council.  A good example is Suva City 
<br/>Council.  They have a very good Finance Manager who has been hired by one of the accounting 
<br/>firms.  One of the things that I have also shared with them is to look at ways of retaining officers, 
<br/>especially the good officers in the Council. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other issue is, perhaps, when doing the job evaluation exercise within all the Councils, 
<br/>to  ensure  that  we  have  the  right  remuneration,  as  well  as  the  right  benefits  in  place,  in  order  to 
<br/>maintain or contain the staff in all these Municipalities. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as the former Chairman of the Public Accounts 
<br/>Committee, one of the issues that came through during our time and I think it is still continuing is the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="29">Page 29</a></div>

<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>mandate  of  the  Special  Administrators.  We  have  the  CEOs  who  are  supposed  to  do  the 
<br/>micromanagement  of  the  Councils,  but  there  are  Special  Administrators  who  go  beyond  their 
<br/>mandate and start  to  micro-manage the  Councils, and that is  where the issue starts.    The  CEO is 
<br/>supposed to be reporting to the Board itself. What is the Ministry doing in terms of stopping these 
<br/>Special Administrators who are going beyond their mandate and doing  the micro-management of 
<br/>these Councils? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  can  assure  Parliament  that  within  the 
<br/>parameters of the Special Administrators, they are given specific KPIs, as well as special instructions 
<br/>are given on how to conduct themselves in managing the affairs of the Council.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Something  that  I  have  also  been  sharing  with  them  is  the  importance  of  having  a  Special 
<br/>Administrator who is supposed to be a strategic thinker and must make sure that they give directions 
<br/>and provide strategies to the  Council. I think it is  working  in  most of the  Councils.   I have been 
<br/>stressing with the Special Administrators, when we have our forum with them, the importance of 
<br/>ensuring that they provide directions, while the CEO does the operational arm of carrying out the 
<br/>operations of the Municipalities.

<div><span>Eligibility of Foreign Nationals Entering without Permit

<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice:

<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and 
<br/>Fiji  Police  Force  inform  Parliament  on  measures  in  place  at  the  Fiji  Immigration 
<br/>Department to verify the eligibility of Girmitiya descendants and those registered in the 
<br/>Vola ni Kawa Bula</span><span> </span><span>holding foreign citizenship to enter Fiji without a permit? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for her question.  
<br/>On Friday, 13</span><span>th</span><span> October, 2023, the Fiji Immigration Department and the Ministry of iTaukei Affairs 
<br/>formalised  their  collaboration  by  signing  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  carry  out  the 
<br/>mandatory responsibilities outlined in the Immigration Act 2023.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The amended Immigration Act 2003 allows </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> individuals who are registered in the Vola 
<br/>ni Kawa Bula (VKB) to enter, reside and work in Fiji under exemption status, as specified in section 
<br/>8(1)(g) of the Act. Similarly, descendants of Girmityas are eligible under the exemption by descent, 
<br/>as outlined in section 8(3). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Department  has  implemented  a  multilayered  approach  to  verify  the 
<br/>eligibility of the Girmitya descendants’ exemption by descent and VKB registered individuals who 
<br/>hold foreign citizenship for permit entry into Fiji. These measures ensure the integrity of Fiji’s border 
<br/>management, while honouring historical and cultural obligations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Girmitya  descendants,  those  who  were  exempted  by  descent,  are  granted  to  a  direct 
<br/></span><span>descendent  of a person (that is  the principal citizen) who was considered a citizen of Fiji  on  10</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/></span><span>October, 1970, and holder of a valid foreign passport to enter, reside, study and work in the country. 
<br/>Direct descendent include the principal citizen’s children, grandchildren and great grandchildren ….

<div><span>The Parliament resumed at 2.35 p.m. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before we begin, honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the 
<br/>students and teachers of Nailagotabua Primary School from Verata, Tailevu.  You are most welcome 
<br/>to your Parliament, and I hope that you will learn more about how your Parliament works. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Acclamation) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  first,  I  apologise  to  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  honourable 
<br/>Members,  on  behalf  of  our  technical  staff  and  the  Secretariat,  for  the  disruption  to  our  morning 
<br/>session caused by some technical glitch to our sound system. As you are aware, it also happened 
<br/>yesterday,  and  maybe  on  second  thought,  I  should  not  have  mentioned  our  woes  from  Waidina 
<br/>making  their  presence  felt.    At  any  rate,  the  problems  are  fixed  and  we,  hopefully,  can  proceed 
<br/>without any further interruptions this afternoon.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Members,  we  shall  continue  with  where  we  left  off  this  morning  on  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister’s response to the question that was posed by honourable Premila Kumar.  
<br/>If the honourable Prime Minister so wishes, he may begin now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, in my response to the question asked by honourable 
<br/>Premila Kumar on the eligibility of Girmitya descendants and those registered in the </span><span>Vola ni Kawa 
<br/>Bula</span><span>  (VKB)  holding  foreign  citizenship  to  enter  Fiji  without  a  permit,  the  Fiji  Immigration 
<br/>Department  and  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  formalised  their  collaboration  by  signing  a 
<br/>Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  to  carry  out  the  mandatory  responsibility  outlined  in  the 
<br/>Immigration Act 2023, which allows </span><span>iTaukei </span><span>individuals who are registered in the VKB to enter, 
<br/>reside  and  work  in  Fiji  under  exemption  status,  as  specified  under  section  8(1)(g)  of  the  Act. 
<br/>Similarly, Girmitya descendants are eligible under exemption by descent, as outlined under section 
<br/>8(3). 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has different merits, a multi-layered approach, to verify the 
<br/>eligibility of Girmitya descendants who are exempted by descent and VKB registered individuals 
<br/>who hold foreign citizenship for permit for free entry into Fiji.  These measures ensure the integrity 
<br/>of Fiji’s border management, while honouring historical and cultural obligations.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Girmitya descendants’ exemption by descent is granted to a direct descendant of a person, 
<br/>that is, the principal citizen who was considered a citizen of Fiji on 10</span><span>th</span><span> October, 1970, and a holder 
<br/>of a valid foreign passport to enter, reside, study and work in the country.  Direct descendants include 
<br/>the principal citizen’s children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. You probably know that in 
<br/>Africa during the wave of independence movement when the African States became independent, 
<br/>they  granted  citizenship  to  descendants  -  people  whose  great  grandfather  was  the  citizen  of  that 
<br/>country or a citizen of that colony.  Jomo Kenyatta was one of the examples of those first independent 
<br/>movement leaders. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, under section 83 of the Immigration Act 2003, Girmitiya descendants who 
<br/>hold foreign citizenship can enter Fiji without a permit if they meet specific eligibility criteria and 
<br/></span><span>provide  the  necessary  documentation.  This  criteria  ensures  that  descendants  can  maintain  their 
<br/></span><span>ancestral ties, while preserving the integrity of Fiji’s immigration system. The eligibility criteria and 
<br/>documentation requirements for Girmitiya descendants are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Individuals must provide evidence that link them directly to Girmitiya ancestors who arrive 
<br/>under the indentured labourer system.

<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will table the response after, and we will also be circulating this to the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Foreign Embassies for the information of the Fiji Diaspora.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Immigration  Act  2003,  specifically  under  Section  81(g)  granted 
<br/>exemption say that to iTaukei individuals registered in the VKB, allowing them to enter, reside and 
<br/>work in Fiji without requiring a permit. A registered individual in the VKB</span><span> </span><span>is granted to a person 
<br/>registered in the VKB maintained by the iTaukei Land Commission and hold a valid foreign passport 
<br/>to enter, resides, study and work in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The eligibility criteria and documentation requirements for registered individuals in the VKB

<div><span>are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Completed exemption application form.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, mostly, they are the same,  they run parallel - the Girmitiya descendant and the VKB descendant, 
<br/>parallel all the way in the application. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department conducts cross verifications with national databases through 
<br/>collaboration  with  the  Ministry  of  iTaukei  Affairs  on  the  VKB  registrations.  For  Girmitiya 
<br/>descendants, historical and archival records are accessed in collaboration with cultural and heritage 
<br/>institutions. Additionally, citizenship verifications are carried out through the Citizenship Unit.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department also conducts identity security checks such as signatures, 
<br/>facial  comparisons  and  passport  data  match  against  existing  immigration  records  to  ensure 
<br/>authenticity and prevent identity fraud. It is a very complicated and detailed response to a very valid 
<br/>question  with  the  fluidity  of  the  population  we  now  have  in  and  out,  and  I  believe  it  should  be 
<br/>presented at the end of my time for honourable Members to look up if they have any related cases or 
<br/>relatives to communicate them to. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Prime  Minister.  We  note  the  offer  by  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister to table the qualifications required of the would-be applicants to those 
<br/>holding foreign citizenship to enter Fiji without permit. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Memorandum of Cooperation - Japan Tourism Agency 
<br/>(Question No. 300/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Tourism and Civil 
<br/>Aviation  update  Parliament  on  the  Memorandum  of  Cooperation  with  the  Japan 
<br/>Tourism Agency of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Vocea for his question. I 
<br/>appreciate the opportunity to update this esteemed House on the recent Memorandum of Cooperation 
<br/>(MoC) signed between the Government of Fiji and Japan Tourism Agency, which is part of Japan’s 
<br/>Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, dialogue on the MoC had started in 2018 and was formalised during my 
<br/>recent  visit  to  Sendai,  Japan,  representing  a  significant  milestone  in  Fiji’s  bilateral  relations  with 
<br/>Japan. It underscores a mutual commitment to strengthening our tourism sector through sustainable 
<br/>practices,  disaster  resilience  and  knowledge  exchange.  The  agreement  aligns  closely  with  Fiji’s 
<br/>National Development Plan which prioritises economic diversification, environmental sustainability 
<br/>and building climate-resilient infrastructure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Under  the  MoC,  Fiji  and  Japan  will  collaborate  on  key  areas  such  as  crisis  management, 
<br/>sustainable  tourism  development  and  infrastructure  resilience.  This  partnership  provides  an 
<br/>opportunity for Fiji to learn from Japan’s expertise in disaster preparedness and response - a vital 
<br/>area,  given  Fiji’s  vulnerability  to  cyclones  and  other  natural  disasters.  By  leveraging  Japan’s 
<br/>advanced  technical  knowledge  and  best  practices,  we  aim  to  fortify  our  tourism  industry  against 
<br/></span><span>future shocks, while fostering sustainable growth. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  additionally,  the  MoC  sets  the  stage  for  capacity  building  initiatives, 
<br/>technical exchanges and joint programmes to promote eco-friendly tourism. These efforts will not 
<br/>only protect our environment but also enhance Fiji’s appeal as a leading destination for responsible 
<br/>tourism, catering to increase global demand for suitable travel experiences.

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  signing  of  this  MoC  also  coincided  with  Fiji’s  participation  in  the  Japan  Tourism 
<br/>Resilience Summit, where  I had the privilege of addressing Asia Pacific Tourism Leaders on the 
<br/>importance  of  resilience  and  innovation  in  the  face  of  global  challenges.  This  Summit  further 
<br/>reinforces the objectives of the MoC by highlighting shared strategies for recovery, sustainability 
<br/>and regional cooperation.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, through this agreement, Fiji is building a future-ready tourism sector that 
<br/>balances economic prosperity with environmental stewardship. By deepening our ties with a global 
<br/>leader like Japan, we are securing not just the immediate benefits of partnership, but also the long-
<br/>term resilience of the industry that is vital for Fiji’s socio-economic development.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, in  light  of the fact  that the  agreement has been 
<br/>signed with the Japan Tourism Agency, is there a likelihood that we will be making an increased 
<br/>presence in Japan with respect to Tourism Fiji and Fiji Airways, bearing in mind that Denarau was 
<br/>built on the back of Japanese tourism?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, indeed, Japan is a huge market for Fiji and it used 
<br/>to be amongst the top three or four for Fiji back in the 1980s before the collapse of the Japanese 
<br/>economy at that time with the way the real estate market collapsed in Japan.  But since then, Japan 
<br/>has been rather flat in terms of numbers, even globally, and more so now with the Yen being so weak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they admit this, they will not see any growth on outbound travel for Japan 
<br/>because of the Yen. For us, Fiji, we are flying into Narita right now.  We used to fly to Osaka at one 
<br/>time and Nagoya is a possibility, so going forward, the possibilities are there. We believe we have 
<br/>the capacity in terms of equipment, but at this point, given the economy in Japan and the way the 
<br/>numbers are still flat, we will not be considering any additional city in the immediate future.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a quick question to the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister.  Infrastructure resilience is one of the key areas covered under the agreement. Could you 
<br/>just elaborate further on that, honourable Deputy Prime Minister? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  conference  was  in  Sendai.  Sendai,  during 
<br/>Easter of 2011, had an earthquake and a tsunami that killed almost 20,000 people. I think you will 
<br/>remember  that  30  metre  high  waves  came  in  and  flattened  that  part  of  Japan,  the  big  Sendai 
<br/>earthquake. It was the worst in Japanese history.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What they have done now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is build infrastructure around that coastal area 
<br/>to stop or to weaken the power of the tsunami that would come into the coastal areas of Japan. So, 
<br/>those are the types of infrastructure that we can benefit from, as we also prepare against risks like 
<br/>that. It is quite phenomenal; they even now have a way of determining that.  Once an earthquake 
<br/>happens, immediately they know if the tsunami is coming - their warning system is highly developed 
<br/>also, and that is where we are coming from.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is amazing that the area that was flattened, about 800 homes were swept away in a matter 
<br/>of minutes during that period.  I think if you saw the documentary on BBC and CNN, the school 
<br/></span><span>where people ran to from the tsunami is still there.  We went to the school and we saw marks of how 
<br/></span><span>high the waves went up, this is the fourth-floor building. However, the important thing is the way 
<br/>they have recovered and what they are putting in place, so that is an example.  There are other areas, 
<br/>on the kind of infrastructure that is built to guard us against flooding also.  So, all these technical 
<br/>support will be there with Japan.  They know how vulnerable we are, and they are willing to share 
<br/>what they have with Fiji and other countries in the Asia Pacific.

<div><span>Enhancing Capabilities of Firefighters – NFA 
<br/>(Question No. 301/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on  the  measures  being  undertaken  to  enhance  the  capability  of  the  fire  fighters  of  the 
<br/>National Fire Authority? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for the question. 
<br/>Before I proceed, I would like to inform this august Parliament that today, at the Marist ground in 
<br/>Flagstaff, Suva, the National Fire Authority (NFA) conducted their National Drill Competition and 
<br/>this competition gives opportunities for all the firefighters in the three Divisions - Central, Northern 
<br/>and Western Divisions, to not only display their skills, but also showcase the fitness level that they 
<br/>have in their respective Divisions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as part of the 5-Year Strategic Plan for the NFA, the Authority places much 
<br/>emphasis  on  the  ongoing  announcement  capability  of  the  firefighters  to  improve  their  quality  of 
<br/>response,  improve  readiness  to  emergencies  and  increase  technical  skills,  and  to  achieve  the 
<br/>outcomes  mentioned,  focus  on  physical  development  and  training  on  technical  skills  of  all  our 
<br/>firefighters.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  after  recruitment,  the  firefighters  can  attend  to  fire  incidents,  material 
<br/>accidents,  urban  search  and  rescue,  high-rise  technical  rescue,  road  accident  rescue,  swift  water 
<br/>rescue  and  natural  disaster  rescue.   These  core  responsibilities  require  a  high  level  of  fitness  and 
<br/>technical skills to ensure tasks are executed efficiently and effectively.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all firefighters undergo Required Fitness Level (RFL) training on a quarterly 
<br/>basis, as the very nature of work demands it.  Every year, they undergo four RFL tests to ensure that 
<br/>they  have  the  physical  capability  to  conduct  their  work.  Passing  RFL  tests  means  that  they  are 
<br/>physically capable to douse off or extinguish fires, respond to vehicle accidents, respond to people 
<br/>during floods or during any natural disaster, high rise rescue and any emergency that will need their 
<br/>response.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Before  they  undergo  RFL  tests,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  health  screening  medical  check  is 
<br/>conducted to make sure that they are in the right state of health and mind to take the test. To ensure 
<br/>that they maintain physical condition, the Authority is working on equipping all Fire Stations with 
<br/>appropriate  gym  facilities  and  equipment.  To  date,  11  of  the  21  Fire  Stations  have  proper  gym 
<br/>facilities and equipment, and there are plans already in the pipeline for another 10 Stations to also 
<br/>have proper gym facilities and equipment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In the 2025-2026 financial year, the Authority is looking at constructing gym facilities for 
<br/>Labasa,  Levuka,  Nausori,  Suva,  Valelevu  and  Sigatoka  Fire  Stations,  and  the  following  financial 
<br/>year, gym facilities have been earmarked for Pacific Harbour, Ba and Tavua Fire Stations.   In the 
<br/>current  financial  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  NFA  will  be  constructing  a  proper  gym  facility  for 
<br/></span><span>Lautoka Fire Station.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Authority  also  takes  the  Health  Wellness  Wednesday  Programme  seriously.    Every 
<br/>Wednesday, all staff are required to participate in physical activities as organised by the Training 
<br/>Department.  As  part  of  their  annual  cost  operational  plan,  Corporate  staff  are  required  to  walk  a 
<br/>minimum of 10 kilometres every month.  With the rise in NCDs, all Authority staff should maintain 
<br/>a healthy lifestyle.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Authority also invests heavily in building the technical capacity of its 
<br/>firefighters. As part of their progress up the ranks, they undergo promotional courses which they need 
<br/>to  pass  in  order  to  advance.    These  courses  include  a  Leading  Firefighter  Course,  a  Qualified 
<br/>Firefighter Course and a Firefighter Course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Leading Firefighter Course prepares the officers to take on senior leadership, managing 
<br/>a team of people, supervisory skills and test their ability to make decisions at an emergency site or 
<br/>ground.  The Qualified Firefighter Course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, prepares officers to take the leadership 
<br/>role in their respective stations, strengthen their skills in public speaking and presentation ability, 
<br/>compiling proper records and test their ability to conduct drills. Those promotional courses, Sir, are 
<br/>conducted by the Authority’s senior staff, internal training staff or certified trainers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Firefighter  Course  training  tests  the  skills  and  knowledge  in  fire  terminology  of  our 
<br/>probation officers after they have completed a 12 months’ probationary period.  Upon completion of 
<br/>the training, Mr. Speaker, Sir, officers are then confirmed to their positions. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  firefighters  also  attend  international  trainings  in  collaboration  with 
<br/>international organisations and overseas counterparts. In May this year, 18 officers participated in 
<br/>International  Aircraft  Rescue  and  Firefighting  training  coordinated  by  Airports  Fiji  Limited  with 
<br/>trainers from the USA and Australia.  Recently, two officers returned from Japan after attending a 
<br/>three-month technical training. This opportunity was coordinated through the JICA sponsorship, in 
<br/>conjunction with the Ministry of Civil Service Training Division.  Officers were trained in rescue 
<br/>techniques,  fire  management  and  disaster  risk  reduction.  In  2023,  an  officer  was  sent  to  attend  a 
<br/>three-month rescue technique coordinated by JICA.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also,  in  the  same  year,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  three  officers  from  the  Structural  Fire  Safety 
<br/>Department attended a course on fire safety regulations in Sabaudia, Rome, for three weeks. Also, in 
<br/>2023, 21 officers took part in a training coordinated by the Australian Disaster Assessment Team on 
<br/>Urban Search and Rescue held in Suva.  These trainings, coordinated and conducted by international 
<br/>organisations,  ensure  that  our  fire  service  personnel  are  well  versed  with  the  current  firefighting 
<br/>training trends.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, all officers who attend training locally and overseas compile reports and 
<br/>learnings  from  training  are  often  shared  or  taught  to  their  colleagues.  The  NFA  is  also  building 
<br/>networks  with  international  counterparts  for  long-term  training  plans.  Discussions  are  currently 
<br/>underway  with  a  Singapore  Fire  Service,  to  explore  the  possibility  of  an  MOU  between  the  two 
<br/>organisations. On the emergence of new technologies on electric vehicles and lithium batteries, the 
<br/>Authority is hoping to send officers to Singapore for training in firefighting strategies, attending to 
<br/>electric vehicles and lithium battery fires.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are also looking closer to home in building capacity for our firefighters. 
<br/>In April this year, the Authority signed an MOU with the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services 
<br/>of Queensland, Australia. This is through our Vuvale Partnership.  This MOU will bring enhancement 
<br/>capabilities to our fire services. With the implementation of this MOU, Sir, three senior officers have 
<br/>returned  from  Queensland  Fire  Services  on  a  one-week  study  tour.  There  are  now  discussions  to 
<br/></span><span>explore overseas training for more officers to attend the same type of training.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  lot  of  measures  are  being  taken  to  enhance  the  capability  of  our 
<br/>firefighters.    With  Government  support,  the  Authority  is  continuously  building  capacity  of  its 
<br/>firefighters to meet the needs and risks of today and tomorrow. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>2521 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Honourable Minister, in the area of disaster related assistance and 
<br/>responsibility, the National Fire Authority is tasked with two main rescue elements - water rescue 
<br/>and  hopefully,  this  is  from  lessons  learnt  during  </span><span>TC  Winston</span><span>,  infrastructure  structural  damages 
<br/>assessment. I want to know what progress has been made in these two areas based on the previous 
<br/>arrangements  that  were  also  made  with  our  overseas  partners.  In  terms  of  water  rescue,  their 
<br/>capabilities and skills, and of course, infrastructure structural damages assessment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Member for asking a 
<br/>very important question. Yes, the Authority has been collaborating with the Queensland Fire Services 
<br/>in the areas such as water rescue, as well as one that he has just mentioned, which is on infrastructure 
<br/>structural damages assessment. That is something that we are also considering to review so that in 
<br/>the future, training that we are going to have, the Authority is going to have this kind of training with 
<br/>counterparts from Queensland, as well as Singapore. We also have this training to be part of their 
<br/>training overseas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you can recall, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in some of the flooding situations that we have just had 
<br/>late last year as well as early this year, especially in Rakiraki, the NFA Team was there to rescue 
<br/>some of the people that were caught during the flooding. That is also part of the training that the team 
<br/>is doing right now.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>They  have  also  created  paramedic  training,  and  that  is  going  to  manage  the  provision  of 
<br/>ambulance services.  We are also thinking of getting ambulance from overseas that will have these 
<br/>facilities  to  also  take  care  of  some  serious  cases  that  are  near  death.  These  are  some  of  the  new 
<br/>initiatives that the Authority is undertaking in addressing some of the latest incidents in major health 
<br/>and also risky situations that they have encountered. Thank you, Mr. Speaker Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Economic Empowerment of iTaukei 
<br/>(Question No. 302/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. E.Y. IMMANUEL asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts inform 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  opportunities  and  programmes  that  are  currently  available  for  the 
<br/>economic empowerment of the iTaukei? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. VASU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister for Finance for 
<br/>the question.  The economic empowerment of the iTaukei is not a challenge only for the Ministry of 
<br/>iTaukei but it is a whole of Government approach, to ensure that the benefits of  
<br/>economic growth is shared widely. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  it  is  merely  a  redistribution  policy  but  is  based  upon  building  a  sustainable 
<br/>framework that will allow more and more iTaukei to establish and run businesses successfully and, 
<br/>hence, generate new economic growth potential. This is also aligned to the Government’s Economic 
<br/>Diversification Policy. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, in this regard, the itaukei institutions have been working more collectively 
<br/></span><span>under the Solesolevaki Framework, to formulate new initiatives for the economic empowerment of 
<br/>the iTaukei.  Under the Framework, illegible landowners go through an investment ready programme 
<br/>with the iTaukei Trust Fund Board and the iTaukei Land Trust Board before they are channelled to 
<br/>Fijian  Holdings  Limited  for  their  investment  assessment,  or  the  Merchant  Finance  for  lending 
<br/>requirements.  Some of the key initiatives include the establishment of wealth fund by the iTaukei 
<br/>Trust Board.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the first time in 84 years’ history of iTLTB, 10 percent of the annual 
<br/>lease money are being set aside for future investments. This is a historical initiative that will create a 
<br/>fund that allows the landowners to effectively develop resources, participating in: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>business entrepreneurship; 
<br/>(2)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(3)</span><span>
<br/></span><span>(4)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>invest or buy up expiring commercial leases; 
<br/>assist in providing education assistance for specialised fields; and 
<br/>in the same initiative, we are already on track to open up a landowners’ bank.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have the iTaukei Development Fund by the iTaukei Land Trust Board. 
<br/>The iTLTB has already allocated $5 million in concessional financing to iTaukei businesses.  So far, 
<br/>the sum  of $2.7 million has been approved for 33 landowners’ projects ranging  from  agriculture, 
<br/>gravel extraction, tourism transportation services, logging fleet and SMEs. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  also  provide  some  assistance  to  eco-tourism.  As  part  of  its  broader 
<br/>strategy to empower iTaukei landowners, iTLTB has committed $1 million in financial assistance, 
<br/>specifically targeted at supporting eco-tourism projects within the landowning units.  This initiative 
<br/>recognises  the  critical  role  eco-tourism  plays  in  sustainable  economic  development  and  the 
<br/>conservation of Fiji’s natural resources, particularly in areas like Yasawa, where landowners operate 
<br/>eco-tourism ventures.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Eco-tourism projects were badly affected by COVID-19 and iTLTB has taken the initiative 
<br/>to assist in revamping these operators in better quality standard to operate in the market. A study has 
<br/>been concluded and the iTLTB management is currently reviewing the recommendations provided 
<br/>by  the  consultant.  These  initiatives  align  with  iTLTB’s  reasons  of  driving  sustainable  economic 
<br/>development  by  empowering  the  iTaukei  landowners  to  take  a  leadership  role  in  tourism  and 
<br/>conservation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir,  on  the Vanua  and Marama  Finance by Merchant  Finance, the Merchant 
<br/>Finance has  launched two financial products - the Vanua  Finance  and Marama  Finance, to  allow 
<br/>more access of capital to iTaukei businesses. The Vanua Finance is specifically for iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>resource 
<br/>owners who want to unlock the commercial value of their resources. This programme  is targeting 
<br/>businesses, such as land subdivision, property development, gravel extraction and cartage operators. 
<br/>Over $6 million has been distributed for land subdivision projects, with five landowning groups. This 
<br/>is a huge opportunity, and the pipeline is very robust.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Marama  Finance  is  targetting  SME  businesses  in  agriculture  and  other  sectors.  This 
<br/>facility allows women to access between $100,000 to $500,000 in loan from Merchant Finance. It 
<br/>should be noted that Government will be subsidising the interest for the first three years of this loan 
<br/>and no interest will be paid by the borrowers.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on investment towards landowners joint venture with Fijian Holdings, the 
<br/>Fijian Holdings Limited through its impact investment programme has allocated 10 percent of its 
<br/>capital  of  around  $50  million  to  directly  invest  into  landowners’  group.  This  is  through  the  joint 
<br/>venture model where Fijian Holdings Limited will contribute 60 percent equity and 40 percent will 
<br/></span><span>come from the value of the land, and the joint venture is the development of property for commercial 
<br/></span><span>development. Close to $50 million has been committed by Fijian Holdings Limited for five projects 
<br/>around Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, on the Resource Owners Forum, for two consecutive years, we have been 
<br/>running the Resource Owners Forum where relevant Government agencies, the actual processors and 
<br/>exporters of these resources and the relevant financial lending institutions come together to discuss 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the economic empowerment of iTaukei</span><span> </span><span>resource owners. It is from this Forum where most of the 
<br/>initiatives that I am sharing today were identified and initiated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On training and development, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the need for more training and development 
<br/>of landowners in financial literacy and businesses is critical. The Government is also committed to 
<br/>this and is working in association with the Government Ministries, non-government organisations 
<br/>and the private sector to ensure that this challenge is addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Mr. Speaker, Sir, to conclude, the need to economically empower more iTaukei by getting 
<br/>them into business is a priority for this Government.  However, we should be under no illusion that 
<br/>this will be achieved overnight. Our Government is coming up with programmes and is trying to set 
<br/>strong foundations to ensure that this is sustainable over a long term.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Replacement Crossings – Nasovotava Village 
<br/>(Question No. 303/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.N. NAND asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport  update  Parliament  on  the  construction  of  replacement  crossings  for 
<br/>Nasovotava Village in Valley Road, Sigatoka, which were washed away in the 2012 
<br/>flood?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, yes, we have included Nasovotava Village 
<br/>crossings in the Fiji Road Authoritys road works for the next financial year, specifically 2025-2026. 
<br/>This means that necessary resources and plans have been drawn up for the current financial year.  
<br/>The survey and design works for the replacement crossing is close to completion. These preliminary 
<br/>steps  are  crucial  to  ensure  that  designs  meet  the  safety  and  capacity  needs  of  the  area,  while 
<br/>considering the flood risks which led to the damage in 2012.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The design will consider the lessons learnt from those floods, especially climate resilience, 
<br/>so that it can withstand the future challenges. It includes appropriate materials, structural enforcement 
<br/>and modifications.  Consultations are ongoing with the affected communities, including the residents 
<br/>of Nasovotava. So, as mentioned, the replacement will not only improve the safety and accessibility 
<br/>but  also  enhance  the  resilience  of  the  Valley  Road  network.    Government  is  fully  committed  to 
<br/>addressing the needs of all Fijians, especially in our rural and flood affected areas, and we recognise 
<br/>the importance of connecting our rural communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To conclude, I fail to understand why I am being asked about Nasovotava crossing because 
<br/>you could have asked the former Minister for Infrastructure and his Assistant as they had 10 years 
<br/>from 2012 to 2022, 10 years! But that was not addressed, so as our Government is for the people, for 
<br/>the Fijians in the rural areas which had not been addressed, we will definitely look into those. Thank 
<br/>you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.S. KIRPAL.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question. I would just like to bring 
<br/></span><span>to the honourable Minister's attention and if he is aware of it, that recently the Buabua Bridge has 
<br/></span><span>been washed away in Lautoka and the Arolevu Bridge in Nadi has been badly damaged.  It serves 
<br/>the people of Barosa, Tunalia and part of oNawaicoba. Thank you.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Thank you, I will get more details on that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hogwash! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="39">Page 39</a></div>
<div><span>2524 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  I do not have the specific details, but in the last few days I 
<br/>have been very concerned about the perception put up by the other side of the Parliament, that we 
<br/>are not doing anything and we have been labelled ‘hogwash’. This term has been introduced by your 
<br/>side, so it has now become very popular.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The other one was being called as incompetent and inaptitude. So, when we, the Coalition 
<br/>Government came in, we have worked hard, we did not rubbish the past projects but to continue and 
<br/>build on that. But one thing that continues to flabbergast me is the Queen Elizabeth Drive which 
<br/>contracted the sum of $61.9 million was awarded with a variation of $4.5 million and a final sum of 
<br/>$65.9 billion.  This is what I am saying, that you cannot call us inaptitude or incompetent, when I 
<br/>can  also  say  that  of  you.  But  the  good  thing  is  that  this  is  a  Coalition  Government  which  is  not 
<br/>abusive, we listen to you, and we work with you. When we are labelled as incompetent and inaptitude, 
<br/>this Queen Elizabeth Drive comes to mind.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the final sum of $6.8 million, a length of 4.5 kilometres or 14.6 million a kilometre, that 
<br/>could  have  been  reasonably  upgraded  because  the  objective  was  to  make  Queen  Elizabeth  Drive 
<br/>more pleasant and for leisure walks and drives so that could have been done for $20 million.  So, 
<br/>minus that from the final cost is $45 million. You could have built 30 crossings like the one which 
<br/>was being asked at $1.5 million per crossing, including the Nasovotava Crossing. Sir, that is just to 
<br/>put things into perspective when they labelled this side of Parliament as incompetent and inaptitude.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I am saying that not to condemn you, but just to balance. I am 
<br/>sure  we  are  not  perfect,  but  we  are  making  things  right  and  building  on  what  you  have  started. 
<br/>Someone said, “failed to do”, maybe I should have said that, but thank you very much. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- When we are talking about crossings and you go and talk about our 
<br/>road in Suva, that is inaptitude. But in terms of getting things right, what is the honourable Minister 
<br/>doing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just a few months ago they did road markings. When there was heavy rain now, you cannot 
<br/>see the road markings. That is inaptitude!  So, what is the Ministry doing? Are you buying cheap 
<br/>paint or is it that the contractors are not doing the right thing because those road markings that we 
<br/>did earlier this year have completely disappeared?  What is the honourable Minister going to do about 
<br/>that to make sure that people drive safely on the road from Suva to Nausori? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO. F.Q. TUISAWAU.- This could be labelled a new question, but this goes back to 
<br/>the situation during their governance where they removed the Public Works epartment. So, within 
<br/>the Public Works Department, they used to have a Quality Assurance and Testing Unit but that was 
<br/>removed. They used to test the quality of the roads, what types of materials were used and the material 
<br/>used  for  road  painting  which  is  resin,  he  knows  the  answer  but  he  is  asking  me.    Yes,  I  am  the 
<br/>Minister, so we are in the process of bringing that back to address that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  thing  is  that  the  quality  assurance  work  was  being  done  by  the  private  sector 
<br/></span><span>company who was engaged in that contract. That is like asking Dracula to look after a blood bank, 
<br/></span><span>so the two needs to be separated because one is monitoring the other, so that is the process. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Role of FCCC – Fostering Market Competition 
<br/>(Question No. 304/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. T.N. TUNABUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="40">Page 40</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2525 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Trade,  Co-
<br/>operatives,  Micro,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  and  Communications  update 
<br/>Parliament  on  the  role  of  the  Fijian  Competition  and  Consumer  Commission  in 
<br/>fostering  competition  within  the  market  while  maintaining  oversight  of  price-
<br/>controlled goods and services? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Tunabuna  for  the 
<br/>question.  Of course, the Fiji Competition and Consumer Commission (FCCC) is a very important 
<br/>independent  regulatory  agency  of  Government  that  obviously  monitors  competition  in  the 
<br/>marketplace,  provides  oversight  of  goods  that  are  price-controlled  and  also  ensures  that  market 
<br/>behaviour remains fair and equitable. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  a  bit  of  history,  FCCC  was  established  in  2010  and  actively  regulates  markets  where 
<br/>competition is limited or absent. It controls prices of essential goods and services and also looks at 
<br/>anti-competitive  behaviour  and  attempts  to  address  such  behaviour  where  there  is  suggestion  of 
<br/>prohibited practices such exclusive dealings, price discrimination, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The FCCC reports to the Ministry of Trade, and we do work closely together in terms of just 
<br/>watching the market.  I do receive regular advice from them in terms of particular market behaviours 
<br/>and  also  attempts  to  address  them.      Maybe,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  because  of  the  close  working 
<br/>relationship, I will just share some of the things that we have been working on together or trying to 
<br/>facilitate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Of  late,  there  has  been  the  Geogas  Pacific  Acquisition,  Petro  Oceania  Energy  Pte  Ltd  - 
<br/>acquisition of Mobil operations. There was the Telstra Corporation acquisition which happened not 
<br/>in  our  time,  but  that  was  a  big  exercise  as  well.  So,  they  do  look  very  closely  at  acquisitions, 
<br/>particularly significant acquisitions, that may impact on market position, creating unfair competition 
<br/>or may disadvantage consumers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lately too, Mr. Speaker, Sir, they do things such as when we introduced the increased VAT, 
<br/>FCCC was very active in monitoring all the retail shops around Fiji, to actually ensure that the right 
<br/>pricing  was  being  transferred  to  the  people  of  Fiji  and  where  they  felt  there  was  some  strange 
<br/>behaviour let us say, that was actually addressed there and then around the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Lately, as well, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have talked in this Parliament about the National Food 
<br/>Safety Taskforce.  That Taskforce is still ongoing and, hopefully, we can come back and report to 
<br/>Parliament on some of the work that is happening there.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>But, certainly, some of the things that we were seeing was the prevalence of inferior goods 
<br/>on  our  supermarket  shelves,  and  FCCC  as  well  as  Consumer  Council  have  been  quite  active  in 
<br/>actually  moving  around  towns  and  cities,  also  working  with  the  Health  Inspectors  in  the  Town 
<br/>Councils and trying to work together to go and monitor these places and ensure that some of these 
<br/>issues are being addressed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the moment with FCCC and Consumer Council, there has been a bit of work going on, 
<br/></span><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  trying  to  address  the  issues of  food  safety  and  food  standards  as  well  in  the 
<br/></span><span>country. We hope to bring a separate set of legislative changes, and I know the Ministry of Health is 
<br/>actually  looking  at  food  safety  at  the  moment  and  the  FAO  is  working  with  them.  We  hope  to 
<br/>piggyback on them and strengthen the standards, if you like, Sir, so that we can ensure that we do 
<br/>not have substandard food circulating on our shelves around the country.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, certainly from my perspective, FCCC has been quite active in trying to do 
<br/>its role. We interact regularly on all sorts of issues, and they do help provide guidance as well, where 
<br/>there is  requirement for  adjustments in  bus fares or adjustments in  other tariffs.  So,  it is  a useful 
<br/>agency  in  terms  of  continuing  to  ensure  that  in  the  Fijian  marketplace,  that  equity  and  fairness 
<br/>prevails and that our consumers are not gouged, Sir. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A supplementary question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thank the honourable 
<br/>Deputy Prime Minister for his answer. He spoke about standards of foods. FCCC also regulates the 
<br/>pharmaceutical industry, and they also regulate medicine. I am not too sure, honourable Minister, 
<br/>whether you are aware of this or not, but the standard of medicines that are actually regulated are not 
<br/>accepted by the Ministry of Health.  So, are there any, I would say, views of the Minister of excluding 
<br/>the substandard medication that are not accepted by the Ministry of Health and bringing the standard 
<br/>medication and have it priced controlled that are actually accepted by the Ministry of Health?  For 
<br/>example, at the moment, if a particular brand of paracetamol is accepted by the Ministry of Health, 
<br/>that should be the standard followed by FCCC but currently, it is not.  Anyone can bring paracetamol 
<br/>of any standard and get it under price control. Sir, is there any model to standardise that? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.S.N.  KAMIKAMICA.-  Thank  you  very  much,  honourable  Maharaj,  for  that 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question  because it is part of your profession. I thank you for the information. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think I can only promise to find out more about what you have raised, and 
<br/>I am quite happy to engage further in terms of trying to work out what you have just mentioned. 
<br/>Clearly, the Ministry of Health says that it is acceptable that, that should be the standard and that we 
<br/>should not be deviating. So, we will certainly find out a bit more on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question is to the honourable Minister and it is 
<br/>in regards to short term price control. We have seen during Diwali time that the price of ghee, from 
<br/>$18, it shot up to $32. During cyclone time, the price of candles and batteries goes up. So, there are 
<br/>businesses that are trying to make money. These are mainly unscrupulous businesses at the misery 
<br/>of the people. So, my question to the honourable Minister is, are you going to short term price control 
<br/>certain items based on the situation? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I forgot to mention ghee and that actually 
<br/>came up as an issue lately. We have actually put that under price control because there were some 
<br/>very irregular pricings that was seen at the time, so that is under price control currently.  In terms of 
<br/>the candles and batteries, we will have a look at that and see what can be done in that space as well.

<div><span>Specific Measures – Upcoming Cyclone Season 
<br/>(Question No. 290/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. F.S. KOYA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation  inform  Parliament  what  specific  measures  is  the  Ministry  implementing  to 
<br/>prepare the tourism industry for the upcoming cyclone season and the impacts of climate 
<br/></span><span>change? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.R.  GAVOKA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  am  grateful  that  this  question  was  able  to  be 
<br/>deferred from yesterday because I had to leave early to go to Nadi to officiate in the consultation and 
<br/>the announcement of a new tourism project at Wailoaloa Beach that occurred in Sheraton, Denarau. 
<br/>So, things are looking good for tourism, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I am grateful that I was given the time 
<br/>to go, and that question was deferred until today.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Ministerial Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2527 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Koya for the question. The impacts of climate change, 
<br/>as you all know,  is  a reality  we share. We have lived and recovered from it  - each time taking a 
<br/>lesson.  In  my  years  with  the  tourism  industry,  I  have  seen  all  these  disasters  as  a  hotelier,  as  an 
<br/>inbound operator and someone in charge of destination marketing for the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of cyclone preparedness, we can never be too prepared. But I also want to commend 
<br/>the  role  that  the  private  sector  industry  has  played  which  is  quite  instrumental  in  preparing  for 
<br/>disasters. As we know, preparing for a cyclone or any other natural disaster for that matter is not a 
<br/>one agency job. When it comes to managing the impacts of a crisis or a natural disaster, it is absolutely 
<br/>critical to have a multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On communication, one  of the very  first  ways of preparing is  to  ensure  a transparent  and 
<br/>ongoing  communication.  In  Fiji,  we  have  what  we  call  the  Tourism  Response  Team  (TRT).  The 
<br/>TRT’s key objective is to act as a consultative forum of public and private sector to coordinate, share 
<br/>information and provide assistance during natural disasters.  It has membership of the Ministry of 
<br/>Tourism,  National  Disaster  Management  Office  (NDMO),  hotel  association,  tour  and  transport 
<br/>association, national airline, airports and utility bodies, like energy and water. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>While functioning informally, we are now in the process of formalising the TRT that it is not 
<br/>only  activated  during  a  crisis,  but  prior  for  better  planning.  This  will  also  involve  clearly 
<br/>communicating each agency’s role and responsibilities.  This includes sharing information real time 
<br/>on guests who may be stranded, flight cancellation and expected water or power disruptions. Part of 
<br/>this  includes  disseminating  information  on  evacuation  centres,  situation  reports  and  emergency 
<br/>contacts.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the leadership played by NDMO.  Through Tourism 
<br/>Fiji, we also ensure timely consumable information to our global partners to provide reassurance of 
<br/>the safety of visitors to Fiji which is paramount.  We also roll out re-start campaigns to let our visitors 
<br/>know we are open.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On  Business  Continuity  Plans,  a  few  of  the  additional  actions  the  Ministry  will  take,  as 
<br/>identified by the National Sustainable Tourism Framework, is to identify resources and partners to 
<br/>support  tourism  businesses,  MSMEs  in  particular,  to  develop  business  continuity  plans  and  build 
<br/>contingency funds.  This is a big part of building resilience.   We also work with financial institutions 
<br/>and private sector associations to expand insurance options.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  With  respect  to  how  we  are  supporting  the  industry  and  prepare  for  the  impacts  of  climate 
<br/>change, I think the approach, to a large extent, focusses on adaptation.    This means, having in place 
<br/>climate  resilient  infrastructure,  incentivising  energy  efficiency  and  ensuring  access  to  climate 
<br/>finance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  one  of  the  initiatives  the  Ministry  will  spearhead  is  the  introduction  of 
<br/>National Sustainable Tourism Standards.  The proposed National Sustainable Tourism Standards will 
<br/>act as a guide to enhancing the holistic visitor experience and the long-term sustainability of Fiji as 
<br/>a  destination.    It  will  also  comprise  specific  indicators  to  ensure  compliance,  while  fostering 
<br/>alignments  with  international  and  regional  frameworks.    This,  amongst  other  areas,  will  look  at 
<br/>energy conservation and waste and water stewardship. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, over the next few years, we will also conduct an audit of available toolkits/ 
<br/>resources  for  mainstreaming  sustainability  best  practices,  and  adopt  Fiji-specific  toolkits  for 
<br/>operators to support the adoption and to the meet requirements of the Fiji Climate Change Act 2021: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Develop a voluntary green building code for hotels; 
<br/></span><span>•</span><span> </span><span>Focus on ecotourism products; and

<div><span>HON. R.R. SHARMA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very quick question to the honourable Minister, 
<br/>Paramedic  Insurance is  currently a programme for social welfare recipients  in  preparation of and 
<br/>respond to national disasters.  Can the honourable Minister consider a similar type of insurance for 
<br/>villages hosting tourists and small tourism enterprises when disaster hits and it affects their business 
<br/>so that covers their losses? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a good question.  We want everyone to be insured.  
<br/>There  are  a  number  of  options  out  there  but  certainly  it  is  something  that  we  are  working  on, 
<br/>honourable Member.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Tourism now has a huge element of community involvement these days. As I said earlier, it is 
<br/>no longer just the sun, sand and sea.   People want to visit our communities, in fact, some prefer to 
<br/>stay in community establishments.  We insist on insurance, and we will look at options to cater small 
<br/>scale types of businesses.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just  a  bit  of  background,  because  there  is  a  bit  of  history  to  this,  at  one  time,  we  had  four 
<br/>cyclones in  Fiji,  to  the extent  that underwriters  refused to  underwrite anymore insurance for  Fiji.  
<br/>Such was the impact on the bottom line. We had to go to Reserve Bank of Fiji so that people set up 
<br/>their own insurance.  They carried their insurance at the time, I am going back some years now.  But 
<br/>that is the kind of stuff that happened when Fiji had that kind of calamity.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I think honourable Members will remember those days back in the 1980s when there were four 
<br/>cyclones for over two weeks or something. Those are the kind of risks that we face.  I think today, it 
<br/>is much better because the risk for insurance has now spread globally.  I do not think we will ever 
<br/>have that situation again where we would be virtually isolated from the insurance community because 
<br/>of  the  types  of  disasters  that  occur  in  our  country.    But  going  back  to  your  question,  yes,  it  is 
<br/>something that we will look into and be part of a tourism setup.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for this opportunity to, perhaps, ask 
<br/>the last supplementary question.  Lessons learnt, particularly from </span><span>TC Winston</span><span> and </span><span>TC Evans</span><span> in 2012 
<br/>for  the  outer  islands,  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister,  the  main  issues  were  communications 
<br/>backup and transportation.  This is dealing with bringing the tourists back.  The ones along the coast, 
<br/>on mainland, are water issues.  What is the Tourism Response Team, together with NDMO, doing to 
<br/>continue with the preparatory work to cater for such incidences?      
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the outer islands, thankfully the warning system 
<br/>in Fiji is quite effective, and just going back to my earlier statement regarding Japan, most of the 
<br/>weather systems in Fiji is through the support of the Japanese Government and we all know that.  
<br/>What we normally do in the outer island resorts is try and empty  our resorts prior to the cyclone 
<br/>arriving because we want them near the airport.  The anxiety, these things are covered globally on 
<br/>television, et cetera.  The relatives back home are worried, so it is good that we always try and move 
<br/>them quickly into Nadi, near the airport areas or into the mainland.  You do not want to keep your 
<br/>guests on island resorts. The warning system enables you to do that in good time so that they are safe 
<br/></span><span>in a mainland resort.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> The communication system is adequate.  My last resort was back in 2010, I was in an island 
<br/>resort, communication was alright and was also centred through Tourism Fiji.  Now, with Starlink, 
<br/>things will be a lot easier.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>On the mainland, water is an issue but what we notice is that most resorts now carry storage

<div><span>2529 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>capacities that enable them to operate for three days, and some can do more than that. So, part of the 
<br/>resilience and infrastructure is to ensure that you have backup in your water supply system. Just about 
<br/>everyone now has a generator so when power goes off, the generator kicks in within 30 seconds. All 
<br/>in all, the tourism industry is very well positioned and equipped to handle crisis, like cyclones.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  of  all  the  industries  in  Fiji  today,  the  tourism  industry  is  very  well  positioned  and 
<br/>structured to handle any kind of disaster.  We have seen it.  How many cyclones have happened here 
<br/>for the last 30 years or 40 years, but we always survive.  When you are managing a hotel and you 
<br/>have about 400 guests and some of them are, for the first time, feeling this kind of stuff, that is the 
<br/>main part of the equation - to make sure they are safe, and you also make sure that your property is 
<br/>also safe.  But as I have said, the industry is pretty well positioned and well structured to meet these 
<br/>types of threats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I ask the honourable Leader of the Government in Parliament to 
<br/>move his suspension motion, I wish to inform honourable Members that the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Lands and Mineral Resources has submitted his written response to Written Question No. 274/2024 
<br/>which was asked on Monday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024 by the honourable Assistant Minister for Foreign 
<br/>Affairs.  That is now tabled and will be distributed accordingly. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the purposes of complying with the Standing Orders with respect to sitting times, I now 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>call upon the Leader of the Government in Parliament to move a suspension motion.
