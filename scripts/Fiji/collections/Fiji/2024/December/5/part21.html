<h3>BANK OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>BANK OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on 
<br/>Wednesday 4</span><span>th</span><span> December 2024, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 (Bill No. 22/2024) be debated, voted upon, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and be passed. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  said  yesterday,  this  is  a  pretty 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>straightforward Bill and I hope that we will be able to get through this very quickly.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just by way of background, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank of the South Pacific (BSP) Financial 
<br/>Group Limited formerly known Bank of South Pacific Limited, is incorporated and headquartered in 
<br/>Papua New Guinea with branches operating in the Pacific region including Fiji, Solomon Islands, 
<br/>Samoa, Tonga, Cook Islands and Vanuatu.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The BSP Fiji Branch is registered under the Companies Act 2015 as a foreign company.  In 
<br/>line with the global corporate financial structure and, indeed, some of the trends to gain operational 
<br/>efficiencies, the BSP Group Board resolved and approved the restructure of its operations in Fiji from 
<br/>a  branch  to  a  subsidiary  structure.    On  this  note,  to  the  new  entity  for  which  the  name  has  been 
<br/>reserved  with  the  Registrar  of  Companies  as  BSP  Financial  Group  Limited  (BSP  Fiji)  will  be 
<br/>incorporated as a company under Fiji's Companies Act 2015 with 100 percent shareholding of its 
<br/>parent company BSP. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the restructure of this nature of a commercial operation has implications for 
<br/>customers, employees and other persons in legal relationships with the banking entity. And without 
<br/>an  enabling  legislation  of  this  kind,  numerous  and  complex  legal  steps  would  be  involved  to 
<br/>substitute, in this case, BSP Fiji for BSP legal security documents such as mortgages, debentures, 
<br/>general  and  specific  security  agreements,  and  the  like.    This  could  potentially  involve  a  lot  of 
<br/>transaction costs and, indeed, an inconvenience to customers, the acquiring bank and other persons 
<br/>dealing with the transacting banks.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said  when  I  moved  the  motion  yesterday,  this  legislation  has 
<br/>precedence. The Australia-New Zealand Banking Decree 1991 successfully proceeded day two of 
<br/>the takeover by ANZ of the operations of Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Many of us would remember 
<br/>the BNZ. The National Bank of Fiji Limited Act 2011 also facilitated the acquisition by BSP of the 
<br/>operations of National Bank of Fiji in 2011.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024, therefore, seeks to facilitate the 
<br/>restructure by the vesting of BSP’s banking businesses in Fiji to be BSP Fiji by law, and this Bill is 
<br/>actually modelled on the 1991 and 2011 legislation. Those who are familiar with banking, such as 
<br/>the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives and Small and Medium Enterprises 
<br/>and Communications would attest to this, that there are some of the justifications on BSP Fiji to be 
<br/></span><span>restructured into a subsidiary company.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I want to highlight the following financial market regulators preferred financial institutions 
<br/>within their markets being incorporated into that particular jurisdiction.  Secondly, it complements 
<br/>the existing subsidiary approach in Vanuatu, Tonga, Samoa, and signals to the Fiji market that it is a 
<br/>local bank. But it also is about confidence in the country and confidence in the market in which the 
<br/>branch is located. 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span> Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Additionally,  having  a  locally  incorporated  subsidiary  allows  for  greater  local  board 
<br/>participation with consideration of a local operating environment. It allows for the segregation of Fiji 
<br/>market activities to a Fiji entity which, in turn, should allow for greater economic efficiency - things 
<br/>such as head office costs and other rationalisation that normally takes place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  subsidiary  operation  provides  limited  liability  protection,  shielding  the  parent  company 
<br/>from  the  legal  and  financial  risks  associated  with  the  subsidiary’s  activities.    Additionally,  Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, subsidiaries often have a degree of autonomy in  decision-making, allowing them to 
<br/>adapt more effectively to local market conditions and regulations.  Operating through subsidiaries 
<br/>can help mitigate risks by segregating operations and assets, thereby, protecting the parent company’s 
<br/>overall financial health. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are also, Mr. Speaker, Sir, expansion opportunities that subsidiaries can facilitate, such 
<br/>as expansion into new markets and new industries, providing a platform for growth separate from the 
<br/>parent  company’s  care  corporations.  So,  there  is  an  element  of  independence  with  a  local  board 
<br/>participation, and a local operating environment Local presence also enhance the parent company's 
<br/>local presence, subsidiaries will add to that, fostering better relationships with customers, suppliers 
<br/>and stakeholders in different regions. Subsidiary also may comply with local regulation, which can 
<br/>streamline regulatory compliance and reduce the parent company's administrative burden.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through this Bill, Mr. Speaker, BSP Fiji will install its own board of directors here in Fiji 
<br/>and  further  enhance  its  current  structure  by  having  other  subcommittees,  requisite  policies  and 
<br/>procedures where required pursuant to RBF’s (Reserve Bank of Fiji) supervision guidelines and any 
<br/>legislative provisions.  So, as I have said yesterday, as the consultations were held. The Cabinet had 
<br/>provided  approval  for  stakeholder  consultations.  As  I  said  yesterday,  they  were  face-to-face 
<br/>consultations  held  at  the  BSP  Fiji  branch  conference  room.  Generally,  the  Ministry  of  Finance 
<br/>received overwhelming support on the proposed restructure, Mr. Speaker, Sir.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  said,  this  is  important  for  BSP  and  Fiji.  BSP  is  a  number  one  bank,  and  I  will 
<br/>probably, in my right of reply, provide more details as to where BSP is in terms of the whole banking 
<br/>industry.  As I said the other day, the urgency of this Bill contrary to my friends on the other side, 
<br/>the financial year ends on 31</span><span>st</span><span> of December, and once this Bill is passed, BSP will be able to move 
<br/>on.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor for debate, there are three speakers on my list and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>each speaker will have 10 minutes to speak.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it is actually quite late in the day, and I think I did 
<br/>mention yesterday that this particular Bill is (I see the honourable Deputy Prime Minister smiling), 
<br/>is not thorny, but there is one question, which I ran by him earlier just to give him a heads up.  It is 
<br/>just some clarity with respect to one or two issues.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the two transactions that the honourable Deputy Prime Minister referred to 
<br/>were, when ANZ outright took over BNZ, and I think also when BSP took over Colonial’s operation.  
<br/>If  I  remember  correctly,  subject  to  be  corrected  by  the  honourable  Minister,  I  think  those  were 
<br/></span><span>purchases,  but  this  is  an  assignment,  that  is  being  done  in-house.  So,  in  terms  of  purchases  and 
<br/></span><span>assignments, what is interesting, is within this particular Bill, and I think if I can refer to Section 18.  
<br/>That particular Clause reads: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> “No liability is created or is deemed to be created under any tax law for BSP or 
<br/>BSP Fiji by the divesting by BSP of the BSP business and BSP property and the vesting 
<br/>of the BSP business and the BSP property into BSP Fiji.”  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="94">Page 94</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2579 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> So, you are looking at, this is going into a new entity for one, and then the vesting of BSP 
<br/>capital in the assumption of BSP Fiji or of the BSP liabilities.  We all understand what is actually 
<br/>transpiring  here,  but  what  we  would  like  to  know  from  the  honourable  Minister  is  that,  in  other 
<br/>previous transactions, would they also be given a waiver of any tax liabilities?  Because bear in mind, 
<br/>these are foreign-owned companies that make a large profit out of Fiji.  So, is this transaction being 
<br/>treated  as  one  where  it  is  so  important  that  they  are  being  told  that  they  do  not  have  to  pay  any 
<br/>liabilities tax on this particular change of ownership, so to speak? Because it is a divestment  and 
<br/>divesting all of its business into another one?  If it was done with a private company, where you are 
<br/>divesting your shares, et cetera, there are taxes and things that you may be liable for.  So, there may 
<br/>be a quicker explanation when he is going to respond, to say why is that being done, or is that a 
<br/>normal practice, and was that done when BSP purchased Colonial Bank and when ANZ purchased 
<br/>BNZ?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Again, the difference here is also that that was a purchase, but this is just a clear divestment. 
<br/>We understand the reasons why this is being done; basically, to create operational efficiencies, et 
<br/>cetera.    We  understand  that  it  may  be  a  huge  quagmire  of  difficulties  involved,  because  you  are 
<br/>talking about pieces of property and liabilities that are involved. We understand the operation of the 
<br/>particular clause in it where there is a waiver and I am talking about Clause 4(4) where it says: “no 
<br/>further consent, permit, notice, certification, ratification, charges, registration fees of any kind, filing 
<br/>fees,  lodgement  fees,  or  fees  of  any  kind  whatsoever  is  required  to  be  given  in  respect  of  any 
<br/>instrument sought to be registered for the purpose of evidencing, recording or effecting the matters 
<br/>referred  to  in  this  Act.  So,  anything  that  is  being  done  in  order  to  facilitate  this,  no  fees  will  be 
<br/>applicable. Basically, it's being done for zero. The state does not collect a penny.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My question here and behalf of all of us is please just give us reason why? Why is the state 
<br/>not collecting a penny, especially in light of the fact this is not one of our Fijian institutions like HFC 
<br/>or FNPF or one of our other institutes like Vodafone, etc?   If it’s to facilitate because they are one 
<br/>of the largest operators, we would like to know. Is it to facilitate because they have so many customers 
<br/>in Fiji, we would like to know.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We do not have an objection to this happening, Mr. Speaker, we just want an explanation 
<br/>from the honourable Minister as to why that is happening or what is actually happening with respect 
<br/>to this exemption from any tax payable. If there isn't any tax liable, that's understandable, but I'm not 
<br/>privy all of that. The honourable Minister might be able to explain to us, whether there is a liability 
<br/>and that's actually being waived by virtue of that particular clause being put into the law. That was 
<br/>the  only  query  that  we  had  Mr.  Speaker,  I  notice  late  in  the  day  and  I  actually  that's  the  that's 
<br/>something for the Minister to answer. I think that's a genuine query from all of us so that we do know 
<br/>if we do get asked, we can always respond to that.  I thank you Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. N. T. TUINACEVA.- Mr. Speaker Sir, I rise to support Bill No. 22 of 2024.  These are 
<br/>BSP Fiji Bill 2024, it’s a very important one to the organisation and to Fiji as well. It is simply to 
<br/>provide for the transfer to BSP Financial Group Fiji Ltd of the undertakings of the BSP Financial 
<br/>Group Ltd in Fiji for related purposes as already been mentioned by the honourable Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, as also mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister, this is an important business 
<br/></span><span>decision  moved  by  BSP  as  it  seeks  to  be  aligned  with  global  financial  structure  and  try  to  gain 
<br/>operational efficiencies.  What we are looking at, at the end of the day, it will mean innovative and 
<br/>cost-effective financial services to customers. However, it is also important to bear in mind from the 
<br/>explanatory notes on page 13, item 1.3, that there will be implications of this kind action as being 
<br/>questioned by honourable Koya. There could be tax implications that can be clarified by the Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister.

<div><span> Bank of the South Pacific Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It is also mentioned by the Deputy Prime Minister, the BSP Fiji Bill 2024 has precedent.  We 
<br/>all know that the </span><span>Australia-New Zealand banking Decree 1991</span><span> successfully facilitated the takeover 
<br/>by ANZ and so the operations of the Bank of New Zealand. And also mentioned by the Deputy Prime 
<br/>Minister the same case also happened in the Bank of the South Pacific Limited’s acquisition of the 
<br/>operations of the National Bank, back in 2011. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the business restructure of BSP will need the enabling legislation. This Bill is a 
<br/>necessity. BSP’s financial year begins in January, and they will definitely need the law to get the 
<br/>transformation work done.  So, I want to thank you Mr. Speaker for the opportunity, and I support 
<br/>the Bill that is before the House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to contribute to the Bill relating to 
<br/>BSP. I was just reflecting over the last few days when Colonial Bank started saying that it was going 
<br/>to  leave  Fiji.  I  remember  quite  vividly  reflecting  on  what  would  happen  to  the  assets  of  such  a 
<br/>wonderful bank that had done a lot for the country, and what that investor would do for the future of 
<br/>the financing system in Fiji? It was the first time I heard about Bank of the South Pacific, then we all 
<br/>discovered they were from our brothers and sisters from Papua New Guinea and they wanted to come 
<br/>to invest in Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fast-forward now to 2024, they are one of the largest single investors in Fiji and will be up 
<br/>there in terms of lending funds. They are number three certainly in terms of institutional investment 
<br/>through BSP Life.  They cover life insurance for quite a number of our people. And I have to say Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir that they have done well. They have of cause have their own property in the country and 
<br/>they are wonderful corporate citizens.  I turned a celebration for them recently, the honourable Prime 
<br/>Minister as well.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of regionalism, in terms of regional corporation, BSP has been one of the agents of 
<br/>regionalism in the South Pacific. They continue to move around the Pacific and have become a central 
<br/>part of the financing system in the Pacific.  So, I guess I am saying Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you reflect 
<br/>on that and the importance to Fiji.   Of course, when they decided to become a subsidiary and no 
<br/>longer a branch, and some of us especially for me, who have worked in the banking system, there is 
<br/>a major shift when you are a branch and becoming a company.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Because the proper system of governance perhaps is a bit lighter in terms of footprint over a 
<br/>branch,  the  full  extent  of  corporate  governance  gets  imposed  in  a  subsidiary.    So,  full  corporate 
<br/>governance structures are imposed on the entity. I have always reflected on when foreign banks setup 
<br/>as branches and when they decide to become subsidiaries as in the case with BSP, it is actually a 
<br/>signal that they are in the country to stay. That they want to part of the fabric of the country, they 
<br/>have confidence in the country, and they wish to participate not only as a branch but a fully-fledge 
<br/>corporate citizen.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just on those reflections alone Mr. Speaker, Sir, alone when this came to Cabinet, I certainly 
<br/>welcomed it because it is the right thing to do for the company. I am sure the honourable Finance 
<br/>Minister  will  address  the  questions  by  honourable  Koya.  But  just  look  at  it  this  way,  they  are 
<br/>signalling to Fiji that they are here to stay, it really just the left hand passing over a bottle to the right 
<br/></span><span>hand, and in that simple process if they are any liabilities of course.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a country we should welcome the decision to change over to a corporate entity, because it 
<br/>does enhance its overall standing and also creates greater signal certainly from my perspective in 
<br/>terms of their participation in the banking and financial sector of our country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, on those few notes I fully support the Bill before Parliament and hope we all do

<div><span>as well. </span><span>Vinaka saka. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  before  I  give  a  little  bit  more  on  BSP’s 
<br/>footprint enrolled in the banking industry in the country.  Let me just respond to honourable Koya I 
<br/>think that is a very good question.  Let me say first there is no new third-party involvement, so that 
<br/>is the first thing which essentially means that the ownership does not change.  If you look at the Value 
<br/>Added  Tax  1991  legislation,  which  provides  exemption  for  financial  services  and  zero-rating  of 
<br/>taxable set supplies of sales for business as a going concern, that is another point. Section 18 of the 
<br/>Bill which you referred to honourable Koya, that is related to tax consequences of the BSP transfer. 
<br/>We have checked with Fiji Revenue and Customs Service) as well, it is satisfactory.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Really in terms of tax, nothing changes. Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP is one of the largest corporate 
<br/>taxpayers and your point about profit of BSP, in fact, BSP has 6,000 shareholders and FNPF is the 
<br/>largest shareholder.  So, what that means is that the more profit BSP makes, the better for FNPF 
<br/>members, but let me just give some information for our people and for Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, BSP offers a full range of business and personal lending products, international trade and 
<br/>payment services, transactions, savings accounts, plus electronic banking services across the ATMs, 
<br/>EFTPOS, internet, phone, and SMS banking services.  It offers a full range of business and personal 
<br/>lending  products,  international  trade  and  payment  services,  transaction  and  savings  account  plus 
<br/>electronic banking services, ATMs, you have internet, phone and SMS and banking services. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir, BSP is the number one bank by market share, having the largest loan 
<br/>deposit portfolio, the loan portfolio is about 26.9 percent almost 27 percent and the deposit is about 
<br/>25.5 percent. They have about 398,412 customers, a network of 17 branches, 548 fulltime employees 
<br/>and 40 part-timers, and attachment staff. They have about 122 ATM and 319 EFTPOS.  They actually 
<br/>offer  a  very  significant  volume  of  rural  banking  services  through  their  partnership  with  postal 
<br/>agencies, and they have the farthest outreach right up to Rotuma.  There are also about 58,736 social 
<br/>welfare customers who bank with BSP and are not charged any monthly service fees, and they get 4 
<br/>free transactions per month. This is the nature of BSP’s banking business. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  want  to  thank  all  the  honourable  Members  for  their  contribution  and 
<br/>support for the Bill. I want to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Haroon Ali, the Country Head for 
<br/>BSP; the man with 40 years of banking  experience. And our staff within the Ministry of Finance 
<br/>including the Permanent Secretary for having the consultations and getting this process sorted out.  
<br/>We had two options; we could have done this through transfer by agreement and the other option is 
<br/>legislation. We preferred the legislation which is easier than the transfer by agreement option.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the motion to the honourable Members. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- We will now proceed through vote on the motion.   
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that bring us to the end of today’s sitting. I thank 
<br/>you all for your contributions and if I may say so I think that we have done remarkably well today, 
<br/>considering the seven Bills and their importance to the country that have gone through and passed.
