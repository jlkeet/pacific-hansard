<h3>SUGAR INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>SUGAR INDUSTRY (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to Standing Order 51, I move: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That the -  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(a)</span><span> </span><span>Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill 2024 (Bill No. 23/2024), be considered by Parliament 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>without delay; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(b)</span><span> </span><span>Bill must pass through one stage at a single sitting of Parliament;  
<br/>(c)</span><span> </span><span>Bill  must  be  immediately  referred  to  the  Standing  Committee  on  Justice,  Law  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Human Rights; 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(d)</span><span> </span><span>Standing Committee must report on the Bill at the next sitting of Parliament and upon 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(e)</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>presentation of the report on the Bill by the Standing Committee;  
<br/>the Bill must be debated and voted upon by Parliament and that one hour be given to 
<br/>debate the Bill, with the right of reply given to me as the Member moving this motion. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, on various occasions, I have emphasised my plans in  
<br/>addressing the challenges of the sugarcane farmers.   One of the matters that I have agreed to resolve 
<br/>as the Minister responsible for the sugar industry was to give farmers back their voice by allowing 
<br/>them to choose their own members to serve the Growers Council Board. We want to stop making 
<br/>decisions on matters affecting them as farmers, and this can only happen if the growers election is 
<br/>reinstated.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to assure the honourable Members of this august House that we are 
<br/>making appropriate use of Standing Order 51.  The Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill to facilitate the 
<br/>reinstatement of the process of the election of members of the Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC).  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, For the past two years, I have had many pocket meetings with the sugarcane 
<br/>farmers both, in Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  The farmers, in nearly all meetings, had inquired with 
<br/>me  on  why  there  are  delays  in  conducting  the  elections  for  the  members  of  the  SCGC.    Their 
<br/>eagerness and interest indicate that they can no longer wait to get their voice back. It was taken from 
<br/>them in 2009.  Since then, the farmers voices have been diluted with the experience from the previous 
<br/>government.  This  not  only  affected  them  psychologically  but  impacted  their  contribution  to  the 
<br/>industry, resulting in an overall decline in production. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is 15 years now and we cannot afford to delay the elections and reinstate 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>everything back to the way it was before in 2009. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the actual work to reinstate the process of the SCGC began as soon as I got 
<br/>into  Parliament  in  December  2024.    Following  necessary  consultations  with  the  SCGC  and  the 
<br/>institution  representing  all  Growers  Councils  -  the  Sugar  Industry  Tribunal,  the  Registrar  of 
<br/>Sugarcane Farms, approval was given from Cabinet in August 2023.  
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sugar Industry (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2531 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  Ministry  has  continuously  been  consulting  the  SCGC  to  ensure  that 
<br/>necessary  work  is  undertaken  to  allow  sugarcane  farmers’  election  to  be  conducted  before  the 
<br/>beginning of the next cane crushing season, which is June 2025.  After the election is conducted, the 
<br/>new Council Board or Directors will get into office to take charge of the farmers’ affairs. There will 
<br/>no longer be any appointments made by the Minister, which has been happening since 2015. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  Bill  was  drafted  by  legal  experts  from  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-
<br/>General with input from the Ministry of Sugar, the SCGC, the Sugar Industry Tribunal and Fijian 
<br/>Elections Office. The Bill aims to simply reinstate the election process for the members of the SCGC.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Certain clauses of the Sugar Industry Act 1984 was removed to repeal the SCGC election and 
<br/>the composition of the Council. Therefore, through this Bill and the Principal Act, it will amend to 
<br/>reinstate Clauses 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 43, 46 and 47 that were either amended or completely 
<br/>deleted.  The  reinstatement  of  these  Clauses  will  also  allow  the  election  to  take  place  and  new 
<br/>members of the Council Board to be appointed through the farmers election.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have done necessary consultations, and this Bill is a straightforward one, 
<br/>so  we  are  referring  this  Bill  to  the  Standing  Committee  for  further  deliberation.    The  Standing 
<br/>Committee will have several  weeks to  conduct  their own  consultations and analyse the Bill.  My 
<br/>Ministry, including the SCGC and the Sugar Industry Tribunal are available to provide any further 
<br/>support to the Standing Committee where and when required.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Before I open the floor for debate, I wish to remind Members that you may 
<br/>speak for up to 20 minutes only and I should emphasise that the debate should be confined to the 
<br/>procedural aspects of Standing Order 51 and why the Bill needs to go through this process.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, the floor is open for debate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I congratulate the honourable Minister for coming 
<br/>up  with  this  particular  Bill  that  I  am  sure  is  very  vital  for  the  sugar  sector,  in  particular,  for  the 
<br/>sugarcane growers. I think, as a matter of principle, it has always been our hope that things would 
<br/>not have to go through Standing Order 51, but we are grateful that in this particular case, while it has 
<br/>gone through Standing Order 51, it is something that is needed and there is time. There is a bit of 
<br/>time.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We know we have Christmas around the corner and to get this Bill back by March will mean 
<br/>that the Committee will have to start working in December, and probably by February, and we hope 
<br/>that, that will be facilitated so that we can meet the deadline that the honourable Minister requires. 
<br/>As I have said, we always talk about not using Standing Order 51 but in this case, there is some time, 
<br/>which gives us an opportunity as representatives of the people to take this back to the stakeholders 
<br/>and to come back with a full assessment of this particular Bill for the benefit of Parliament and Fiji. 
<br/>So, we agree with the recommendation that is before this august House.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Since  there  are  no  other  interventions,  I  now  call  on  the  honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister to speak in reply.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. C.J. SINGH.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Usamate and the Opposition for 
<br/>taking this Bill very seriously.  I hope we can settle this Bill by March and hold the election before 
<br/>June. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Parliament will now vote.
