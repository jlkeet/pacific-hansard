<h3>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024</h3>
<div><span>PRESIDENTIAL PENSIONS (AMENDMENT) BILL 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, pursuant to the resolution of Parliament on Monday, 
<br/>2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024, I move that: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  Presidential  Pensions  (Amendment)  Bill  2024  (Bill  No.  20/2024),  be  debated, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>voted upon and be passed.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, we had some discussions on Monday on this Bill 
<br/>which  is  very  clear.  The  short  title,  the  amendment  to  the  Act  decided  the  Presidential  Pensions 
<br/>(Amendment) Act 2024 and if approved, this Act comes into force on a date appointed by the Minister 
<br/>by notice in the gazette.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The only amendment, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is section 8(1) of the Presidential Pensions Act 1994, 
<br/>which is amended to delete “five years”, substituting it with “three years”, because of the situation 
<br/>we are in where the presidential term in the 2013 Constitution is for three years or prior.  Previously 
<br/>it had been five years.  The pensions were calculated or determined by the term of the time, rather 
<br/>than a term in office, as had been changed in the Constitution.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We find ourselves now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that we have the first President who only served a 
<br/>term of three years, although they may be appointed for a further term.  The immediate past President 
<br/>served only three years and should not be denied the benefits he would have derived if he had served 
<br/>the full five years.  I thank the honourable Members who had supported the motion to bring it this 
<br/>far, and I also thank the </span><span>Turaga na Tui</span><span> </span><span>Macuata</span><span> for his term, and we do not want to deny him any of 
<br/>the benefits.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have seen that our Heads of State had really carried the flag of the nation 
<br/>well wherever they had gone.  The immediate past President had carried that flag to the Olympic 
<br/>Games, World Cup Rugby, United Nations General Assembly and has really been a worthy holder 
<br/>of the Office of Head of State - President of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Without any further ado, I commend this Bill before the House.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, the floor is now open for debate on the motion.  I 
<br/></span><span>have a list of three speakers, and may I remind that each speaker will only have 10 minutes each for 
<br/>their intervention.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me the floor on the motion that 
<br/>is before this august House on the amendment to the Presidential Pensions Act 1994.  It is a legislation 
<br/>that has covered the pensions for Presidents and also for Governor-Generals in the past, those who 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="48">Page 48</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2533 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>had  been  our  Heads  of  State  and  also  when  we  did  have  then  the  Vice  Presidents  of  Fiji.    It  is 
<br/>something that is important and relates to the highest office of the land in terms of the Commander-
<br/>in-Chief of our Fiji Military Forces and all that it entails, hence the Head of State.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>First, I would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister and  members of the Executive, 
<br/>who have brought this up because as we can see, there is an anomaly, to some degree, between the 
<br/>duration of the term that they serve and the way that it was set in the original legislation.  I think this 
<br/>sort of motion or Bill being brought up under Standing Order 51 makes sense because it is apparent 
<br/>that there is a need for it.  No one needs to get a big textbook to be able to see that need.  There is 
<br/>nothing new that has come up.  It is not a substantive change, it is something just to correct, something 
<br/>that needed to be corrected.  I think this is something that the Government needs to realise - you use 
<br/>Standing Order 51 for something like this, that is sensible.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The good thing, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that this is an Opposition that is sensible.  We do have 
<br/>our senses about this.  In the past, we have had an Opposition who would sit on this side and oppose 
<br/>anything and everything.  This particular Opposition, we do have our senses with us, and we see that 
<br/>this is something that is just logic or something that needs to be done.  It needed to be done so that is 
<br/>why, as the Opposition, this is something that was ideal for Standing Order 51, not aquaculture.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Aquaculture Bill is a totally new Bill.  It should have gone through the whole process but 
<br/>because  it  is  sensible  and  look  at  us,  we  are  all  sensible,  including  those  on  this  side  who  really 
<br/>support the other side, we are all sensible on this side of the House.  That is the reason why.  For me 
<br/>and all of us on this side, we unequivocally support this Bill.  It makes sense, it is a sensible move 
<br/>and we are, I would say, the sensible Opposition, not like that lot when they were sitting on this side.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I support this whole episode of nominating Presidents.  We have the process 
<br/>where the honourable Prime Minister has a nominee, and the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>has  a  nominee.    However,  that  particular  process  has  now  ended.  The  former  President  has  now 
<br/>departed and is back in Macuata. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We now have a new President.  In the appointment of the current President, one of the things 
<br/>that concerns us, which is the second reason, is the flip-flopping nature in which the Government 
<br/>approached this issue.  Honourable Prime Minister, with all due respect, Sir, we once again saw that 
<br/>flip-flopping nature which was apparent right from the very outset ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- A Point of Order, Mr. Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Standing Order 60 on relevance. Also, it is unnecessary that 
<br/>the honourable Member is casting aspersions on the appointment process.  He is talking about flip 
<br/>flops.  His Excellency the President has been appointed by a process of Parliament. This Parliament 
<br/>appointed him.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is unparliamentary, irrelevant, and an attempt to bring disrepute 
<br/>to the Office of the President by raising the matter of the appointment of the President.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I do agree and I will rule honourable Usamate out of order in that particular 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>respect. You may continue nevertheless on other aspects of it, if you wish. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not question the manner in which His Excellency 
<br/>the President was appointed, I do not cast aspersions on that. I think we now have the honourable 
<br/>President who is in place, </span><span>Na Gone Turaga Na Tui Cakau</span><span>, and there is nothing that I will say that 
<br/>says that there is anything wrong with that. It has been done. I was just talking about the fact that the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="49">Page 49</a></div>
<div><span>2534 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>nominations changed over time and that is alright also because it is the prerogative of the honourable 
<br/>Prime Minister to change his nominations. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Members interject) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Hold your horse!   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  think  one  of  the  things  that  did  happen  here,  to  a  large  extent,  was  the  build  up  of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>expectations.  I am sorry, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Usamate.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  rise  to  contribute  to  the  debate  on  the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024. This Bill, at the outset, it is a clear, simple ….  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- A Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Usamate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Just a clarification, I was under the impression that you had asked me 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to stop. Is that correct?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Well, I have asked you to stop, yes, now. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was under the impression that you had asked me then, that is why I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sat down.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I said, “do continue if you wish” but you then sat down, so that ceases your 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>opportunity to present.  I did ask you to continue, that is correct.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.-  Can I just clarify, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- What do you want to clarify from me? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- I was under the impression that you had asked me to stop, that is why 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I stopped talking.  I did not realise that you had given me leeway to continue. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- It is on the record. I did ask you to continue if you wish, but then you sat 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>down and said you are done. Continue, honourable Naivalurua. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  NAIVALURUA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  I  have  said,  this  is  a  very  simple  clear 
<br/>amendment Bill that can be easily discussed in a very short time. It is a Bill that is urgent.  Secondly, 
<br/>it is a Bill of necessity. It is quite clear from the discussions on the Bill that it has been long overdue 
<br/>and there is a misalignment of the Constitution to the actual Act, in my understanding, of this.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I believe, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the amendment will surely bring a degree of fairness to His 
<br/></span><span>Excellency the President who has recently retired. If we fast-track this quickly, he will be able to 
<br/>receive a fair remuneration of what he is supposed to receive.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  this  side  of  the  House,  we  are  clear  on  our  position.    We  support  this 
<br/>amendment Bill for the simple reason that it is urgent and a matter of urgency.  But the point that I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="50">Page 50</a></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2535 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>would like to emphasise is that it was long overdue. It should have been realigned long ago, but it 
<br/>was not, so let us do it now.  I, and our G9 Bloc, support the amendment of this Amendment Bill.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.W.R.  VOSAROGO.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  honourable  Prime  Minister,  fellow 
<br/>Cabinet Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; 
<br/>I rise to support the Bill that was moved in this august House by the honourable Prime Minister on 
<br/>Monday, 2</span><span>nd</span><span> December, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I do that, I suppose I should join the chorus of congratulations and 
<br/>well-wishes that have been expressed in this House by  honourable Members, as well as outside of 
<br/>the House, to your good self for your appointment as the Speaker of this august Parliament.  I am 
<br/>sure that you would have already observed by now that it is, indeed, a little harder to maintain the 
<br/>House that you had, compared to the house that you had previously had domain over in the courts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps on a lighter side, Mr. Speaker, Sir, since we are well into the evening, in the courts, 
<br/>only one lawyer has a right of audience when he or she is on her feet.  In this House, Sir, you will 
<br/>find that 55 Members would think that they all have a right of audience all at the same time, even 
<br/>when you have only given permission to one. But I wish you all the very best, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A bit of background and context, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is, indeed, a very short Bill. It seeks to 
<br/>correct a legacy error of the previous Administration.  Let me correct myself, Sir.  The misconception 
<br/>of a legacy and the era that they did not correct.  What was the legacy?  Around 6th September, 2013, 
<br/>a  new  Fiji  Constitution  was  signed  into  law  by  decree.  We  all  know  how  that  Constitution  was 
<br/>constructed - by a few, quite possibly by one, and forced on the people of Fiji.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. GOVERNMENT MEMBERS.- Hear, hear! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- This was after the widely consulted Yash Ghai Draft which 
<br/>was released in March 2013.  Later, as we all know, was hideously burnt at the back of the Printing 
<br/>House.  On whose orders?  That attack on a democratic consultative process was done.  Perhaps, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, some honourable Members on the other side of the House know. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Point of Order, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, honourable Usamate, your Point of Order? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- My Point of Order is Standing Order 60 – Speech must be relevant.  
<br/>We are talking about an amendment to this Bill and the honourable Member is talking about Yash 
<br/>Ghai and the making of Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not talking about our Constitution.  
<br/>The speech making is totally irrelevant. We are just talking about the amendment. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order! I will just allow him for a little bit more.  Carry on, honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.W.R. VOSAROGO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, could I just rehash that?  On whose orders 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that attack on the democratic consultative process was done? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Perhaps, some honourable Members on the other side of the House know.  Now, with the 
<br/>passing of the Truth and Reconciliation Act yesterday, they are now free to tell us who gave those 
<br/>orders.  So,  the  much  publicised  fanfare  of  constitutional  making  in  2013  that  provides  for  the 
<br/>President’s Office’s functions, powers, terms in office and other provisions concerning that office of 
<br/>the President, Section 85(1) of the Level 7 Constitution of 2013 states, and I quote: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="51">Page 51</a></div>
<div><span>2536 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Presidential Pensions (Amendment) Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>5</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>“The President holds office for 3 years, and is eligible for re-appointment for one 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>further term of 3 years, but is not eligible for re-appointment after that.” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since 2013, Mr. Speaker, there have been four Presidents to-date.  The first two Presidents 
<br/>served more than five years.  The recently retired President of the Republic of Fiji served one term 
<br/>and,  that  is,  three  years.    Whilst  the  two Presidents  qualified  for  Presidential  Pension, the  retired 
<br/>recent occupant of the State House did not.  Therein, Sir, is the error of the so-called legacy of the 
<br/>FijiFirst  Government.    They  forgot  to  correct  the  President’s  Pension  Act  of  1994,  in  particular, 
<br/>section 8, to  align the  constitutional term  of office and the entitlement that  must ensue after they 
<br/>leave.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This amendment, Mr. Speaker, that is being brought in by the Coalition Government does 
<br/>more than just correct the legacy error of the previous Administration but also reflects a government 
<br/>that is ensuring that Heads of State are treated alike after they have completed their term in office.  
<br/>Whether they have completed one term  or after  completing a re-appointment term,  this Coalition 
<br/>Government is taking the step to ensure equity to all past Heads of State who have served our nation 
<br/>well.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this amendment shows a government that is committed to fairness and parity 
<br/>and in that regard, I urge the honourable Members of this august House and the members of the G16 
<br/>Bloc to also support the Bill moved by the honourable Prime Minister. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  I  would  just  like  to  comment  further,  after  listening  to  the  honourable 
<br/>Minister,  that  I  find  his  intervention  relevant  as  a  background  to  why  the  present  amendment  to 
<br/>section 8 is made.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a very short reply, but I would like to just reflect on 
<br/>the great motion we agreed to yesterday on the Truth and Reconciliation Bill which became the Act.  
<br/>I would like to thank all the Members who participated.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you were ambassador, one of the few ambassadors we have had during 
<br/>our term out of the Commonwealth in the Court of St. James, I came to present my </span><span>matanigasau</span><span> to 
<br/>Her Majesty.   You became Her Majesty’s </span><span>matanivanua.  </span><span>I still do not know what Her Majesty had 
<br/>told you to say to me, but I was very happy with the way she received me and I am sure that if we go 
<br/>through the process that we have agreed to go through in the passing of the Bill yesterday, we will 
<br/>have the same sort of friendship and comfortable relationship that I had with Her Majesty until her 
<br/>demise.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However, coming back to this Bill, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank those who participated, and I 
<br/>apologise  for  the  flip  flop,  that  was  a  sincere  disclosure.    We  were  sincere  about  moving  for  the 
<br/>reappointment of the former President, but the circumstance is beyond our control which forced us 
<br/>to look for someone else.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With those few words, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend this Bill before the House and I hope 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that we can now vote on it and agree.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, Parliament will now vote. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.
