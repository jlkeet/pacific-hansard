<div><span>Restoration Payment – FNPF Pensioners 
<br/>(Question No. 305/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning, National Development and Statistics update Parliament on the restoration payment 
<br/>from FNPF to pensioners as announced in the 2024–2025 National Budget?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Naupoto for his  question.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Very quickly in 2011, as we all know, the military regime unilaterally reduced the pension rates for

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>FNPF pensioners, in a way broke the trust between the Fund and the pensioners. To deny justice, the 
<br/>government at that time also enacted a law to restrict these pensioners from challenging this unfair 
<br/>treatment in the court of law.  That, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is history.  When we came into Government, 
<br/>we responded for a quick temporary solution by allowing affected pensioners to access Government 
<br/>social pension of $125 if they were above the age of 70 or $115 if they were between 60 years to 69 
<br/>years.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  the  honourable  Members  would  recall  that  in  the  recent  budget,  we 
<br/>brought some kind of permanent closure to this gross injustice. All pensioners who reluctantly opted 
<br/>for reduced pensions rate or had their pension payments restored to same levels to the new rate which 
<br/>was decided in 2011. However, effective from 1</span><span>st</span><span> August 2024 and moving forward, we have restored 
<br/>the full pension that they were receiving at that point in time and for this, we did not go to FNPF 
<br/>because the FNPF is still looking at the whole issue.  We provided a funding of $4 million in the 
<br/>Budget for the reinstatement which is estimated to be around $57 million over the next two decades 
<br/>based on the actuarial estimates and analysis, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that has been done.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>To facilitate the process, the Ministry of Finance had entered into an arrangement with FNPF 
<br/>to  facilitate  the  top  up  payment  to  the  affected  pensioners  and  so  far  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  August,  2024, 
<br/>Government has disbursed around $1.3 million to 1,300 pensioners from August to November, 2024. 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the payments are made according to the pension payment cycle on the 14</span><span>th</span><span> and 28</span><span>th</span><span>
<br/>of each month. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Deputy Prime Minister, you did 
<br/>mention that the Military regime unilaterally made this decision way back in 2011. But I want to tell 
<br/>you honourable Deputy Prime Minister that, that decision was based on a presentation that was made 
<br/>by the board and the management for the long-term sustainability of the Funds. So, my question, and 
<br/>I want you again to confirm this decision that you have taken, was it as a result of a presentation 
<br/>again, a request from the board or the management, or is it just a unilateral decision taken by the 
<br/>Government? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the honourable Leader of the Opposition 
<br/>was listening to me carefully, I said very clearly that what happened in 2011 was a unilateral decision 
<br/>by the Government; whether it was based on actuarial advise or whether it was about sustainability, 
<br/>the fact that it was made by a Government without consultation with the pensioners, it was a unilateral 
<br/>decision so that stays there.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>What I have said very clearly is that the Government recognised the pain of these pensioners 
<br/></span><span>and as soon as we came in, we voluntarily (in a temporary solution) we provided the social pension. 
<br/>In  the  last  Budget,  we  tried  to  restore  the  pension  from  1</span><span>st</span><span>  August,  and  we  have  taken  the 
<br/>responsibility as a Government to provide funding. I said very clearly that we have $4 million in the 
<br/>Budget for this year and so far, $1.3 million has been dispatched, so that was very clear, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  The issue about sustainability actuarial decision, that is another matter; that the FNPF Board in 
<br/>consultation with the Government if they are going to relook at that. That is another matter. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- The honourable Minister is known for goosestepping, he has just one. 
<br/></span><span>My  question  is  from  a  pensioner  who  withdrew  partially.  Partial  withdrawal  was  made  for  their 
<br/></span><span>pension in 2011 during the reform period because they felt maybe they will not get any money et 
<br/>cetera. They wanted to take this matter to court, so my question to the honourable Minister is, in free 
<br/>Fiji when will the Government repeal the 2011 FNPF Transition Act to allow pensioners to take their 
<br/>grievance to the court?

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2587 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- What is very clear Mr. Speaker, Sir, is the confusion that the 
<br/>honourable Leader of the Opposition and his member sitting on the other side.  One is saying, when 
<br/>are  you  going  to  bring  a  legislation  in  Parliament  to  revoke  that?    The  honourable  Leader  of  the 
<br/>Opposition is talking about the justification for that and the sustainability, and they accuse us, so they 
<br/>are confused! She is confused!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable Member interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I want them to answer this, is she agreeing with the honourable 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Leader of the Opposition that his point of view is that, they did the right thing?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, I take your Point of Order, honourable Minister.  Can you go on right 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>away? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-I  am  just  clarifying,  will  you  continue  honourable  Minister?  But  answer 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>directly the question that is posed to you. Thank you. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- I am answering the question directly, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As I 
<br/>have said earlier, this decision that the Government has made to include $4 million in the budget is 
<br/>to restore the pension of those who chose to go on a lower pension that was decided in 2011. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  PROF.  B.C.  PRASAD.-  All  the  other  matters  that  honourable  Kumar  is  raising, 
<br/>whether  we  repeal  the  law  that  was  there  in  2011,  that  is  the  matter  for  the  Government.  As  a 
<br/>government, we will make the decision in consultation with FNPF, if it is appropriate.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Right now, Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done as a government is a compassionate thing, 
<br/>we have done justice to all those pensioners and that is where the matter rests at the moment. The 
<br/>honourable Member can ask for an opinion or whatever which is irrelevant.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR.  SPEAKER.-  Thank  you,  honourable  Minister.    I  consider  the  question  as  answered. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Maharaj, were you going to ask the last question on this? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, with this reform, there was also suggestions that 
<br/>a member could actually get pension, is $100. Now we have actually moved 12 years ahead, even 
<br/>the minimum wage rate... 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Chorus of interjections) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- I am coming to the question, Mr. Speaker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Yes, please, pose your question now. 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  A.A.  MAHARAJ.-  The  Minimum  Wage  rate  has  actually  increased  by  this 
<br/>Government to around $5.50. Has Government plans to increase the $100 pension to, at least, 50 
<br/>percent,  considering that the new Minimum Wage rate with  $5 comes to  $250?  Even the Social 
<br/>Welfare  pensioners  are  receiving  $115  to  $125.    So,  this  segment  of  members  who  have  been 
<br/>receiving $100 for the past, at least, 10 to 12 years have been missed out. Is there any consideration 
<br/>to increase their pension to bring it up to par with what the Social Welfare pensioners are getting, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said, the mess that we inherited in terms 
<br/>of how this pension rates were changed.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have in the last two budgets, carefully 
<br/>considered, we increase social welfare allowances in the 2023-2024 Budget. We have provided this 
<br/>additional support to FNPF pensioners and going forward, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a Government, we 
<br/>would be reviewing in consultation with the Ministry of Social Protection, how and where we need 
<br/>to increase amounts and I think that is a legitimate question and that is something that the Government 
<br/>will constantly look at.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2024 China International Import Expo 
<br/>(Question No. 306/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I. S. VANAWALU asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, Co-operatives, 
<br/>Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Communications update Parliament on Fiji’s 
<br/>participation at the 2024 China International Import Expo?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank honourable Vanawalu for the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>question. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the China International Import Expo (CIIE) is actually one of the premier 
<br/>events in China, in terms of the global calendar. I actually attended last year, however, this year the 
<br/>exhibition was attended by the Permanent Secretary for Trade and his team and it took place from 
<br/>5</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024 to 10</span><span>th</span><span> November, 2024. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just to give a sense of the size of this event, Mr. Speaker, about 152 countries attended from 
<br/>across the globe, plus regional organisations. The exhibition spaces is around 420,000 square metres 
<br/>and it does actually provide an opportunity for Fiji, we normally have a booth that profiles our trade 
<br/></span><span>and investment in the country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the booth actually was endeavoured to highlight some of our key exports, 
<br/>mineral  water,  noni,  beverages,  turmeric,  kava  products  alongside  tourism,  agribusiness  and 
<br/>manufacturing.  This  year’s expo, of course, reinforced our broader strategy or the strategy of the 
<br/>People’s Coalition Government to boost exports and investment and solidify Fiji’s position as the 
<br/>hub for trade and transportation in the Pacific. With China has one of Fiji’s key trading partners, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker,  Sir,  our  engagement  at  CIIE  is  very  important  in  fostering  connections  of  course,  and 
<br/>creating new opportunities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Just very briefly, Mr. Speaker, before I sit down some of the discussions that were held while 
<br/>the team was there included a discussion with Modern Star Silk. It is a company that manufactures 
<br/>silk production and there is some discussion around silk production in Fiji and they will be visiting 
<br/>our shores soon.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2589 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and  digital  infrastructure  is  a  mega  multinational  in  China  and  are  keen  to  see  whether  they  can 
<br/>participate in our green transition.  Of course, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in keeping with the Aquaculture Bill 
<br/>that was passed into law yesterday, part of the visit also was to continue discussions with the Chinese 
<br/>Government on fisheries and aquaculture.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  the  team  actually  visited  the  South  China  Agricultural  University  Fisheries  Research 
<br/>Institute  in  Nansha,  Guangzhou,  exploring  opportunities  for  collaboration  in  aquaculture  and 
<br/>sustainable  fisheries.  Potential  projects,  such  as  crab  and  prawn  farming,  which  would  obviously 
<br/>support the rural community, food security and economic diversification was explored, and of course 
<br/>we have invited the institute to visit Fiji, and hope that either of the major universities, whether it is 
<br/>FNU or USP may be able to collaborate with the South China Agricultural University. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr, Speaker, Sir, we are looking forward to a delegation from China in the next few weeks. 
<br/>There  are  also  some  cultural  tourism  projects  being  discussed  during  the  visit  and  again  the 
<br/>emergence of cultural tourism is starting to gain momentum, and our delegation from Shanghai is 
<br/>most likely to visit Fiji next year to look at exploring opportunities in that particular area, and I am 
<br/>sure it will be a welcome development from the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for 
<br/>Tourism. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  as  you  can  see  the  China International  Import  Expo  (CIIE)  event  is 
<br/>normally quite an important event for the country. It was funded by the Chinese Government. So, 
<br/>our visitation was quite targeted and there are some very good opportunities that have emerged, and 
<br/>we shall be following them through in the next few months.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT.COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Deputy Prime Minister, 
<br/>China is a key development partner and a friend. We import a lot from China, but we are interested 
<br/>in how we can also increase our export levels to China.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Way back in 2013, we had some discussions, we sent our </span><span>dalo</span><span> to China and we have talked 
<br/>about aquaculture and fisheries products. There is a problem in China, where now products land, 
<br/>particularly agriculture and fisheries products, there is a 16 percent tariff on our products because of 
<br/>our World Trade Organisation (WTO) standing as a middle income country. What has progressed in 
<br/>terms of getting our products into China, that negotiations started way back in 2013. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you know, it is a continuing discussion 
<br/>at the moment with China in terms of the trade arrangements. We are talking about a Free Trade 
<br/></span><span>Agreement, which has some implications on our economy. So, we are sort of handling it strategically. 
<br/></span><span>Certainly,  if  the  Government  does  something  it  will  be  done  on  Fiji’s  terms  so  that  we  do  not 
<br/>jeopardise our industries in Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some discussions in trade and we will continue them next year, but certainly a Free 
<br/>Trade Agreement as we all know, will decimate our industry in Fiji, so we have to be very careful in 
<br/>terms of that negotiation. There are other ways to sort out tariff barriers or tariff reductions, and that 
<br/>too is in discussion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, I agree with you, this is one of the most premier 
<br/></span><span>destinations in terms of export.  Just a quick question on the private sector participation. The question 
<br/>is twofold. Was there a delegation including the private sector from Fiji or did they go out privately?  
<br/>If so, do we have a dollar value to some of the deals that were done with respect to other exports out 
<br/>or imports in?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am pretty sure there were some private 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="11">Page 11</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>sector participants in the expo because of the exhibitions that happened there. I will check for sure, 
<br/>but I cannot remember at this stage. But certainly, some of these discussions are at the very early 
<br/>stages, so it would probably be premature to estimate a figure.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Interestingly last year, when I went to the expo, we ended up signing two MOUs that were 
<br/>worth around US$60 million - one to do with </span><span>noni</span><span>, which was about $40 million and the other $20 
<br/>million was someone wanting to set up forestry here.  I am pleased to say that the </span><span>noni</span><span> production is 
<br/>now happening in Tailevu, so we look forward to seeing that explode, because as we all know, </span><span>noni</span><span>
<br/>is  quite  popular  in  parts  of  China.  We  will  certainly  work  on  that.  I  will  try  and  get  some  more 
<br/>information on the potential quantum, but last year was a bit easier to quantify because we had the 
<br/>MOUs, we had done a press release. But point taken and I will report back on that.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Measures to Address Illegal Immigrants  
<br/>(Question No. 307/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. LAL asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Foreign  Affairs,  Climate 
<br/>Change, Environment, Civil Service, Information, Public Enterprises, Immigration and 
<br/>Fiji  Police Force inform Parliament  of  measures the Ministry is  taking to  address  this 
<br/>issue, given that there are currently more than 8,000 illegal immigrants in the country?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Virendra Lal for his question.  
<br/>Perhaps, a background to the question, but before that, I congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, Sir,  for your 
<br/>first week in the Chair and it has not been an easy week - not a normal Parliamentary week, and thank 
<br/>you for your endurance. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Today is also a very important day in my life, not my birthday, but on 6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 1987, I 
<br/>gave away all the powers I had to the late Sir Ratu Penaia Ganilau, and made him President, and I 
<br/>went back slowly to the Camp.  Also, in 2006, this room was configured rather differently at the time. 
<br/>I sat in a box in the middle there, and a gentleman sitting here with a red gown, and he used the same 
<br/>sort of gavel, and he said to me “not guilty, you are now a free man, go and join your family.” So, it 
<br/>is a very important day in my life, and I would like to thank the honourable Virendra Lal for bringing 
<br/>up this question.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I would like to just go very quickly over the background of the question that points back to 
<br/></span><span>Government. I would have asked the Immigration Investigators to wait for you, honourable Lal, after 
<br/></span><span>this break to ask you where these people are. But you have got the figures from the former Minister 
<br/>for Home Affairs who made a statement that there are presently more than 8,000 illegal immigrants 
<br/>in Fiji, says honourable Pio Tikoduadua. This number had doubled from one year, as reports from 
<br/>2023 shows they were 4,709 illegal immigrants in Fiji in January 2023. The number had increased 
<br/>and the Minister then, was very concerned.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, the answer to your question is also the response to the question he had, of the concerns 
<br/>that he had. What is the Immigration Department or Government doing at this time?  I would like to 
<br/></span><span>go over those.  They were started by honourable Tikoduadua, while he was holding the portfolio of 
<br/></span><span>the Minister for Immigration.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Office had implemented a comprehensive strategy to address the issues effectively. Key 
<br/>measures  in  place,  intelligence  structure,  the  Fiji  Immigration  Department  has  enhanced  border 
<br/>management capabilities through the following actions. An intelligence and assessment structure that 
<br/>coordinates information proactively in drawing out the trend of illegal migrants who may intend to 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>reside illegally in Fiji. This assessment will point out emerging trends and issues of border security 
<br/>to  identify  irregular  migration  movements  and  provide  a  border  security  landscape  to  avoid  an 
<br/>increase in numbers. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember my first visit to Australia as Prime Minister, where there was a 
<br/>welcoming service by the Fijian community in Sydney, and I had a big police entourage looking after 
<br/>me and I noted that there we no prayers right through the service and even the benediction at the end 
<br/>of the sermon when the </span><span>Talatala</span><span> pronounced benediction, no one closed their eyes and I said, why 
<br/>did  you  not  pray?   There  was  no  prayer  right  through  the  service  and  during  benediction  no  one 
<br/>closed their eyes. When they came out from the grog session after, they told me, “</span><span>O ira na tevoro era 
<br/>lako tu mai qori.</span><span>” You had demons and devils accompany you, who were they? Those people who 
<br/>were with you. Who were they?  They are my police security.  “</span><span>Oi</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>we thought they were Immigration 
<br/>Officials.  So many  of our own who  are  out  there in  other  countries are  also  worried  about  being 
<br/>nabbed by Immigration Officials.  Perhaps, we should have our own </span><span>tevoro </span><span>around looking for illegal 
<br/>immigrants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  integrating  all  immigration  systems  with  Migration  Information  Data 
<br/>Analysis System will centralise traveller data, including biometrics and travel history, to  enhance 
<br/>border security and streamline operations.  Using advance analytics and real-time verification, the 
<br/>system  will detect  illegal  immigration, fraud and security threats  through automated assessments. 
<br/>This unified approach strengthens security, improve efficiency, supports data driven decision and 
<br/>ensure it is compliant with privacy standards.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Strengthening compliance and enforcement operation, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Department has 
<br/>expanded the Compliance Unit resources to explicitly focus on surveillance process for geographic 
<br/>locations of prohibited immigrants.  It also entails enforcement, operational plans involving security 
<br/>apparatus  to  facilitate  and  feed  intelligence  to  execute  operation  activities  without  violating  any 
<br/>human rights and also reducing the number of illegal immigrants. As we enforce the law, we have to 
<br/>be mindful of the various rights that we enjoy as citizens and also those that are in our country. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Developing networks and partnerships with local and international law enforcement agencies 
<br/>to encourage effective collaboration and coordinated immigrants. This approach involves leveraging 
<br/>advanced  surveillance  processes,  data  analytics,  and  intelligence-sharing  to  track  and  address 
<br/>unauthorised movements efficiently. Collaboration with other law enforcement agencies ensures a 
<br/>coordinated response to potential breaches while fostering transparency and accountability.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This morning, Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the Caucus I asked the honourable Pio Tikoduadua whether 
<br/></span><span>we had been too passive in our enforcement, perhaps we should take a more proactive role with our 
<br/>investigators and our police, actually asking people on the street if they look suspicious - excuse, Sir 
<br/>or excuse Ma’am, do you have an ID; excuse me young girl, do you have an ID and  find out whether 
<br/>she should be in school or she should be on the street. Those are some of the things we need to tighten 
<br/>up. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Voluntary departure and removal mechanisms – the department is intensifying consultation 
<br/>efforts through stakeholder engagements to facilitate voluntary departures for those seeking to leave 
<br/></span><span>the country. This includes fostering open dialogue with community groups, NGOs, and other relevant 
<br/></span><span>entities to promote compliance and provide pathways for resolving immigration issues amicably. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Public awareness campaigns – the Department adopts a whole-of-government approach to 
<br/>deliver comprehensive information through coordinated public awareness initiatives.  By engaging 
<br/>multiple  government  agencies  and  stakeholders,  these  campaigns  aim  to  educate  the  public, 
<br/>employers and migrants about immigration laws, workers’ rights and the importance of compliance.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Legislative  reforms  and  police  updates  –  the  department  is  undertaking  a  comprehensive 
<br/>review of the Immigration Act to enhance the independence of the institution and address critical 
<br/>areas  such  as  intelligence  gathering,  emerging  immigration  pathways,  infringement  notices  and 
<br/>penalties, removal processes and responses to non-traditional threats. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have multi-stakeholder collaboration through the department and other international 
<br/>and local agencies, like Interpol. Those, Mr. Speaker, Sir, are some of the measures put in place to 
<br/>try and encounter the rising numbers of illegal immigrants.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you notice from the Chair, that this tie 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that I am wearing, sort of, energises me, and I want to fly this morning. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I am noticing it. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- My simple question to the honourable Prime Minister is, I did not 
<br/>serve  in  the  immigration  portfolio  but  convening  boarder  agency  meetings  and  national  security 
<br/>meetings. One of the key issues, Sir, that is usually related to these illegal immigrants, is the issue of 
<br/>detention centres - a proper detention centre for illegal immigrants.  There  have been discussions 
<br/>about purchasing a land, and I just want to know if there has been progress on this key issue. You 
<br/>have a responsibility for this, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the moment, there is none, and we have had a 
<br/>recent example, a bad example, of someone who was held up for immigration, non-compliance, being 
<br/>housed with convicted criminals. There is none yet, but it is also something that we must really look 
<br/>into, but better than that would be to just avoid or prevent immigrants staying longer than they should 
<br/>be. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, would like to thank the honourable Prime Minister 
<br/>for the answers that he has given to the questions. I am interested in the analysis, if there has been 
<br/>any  analysis  done  to  the  breakdown  or  where  the  illegal  immigrants  come  and  in  particular  the 
<br/>proportion of Pacific Islanders vis-à-vis others from other countries. If there is any information on 
<br/>that generally, and the reasons in particular for Pacific Islanders remaining in country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe there is a data available, they have been 
<br/>analysed and the main reason for Pacific Islanders overstaying their permit or their allowed time, is 
<br/>kinship,  not  many  are  illegally  employed,  mostly  the  kinsman  will  just  stay  on  and  on.  The  Fiji 
<br/></span><span>citizens are asking for more sympathetic considerations. The analysis that have been taken, and it is 
<br/></span><span>not flattering, it is quite embarrassing if we openly mention the countries of origin. But they will 
<br/>have to be brought out in the right media.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  F.S. KOYA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, honourable Prime Minister, in  light  of the  fact  that 
<br/>8,000 is almost 1 percent of our population being a substantial number, but I know there is a lot being 
<br/>done  at  immigration.  There  are  likelihood  that  we  will  also  be  looking  at  strengthening  our 
<br/>immigration laws especially because we have also had quite a huge influx of foreign workers coming 
<br/>into the country, because a lot of ours have actually migrated or gone across to other parts of the 
<br/></span><span>world to work. So, would we be looking at strengthening our immigration laws which I certainly feel 
<br/></span><span>that we can do?  On the other side of the coin, honourable Prime Minister, is there a chance that the 
<br/>Coalition Government may look at an amnesty of sorts to see if we can actually reduce the numbers 
<br/>and those that may genuinely qualify to actually stay in Fiji, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the former Minister for Immigration just whispered 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to me that it is already now with the Office of the Solicitor-General being vetted so that we can

<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the former Minister for Immigration just whispered 
<br/>to  me  that  it  is  already  now  with  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor-General  being  vetted  so  that  we  can 
<br/>implement those measures.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>However,  most  of  those  who  came  in  to  work,  they  illegal  stamped  it  because  they  have 
<br/>changed from the conditions issued to them with their work permit.  The work permit could have 
<br/>contained  where  they  were  going  to  be  working  and  for  whom,  but  when  they  change  that,  they 
<br/>become illegal immigrants. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, I think this is the appropriate time to have recess, so 
<br/>we will now suspend proceedings for our morning break.  Parliament will resume in half an hour.  
<br/>Thank you, honourable Members.

<div><span>Benefits to Rural Communities - Tourism Development 
<br/>(Question No. 308/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA asked the Government, upon notice:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Deputy  Prime  Minister  and  Minister  for  Tourism  and  Civil 
<br/>Aviation update Parliament on how the Ministry is ensuring that local communities in the 
<br/>rural areas benefit directly from tourism development? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, and we also say hello to my </span><span>tauvu</span><span> from Ra. As you 
<br/>all know Nadroga and Ra are very closely related. They generally know that we are superior to them.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  thank  the  honourable  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural,  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management  for  the  question.  I  welcome  the  opportunity  to  address  this  important  question, 
<br/>regarding  how  the  Ministry  is  ensuring  that  local  communities  especially  those  in  the  rural  areas 
<br/>benefit from tourism development. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, is deeply committed to promoting inclusive and 
<br/>sustainable tourism growth, guided by the principles outlined in Fiji’s National Sustainable Tourism 
<br/>Framework  (NSTF)  2024  to  2034.  This  Framework,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  guides  us  to  ensure  that 
<br/>tourism development is equitable, community-centric and aligned with Fiji’s broader socio-economic 
<br/>goals.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Strategy is built on four goals: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Prosperous visitor economy; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Thriving and inclusive communities; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Visible and valued cultures; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Healthy islands and oceans.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Each goal carries strongly the participation and empowerment of communities in tourism.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Goal  1:    Prosperous  visitor  economy;  we  want  to  create  laws  that  suit  indigenous-owned 
<br/>businesses  and  investments.    I  briefed  Parliament  over  the  last  few  days,  Mr.  Speaker,  about  the 
<br/>Summit  I  had  attended  in  Perth,  the  World  Tourism  Travel  (WTTC)  Summit,  and  the  future  of 
<br/>tourism.  As  projected by WTTC, a significant  growth  that is  expected from  indigenous tourism. 
<br/>They believe that without this tourism, we will not achieve what it sets out to do in terms of uplifting 
<br/>the lives of communities across the globe.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Goal  2:  Thriving  and  inclusive  communities;  encourages  initiatives  like  mentoring  and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>training to ensure indigenous participation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Goal 3: Visible and value cultures; while we promote our culture and tradition, we want to 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>ensure we will safeguard it.  
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2595 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A  significant  factor  about  tourism,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  is  how  it  helps  revive  cultures  and 
<br/>traditions.  I  have  shared  in  this  Parliament  about  the  opening  of  the  Muanivatu  Trail  in 
<br/>VuadomoVillage, in Wailevu, Cakaudrove. That  day, they performed ceremonies, some of which 
<br/>were last performed 50 years ago, we were fortunate that there was still an old person there who 
<br/>remembered this particular part of the ceremony. Through the opening of the Muanivatu Trail, the 
<br/>young people of Vuadomo were able to revive their tradition. That is what tourism does, Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Goal 4:  Healthy islands and oceans; we want no disparity in our fight against climate change 
<br/>and explore nature and traditional knowledge-based solutions.  In order to ensure communities and 
<br/>rural areas benefit, promoting inclusiveness over the last two years, we held two major sport events 
<br/>Spartan Fiji and Fiji Pro.  In both of these events, we ensure that local communities and rural areas 
<br/>benefit. For example, at the Fiji Pro event, the organisers rebuilt the cloud break surf tower and gifted 
<br/>it to the people of Tabanivono-i-wai of Nadroga as a legacy asset to monetise the use of their surfing 
<br/>reefs.  Of course, there was cash contributions made to Nabila and Momi Villages.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Through our Farm to Fork initiative, we are working directly with farmers, fisher folks and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>the middlemen around the country to strengthen their ability to supply to the tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Na  Vualiku,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  earlier  this  week,  I  spoke  about  Vanua  Levu  Tourism 
<br/>Development Framework.  This entire programme is centred on empowering a significant part of our 
<br/>country, our second largest island grouping and its people, who right now, only see about 4 percent 
<br/>of visitors in Fiji.  On tourism awareness, the Ministry, under the leadership of </span><span>Roko Tui Saravanua</span><span>
<br/>is  also  undertaking  community  awareness.    The  team  visits  communities  wanting  to  venture  into 
<br/>tourism and provide them with guidance.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Based  on  these  sessions,  we  are  looking  to  partner  with  organisations  to  deliver  training, 
<br/>specific to their needs.  On laws, very critical way of ensuring the benefits of tourism, we are setting 
<br/>up laws to ensure that tourism benefits are equitable by creating all the regulations to safeguard that.  
<br/>There  are  a  number  of  tourism  legislations  that  we  are  now  reviewing  to  ensure  that  we  have  a 
<br/>conducive environment for businesses of all types and sizes to grow. One, is access to funding the 
<br/>resources. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  a  cornerstone  of  this  strategy  to  support  rural  communities  and  tourism 
<br/>development  lies  in  ensuring  equitable  access  to  financial  resources.  As  I  shared  earlier  in  the 
<br/>Parliament,  the  Ministry’s  Pilot  Tourism  Micro  and  Small  Fund  empowers  individuals  and  small 
<br/></span><span>enterprises in rural areas by providing much needed financial assistance. I announced this about two 
<br/></span><span>days ago and the interest it has created has been phenomenal across the country.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This programme enables eligible applicants to secure the resources required to either establish 
<br/>or expand their tourism ventures. It focuses on fostering inclusivity by bridging gaps in accessing 
<br/>capital,  especially  for  those  operating  in  remote  regions.  By  offering  targeted  support,  we  are 
<br/>enabling rural communities to create sustainable tourism enterprises that directly benefit the local 
<br/>economies and livelihoods.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry is steadfast in its commitments to fostering our 
<br/></span><span>tourism sector that uplifts rural communities.  By embedding inclusivity, sustainability and resilience 
<br/>into our policies, we are creating pathways for rural Fijians to thrive alongside the growth of Fiji’s 
<br/>tourism industry.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LT. COL. I.B. SERUIRATU.-  Mr. Speaker, Sir, you have talked about indigenous 
<br/>tourism. Given the resources that our local communities have and the various segments and activities, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="17">Page 17</a></div>
<div><span>2596 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>forgive me, there are two parts to the question, one is just our local cuisine in the rural areas.  Of 
<br/>course,  opportunities  for  activities  like,  abseiling,  mountain  climbing,  cross  country  cycling  and 
<br/>mountain biking, these are opportunities that can help shape us in bringing the tourists into the local 
<br/>areas. What is the Ministry doing about local cuisine and such activities? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the question from the honourable 
<br/>Leader of Opposition.  Indeed, when you talk about food, food is also culture. And this is an area we 
<br/>are developing our tourism. There are a number of renowned chefs who have now produced some 
<br/>publications on the local cuisines which we are supporting. These are a part of the tourism industry 
<br/>which they accept to use in their outlets. It is in their interest because of the cost factor. There is a lot 
<br/>of dialogue on that,  and we are seeing  many changes. If you go  to  many eateries now across the 
<br/>country, you will see a high content of local dishes in their outlets, even in the five start resorts, so 
<br/>that is happening.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We also have the Farm to Fork programme, whereby the local farmers are aligned to the local 
<br/>operators, the hoteliers to ensure that they grow their produce on demand. They coordinate what they 
<br/>grow with the chefs, or with the food and beverage people in the hotel. So, in that way, you will see 
<br/>a lot of local produce being featured in the menus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, however, there is still a lot to do in that area, as I have said food is also 
<br/>culture. On the overall activities, the phenomena or the challenge that we are seeing right now for 
<br/>Fiji is to create more activities for our visitors. As I keep saying, it is not just about staying in the 
<br/>resort now, they want  to go out.  Indeed, it is  something  that we need to  address because we can 
<br/>become a boring destination if we do not factor this into the equation. It is part of the dialogue now 
<br/>with  the  leadership  in  tourism,  to  create  more  activities,  hiking,  mountaineering  and  all  these 
<br/>activities. The support is there, and if anyone wants to start, we are there to help and our development 
<br/>partners are also there to help us develop that. We want them out  there in the country and in the 
<br/>communities.   As a way forward, we cannot do without it and we are committed to it.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Gavoka.   I apologise, honourable Koya, but you 
<br/>are out of the periphery of my vision as I look down. I think you may need to have a light cough or 
<br/>something to draw my attention.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. On a lighter note, the honourable Leader 
<br/>of  Opposition  mentioned  “mountain  biking”  twice  and  members  of  the  Parliament  may  not 
<br/>remember, but I think that everyone should be told that he used to be a 100 metres sprinter.  Athletics 
<br/></span><span>was his game but when he went to COP21, they turned him into a mountain biker, Sir. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, prior to COVID, this is to do with our rural areas, there was an exploratory 
<br/>market being looked at, and I believe there was some work done on it and this is the student tourism 
<br/>market  and  it  is  worth  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars.  This  was  and  is  a  great  opportunity  for 
<br/>connectivity to our rural areas.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When I say, student markets, if I may be permitted to explain a little bit. There are people 
<br/>with a great amount of wealth that wish to send their children to places like Fiji, where they can learn 
<br/></span><span>the  old  way  of  architecture,  the  old  dances,  the  old  way  of  doing  things.  This  is  where  our  rural 
<br/></span><span>communities could benefit quite substantially from it.  This was looking at the Indian market where 
<br/>they spend hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in student tourism. Now, my question to the 
<br/>honourable  Minister  is,  will  you  be  looking  at  that  or  try  and  tap  into  that  source,  that  our  rural 
<br/>communities can engage with them and do extremely well out of it?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V.R. GAVOKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is a segment we are also factoring into our  
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="18">Page 18</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>tourism offerings. Some villages are already welcoming students regularly from the UK.  Indeed, as 
<br/>we speak, we are also talking to operators who are specialised in that, in Australia and New Zealand, 
<br/>to bring in students for that purpose. India is also a possibility.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, it is a segment that we are encouraging and one that is community based driven, and that 
<br/>is the beauty about it, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as it helps with the goals to develop community tourism. As 
<br/>highlighted by honourable Koya, these are parents who have done so well, and they are afraid that 
<br/>their children believe that that is the way life is, all the luxuries and all that they have at home, they 
<br/>just want to send them somewhere where they can experience the reality of life.  And Fiji, is big in 
<br/>the map, for families like that. So, yes, Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is a segment that we know is there, and 
<br/>we are working towards tapping into that segment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, pursuant  to  Standing Order 45(6), Oral  Question

<br/>(Question No. 310/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALABURE asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Culture, Heritage and Arts update 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Parliament on the status of the iTaukei Lands and Fisheries Commission review? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  I.  VASU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Vakalalabure  for  the  question.  In 
<br/>regard to the iTaukei Land and Fisheries Commission Review, the team started their review from 
<br/>September with the help of the Strategic Advisory Group, who guided the step during the review. 
<br/>They have already visited 14 Provinces, doing their consultations. They have also consulted some 
<br/>focus groups on their discussions and they also  did  virtual  meetings, that  included diaspora  from 
<br/>overseas. Currently, they have also updated the GCC on its last meeting, and they are compiling their 
<br/>report now. On the 20</span><span>th</span><span>, they will discuss their report with the Strategic Advisory Group before they 
<br/>hand over their report to the Ministry.

<div><span>Frequent Traffic Congestion - Suva-Nausori Corridor 
<br/>(Question No. 311/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S. KUMAR asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport  inform  Parliament  on  how  the  Ministry  will  address  the  frequent  traffic 
<br/>congestion in the Suva-Nausori corridor? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q. TUISAWAU.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Shalen  Kumar  for  the 
<br/>question.    In  line  with  Government’s  commitment  to  improving  access  to  socio-economic 
<br/></span><span>opportunities, the Fiji Roads Authority’s (FRA) is actively working towards addressing the frequent 
<br/></span><span>traffic congestion.  This is part of the broader medium to long-term infrastructure development plan 
<br/>that aligns with the objective set out in the FRA’s strategic plan. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the continued growth in urban development and increasing number of vehicles on our 
<br/>roads, we do recognise the urgent need to find sustainable solutions to this congestion.  As a result, 
<br/>in line with Government’s vision we are working towards forward planning to implement a four-lane 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>widening of Ratu Dovi Road from Nadera to Laqere, Fletcher Road from Nanuku to Laucala Bay 
<br/>Road and Princess Road from Khalsa Road to Samabula. These are vital corridors that once upgraded 
<br/>will significantly reduce traffic congestion.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir,  the  Ministry  is  also  currently  working  on  the  review  of  our  transport  system  where 
<br/>assistance has been secured from the Government of New Zealand to develop the Transport Master 
<br/>Plan  and  Decarbonisation  Implementation  Strategy.    In  terms  of  reference,  include  a  roadmap  to 
<br/>deliver  the  final  goal  of  the  transport  sector,  provide  a  flexible  and  achievable  guide  for  future 
<br/>planning and development and outline long-term growth and development for the transport sector.  
<br/>Including in that, as I mentioned, decarbonisation implementation strategy assessing Fiji’s current 
<br/>transport emission, identifying areas for improvement and setting clear and achievable targets. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the master plan will also identify traffic congestion issues and come up with short and 
<br/>long-term solutions to address these problems.  One of the pressings issues that we are facing is the 
<br/>supply of new and second vehicles, increasing supply of new and second-hand vehicles and number 
<br/>on our roads which put  pressure on our road infrastructure.  This plan will also identify the right 
<br/>quota in terms of number of vehicles on our roads. As most of you will agree, there seems to be a lot 
<br/>of vehicles on our roads as compared to the current capacity of our roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, LTA is also actively currently actively working on a range of targeted initiatives to address 
<br/>the  persistent  traffic  congestion  including  promoting  public  transport,  review  of  public  transport 
<br/>networks,  also  development  of  a  sustainable  urban  mobility  plan.    A  service  targeted  measure 
<br/>supported by strategic partnership and technical expertise reflects the Government’s commitment to 
<br/>mitigating traffic congestion in the Suva-Nausori corridor.  The aim is to create a modern, sustainable 
<br/>and efficient network modalities for all Fijians.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addition, FRA and PWD are also exploring existing reserves for the construction of roads 
<br/>within this corridor.  This includes the Suva-Nausori Regional Road. This is alternative road to King’s 
<br/>Road and Princess Road. Their priority is to explore these link roads to the populated Nasinu corridor, 
<br/>residential and commercial areas to ease the movement of traffic.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, PWD is now cutting the Wainibuku to Princess Road, and from looking into 
<br/>the  Davuilevu  Housing  to  connect  to  that Wainibuku  to  Princess  Road  and  also  looking  into  the 
<br/>Koronivia/Naulu.  It is also planning and designing the four-lane widening of the King’s Road, from 
<br/>Tamavua-i-Wai Bridge as you see, that old bridge is being demolished, JICA has approved the new 
<br/>bridge which will make it a four-lane and that will be expanded towards Lami.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Sir, the FRA Strategic Plan prioritises the introduction of regular National Traffic Coms and 
<br/>Surveys. This will assist in having the research and data to assist us in forward planning.  If you go 
<br/>to a lot of cities in Australia, for example, Brisbane and Sydney, there are about ten ways to get into 
<br/>the city and that is what we are working towards in terms of the various routes as already mentioned.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As  I  have  already  mentioned  these  includes  the  Coastal  Road,  in  addition  to  what  I  have 
<br/>mentioned,  Koronivia  Roundabout  to  Nokonoko  and  Davuilevu/Khalsa  Road  link,  Koronivia 
<br/>Roundabout to Adi Davila Road, Caubati Link Road, Nabua Bypass Link, Namadi-Vunakece Link, 
<br/></span><span>Valelevu  Link,  Princess  Road  to  Tamavua-i-Wai  Road,  Wairua  Road  to  Tamavua-i-Wai  Bridge, 
<br/></span><span>Cement Factory Lami Link Road, Novotel Access Link Road, Wailoku to Delainavesi. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thank  honourable  Minister  for  his  answers.  He  has 
<br/>mentioned the Princess Road and I do remember during our days when we were in government, there 
<br/>was no road hump in Tamavua and a traffic light and speed camera was there.  I have seen a traffic 
<br/></span></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2599 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>hump there and because of that, you will find the movement of traffic has increased by half an hour.  
<br/>I am a frequent user of that road.  Why would he change from the latest technology to the old one? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  That  is  a  good  question.  There  were  a  few  incidents  there 
<br/>including  the  death  of  a  child,  I  think.    So  that  was  done  in  liaison  with  the  Tamavua  Village 
<br/>community in terms of their specific needs.  We will still review that and also in consultation with 
<br/>them in terms of what you had mentioned.  You are correct, I believe there would be traffic speed 
<br/>cameras but as you know sometimes speed cameras do not deter speeding vehicles these days, so we 
<br/>might make a double jeopardy there to stop people.  I take what you have brought up and we will 
<br/>continue to assess the situation. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NATH.- Mr. Speaker, another supplementary question to the answer the honourable 
<br/>Minister has given.  A simple solution, can take away the hump from there and re-adjust the traffic 
<br/>camera by 30 and that will be income generating too. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Also, Mr. Speaker, he mentioned of ten ways of getting to towns and cities in Sydney, but 
<br/>going to Nadi Airport, there are only two ways.  It takes an hour to cross from one end of Nadi to the 
<br/>other.  Why would you have changed from one way to two ways now? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Nath, you could easily have rephrased your statement into a 
<br/>question by just adding “can you do this and that” and that would have matched the requirement  of 
<br/>the question.  I think the honourable Minister has taken the essence of your question on board. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- It is a breach of Standing Order 2, it is a new question. So, can 
<br/>you put that again to the Business Committee because that is to do with Nadi?  Nadi is quite a complex 
<br/>area …. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Minister.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  V.  NATH.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  are  talking  about  tourism.    Nadi  Airport  is  an 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>international airport. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Nath, the question is specific on the Suva-Nausori corridor, 
<br/>there is no other question for any part of the road in Fiji except for the Suva-Nausori corridor, so I 
<br/>will rule your question out of order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. F.S. KOYA.- Honourable Minister, one of the methodologies used around the world 
<br/></span><span>to gather proper traffic information, for cameras and for the LTA to keep track of weight, et cetera, 
<br/>is the use of gantries. In terms of getting traffic flow and the police getting the right information, 
<br/>LTA, et cetera, would you be looking at the use of gantries all across, right through from Nausori to 
<br/>Suva,  bearing  in  mind  that  we  have  a  300,000-plus  population  and  you  cannot  stop  people  from 
<br/>buying vehicles, that is just a sign of prosperity.  Are we looking at that as a new form of keeping 
<br/>track of traffic and controlling?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Definitely,  we  are  looking  at  that  and  other  means  of 
<br/></span><span>monitoring  and  assessing  and  also  formulating  the  appropriate  responses  moving  forward  and 
<br/></span><span>strategies.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Minister for his very good 
<br/>detailed response. Honourable Minister, you aware of the previous government’s initiative of having 
<br/>a shuttle service from Nakasi so that people who are living in Valelevu if they have to go to Princess 
<br/>Road through the shuttle service they could go, rather than catching a bus from Valelevu, going to

<div><span>the  Suva  bus  stand,  then  changing  a  bus  and  travelling  down  because  that  creates  congestion.  
<br/>Honourable Minister, is that plan still there or the plan has been scrapped?   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  Yes,  that  is  also  linked  with  the  decarbonization  of  public 
<br/>transport. That  project  is  still there and we  also  continue to  discuss that with  Korea  International 
<br/>Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) as the facilitator in terms 
<br/>of  funding  for  that,  and  all  the  ones  as  you  mentioned  that  had  been  initiated  from  the  previous 
<br/>government, it would be a pilot project in terms of electric buses which would cover that area.  It is 
<br/>still there, and we are progressing with it.

<div><span>Fiji Critical Bridges Resilience Project 
<br/>(Question No. 312/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. S. TUBUNA asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Strategic 
<br/>Planning,  National  Development  and  Statistics  update  Parliament  on  the  Fiji  Critical 
<br/>Bridges Resilience Project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Assistant Minister 
<br/>for his question.  This Critical Bridges Resilience Project is a major capital project which includes 
<br/>the  replacement  of  four  critical  bridges  -  Lami  Bridge  at  Suvavou,  Medraukutu  Bridge  at  Lami 
<br/>Cement Factory, Sabeto Bridge at Sabeto River and Viseisei Bridge between Nadi and Lautoka.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the project is co-financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>World Bank and there are four key components which include: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>replacement of the four critical bridges with new resilience bridges; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>capacity enhancement of the Fiji Roads Authority; 
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>identification and preparation of climate resilient solutions; 
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>implementation of a gender policy and action plan for FRA. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  these  four  bridges  are  critical  public  assets  as  it  connects  our  cities  and 
<br/>towns along the Queen’s Highway.  It will improve domestic connectivity and ensure that the new 
<br/>bridges are climate and disaster resilient. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is in light of the vulnerabilities induced by climate change, the bridge 
<br/></span><span>replacements  are  being  designed  to  not  only  provide  increased  capacity  but  also  designed  to 
<br/>withstand climatic events and natural disasters and the new designs can include dedicated pedestrian 
<br/>pathways, thereby ensuring safety. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the support of the ADB and the World Bank, a lot of preparatory works had already 
<br/>been undertaken and I want to thank the Fiji Roads Authority and the Acting CEO for being part of 
<br/>the preparatory works.  The project is actually ready for implementation from first half of next year 
<br/>which  will  obviously  create  jobs  and  providing  a  major  impetus  for  investment  and  economic 
<br/></span><span>activity. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  total  financing  for  the  project  is  close  to  US$200  million  or 
<br/>approximately FJ$458  million, US$134.5  million or FJ$307 million  from ADB. Of this,  US$120 
<br/>million, which is approximately FJ$274.5 million, is concessional financing and US$14.5 million, 
<br/>approximately FJ$33.2 million, is full grant. Sir, US$50 million is being provided by the World Bank 
<br/>which includes US$25 million in concessional financing and US$25 million which will be accessed 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="22">Page 22</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2601 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>at normal market terms.  Government financing of around US$15 million, which is closed to about 
<br/>$30 million, which includes tax duty exemption, land acquisition amongst other things.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to highlight that the overall financing package is highly concessional 
<br/>with a grant element of over 50 percent. While we have a direct grant component of around FJ$33 
<br/>million from ADB, the huge concessionality of the loan from ADB, 40-year term inclusive of 10-
<br/>year grace period and 1 percent interest rate and World Bank International Development Association 
<br/>(IDA) access, if to the grant element in its present value terms. I want to take this opportunity to 
<br/>thank  the  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  for  their  continuous  support  towards  financing  Fiji’s 
<br/>development over the last many years and providing this cheaper source and increasingly building 
<br/>grant components into these climate resilient infrastructure projects.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In fact, Mr. Speaker, Sir, ADB now has proclaimed itself as a climate bank and the World 
<br/>Bank is also focussing on climate financing, and with the operationalisation of the loss and damage 
<br/>fund which will be administered by the World Bank, the World Bank is going to be the financial 
<br/>intermediary.  We, Small Island States, in particular are expected to benefit particularly the grant 
<br/>component from the World Bank and ADB.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this project also aligns with the National Development Plan 2025 to 2029 
<br/>which places emphasis on connectivity and accessibility and more importantly getting the basics right 
<br/>which means investment in bridges, roads, water supply, et cetera, is going to meet the basic needs 
<br/>of our people.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my simple question to the honourable Deputy 
<br/>Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, is this part of the current financial year’s commitments as 
<br/>we have already endorsed in this Parliament or is this is going to be for the next financial year? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, there are elements as part of the preparatory   
<br/>works.  As I said, a lot of the preparatory works had already been done. The Government component, 
<br/>Sir, as the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know would include that, but as I said, the 
<br/>project is expected to be implemented in the second half of next year which means that the additional 
<br/>component of the project will be part of the 2025-2026 budget.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the honourable Deputy Prime Minister. I am 
<br/>glad to see that the funding is coming through. During our time we built or repaired 80 bridges, so a 
<br/>lot of work for the current Minister to be able to do that and I thank ADB for what they are doing. 
<br/></span><span>As you can see now, with the kind of money that you are talking about, US$200 million for the four 
<br/></span><span>bridges. That is the kind of cost that we incurred to make bridges resilient in this type of environment 
<br/>that we face and that will become worse in the future. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In terms of crossings, is there also a focus on getting funding for critical crossings? Because 
<br/>a lot of people in the rural areas are focused on those crossings like the one the honourable Joseph 
<br/>Nand talked about the other day, the crossings in the rural areas. Is there a focus also on those for the 
<br/>rural areas and is there concessional funding and grant elements to deal with those areas? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. PROF. B.C. PRASAD.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  I think that is a very good question. As I 
<br/></span><span>said, as part of the National Development Plan and as part of the implementation plan is being worked 
<br/>out in consultation with the different Ministries, we are hoping that we can put together bankable 
<br/>projects so that we are project-ready to be able to access some of these funding, particularly the Loss 
<br/>and Damage Fund and the other most important fund is the Pacific Resilience Fund which, as I have 
<br/>said the other day in my Statement, that Australia and New Zealand have already contributed to the 
<br/>Pacific Resilience Fund, and we are looking at a total of about $250 million by the end of this year.   
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Finance Ministers are meeting in March to set out the legal and financial framework, and 
<br/>we are hoping that funding would be available close to end of 2025 or early 2026.  A lot of those 
<br/>funding, Mr. Speaker, Sir, would be localised financing and we are hoping that not only seawalls. 
<br/>For example, we have identified about sea walls, we have identified about 40 communities, and we 
<br/>are identifying crossings, as you have said quite rightly, which is going to be necessary as a result of 
<br/>constant impact of climate change, flooding, excessive rain, et cetera.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> I think that is a very important aspect that we are focused on and hopefully, Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>in 2025, especially when the Loss and Damage Fund is operationalised, honourable Leader of the 
<br/>Opposition.  The decision at COP had been made to operationalise, the Board has been formed, the 
<br/>World Bank has already prepared itself as a financial intermediary, and I think Fiji is in a very strong 
<br/>position with ADB and the World Bank, in accessing some of those finances, particularly the grant 
<br/>component that should come to Fiji and many of the other Pacific Island countries.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Irregular Bus Services - Viseisei, Vuda and Vaivai 
<br/>(Question No. 313/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> HON. V. PILLAY asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can  the  honourable  Minister  for  Public  Works,  Meteorological  Services  and 
<br/>Transport inform Parliament as to the reasons why bus services to Viseisei, Vuda, and 
<br/>Vaivai operate irregularly, despite concerns raised by the residents?  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, this area has a population  of around 500 
<br/>residents.  There is an approved service timetable for Vuda and Vaivai, and licensed carrier operating 
<br/>from Vuda.  Unfortunately, the irregular bus services can be attributed to road conditions, and we are 
<br/>looking into that.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is an Irish Crossing and the rise near that which needs major cuts in terms of access, 
<br/>especially  for  large  vehicles.    The  other  issue  is  the  issuance  of  route  authority  letters.    This  is 
<br/>normally issued by municipal councils which limits the scope of services to be extended.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are looking at licensed carriers in order to assist with that, I suppose, given the number 
<br/>of passengers at the moment, whom from the bus operators’ view, cannot sustain the bus operations.  
<br/>So, in consultation with the communities, we are looking at licensed carriers which can operate more 
<br/>adaptable vehicles for these communities, and also the municipal council regarding the issues with 
<br/></span><span>the route licences and working closely with FRA in terms of the upgrade of that road.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  before I ask my question, I just wish to take this 
<br/>opportunity  to  congratulate  Mr.  Apisai  Ketenalagi.    I  saw  in  the  news  that  he  has  recently  been 
<br/>appointed at Acting CEO of FRA.  It is not an easy job but probably he will need the support of all 
<br/>of us here in his role as Acting CEO.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  road  conditions  is  under  the  Works  and  Rural  Development  but  the 
<br/>transportation is under LTA which is a regulated industry.  If the bus has to be there at 7 o’clock, it 
<br/></span><span>must be there at 7 o’clock. This issue was brought to us in Delaisaweni, I was in that meeting, Mr. 
<br/></span><span>Speaker, Sir.  My question to the honourable Minister, how can LTA ensure that the services that the 
<br/>people require are provided as mandated? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  it goes back to the conditions of issuance of 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>licences  and they are required to provide the services. It is something that I will need to follow-up 
<br/>with LTA in terms of the compliance with the conditions of those licences.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2603 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Yes, I admit that some have not adhered or have not provided the services as required.  That 
<br/>is something that we need to monitor and ensure that those who are issued the relevant public service 
<br/>licence carry out their services.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. PILLAY.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, irregular bus services is mostly because of poor road 
<br/>conditions, as agreed by the honourable Minister also. It is also not only in those areas that I have 
<br/>mentioned  but  other  rural  areas  also.  Can  the  honourable  Minister  inform  Parliament  as  to  why 
<br/>periodic road maintenance works are not done on rural roads? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  RO  F.Q.  TUISAWAU.-  I  thank  the  honourable  Member  for  the  question.    When  I 
<br/>heard that question, it is sort of a generalised question, but for that road, definitely we are looking 
<br/>into that and I will be following up with the FRA Regional Manager West.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I admit, sometimes as a Minister, we have to come down hard on the people at operational 
<br/>level.  That is something which is an ongoing challenge, especially, the monitoring, because some 
<br/>things are obvious, but it has been left there for some time.  So, that is something that I am addressing 
<br/>within the Ministry and with the operational entities - WAF, FRA, LTA and also MSAF.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I do not know but maybe, it is something to do with the attitude or culture, but it is an ongoing 
<br/>process - monitoring and action.  The other part is the Programme Maintenance in terms of not only 
<br/>roads but also building, et cetera.  So, that whole culture of planning, programming and budgeting 
<br/>needs to come together. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>As a Coalition Government, that is something we are taking seriously. We have been here for 
<br/>two years, but we are moving towards that.  I am sure that after we win the elections, everything will 
<br/>be perfect. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J. USAMATE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, a supplementary question to the honourable Minister; 
<br/>all governments do all those things that we need to do to provide for people.  But what I am interested 
<br/>in, Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the things that the honourable Minister has pointed out is the condition 
<br/>of the roads, especially in the rural areas.  I am just wondering to my mind that we have around 4,000 
<br/>kilometres of gravel roads and the cost of maintenance is quite high.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Would there be then a long term plan or mid-term plan by the Government to have say, half 
<br/>of these roads tarsealed, or at least the worst parts, traction sealed, that is, you seal the hills to make 
<br/></span><span>sure that the buses can go, so that we can address this because at the end of the day, the major problem 
<br/></span><span>is the condition of the roads.  Would there be some sort of a targe to say, half of our gravel roads, 
<br/>tarseal them over a period of time, and that will address that particular situation, at least, to a large 
<br/>extent? Is that something that the honourable Minister is considering? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- That is a very valid question.  I am not an engineer or anything, 
<br/>but the focus is on the maintenance but we need to move a step up – new roads and tarsealed roads. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So,  in  the  formulation  of  the  FRA  Strategic  Plan  which  has  just  been  approved,  the  KPI 
<br/></span><span>included there is the number of new or tarsealed roads, extending the number of tarsealed roads.  So, 
<br/></span><span>that is definitely part of what is currently being done. and moving forward.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The tarsealing of roads, some are happening right now, for example, we have budgeted for 
<br/>the tarsealing of the frontage of villages and public facilities, like health centres and schools.  So, that 
<br/>is currently happening now, and more will be done in the second half of the year.  The honourable

<div><span>Public Rental Board Lagilagi Housing Estate 
<br/>(Question No. 314/2024) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. K.V. RAVU  asked the Government, upon notice: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Can the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government update Parliament 
<br/>on  plans  for  further  expansion  of  the  Public  Rental  Board  Lagilagi  Housing  Estate  in 
<br/>addressing housing needs of low-income families, following the opening of its 36 housing 
<br/>flats? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I deliver the response to the question, I 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>just want to give a short brief of the Lagilagi Housing Project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, this was a project that started way back in 2009 by the previous Government, 
<br/>in conjunction with the Pacific Community Network Charitable Trust, commonly known as PCN, 
<br/>together  with  the  German  Catholic  Organisation.    So  far,  the  Government  has  contributed  an 
<br/>investment of close to $16 million. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of the project was for PCN to assist in the construction of low-
<br/>cost  units  to  provide  accommodation  to  those  low-income  earners  who  reside  within  Jittu  Estate 
<br/>informal  settlement.    When  that  project  started,  117  units  were  completed,  and  36  units  were 
<br/>constructed but were incomplete.  So, on 17</span><span>th</span><span> January, 2024, Cabinet approved for the Public Rental 
<br/>Board (PRB) to manage and also complete the incomplete 36 units at Lagilagi Housing Estate.  I am 
<br/>pleased to inform the House, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that the 36 incomplete units was completed by the 
<br/>PRB with  a budget  of close to  $3 million,  but  they managed to  complete within the cost  of $1.6 
<br/>million and is the units are about to be opened soon. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I am also thankful to the Ministry of Youth and Sports for coming on board and assisting the 
<br/>Ministry, as well as the PRB, in providing recreational space for those residents who are going to 
<br/>occupy those additional 36 units, as well as the existing 117 families who are currently residing at 
<br/>the Lagilagi Housing Estate.  If you happen to drive through that road, you will see that PRB is still 
<br/>constructing the gabion wall, just to retain the side that is fronting the main road, as well as the side 
<br/>of the multipurpose court. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If you look at the area itself, close to 160 are on that side of Lagilagi Housing, that is, leaving 
<br/>aside close to another 1,400 families who are residing on the other side of Jittu Estate.  The challenge 
<br/>for the Ministry, as well as for the Board, is to construct additional units on the space that is currently 
<br/>available.  So, the PRB has come on  board, and they were thinking of constructing two-bedroom 
<br/>units but due to space, they are going to only provide a few units.  So, we requested them to redesign 
<br/>the model so, at least, we can accommodate more families to occupy those flats.  So, that is phase 2 
<br/>of what PRB is going to do whilst the 36 families will be given their offer for them to actually occupy 
<br/>36 units that have been completed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There is also another space in that area, but we are still liaising with the Ministry of Lands to 
<br/>also try and transfer that parcel of land to the PRB so that they can construct some more units at the 
<br/>completion of the 36 units.  The idea here is to move those people who are currently residing in Jittu.  
<br/>What we have noted is that, in the phase 2, those who were given the flats are those who are not 
<br/>residing at Jittu.

<div><span>Questions 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2605 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There are some families that are there, who have been paying the charitable trust with the 
<br/>PCN, and now we have changed their consent, we are going to only include those residents who live 
<br/>within Jittu.  The reason  is  that we just want  to get  people out  of that situation, so once we start 
<br/>absorbing  those  people  from  Jittu,  then  PRB  can  expand  further  and  build  some  more  blocks  to 
<br/>accommodate those who are living there, as well as those on the other side of Jittu Estate. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is just the progress and update of what the Ministry is doing, as well as 
<br/>what the PRB has done as far as the completion of the 36 units and also plans that we have in mind 
<br/>to assist those other families who reside there, especially low income families. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. I.B. SERUIRATU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir,  through you, honourable Minister, I know that 
<br/>I have brought this to your attention outside Parliament when a few people came to see us.  As you 
<br/>are aware, honourable Minister, and I think for transparency sake and for the benefit and satisfaction 
<br/>of those who were aggrieved, (I know the investigations) can you, please, give some assurance on 
<br/>what will happen to those who were aggrieved and what actions are you also taking to address it and, 
<br/>of  course,  for  the  future  of  the  aggrieved  parties  as  well  because  of  the  unfortunate  incident  that 
<br/>happened from those who were handling this project? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the unfortunate part about this project was that 
<br/>there were some genuine families who were looking for affordable shelter who came on board and 
<br/>also joined the PCN with the hope that they will be given a flat or shelter. What has happened is that 
<br/>those that have actually not been given, there are systems in place, it is like a co-operative system 
<br/>where they go, register and start paying their subscriptions. Some go towards education.  They were 
<br/>told,  if  you  want  to  pay  something,  you  have  to  mention  whether  its  towards  education, 
<br/>accommodation or shelter.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The unfortunate part is when they were given a refund, when the impasse happened, that is, 
<br/>most of the families encountered with PCN, the Ministry had gone ahead to refund the money to 
<br/>those who had receipts with either shelter or accommodation. However, there were others who paid 
<br/>for education.  What we have done is, if the receipts are from PCN, we have also started processing 
<br/>those that have paid for other means. That was also part of the preparation in the last as well as this 
<br/>current financial year.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>There were those that were still receiving who were there and we have also received some 
<br/>enquiries on how they could be, especially those who live within Jittu Estate. The focus now is for 
<br/>those who live within Jittu Estate. I think this defeats the purpose of getting some people outside Jittu 
<br/></span><span>and not living in informal settlements but living in other formal settlements.  That is something that 
<br/></span><span>we are also taking on board.  Sir, PRB is also in the process, we have done a social survey on those 
<br/>existing tenants that have been offered flats by PCN.  They had told the board and also the Ministry 
<br/>that they had paid this  much with a copy of their  receipts, but these were the ones who were not 
<br/>considered  by  PCN  but  were  starting  to  get  subscriptions  and  memberships  from  those  who  live 
<br/>within the settlement. That is something that the Ministry, together with PRB, will also do for further 
<br/>reviews to assist those who were affected by PCN.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.D. KUMAR.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, my question to the honourable Minister is that the 
<br/></span><span>Special Investigations Report also revealed that there were people who were not meant to be in those 
<br/></span><span>flats were there. A foreign person is owning a flat, a 10-year old child is owning a flat and it was all 
<br/>thanks to PCN, the way they were involved and it was their project. Will you be taking any action 
<br/>against those cases because the report has been out from 2020?  Because of COVID, et cetera, we   
<br/>could not proceed with that, and of course, it was referred to FICAC. So, FICAC was undertaking 
<br/>the investigation to further confirm those cases.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON.  M.K.  NALUMISA.-  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  the  issue  raised  by  the  former  Minister  is  a 
<br/>factual one because there are families living there who are not supposed to be living there. That was 
<br/>the arrangement done by the organisation but something that the Ministry will pursue further and that 
<br/>is something that we are going to do after we have completed, given the offer for those 36 families 
<br/>who will be occupying the newly completed three blocks.
