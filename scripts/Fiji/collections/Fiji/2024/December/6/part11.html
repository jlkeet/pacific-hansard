<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- A Point of Order!  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Maharaj.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Standing Order 32(3) - Official Report of Proceedings (</span><span>Hansard</span><span>).  
<br/>Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, 4</span><span>th</span><span> December 2024, (unfortunately the Member is not here), during a 
<br/>response to honourable Jone Usamate, the honourable Minister for Multi-Ethnic Affairs and Sugar 
<br/>Industry stated that the total amount of 8,000 sugarcane that are left on the farm accumulates to only 
<br/>$80,000. Whether this was deliberate or a mistake, if we calculate 8,000 tonnes by $100, it comes to 
<br/>$800,000.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Member lied to Parliament by trying to portray that only 
<br/>$80,000 was denied, unfortunately, it should be $800,000.  I request if the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span> could be 
<br/>corrected to reflect $800,000.  If we read the </span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>, he is asking a question, and I quote: 
<br/>“…8,000 if you multiply by $100, it comes to $80,000, right?”  I am correcting him, it is not $80,000, 
<br/>it should be $800,000. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Member, I take your Point of Order.  We will refer the matter 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to the honourable Minister.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- I also raise a Point of Order. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- No, I recognise him now, please. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RO F.Q. TUISAWAU.- In Standing Order 62(1), it states and I quote: “When speaking, 
<br/>a member must not impute improper motives …”  The Member used the word “lied”.  Using the 
<br/>word ‘lied’, the way he used it, is imputing that he actually lied when the issue is just to correct the 
<br/></span><span>Daily Hansard</span><span>.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Member.  The use of the word is inappropriate in 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>this Chamber.  It is inappropriate in this Chamber, and I would like you to withdraw that. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.A. MAHARAJ.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I withdraw the word “lied”. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- In respect of the Point of Order which I have accepted, I have referred the 
<br/>matter for the honourable Minister to come back to Parliament and respond to your Point of Order.   
<br/></span></div>
