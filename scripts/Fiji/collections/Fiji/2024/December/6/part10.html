<div><span>COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SPEAKER 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Welcome 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome all honourable Members to this final sitting for this year.  I also welcome all of 
<br/>those  joining  us  in  the  gallery  and  those  watching  the  proceedings  on  the  television  and  on  the 
<br/>internet. Thank you for your continued interest in the proceedings of Parliament.

<div><span>Visitors - Vusokinawaqa Women’s Club 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable Members, please, join me in welcoming the Vusokinawaqa Women’s Club from 
<br/>Nalawa, Ra. Thank you for joining us today and, indeed, welcome to your Parliament.  It is my hope 
<br/>that in the near future, some of you will be encouraged to stand for elections so you can represent the 
<br/>people in this august body.

<div><span>Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For  the  information  of  all  honourable  Members,  I  have  received  a  request  from  the 
<br/></span><span>Chairperson of the Standing Committee on Economic Affairs for the Standing Committee to report 
<br/>back to Parliament on the Access to Business Funding Bill 2024 at a later sitting of Parliament.  The 
<br/>Standing Committee wishes to undertake further public consultations on the Bill.  In that respect I 
<br/>seek your indulgence to allow the Standing Committee for Economic Affairs to report back at a later 
<br/>sitting of Parliament. Is there any opposition? As there being no opposition, the Standing Committee 
<br/>on Economic Affairs has the approval to report back to Parliament on the Access to Business Funding

<div><span>Bill 2024 at a later sitting.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Upgrade - ICT Infrastructure  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Finally, on the issue of the ICT glitches experienced in the course of this sitting week, I am 
<br/>to advise, honourable Members, that the ICT infrastructure is currently undergoing its final phase of 
<br/>the setup of the multi-language caption and translation project.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In order to test the system and which had to be on a sitting week, there were four platforms 
<br/>operating at the same time that affected the video and audio feed in Chambers.  These four platforms 
<br/>are: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(1)</span><span> </span><span>Real time caption on Audio to Speech Recognition; 
<br/>(2)</span><span> </span><span>Testing of the four audio channels and upgrade of parliamentary TV Channel;  
<br/>(3)</span><span> </span><span>Streaming of Parliament Sitting on a new internet platform; and  
<br/>(4)</span><span> </span><span>Video-on-demand and accessibility through the Parliament website.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In light of the implementation of this final phase, my team and I seek your understanding, 
<br/>honourable Members, as we strive to complete this $4.4 million project, which will ensure that our 
<br/>Parliament is more inclusive and transparent for the people of Fiji.
