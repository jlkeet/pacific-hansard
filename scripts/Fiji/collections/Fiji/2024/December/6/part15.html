<h3>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS</h3>
<div><span>END OF WEEK STATEMENTS 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- I now call on the honourable Minister for Housing and Local Government 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>to deliver his response. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to provide my response to the Statement 
<br/>that was presented by honourable Bala and I thank him for bringing this issue to this august House 
<br/>because it is an important issue because it affects economic development and our economic growth.  
<br/>I was expecting honourable Bala to provide to Parliament some of the informal settlements that he

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>has completed.  However, he gave us some ideas, even some complaints and some of the leases that 
<br/>have expired and have not been renewed to-date.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, 48 development leases were acquired by the previous Government.  There 
<br/>was no proper planning done on how they were going to formalise these settlements.  So, far only 
<br/>three have been completed to-date.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I remember during the launching of the Waidamudamu Informal Settlement Upgrade, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir, and that was in 2015.  Now, that project is completed.  He asked as to when we are 
<br/>going to offer the leases, that is something that we are arranging with iTLTB, making sure that we 
<br/>have all the conditions by iTLTB before we can start giving out the leases.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, what we have done before we get the leases for all these settlements, we are 
<br/>also going to follow the process on how the allocation will be done. The Cabinet has approved the 
<br/>new allocation policy for those settlers who reside in  these informal settlements  on  how they are 
<br/>going to get their land. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  want  to  remind  honourable  Bala  about  one  of  his  promises  in  2015.    He  said  that  the 
<br/>development of Cuvu Informal Settlement should be completed by the year 2016.  Mr. Speaker, Sir, 
<br/>the Ministry has completed the evaluation of all the tenders from these settlements and is also in the 
<br/>process of allocating the lots to these informal settlements.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. P.K. BALA.- God is watching! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Laughter) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, informal settlement is not really a simple task, 
<br/>it is really a difficult challenge which should be a community effort.  It is not only by the Government 
<br/>but NGOs should be involved and also the landlords on which these informal settlements are located.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With the current Government, I have already said that there is a 12-year plan, with the support 
<br/>of the Ministry of Finance, if you are going to work on four projects in a year, you should be able to 
<br/>complete all these 48 informal settlements.  You should be able to  formalise them in the 12-year 
<br/>period, so this is the type of planning that we have.  When you acquire a lease, you must make sure 
<br/>that you tell the people when you are going to start the project and when you are going to complete 
<br/>the  project,  something  that  was  missed  out  when  these  announcements  were  made  in  this  august 
<br/></span><span>House. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would also like to mention about the expired land leases.  It comes back 
<br/>to planning, Sir.  The land that he mentioned in Ba, a proper planning was done, and that development 
<br/>should have been completed by now.  The issue is that because there was no plan in place, that is 
<br/>why the development lease had expired, and the Ministry is faced with a mammoth task.  Now, the 
<br/>landowners are coming up with more demands, so we are having some difficulty in re-negotiating 
<br/>with iTLTB to renew these development leases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>(Honourable P.K. Bala interjects) 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Order, order! 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.K. NALUMISA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the current Government is working very, very 
<br/>had to ensure that we are going to complete whatever targets that we have decided and also agreed 
<br/>to complete while formalising these settlements.  We are not a government that just tell the people, 
<br/></span></div>

<div><span>“We want to do this, we are going to acquire leases, we are going to just put red paint to number the 
<br/>houses that they have been suggesting in these informal settlements. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We are hopeful, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that with support of the Ministry of Finance, as well as the 
<br/>funding from other development partners, we will be able to come up with a solution that is going to, 
<br/>not only resolve issues with informal settlements now, but also going to resolve issues of informal 
<br/>settlements in the future.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Role of Society in Addressing HIV in Fiji 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. J.R. VOCEA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, honourable Cabinet 
<br/>Ministers and Assistant Ministers, the honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members 
<br/>of Parliament; I rise in this august House to deliver an End of Week Statement, highlighting the role 
<br/>of society in addressing the critical issue of HIV in Fiji. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the HIV epidemic poses a significant health challenge globally, especially 
<br/>in  the  Pacific  region,  with  Fiji  experiencing  a  concerning  trend  in  new  infections  and  existing 
<br/>vulnerabilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry of Health and Medical  Services  has recorded a staggering 552 new cases of 
<br/>HIV, just from January to June 2024, a figure that highlights the urgent need for collective actions.  
<br/>Cases were identified across the four Divisions with the Central Division shockingly recording 380 
<br/>cases, followed by the Western Division with 151 cases, Northern Division with 19 cases and the 
<br/>Eastern Division with two cases. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  while  sexual  transmission  continues  to  be  a  primary  mode  of  HIV 
<br/>transmission in Fiji, it is important to note that 85 of the 552 cases (15 percent), were transmitted 
<br/>through  injectable  drug  use,  with  individuals  voluntarily  identifying  themselves  as  such.    This 
<br/>relatively new factor in our national data is an indication of evolving social challenges, such as drug 
<br/>use and risky behaviour, that require our attention and a concerted effort to curb. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is important to understand the scale of the challenge we are facing.  The 
<br/>552 cases recorded in the first half of 2024, already reflect a 33 percent increase, compared to the 
<br/>total cases reported in 2023.  However, it is crucial that we do not view this increase as a failure.  
<br/>Instead, it is a direct result of the Ministry’s efforts to ramp up testing and early treatment, which is 
<br/>a key component in HIV management. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I commend the Ministry of Health and Medical Services for implementing 
<br/>new strategies to improve national testing, enrolment into the care of HIV positive individuals, and 
<br/>public  health  communications  to  reduce  stigma  and  raise  awareness.    Further  increases  are 
<br/>anticipated as testing expands nationwide.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>According to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services, the current figures show that our 
<br/>younger individuals, particularly those under 39 years of age, account for 73 percent of the new cases 
<br/>which underlines the need to target our messaging and services to the younger demographic, as they 
<br/></span><span>are among the most vulnerable.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the issue of injectable drug use is a growing concern in our fight against 
<br/>HIV.  Out of the 552 cases reported, 85 have been linked to drug use through injections, representing 
<br/>15 percent of all new cases in 2024.  This emerging trend poses an additional layer of complexity in 
<br/>managing the HIV epidemic, as it introduces risk behaviours that go beyond sexual transmission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="33">Page 33</a></div>

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the practice of sharing needs and participating in high-risk activities, such 
<br/>as  chemsex  and  bluetoothing  (a  dangerous  practice  where  drugs  are  injected  and  shared  between 
<br/>individuals using the same needle), has contributed to the rise in cases.  It is important to highlight 
<br/>that addressing this issue requires a broader societal response that includes addressing drug addiction, 
<br/>providing harm-reduction services and offering education on safer practices to at-risk populations.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, current statistics show that a significant portion of the newly diagnosed HIV 
<br/>cases  in  2024  is  from  individuals  between  the  ages  15  to  29.    These  numbers  tell  us  that  HIV  is 
<br/>disproportionately  affecting  the  younger  population,  many  of  whom  may  be  engaging  in  unsafe 
<br/>sexual practices or using injectable drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a society, we must take responsibility for educating our young people.  
<br/>The information they receive about HIV prevention, safe sex and the dangers of drug use will shape 
<br/>their  behaviour.  Parents,  schools,  religious  leaders  and  community  groups  must  work  together  to 
<br/>ensure that our young people are equipped with the knowledge and tools they need to make safer 
<br/>choices.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the rising HIV infections in Fiji signals a broader regional health crisis.  In 
<br/>other words, this means that the fight against HIV cannot be left to the Government alone.  Every 
<br/>Fijian has a role to play in addressing this critical issue.  Community support is essential to providing 
<br/>care for those living with HIV and preventing the spread of the virus.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In addressing the increasing cases of HIV through injectable drug use, we must be proactive 
<br/>in tackling the root causes of drug addiction and providing harm-reduction services.  Society must 
<br/>support initiatives such as rehabilitation services and community outreach to at-risk populations.  We 
<br/>cannot turn a blind eye to the dangers posed by drug use in our communities, and it is now a major 
<br/>contributing factor to the spread of HIV. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am a firm believer that some of these societal ills all point back to our 
<br/>homes.  I urge parents and heads of households to be diligent in your roles and responsibilities, having 
<br/>constant  and honest  conversations with  your children and family  members, having  quality family 
<br/>times and being attentive to children’s needs and behaviours are very crucial. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I reiterate the statement by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services that 
<br/>HIV is not a death sentence.  With medical advancements available today, people living with HIV 
<br/>can live long, healthy and productive lives.  The key is early diagnosis and timely access to treatment.  
<br/></span><span>We must do everything in our power to encourage individuals to get tested and if necessary, to seek 
<br/></span><span>treatment without delay.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has confirmed that we have 
<br/>recorded 13 deaths from HIV-related illnesses so far this year, a sobering statistics that reminds us 
<br/>that while treatment is available, not everyone is accessing it in time. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, one of the biggest challenges we face in addressing the HIV is the stigma 
<br/>associated with the virus. Many people are still afraid to present themselves for testing because of 
<br/></span><span>the fear of being judged by their families and communities. This is where society must step in, and 
<br/></span><span>its  role  is  critical.  We  must  create  a  supportive  environment  where  individuals  feel  comfortable, 
<br/>seeking help and accessing services without fear of being discriminated. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  must  challenge  the  myths  and  misconceptions  surrounding  HIV, 
<br/>including the outdated belief that it is a death sentence. However, public health campaigns, media 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="34">Page 34</a></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2613 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>and community leaders have a responsibility to spread accurate information and promote compassion 
<br/>for those affected by HIV. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we move forward together, we must all take responsibility for the role 
<br/>we  play  in  addressing  the  rising  number  of  HIV  cases  in  Fiji.  The  Government  will  continue  to 
<br/>provide all the necessary services, but we need the support of every segment of society to effectively 
<br/>tackle this issue.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I  urge  all  Fijians  to  get  tested  and  know  their  status.  I  call  upon  parents,  teachers  and 
<br/>community leaders to educate our young people about the dangers of unsafe sex and drug use.  I ask 
<br/>all of us to treat those living with HIV with the dignity and respect they each deserve, and to help 
<br/>reduce the stigma that prevents so many from seeking the necessary help they need.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  we  have  withstood  many  challenges  together,  and  I  am  still  of  the  firm 
<br/>belief that together, we can turn the tide on HIV in Fiji. It only requires our collective effort, one that 
<br/>involves individuals, families, communities, healthcare professionals, policymakers and faith-based 
<br/>organisations and Civil Society Organisations. I urge all of us to work towards a future where HIV 
<br/>is no longer a threat to our society, and where those living with the virus can lead full healthy lives 
<br/>without fear or discrimination.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the People’s Coalition Government remains committed to improving our 
<br/>healthcare access, increase testing and provide life-saving treatment to all Fijians. However, success 
<br/>will depend on the active involvement of society in raising awareness, promoting safe practices and 
<br/>supporting those affected by HIV.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. DR. RATU A.R. LALABALAVU.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond and support the 
<br/>Statement  delivered  by  the  Assistant  Minister  for  Rural  and  Maritime  Development  and  Disaster 
<br/>Management, highlighting the role of society in addressing the increasing number of HIV cases in 
<br/>Fiji.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I wish to begin by acknowledging the healthcare workers, partners and stakeholders, who are 
<br/>commemorating World Aids Day with the theme ‘Take the Rights Path” in Nadi today and helping 
<br/>to  raise more awareness  and build greater understanding in  our communities of this major health 
<br/>threat that is facing us all.  The chief celebrant is our former President, as well as former Speaker of 
<br/>this  august  Parliament,  His  Excellency  Ratu  Epeli  Nailatikau,  a  fearless  advocate  and  global 
<br/>ambassador for HIV.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>At the celebration in Nadi today, 23-year-old Mark Shahil Khan has come out, for the first 
<br/>time, to share his challenges as a HIV positive patient, giving courage and hope to many.  I admire 
<br/>Mark’s courage, and I wish many more will come out and share their stories so that we can work 
<br/>together to educate our community and help each other to subdue HIV in Fiji.  Although I am present 
<br/>here in Parliament today, my voice and spirit echo with them in solidarity and a shared purpose.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Fiji is confronting an alarming and unprecedented surge in HIV cases. From 
<br/>January to June of 2024 alone, Fiji recorded 552 new HIV cases, an overwhelming indicator of the 
<br/></span><span>epidemic’s growth.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Ministry has reported at many forums and media platforms, including my response to an 
<br/>Oral Question in Parliament in October 2024, on the sharp rise in the number of new HIV cases since 
<br/>2021. The Ministry will continue to highlight this at every opportunity it gets. The UNAIDS Global 
<br/>AIDS Monitoring Report 2022 noted that in 2010, the estimated number of new infections in Fiji has 
<br/>risen  by  260  percent,  the  second  fastest  growing  epidemic  in  the  Asia  Pacific  region.  Many 
<br/></span></div>
<div><a name="35">Page 35</a></div>
<div><span>2614 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>individuals are presenting to healthcare facilities with an advance HIV related infections, and the rise 
<br/>in the number of new cases is also linked to the increasing in testing conducted in our health facilities.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>My fear is that we are still missing a large of group of untested people in our community. 
<br/>Last year, UNAIDS estimated a population of 2,000 people who were living with HIV in Fiji and 
<br/>this is believed to be under reported. Of this, only 1,049 people are on treatment while the remaining 
<br/>951 remain undiagnosed or lost to follow up. Untreated HIV is not only life threatening, but a key 
<br/>driver of community transmission.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>In  this  regard,  the  Ministry  has  engaged  the  assistance  of  our  partners  and  international 
<br/>technical experts to conduct an assessment of the lightly number of HIV cases in the country. This 
<br/>report will be crucial in qualifying the magnitude of our response to HIV challenges before us.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, staggering 82 AIDS related deaths were recorded in 2023 and this figure is 
<br/>expected  to  rise.  This  is  an  unacceptable  loss  of  life.  The  Ministry  is  gravely  concerned  about 
<br/>untreated HIV cases and the delay in accessing care.  Many of the undiagnosed or untreated cases 
<br/>involve youths who engage in risqué activity behaviours, including intravenous drug use, chem-sex, 
<br/>further complicated our response for HIV in Fiji.  It is essential to reiterate that HIV is not a death 
<br/>sentence.  It is a treatable condition with a proper care. People living with HIV can live long, healthy 
<br/>lives. This is the message that we must never stop sharing with anyone and everyone.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>E sega ni kena i balebale, ni sa tauvi iko ga na  </span><span>HIV</span><span>, iko sa na mate sara.  E rawa ni ko 
<br/>bulabula vinaka tikoga ka qarava vakavinaka tiko na nomu vuli, cakacaka, se i tavi e vale.  Esa tiko

<br/>sa kena gauna meda dolava na noda vakasama kei na noda rai, ka da veivuketaka na sasaga ni kena 
<br/>tarovi na mate ca oqo na </span><span>HIV</span><span> e Viti.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Treatment also serves as a vital prevention tool, as treatment suppression eliminates the risk 
<br/>of transmission. This means, that those who are on treatment and their viral load is reduced, will not 
<br/>spread the virus to their spouse and sexual partners, their children when they are born and their babies 
<br/>when they breast feed.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>With treatment, we can also stop the HIV transmission in our community.  This is why we 
<br/>must  urgently  identify  and  start  treatment  for  those  who  remain  untreated.  I  call  on  all  these 
<br/>individuals in our community who may have had a test previously and have not returned for their 
<br/></span><span>results to come forward and seek your results and engage in our free treatment programme.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, treatment for HIV in Fiji is free.  So, patients do not have to pay for the cost 
<br/>of  medicine,  as  they  are  provided  free  by  the  Government.    In  addition,  the  advancement  in 
<br/>medication for HIV over the years means that the number of medicines that one has to take for the 
<br/>control of HIV, has reduced significantly from what used to be eight to nine different tablets and 
<br/>medications each day, to only two or one.  This has made HIV antiretroviral therapy very friendly 
<br/>and encouraging for those on treatment to remain on the lifelong treatment.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, only together as a community can we respond to this challenge of HIV.  Our 
<br/></span><span>statistics  at  the  Ministry  has  revealed  that  the  number  of  new  cases  amongst  illicit  drug  uses  is 
<br/>increasing rapidly. The dual burden of injecting drugs use and HIV is a deadly combination for our 
<br/>people, in particular for our youth and children. Our strategy is to tackle these two scourges with 
<br/>hand in hand and I encourage that when we discuss about one in our communities, we also talk about 
<br/>the other, bringing more awareness and knowledge on how we can address these dual burdens in our 
<br/>midst.

<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2615 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Ministry acknowledges that we need to develop new and innovative 
<br/>preventative approaches quickly, as our current prevention programme will not be adequate for our 
<br/>new HIV challenges. Our current HIV situation calls on all of us to think differently and open our 
<br/>hearts and minds to newer approaches that put our communities back in the driving seat of the HIV 
<br/>response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We will look to the experience and expertise of countries that have gone through similar HIV 
<br/>outbreaks  in  their  communities,  and  the  international  best-practice  approaches  that  have  brought 
<br/>success  in  their  HIV  responses.    We  are  grateful  that  our  partners  and  developing  neighbouring 
<br/>countries who are supporting and assisting us in our response.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The World Health Organization, UNDP, the Australian Government and the New Zealand 
<br/>Government amongst others that have provided support thus far and have pledged to provide further 
<br/>support in the future. Government has endorsed Fiji's HIV Surge Strategy, a comprehensive approach 
<br/>that facilitates collaboration with health partners, government ministries, and communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  surge  strategy  is  pivotal  in  strengthening  HIV  prevention  efforts,  scaling  up  targeted 
<br/>national  testing  for  key  population  groups,  improving  access  to  life-saving  testing  and  treatment, 
<br/>reducing stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS, and enhancing the governance 
<br/>of Fiji's HIV response programme.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>An important pillar of strength is prevention through education and awareness. This is where 
<br/>we require the support of our community, advocacy groups, civil society organizations, faith-based 
<br/>organizations, schools, villages, and communities to educate our children and young people on HIV 
<br/>and  its  linkages  to  illicit  drug  use,  as  well  as  the  treatment  and  good  long-term  outcome  with 
<br/>treatment. This is where we can work together to implement prevention strategies and help to identify 
<br/>HIV cases early. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  subduing  the  current  surge  in  HIV  in  Fiji  will  require  a  whole  of 
<br/>Government and whole of society effort. With every Fijian is guaranteed their right to health in our 
<br/>constitution, stigma and discrimination remain the main obstacle to accessing timely treatment and 
<br/>support to our people living with HIV in Fiji.  I call on all of us to work together to ensure that no 
<br/>one is denied their right to be tested, treated, and supported without fear, stigma, or discrimination. 
<br/>Let us unite in this fight against HIV and protect the rights of those who live with HIV. Get tested, 
<br/>know our status, and ensure a healthier future for our nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Before I sit down, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to wish your good self, members of the secretariat 
<br/>and the staff of Parliament, members of Parliament, a Merry Christmas and blessed, prosperous and 
<br/>a healthy New Year.

<div><span>Fishing Co-operatives – Rural and Maritime/Coastal Communities 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. RATU R.S.S. VAKALALABURE.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the honourable Prime Minister, 
<br/>honourable  Deputy  Prime  Ministers  and  Cabinet  Ministers,  honourable  Assistant  Ministers,  the 
<br/></span><span>honourable Leader of the Opposition and honourable Members of Parliament; a very good afternoon 
<br/></span><span>to  you  all.    I  rise  today  to  give  a  statement  that  will  highlight  fishing  cooperatives  in  rural  and 
<br/>maritime or coastal communities.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, these cooperatives are not just economic entities, they are the lifeblood of 
<br/>our communities’ sustaining livelihoods, fostering collaboration and preserving our cultural heritage. 
<br/>In the heart of our coastal villages and remote islands, fishing is more than a means of sustenance. It

<div><span>is a way of life. For generations our people have depended on the bountiful ocean to provide for their 
<br/>families  and  communities.  However,  in  an  everchanging  world  with  economic  challenges  and 
<br/>environmental threats, the need for sustainable and resilient practices has never been greater.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Fishing  cooperatives  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  offer  a  beacon  of  hope  and  progress,  by  uniting 
<br/>individual fishers under a collective framework. These cooperatives enhance the bargaining power 
<br/>of our community members enabling them to secure fair prices for their catch and gain access to 
<br/>larger markets.  This collective approach, Sir, not only stabilises income, but also ensures that the 
<br/>benefits of our marine resources are shared equitably among all members.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Moreover,  Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  fishing  co-operatives  are  at  the  forefront  of  promoting 
<br/>sustainable fishing practices.  They play a crucial role in educating and training fishes on methods 
<br/>that  protect  our  precious  marine  eco-systems  while  ensuring  long-term  productivity.  Through  the 
<br/>implementation of sustainable practices such as controlled fishing seasons and the use of eco-friendly 
<br/>gear, cooperatives have to preserve fish stocks for future generations safeguarding the biodiversity 
<br/>that is intrinsic to our way of life. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as we speak, we currently have 34 registered fishing co-operatives in the 
<br/>country.  Amongst the 34 registered co-operatives, we have 3 youth groups and one women group 
<br/>that registers as a fisher’s co-operative. A breakdown by division with regards to the 33 registered 
<br/>fishing co-operatives in Fiji are as follows: 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>- 
<br/>- 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>  4 
<br/> Central Division 
<br/> Eastern Division 
<br/>  9 
<br/> Northern Division  -  13 
<br/>-  18 
<br/> Western Division 
<br/></span><span>  44</span><span>
<br/></span><span> Total</span><span>
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, these are the few opportunities available through the fishing co-operatives, they 
<br/>provide economic benefits to individual fisherman by pulling resources, reducing cost and increasing 
<br/>bargaining  power  when  negotiating  prices  for  their  catches  or  purchasing  supplies.  Fishing  co-
<br/>operatives promotes sustainable fishing and sometimes additional fishing practices that encourage 
<br/>members to adhere to responsible fishing methods, helping to protect fish populations and marine 
<br/>eco-systems. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, they empower local fishing communities by giving fisherman a collective 
<br/></span><span>voice in decision making processes and enhancing their influence in fishery management policies. 
<br/></span><span>Co-operatives help mitigate risks associated with fishing, such as fluctuating market prices, weather 
<br/>conditions and regulatory changes by offering support and shared resources amongst members. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  beyond  the  economic  and  environmental  benefits,  fishing  co-operatives 
<br/>foster a strong sense of community and solidarity. They provide a platform for sharing knowledge, 
<br/>skills  and resources, strengthening social bonds and promoting mutual support. In times of needs 
<br/>whether  due  to  natural  disasters  or  economic  hardships,  cooperatives  serve  as  a  support  network 
<br/>helping families to weather the storms. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the success of fishing co-operatives in Fiji, is a testament to the power of 
<br/>collaboration and community driven initiatives by working together we can overcome challenges, 
<br/>protect our marine resources and build a more prosperous and sustainable future for all. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  let  us  continue  to  support  and  empower  our  fishing  co-operatives, 
<br/>recognising them as essential pillars of our rural and coastal communities. Together we can ensure

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>that the rich legacy of our fishing heritage is preserved and that the benefits of our ocean’s bounty 
<br/>are enjoyed by generations to come. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Coalition Government, through the Ministry of Trade and Co-operative 
<br/>is committed to creating an enabling environment where fishing co-operatives thrive. As we continue 
<br/>to invest in initiatives, we are not just improving the livelihoods of our rural and coastal communities, 
<br/>we  are  strengthening  our  nations’  future  by  harnessing  the  collective  power  of  our  people  and 
<br/>ensuring the sustainable use of our marine resources. We can achieve lasting economic growth and 
<br/>environmental stewardship for the benefit of all Fijians. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I invite all honourable Members of this august Parliament and indeed all 
<br/>Fijians to support and engage in this transformative enterprise as we work together for a prosperous, 
<br/>sustainable and equitable future for our communities. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I take my leave, I also want to wish the honourable Members of this 
<br/>Parliament and your good self, Sir, for Christmas and a Prosperous 2025. And to all families of Fiji 
<br/>who are listening in, I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous 2025.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. M.S.N. KAMIKAMICA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I begin, I also would like to join 
<br/>with honourable Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure in wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy 
<br/>New  Year,  and  given  it  is  the  second  anniversary,  almost  second  anniversary  of  this  side  of 
<br/>Parliament.  I  Wish  to  thank  the  other  side  of  Parliament,  particularly  the  G9  Bloc  for  being 
<br/>collaborative and supportive. We have had some arm wrestles now and again, Mr. Speaker, Sir, but 
<br/>it is all in the spirit of trying to serve our nation. So, we thank everyone, including the honourable 
<br/>Leader of the Opposition of course and the G9 Bloc as well. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  I  thought  I  just  reply  to  honourable  Ratu  Vakalalabure’s  wonderful 
<br/>statement. Just picture this in a group of co-operatives all along the coast of Bua and Macuata, they 
<br/>have a co-operative truck that picks up all their fish starting from Macuata, coming down to Dreketi 
<br/>and all the way to Nabouwalu, on the ferry, back to Suva and then supply in Suva for export.  If we 
<br/>are able to achieve that, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is the essence of co-operatives.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Basically, Mr. Speaker, Sir, this side of Parliament will do its utmost to push co-operatives 
<br/>as a means to really develop the rural economy. We do not need to look far to see how successful co-
<br/>operatives are. There is Zespri, the main exporter for kiwifruit out of New Zealand. You have Amul 
<br/>in the State of Gujarat and is the largest dairy company in India and is one of the biggest exporters 
<br/></span><span>fact, 
<br/>from India to the rest of the world in terms of dairy, and they are a genuine co-operative.   In 
<br/></span><span>Sir,  being  a  former  Director  of  Rewa  Dairy,  the  Amul  Co-operative  is  a  one  man,  one  boat  co-
<br/>operative.  No  matter  if  you  are  a  large  supplier  or  a  small  supplier,  everyone  is  the  same.  It  is  a 
<br/>wonderful testament in how co-operatives can work.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr.  Speaker,  Sir,  in  a  nutshell  what  this  side  of  Parliament,  through  the  leadership  of  the 
<br/>honourable Prime Minister, what we are trying to do is rebuild the co-operative movement in Fiji, 
<br/>ensure  that  we  use  it  as  a  vehicle  to  drive  rural  development  and  urban  development  in  terms  of 
<br/>economy. At the same time, ensure that our hardworking farmers and fishermen do not get left behind 
<br/></span><span>or taken an advantage of by middlemen in the process.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will see next year is the international year for co-operatives, the whole 
<br/>year. So, we will be conducting awareness  events  over the year, starting  from  January to  try and 
<br/>really  encourage  the  co-operative  movement  and  try  and  make  sure  that  it  is  a  fundamental 
<br/>instruments in terms of what we are trying to achieve on this side of Parliament.  I thank you, Mr. 
<br/>Speaker, Sir.

<div><span>Tackling Drug Problems in Fiji  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. V. NAUPOTO.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, the menace of drugs is an issue that is now very 
<br/>much  in  the  forefront  of  our  thinking  as  a  nation,  as  a  Government,  as  Members  of  Parliament, 
<br/>teachers, health workers, lawyers, magistrates and judges and simply as parents, grandparents and 
<br/>guardians.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>A few week ago, I had a little chat with Tu Vili in my car, and at the end of our little chat, we 
<br/>came to a gentleman’s agreement - no drugs. As we parted, I asked myself this question, “how can I 
<br/>help Tu Vili stay away from drugs?”  I came to this conclusion, Mr. Speaker, that two conditions, if 
<br/>satisfied, will keep Tu Vili away from drugs. First is that Tu Vili simply has the moral courage and 
<br/>integrity to resist the temptation to take or to peddle drugs.  The second condition is that there is just 
<br/>no opportunity for Tu Vili to take or peddle drugs.  Those two factors that I had just mentioned - 
<br/>temptation and opportunity, make up the formular for fraud.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>It  is  temptation, plus  opportunity, that equals  fraud. When someone is  tempted to  commit 
<br/>fraud, they will only do so if an opportunity presents itself and conversely when an opportunity to 
<br/>commit fraud presents itself and the person who sees that opportunity, resists the temptation, nothing 
<br/>bad  happens.  Temptation  is  personal  but  opportunity  presents  itself  through  the  systems  and 
<br/>processes that are in place.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, I have very little to no chance to help build Tu Vili’s character so he can resist 
<br/>temptation; and he has very little to no help at all in this regard.  Tu Vili is a child, 15 years old, and 
<br/>lives on the street here in Suva. He lives bravely, I must add, because he has very little other options. 
<br/>He told me his story – raised by his grandmother, never attended school in his whole life. I asked 
<br/>him in </span><span>iTaukei</span><span> where he comes from? </span><span>“O gone ni vei</span><span>?” He very softly said, “</span><span>o</span><span> </span><span>au sega ni</span><span> kila (I do 
<br/>not know).” 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Tu Vili was seated on a street in Suva asking for money and food at a spot where 
<br/>the cars were driving and turning very dangerously close to where he was sitting. I invited him into 
<br/>my car which he accepted so he can join me and my wife and drive-through and get some food for 
<br/>the three of us. We had our little </span><span>talanoa</span><span> session on our way to get food and on our way back to drop 
<br/>him off where I picked him up.  Tu Vili is a child in need of care and protection, as defined under 
<br/>Clause 5 of the Child Care and Protection Act that was just passed last night.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, the funny thing as we parted with Tu Vili that evening, we said our goodbyes, I 
<br/></span><span>leaned over and gave him a long Fijian </span><span>uma</span><span>, the one </span><span>pu</span><span> and </span><span>tua</span><span> do on his forehead like I do to my 
<br/></span><span>grandchildren.  I notice he froze and stood there for a few seconds before he said, “</span><span>moce” </span><span>and then 
<br/>he left.  As we were driving home, I told my wife, “</span><span>Isa,</span><span> maybe Tu Vili has never been kissed on the 
<br/>forehead by a grandfather.”     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I dropped him off, I gave him my MP business card and told him to get 
<br/>someone to ring my number if he needs to speak to me.  But I was bothered with this niggling question 
<br/>in my mind, how can an MP like me help Tu Vili stay away from drugs?  How can this august House, 
<br/>how  can  the  Legislature  help,  in  support  of  Government,  of  course,  as  they  take  the  lead  in  this 
<br/></span><span>national effort to help protect Tu Vili and our children from the menace of drugs? 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Coincidentally, last night in this august House, the Legislature, as we passed those two Bills 
<br/>and now into law - the Child Justice Act and Child Care and Protection Act, I told myself, “Yes, we 
<br/>can”.  We did help Tu Vili and our children last night.  Thank you again to the honourable Minister 
<br/>for Women, Children and Social Protection and the Government and to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.  Last 
<br/>night before adjournment, you reminded us of the significance of the work that we had accomplished.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>End of Week Statements 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>2619 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span> Let me put another perspective of what happened last night.  Last night there were four Bills 
<br/>passed, brought into this House by three women.  That is history also.  I think all the men on that side 
<br/>owe something to the three women sitting behind them for those four Acts.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I apologise for digressing, but I am of the view that we can help by targeting 
<br/>the opportunity side of that equation that I mentioned, and we try and remove as much as we can, the 
<br/>opportunities that are being to bring drugs into this country, and also manufacture illicit drugs within 
<br/>our country. Opportunities are presenting itself in the systems and processes that govern our borders, 
<br/>our ports of entry - both air and seaports, the systems and processes that govern the importation and 
<br/>sale of pharmaceutical drugs and chemicals that are used to manufacture illicit drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Overall, I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, we should try as much as we can to reduce the volume of 
<br/>drugs that is in the country, and at the same time, try and stamp the inflow of drugs into the country.  
<br/>We tackle the supply end of the supply and demand chain, because a lot of effort is now being directed 
<br/>towards the demand side.  We heard the very inspirational story from the honourable Minister for 
<br/>Justice last night of that family that his showering love to those children and young adults in Nabua, 
<br/>most if not all of them, caught in this web of drug abuse.  One of them robbed me, admittedly a few 
<br/>years ago.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, we can do this via a parliamentary inquiry, an inquiry into the drug problem 
<br/>in Fiji.  I think we can be surgical in our inquiry through a very specific and focused terms of reference 
<br/>and find those gaps and loopholes in the systems and processes in the areas, some of which I had 
<br/>mentioned and also look at the laws that needs to be amended to effect the required changes.  The 
<br/>findings will be presented to you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and to the Government and we can progress from 
<br/>there.  I think, Mr. Speaker, Sir, that section 129 of the Standing Orders is the enabling clause, I stand 
<br/>to be corrected, there has never been a precedent of an inquiry in this Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The  other  aspect  of  tackling  this  drug  problem  is  deterrent.    I  will  just  say  that  study  has 
<br/>shown that it is not the severity of punishment that deters criminal behaviour, rather it is the certainty 
<br/>of  punishment  and  the  swiftness  of  justice  that  deters.  This  aspect  can  also  be  looked  at  by  this 
<br/>Parliament inquiry. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, Tu Vili Beranavere (that is his full name) and our children need help. Yes, 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I firmly believe that we in this august House, we can, Legislature can help.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Thank you, honourable Viliame Naupoto, especially  that  emotional and 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>heart rendering story.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. S.L. RABUKA.- Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I first  of all, thank the honourable Viliame 
<br/>Naupoto for his End of Week Statement, bringing out to us a real and very serious problem that we 
<br/>are all facing as a nation.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Mr. Speaker, Sir, I remember when I was in the Opposition, the honourable Tikoduadua had 
<br/>raised the issue of establishing a commission or investigation committee of Parliament to look into 
<br/></span><span>the issues and the problems of drugs in the country.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>I welcome the suggestion that honourable Naupoto has just raised about establishing this drug 
<br/>investigation commission or whatever we will call it, to look into the real issue of drugs. Mr. Speaker, 
<br/>Sir, I am reminded of our responsibilities as leaders; we are national leaders.

<div><span>6</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We study the very simple words of Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, who was looking at 
<br/>Moses trying to organise the Israelites on their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land and was 
<br/>having an all day and almost all night sessions trying to run court cases and investigations about who 
<br/>had done what.  Jethro said, “Moses, you are not doing that right. You have to organise them into 
<br/>smaller groups - groups of 50, groups of 100, groups of 500 and groups of 1,000 and select men 
<br/>(probably the language now would be “people” or “persons”) who can do that effectively, but select 
<br/>people who are trustworthy, hardworking, fear God and cannot be bribed.” Those were the words 
<br/>from Jethro in the book of Exodus.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>This is the basically the problem we have in Fiji, Mr. Speaker, Sir. So many of these things 
<br/>happen because people should  be watching, people should be advising, people should be looking 
<br/>after those little groups, even family groups, schools and bigger communities in society - people who 
<br/>can be entrusted with being vigilant in what they do. They have to watch the people and understand 
<br/>the trends of society.  As soon as they find out that someone is straying from the boundaries, they 
<br/>would automatically try and find out - where have you been, where are you going, your friends are 
<br/>here, why have you been out, it is late in the night.    
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>If the people are vigilant enough and diligent enough, they should be able to nip the problem 
<br/>in the bud as soon as it starts. I do not know what they look like on the streets.  The problem with 
<br/>high office is that you get driven here, there and driven home.   So, you are not on the streets to see 
<br/>what is happening, what the people are doing.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>You are very fortunate that you found someone that you could extend a helping towards and 
<br/>help him out.  That little </span><span>uma</span><span> on his forehead took him time to understand – what was that?  Never 
<br/>had any demonstration of love before.  So, he must have been thinking, what was that?  You said that 
<br/>he was brought up by his grandmother – we must thank grandmothers, widows and mothers who 
<br/>bring up children without the support of a male partner.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>These are the things that can come up if we establish a special parliamentary committee to 
<br/>look into the problems of drugs and using them.  I do not believe that those high up in society in the 
<br/>communities are not involved.  When we find a young man with a mobile phone perhaps, and we 
<br/>know that that young man has not been employed, we should be able to go and find out, probably 
<br/>without even asking him, how would he have gotten that mobile phone or other luxury items that 
<br/>people have on the streets now.  So, immediately we should have indicators of unexplained wealth 
<br/>or unexplained benefits that people get.     
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  are  always  hamstrung  by  the  limitations  on  law  enforcements  in  regards  to  freedom.  
<br/></span><span>People are free, the tell you, “I got it”.  You ask, “where did you get it?”  The response, “I just got it, 
<br/>I sold something.” Again, you ask, “what did you sell, where did you get what you sold?”  Those are 
<br/>the things that perhaps we should be aware of happening right around us.  It is a good End of Week 
<br/>Statement, Mr. Speaker, Sir, and I can only promise that we will co-operate to find ways and means 
<br/>of controlling the issue of drugs.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>When  I  was  talking  to  the  Prime  Ministers  from  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  even  those 
<br/>Ministers who were here, I am looking at cooperation, border security co-operation.  Right now, we 
<br/></span><span>are introducing drones and drone operators’ courses to be run here in Fiji, they will be incorporated 
<br/></span><span>into  our  border  security  operations.    We  know  or  we  have  been  suspecting  the  way  the  illicit 
<br/>substances have been introduced into Fiji.

<br/></span></div>
<div><span>We  have  a  very  porous  border.    So  many  people  can  just  come  in  and  go  out  without  our  even 
<br/>knowing, but once they get into Fiji’s territory, there is very little checks at the outer island airports 
<br/>and ports.  Yesterday, the news media asked me, “when did you start putting the canine section’s 
<br/>up?” I said, “I don’t know, it must have been initiated by honourable Tikoduadua.”  But if they are 
<br/>out there, that is good then they can control from the point that they have entered, to another point 
<br/>inside the border.  How do we find out what is out there coming in?  The big catch in Europe destined 
<br/>for Fiji, those are the things that should wake us up.  There is a bigger movement out there and we 
<br/>have to look after our people, particularly our young people.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Honourable  Tikoduadua  said  that  we  could  become  a  nation  of  zombies,  people  walking 
<br/>around not knowing where they are going, not knowing what they are doing, not even knowing their 
<br/>names.  That young man who did not know where he was from, you cannot blame  him.  He was 
<br/>brought up by his grandmother, probably she did not tell him, “</span><span>O iko na gone mai ka.”  </span><span>I asked my 
<br/>caddy one day, “</span><span>iko gone ni vei?”</span><span> He responded, “gone </span><span>ni Nabua.” </span><span>I further asked, “</span><span>O cei nomu 
<br/>yasana?”  </span><span>He responded, “</span><span>Yasana yani I na keba.”  Sega cala qori.  </span><span>But that is our responsibility, 
<br/>Mr. Speaker, Sir.  The Government will take up this suggestion and we will introduce this body to 
<br/>be run as part of a Committee of Parliament to look into the problem of drugs.
