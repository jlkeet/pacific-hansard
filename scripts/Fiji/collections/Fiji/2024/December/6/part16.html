<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. LEADER OF THE GOVERNMENT IN PARLIAMENT.- Mr. Speaker, I move:  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>That Parliament adjourns until Monday, 24</span><span>th </span><span>February, 2025 at 10.00 a.m.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>HON. A.V.B.C. BAINIVALU.- Mr. Speaker, I second the motion.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Question put.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Motion agreed to.  
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>MR. SPEAKER.- Honourable Members, that concludes the end of our sitting for this week 
<br/>and this session.  I am sure, I speak on behalf of my predecessor His Excellency the President, </span><span>Turaga 
<br/>Na  Tui  Cakau</span><span>  and  myself  in  expressing  our  gratitude  to  each  and  every  one  of  you  for  your 
<br/>contributions throughout this year to the second session of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>For the information of all honourable Members, Monday, 16</span><span>th</span><span> December, 2024 would mark 
<br/></span><span>the Prorogation of Parliament. This is not a Sitting day and by tradition Prorogation marks the official 
<br/></span><span>conclusion of Parliamentary Session of the year without or within the four years Parliamentary term. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Speaker will notify His Excellency the President of the Prorogation as well as the State 
<br/>Opening of the Parliament.  As all honourable Members are aware, His Excellency the President will 
<br/>address the Parliament at the Opening of Parliament.   
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>So, once the Parliament is prorogued, Parliamentary business including Parliamentary sittings 
<br/>and Parliamentary Standing Committee proceedings on Bills, Motions and Reports are suspended or 
<br/></span><span>ceased until the Opening of the new Parliamentary Session, with the exception of matters that would 
<br/></span><span>be deemed urgent and necessary at the discretion of the Speaker. 
<br/></span></div>
<div><span>Since this will be our last Sitting for this Session of Parliament, I would like to wish all the 
<br/>honourable Members,  all those seated in  the gallery and those watching the live proceedings and 
<br/>everyone in Fiji a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous 2025.  For myself, it has been my particular 
<br/>honour and privilege to serve you honourable Members and the people of Fiji this week.
